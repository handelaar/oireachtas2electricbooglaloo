      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the growing concern among construction companies and industry bodies about the problem of &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; chips in computer systems essential to modern buildings and the possible damage to microprocessors in building systems if computers crash on 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to fund the sperm freezing bank for cancer patients at the Rotunda Hospital.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Contributions of Senators on item 1, motion on Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1998, are not to exceed ten minutes. The Committee and Remaining Stages of item 2 will be taken at 3 p.m. Second Stage of item 3 will then be taken, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes. Senators may share time.  If not previously concluded, proceedings will resume after item 4.  Item 4, statements on Northern Ireland, will be taken at 6 p.m., with each statement not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business. I wish to raise the issue of lorry driving tests. It has been brought to my attention that there is a backlog for car and lorry driver testing.  This is <Col N="426" /> causing severe hardship in the lorry industry where jobs are very scarce and lorry drivers are being brought in from England.  Will the Leader call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to sort out this backlog as a priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify the position in regard to legislation over the next number of months?  I recognise this is our last sitting week because of the planned renovations.  How is it intended to deal with outstanding legislation in September?  This is crucial.  Would the Leader consider dealing with Committee Stage of some of these Bills in committees during the summer? Is it necessary to take all this legislation this week?  I raise this because there are three major Bills and an important debate ordered for today. All Members agree that this is necessary, but given the pressure of time we should be able to come back to some of these Bills later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on the business ordered for today and for the rest of the week.  The Leader has done some excellent juggling in organising the items, but there are 16 Bills being dealt with this week both here and in the Dáil, and all Stages of 12 of those Bills are due to be taken.  The Leader has juggled the timeframe and the effect has been to cram a large amount of legislation into a short space of time, which is not how we should conduct our business.  Will he clarify whether it is possible to take some Stages of these Bills later?</P>
      <P>Item 20, motion 18, on the Order Paper reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its grave concern at the failure of the Irish Government to secure a senior management or executive Board position on the new European Central Bank.</P>
      <P>That bank is now being launched, and it seems that the only Irish input will be the performance of Riverdance at its opening.  I would like to know if the Government has succeeded in getting senior representation in the bank because I have asked the Leader about this matter in the past. According to newspaper reports, the Governor of the bank has announced that interest rates will drop in line with those of the bigger states, such as Germany and France, and the smaller states will not be taken into consideration.  There seems to have been a failure to get senior Irish representation in this bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call last week for no reduction to be made in the number of teachers employed in rural schools in the west.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science not to implement these cuts, as they would have a detrimental effect on education in the west and on the fabric of society given the peripherality of the western seaboard and its disadvantaged nature?  I ask the Leader to <Col N="427" /> impress upon the Minister not to impose these cuts particularly in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Leader on the amount of business he has ordered for today and this week.  I have been seeking a debate with the Minister for Public Enterprise on transportation policy in Ireland for some time.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement but I am disappointed that no money was made available for the Tralee to Killarney route, which is the most dangerous route in the country.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on whether more money will be made available for upgrading that line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to a previous debate in the House on the Insurance Ombudsman.  Will the Leader request the Minister to explain how it was that, in breach of a clear and binding agreement with the current ombudsman, that no announcement will be made about the successor to this post until the end of August, a public relations firm, apparently acting on the instructions of the Department, was simultaneously faxing an announcement about the post at the time the debate was taking place in the Seanad?  I ask the Leader to request the Minister to come to the House and explain this very curious behaviour which seems to undermine the Office of Ombudsman and the Seanad and violate a serious agreement.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Kiely's concern and join him in calling for a debate with the Minister. While welcoming the announcement of funding for the Killarney to Mallow line, I ask the Leader to ascertain if the line from Killarney to Tralee is being discriminated against.  This line contains some of the most dangerous sections and there have been a number of accidents on it.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Norris's concern regarding the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman.  I am concerned for the independence of the office and ask for a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the Turf Development Bill.  I know the House is under pressure of time and that it is always unsatisfactory to rush legislation through at the end of session.  However, the Bill runs to 25 pages and 50 sections and it seems very wrong to restrict speakers to ten or eight minutes.  The provision of time on Second Stage should be far more flexible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke raised concerns about current delays in truck or lorry driving tests and I will pass his request to the Minister.  Senator O'Toole queried the status of legislation in the context of the works which will take place next door to the Chamber.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is endeavouring to address the issue and will discuss it tomorrow afternoon. I am sure the Senator may attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello made various comments about the amount of legislation coming through the House.  It helps if parties are represented on Second Stage and I hope there will be a full attendance by all parties on Second Stage debates throughout the week.  The Senator also referred to motion No. 18: I will examine the matter and discuss it with him after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh raised concerns about the proposed cuts in education.  The House is aware that the Minister for Education and Science will take the Education Bill to the Dáil on Friday and the Senator's concerns can be expressed when the Bill comes to this House.  It is proposed that the Bill will be the next legislation to come to the House after what is proposed for the current week.  I share the joy and congratulate the Minister for his stance on two teacher schools, something which affects many rural parishes throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Senators Dan Kiely and Coghlan represent the kingdom of Kerry.  I share their concerns regarding the rail line from Tralee to Killarney and will pass their comments on to the Minister, my constituency colleague.  Senators Coghlan and Norris called for statements on the Insurance Ombudsman. Members are aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, announced the new Ombudsman in the House.  We have heard Deputy Treacy on the radio over the past two or three days.  He is very able and experienced and is one of the Ministers of State who has most impressed me.  I will pass on Senator Norris's further concerns to him this afternoon.  Senator Joe Doyle asked for time to be made available to discuss item 5 tomorrow and I confirm time will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Bovine Disease (Levies) Regulations, 1998</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Seanad on 24th day of June, 1998. <Col N="429" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1998, were laid in draft before the Seanad on Wednesday, 24 June 1998.  The proposed regulations will be made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Acts, 1979 to 1996, and their purpose is to reduce the contribution by the farming community towards the cost of TB and brucellosis eradication programmes by £2 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Diseases levies were introduced under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, to provide for the farming community to make a financial contribution towards the cost of TB and brucellosis programmes.  Under this Act a levy was imposed on all cattle slaughtered in the State, on live export from the State and on each gallon of milk delivered for processing.</P>
      <P>The rates of levy were last adjusted on 1 April 1996 when they were reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal slaughtered or exported live and from 1.3p to 0.5p per gallon of milk delivered.  That reduction resulted in a saving to farmers of £18 million in a 12 month period and was made in recognition of the additional cost to farmers who from that time were to pay private veterinary practitioners directly for the first TB and brucellosis test on their herd each year.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, access to EU and third country markets is underpinned by our relatively high animal health status, freedom from major diseases and by our application of animal health rules provided for in EU legislation.  These factors will continue to be decisive in maintaining our access to markets as the animal health status is raised throughout the Union and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In the foregoing context, Ireland operates a number of measures aimed at preventing the introduction of animal diseases and at controlling, reducing and eradicating disease.  The most important national animal disease programmes in terms of human, animal and financial considerations are the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.  For trading purposes and to comply with EU legislative requirements, it continues to be necessary to operate annual programmes for both diseases, which are costly to farmers and the Exchequer, while progress towards reduction and the eventual eradication of the residual levels remain difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to eradicate these two extremely serious diseases &mdash; TB and brucellosis &mdash; and any other diseases affecting the animal herd, first, in the interests of consumers, the human food chain into which animal products get, and, second, for trading purposes.  We export 80 per cent to 90 per cent of what we produce in dairying, beef, cattle and livestock generally.  No other European country has the same dependence on exports.  Access to markets is, therefore, vital.  Given the discerning consumers we have nowadays, they rightly demand the highest level of animal disease free status for, and control programmes in place in the country of origin.  We are fortunate to have <Col N="430" /> an exceptionally high animal health status which we want to maintain.</P>
    <P>Since 1954, the total expenditure on the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes has been exceptionally high, exceeding £1 billion.  Since the disease levies were introduced in 1979 farmers have contributed over £300 million up to the end of 1997, while £28.7 million has been received from the EU veterinary fund.  While these are large sums of money, they should be seen against the value of our cattle, beef and dairy export trade.  Our total food and beverage export trade was worth in excess of £5 billion last year.  Cattle and beef exports contributed approximately £1.5 billion while dairy exports were of a similar value.</P>
    <P>In 1997, farmers contributed £10.6 million by way of levy to the operational costs of the bovine TB and brucellosis programmes.  The Exchequer carried the balance of the operational costs, £28.2 million, as well as the costs of salaries of administrative, veterinary, technical, laboratory and clerical staff, valued at approximately £22 million.  The entire programme was funded by the Exchequer to an amount in excess of £50 million last year. Farmers contributed approximately £26 million. The total cost of the programme last year between farmers and the Exchequer amounted to £76 million.  It is a costly scheme which needs to be brought under control.  There is a need to reduce the incidence, eliminate it and reduce the very steep costs to farmers and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The proposed draft regulation to reduce bovine disease levies from 1 July 1998 to £2 per animal exported live or slaughtered and to 0.4p per gallon of milk delivered for processing should generate an aggregate amount of £2 million savings to farmers in a 12 month period.  The proposed reductions are made against the background of the restructuring of the operational aspects of the brucellosis eradication scheme which I have put in place in recent months.</P>
    <P>The incidence of TB has remained relatively unchanged over recent years.  However, while the incidence of brucellosis in cattle had remained fairly stable over the years 1988 to 1995, the position deteriorated drastically in 1996 and it continued to deteriorate in 1997.  Towards the end of last year Ireland's OBF &mdash; official brucellosis free &mdash; status became endangered.  Under the new regulations, if the incidence exceeds 0.2 per cent of herds a compulsory pre-movement test must be introduced.  Access to markets worldwide became endangered and this gave rise to a crisis.</P>
    <P>To address this deterioration and after protracted discussion with the National Animal Health Forum, I introduced a range of additional initiatives early this year.  The key elements include from 23 February 1998 all eligible animals being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; in addition, all bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale, on foot of a brucellosis test and such cattle <Col N="431" /> must be moved from the holding where tests were undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding; a full round of blood testing of all eligible animals is being carried out in 1998 to augment and complement existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing; a full round of blood testing of all eligible animals in the worst affected areas has been completed in the two month period March-April 1998; a range of operational/administrative measures were introduced aimed at improving the operation and delivery of the eradication measures, including an awareness campaign, increased epidemiology, early removal of reactors, improved monitoring and other operational measures and a revamped compensation régime came into effect from 27 April 1998.</P>
    <P>These measures were additional to those introduced during 1997.  All parties represented at the National Animal Health Forum unanimously accepted these additional measures and initiatives were essential to address the deteriorating brucellosis situation and protect our trading status in relation to both livestock and livestock products. While the &ldquo;one sale&rdquo; aspect is over and above the strict requirements of the EU régime, it is accepted as being essential if the brucellosis problem is to be turned around quickly.  In the negotiations, the farming bodies pressed strongly that the Department of Agriculture and Food should bear the costs of the additional testing which is estimated at approximately £4 million per annum.</P>
    <P>In the context of securing the full backing of the farming bodies for the new initiatives under the brucellosis eradication scheme and partially relieving farmers of the additional testing costs, it was agreed towards the end of April 1998 that the bovine diseases levies should be reduced by amounts yielding approximately £2 million in a 12 month period which equates with 50 per cent of the additional testing costs on farmers.  Necessary Government approval for this was secured on 9 June 1998, subject to obtaining necessary approval today from both Houses of the Oireachtas of the motion before each House.  The reductions proposed will be effective from tomorrow, 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the new requirements, particularly those relating to testing and the &ldquo;one-sale&rdquo; régime, impose additional constraints on farmers and others.  At the same time, the farming and veterinary bodies and the representatives from my own Department and the Department of Finance involved in the negotiations over an extended period in the latter part of 1997 and earlier this year, accept the veterinary advice that the new measures and initiatives already outlined would be essential, together with the full use of current technology and good herd management practices to redress the brucellosis problem in cattle, safeguard animal and public health and protect our trading position for livestock and livestock products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> The additional testing régime resulted in a huge increase in the volume of blood samples received for testing in both the Cork brucellosis laboratory and the regional veterinary laboratory in Sligo.  For example, in 1998, 2.66 million blood samples were received in the Cork laboratory up to the end of last week compared with 1.6 million samples for the corresponding period in 1997, in other words, one million additional samples were received.  Due to the increase in throughput in the Cork laboratory and some delays in recruiting staff, there were delays earlier this year in processing results.  However, the position now is that, following initiatives taken by me, there are no arrears in the laboratory and the backlog was cleared over the June bank holiday weekend.  I want to express my appreciation to the staff of the Cork and Sligo laboratories who worked late into the evenings and over weekends to clear the backlog.</P>
    <P>The difficulties caused to farmers in this regard have been rectified and the processing of blood samples now commences on the dates they are received in the laboratory.  The improved situation should be further underpinned by a number of other measures already in place or being introduced including, in particular, an inquiry desk staffed by courteous staff, further e-mail facilities which will serve to communicate results to the district veterinary offices and practices quickly and the use of An Post's swift post system for delivery of test samples to the Cork laboratory. The latter system includes a guaranteed delivery time scale as well as a tracking and tracing capability.</P>
    <P>I am confident the systems in place and the initiatives and measures I have taken enable the Cork laboratory to provide a satisfactory turnaround for the volume of blood that will now be received.  Some further steps are being taken to speed up deliveries and to identify where delays are occurring, if they occur.  I am continuing to keep the situation under very close review.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that with a 30 day test, one cannot use up the bulk of that time in getting samples to the laboratory and back to farmers.  A notification period in excess of nine days is unacceptable.  The shorter the turn around period the better.  With An Post ensuring delivery of samples from veterinary practices, and the practices ensuring the samples are clearly labelled and in order, there is no undue delay.  Modern technology such as e-mail is used to notify farmers of the results.</P>
    <P>The new régime has been in place since the end of February and I am satisfied with the level of co-operation as regards blood sampling.  We have identified a higher number of new reactor herds to date in 1998 by comparison with 1997. However, this has to be seen in the context of the additional testing undertaken and the locations in which a high percentage of blood samples have been taken, given that the programme has focused on areas with the highest levels of disease. At the same time the figures do give cause <Col N="433" /> for concern and underpin this need for strict observance of and compliance with these new measures by all concerned.  I believe that if we persist with this programme it will achieve the desired results &mdash; the elimination of this dreadful disease which wipes out entire herds and the income of the farmers affected.  The drastic action which we are taking may impose some hardship but it is better to establish a comprehensive programme over a short period of time in the interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I recommend that these regulations be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I am glad there is some good news for the farming community.</P>
      <P>We believe that these levies should be abolished entirely because a reduction of 0.1p per gallon in the context of the overall agriculture budget is minuscule.  Every reduction, however, is welcome.  The Minister is going in the right direction and this time next year I hope he will come before the House with a motion to abolish the levies.  Farmers are paying for their tests and they deserve the abolition of the levies.</P>
      <P>In the livestock sector the intervention of the Department of Agriculture and Food commences at the birth of an animal &mdash; it intervenes to tag and register the animal and the disease eradication regime starts immediately.  The Department identifies when a vet must visit the farm to carry out a TB or brucellosis test and under certain circumstances it must be contacted before an animal is sold during premia retention periods.  If tags go missing the Department must be contacted. Farmers understand the need for these arrangements but it should be pointed out that the constant intervention by the Department of Agriculture and Food is probably far in excess of the intervention in other areas such as social welfare.  We know that 350,000 people are dependent on agriculture and there is a feeling that the Department is very intrusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the CAP reforms in 1992, the premia regime has become an extremely important sector of Irish farming.  Bureaucracy has increased significantly.  Farmers must fill out premia application forms for the Department and the regulations are detailed and complex.  Completing these forms is a daunting task for many farmers and in some cases causes extreme stress.  The Department sets out a deadline for the receipt of these forms.  It recently declared the 15th as the deadline for the receipt of the suckler cow forms. The Department then found itself inundated with queries and was unable to deal with many of the applications.  We all know of the consequences if an application form is not completed correctly. Adequate staff and resources were not available for the Department to deal with the onslaught of applications and queries.  Teagasc provides assistance but many farmers on an average income of £4,000 per annum do not believe they should have to pay Teagasc to assist them to obtain <Col N="434" /> moneys to which they are entitled.  This area needs attention.</P>
    <P>The processing of a premia payment involves the application and processing period, the farm inspection, payment, refusal and subsequent appeal, all of which take time and money.  From the outset the applicant is faced with very complex application forms.  The internal processing then commences in the Department.  This year there have been considerable delays in premia payments caused by organisational difficulties in the Department.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the area aid unit in the Department have long been recognised and are continuing.  In January 1998 the Department's charter review group accepted that a serious problem existed in this unit, yet it took until April before a new regime was established in the unit to rectify the situation.  The result is that many farmers have experienced long delays in receiving premia balances.  This has added to cashflow problems and the Department should address this situation immediately.  The delays are unacceptable.  Many farmers are facing extreme financial difficulties and paying for huge bank overdrafts while waiting for premia payments.</P>
    <P>The farm inspection is a cause of further difficulties. No premia payments are made until the reports of the inspections are received by the premia units in Portlaoise and Castlebar.  I live near Castlebar and know of the problems being experienced in the area.  Nevertheless, the staff in Castlebar are excellent and do their best to deal with queries and problems as they arise. However, the resources are limited and the staff are overworked resulting in considerable delays. Premia payments for 1997 are delayed due to the non-receipt of reports of inspections which took place in 1997.  It is obvious that farmers who were the subject of random inspections are going to have to wait longer for premia payments.</P>
    <P>There are a considerable number of issues which the Department should examine in order to help farmers.  These include the elimination of much of the bureaucracy within the Department and in communications between the Department and the industry.  The Department insists on two tags at the slaughtering of animals but this is not a regulatory requirement.  EU regulations require that tags be applied to animals within 30 days. The current Department tag distribution does not even meet this deadline.  A serious problem occurs in that animals are turned back at meat plants because the Department refuses to allow them be slaughtered when presented with only one tag.  Many farming organisations in the country demand that animals with one tag be allowed to be slaughtered.  That is something the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>Cattle testing prior to slaughter causes severe hardship for animals and creates significant additional costs for farmers.  The Department is interpreting the EU regulations in this area very severely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Another issue which could be examined and which would help the farming industry greatly is the establishment of a system whereby farmers would specify their veterinary treatment requirements for a certain period and vets would then give them a blanket prescription to cover those. This would apply at times such as the lambing season.  It would mean farmers having full antibiotic treatment available to cover the needs of ewes requiring medication.</P>
    <P>Overhaul of the area aid section could prevent further premia and headage delays.  There should be a reduction in the severity of penalties applying to cases where mistakes are made, such as where farmers fill out forms only to discover they have made an error.  The penalties for those type of mistakes are very severe and should be examined to ensure they are in proportion to what is involved.</P>
    <P>Compulsory 30 day blood tests were introduced in 1998 and greatly restrict a farmer's opportunity to sell cattle.  The ability to sell has been further restricted by significant delays in the return of blood test results.  In many cases farmers have had less than a week to sell cattle.  The Department gave a commitment of seven days' return period but this is not happening and is causing further hardship.  The Department recently stated the backlog has been cleared. Nonetheless, farmers are still experiencing delays. All these delays and restrictions are costing money.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that almost £1 billion has been spent since 1954 on the eradication of bovine TB and yet, as we approach the millennium, we are still discussing bovine TB.  Nevertheless, counties such as Mayo and others are almost free from brucellosis and this levy is a hardship on farmers who are relatively or almost free from brucellosis and other bovine diseases.  Perhaps the Minister might examine that slight anomaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome any draft regulations he introduces which mean farmers paying less for the eradication of bovine diseases.  In 1996, when the levies were reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal and from 1.3p to 0.5p per gallon of milk, it was stressed that farmers would save money, but I contended that they would pay more because they would have to pay their vets for the first round of bovine TB and brucellosis testing.  My own experience tells me that it is expensive.  The regulations brought in at that time did not save farmers money.  Farmers also had to pay the levy of 0.5p per gallon and £2.50 per animal.  I am delighted that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has reduced those levies and eased the burden on farmers.  I hope in time that farmers who have to pay for a round of testing each year will not be required to pay levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always said that I would not object to paying levies if bovine TB were kept outside my farm gate.  In 1994 I had a brucellosis outbreak in <Col N="436" /> my own herd which had to be depopulated.  I know how painful depopulation is and no amount of money compensates for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the most important animal disease programmes in terms of human, animal and financial considerations are the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.  For trading purposes and to comply with EU legislative requirements it continues to be necessary to operate annual programmes for both diseases which are costly to both farmers and the Exchequer.  It is essential that our cattle are disease free.  In 1997 farmers contributed £10.6 million by way of levy to the operational cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis programmes.  Of course, they also had to pay for their own testing. The Exchequer carried the balance of the operational costs.</P>
    <P>It is important that reactor cattle are removed as soon as possible.  Officials of the Department do their best to help farmers who have disease in their herds but they are often not strict enough in having diseased cattle removed.  Officials may think they are being helpful to a farmer by allowing him to delay in having diseased cattle removed.  They do not help agriculture in general by allowing farmers time to get a heifer in calf so as to get the bigger compensation which is paid for in-calf cattle.  That is wrong.  When disease occurs the herd should be depopulated as soon as possible.  Delay can cause the disease to spread and is not fair to neighbouring farmers.  I know some awkward farmers who defy instructions from the Department to remove diseased cattle. They hold on to these cattle for far too long because they think they are not being paid sufficient compensation and for other reasons best known to themselves.  Such farmers should not be permitted to endanger the disease free status of their neighbours' animals.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister announced new arrangements and revised compensation terms in respect of brucellosis breakdowns.  These arrangements were intended to augment and complement the measures he had announced on 11 August 1997 to tackle the deteriorating brucellosis situation. Details of the measures to be taken by farmers to contain and reduce disease levels had been sent to all farmers.  Details of the revamped compensation measures were also sent to farmers.  There will be significant widening of the differentials between the various categories of compensation.</P>
    <P>The compensation arrangements are directed at encouraging farmers to take appropriate measures to protect their herds against disease. The appropriate measures include either the maintenance of closed herds or alternatively the purchase of cattle from well defined reliable sources which have been pre-movement tested on the farm from which they are bought within 60 days of purchase and which are also blood tested on the buyer's farm within 30 days of purchase.</P>
    <P>Testing within 30 days of purchase is essential. However, some farmers tend not to read the correspondence they receive from the Department <Col N="437" /> while others tend to make mistakes when filling forms.  Many of them were not used to the amount of form filling now involved in farming. One of my farming neighbours bought a bull last year before the implementation of the post-purchase testing regulation last September and has discovered that since the animal was not post-tested, he will lose out in terms of compensation. That farmer has a good record of disease free herds and action should be taken in his case.</P>
    <P>I also wish to comment on the prices factories pay for reactor cattle.  They can pay what they wish.  When the slaughtering premium was introduced in January 1998 the meat factories reduced the price of steers to 80p per pound for the first fortnight in January.  Subsequently, the price was increased.  That type of action is wrong.  The same policy applies when reactor cattle are sent to factories. The prices are extremely bad, as I know from experience.  This system should be examined. There should be some type of control on the part of the Department under which farmers would receive adequate payment from the factories for reactor cattle.  Farmers have no other outlet for these cattle so they are at the mercy of the meat factories.</P>
    <P>In 1995, 400 herds were depopulated because of brucellosis.  Last year, the figure was worse. What is the position this year?  I hope it is improving and I hope the measures introduced by the Minister last year and today will help to eradicate brucellosis and TB from the national herd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to further reduce the bovine disease levies to £2 per animal exported live or slaughtered and to 4p per gallon of milk delivered for processing.  The proposals should result in a £2 million saving per year for farmers.  It is a welcome saving which will boost farmers' incomes at a difficult time.</P>
      <P>The incidence of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis here is a major cause for concern.  Despite the investment of billions of pounds into eradication schemes since its introduction in 1954, the problem still remains, causing severe hardship to many farmers as they see a whole lifetime's work of building up a herd wiped out with TB or brucellosis. My own constituency of Monaghan and Cavan has been particularly badly affected by TB as herd after herd become infected and, despite the best efforts of farmers, their herds and their incomes are destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the various eradication schemes since 1954 must be a great disappointment to all involved.  Billions of pounds have been invested with no major success and at present there is little confidence of success in the near future.  The system of TB testing has been very disappointing as it appears to fail to identify reactor animals while giving a positive reading on animals which may not be affected.  I urge the Minister and the Government to continue with research to find a more effective scheme of testing which can completely eradicate TB and relieve the hardship suffered <Col N="438" /> by farmers.  Remember, it is farmers who suffer most from the failure of these eradication schemes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the range of operational and administrative measures introduced recently to improve the operation of the scheme, in particular an awareness campaign.  This campaign should emphasise to farmers the risk of the spread of the disease to their herd &mdash; for example, by buying animals from unknown sources.  The early removal of reactor animals is essential to avert the spread of the disease.  The improved monitoring of the spread of the disease should include the monitoring of wildlife in areas and its relation to the spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>The recently announced measures to halt the increase in the incidence of brucellosis between 1996 and 1997 are to be welcomed and will, I believe, prove effective.</P>
    <P>As discussed in this House on many recent occasions, the beef sector has been through a very difficult period over recent years, particularly since the BSE scare.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on their continuing efforts to open the live export market.  I urge the Minister to ensure these markets are opened for the autumn peak killing period of this year to ensure competition in the marketplace.  Beef producers have had a difficult period over the past two years and I believe the opening of the live shipping market would greatly assist the industry and improve farmer confidence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again welcome the saving of £2 million proposed for the farming community by the reduction of the bovine levies and I sincerely hope the schemes currently in place for the eradication of TB and brucellosis are successful.  It is up to all of us, farmers, vets, the Department, etc., to work together to ensure these schemes are successful and that anyone abusing them in any way is penalised severely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here today.  It is not long since he was here and he gave us a lot of good news on that occasion.  Today we are also having an appropriate reduction in the levies that farmers pay in relation to the animal disease programmes.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that 98 per cent of the premia and headage payments have been allocated to farmers.  The remainder that is unpaid is as a result of some difficulties.  Farmers' organisations and individual farmers should urge the Department to answer any queries.  They should do the same with regard to the area aid scheme. We should acknowledge that the Minister and the Department have made those payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Herd certification is a new problem.  I ask the Minister and the Department to agree that when a vet visits farms to carry out testing, particularly TB, herd certification could also take place which would avoid unnecessary expense.  Vets have requested that a separate visit should take place but this would result in unnecessary expenses.  I <Col N="439" /> urge the Minister to make a clear decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>I think it is time we had a new and enhanced Veterinary Act to bring us into the new millennium and beyond, as the previous Act is now quite old.  The veterinary profession have been seeking a new Act as well and it is desirable that we have one.</P>
    <P>Brucellosis has been with us for over 100 years. Many Governments have attempted to control and regulate it, but it is very important to eliminate the disease altogether.  It is very traumatic for a farmer when he has to depopulate his farm.  It is also a very costly scheme.  It reflects on the individual farmer and family to whom it occurs.  It is a mistake to remove regulations when we seem to have control of the disease.  We should maintain a tight control to protect individual farmers who suffer from it.</P>
    <P>Some people claim farmers have little interest in their herd's health status.  Nothing could be further from the truth, although some people would have more concern than others.  However, by and large farmers with large and small dairy herds are particularly concerned about it.  In general, farmers involved in the cattle business who buy stores and produce beef are equally concerned from the point of view of the trading and marketing of products.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly pointed out that we must be concerned about the health status of animals in terms of human consumption.  Consumers are not interested in buying beef from a national herd which may have a problem with its status.  I urge all those involved to play their rightful role in the control and elimination of disease.  The new measures were announced on 24 April when the Minister said that, following detailed discussions with the farming bodies in recent months, he was introducing revised compensation arrangements in the context of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The Minister also outlined details of the new arrangements and rates.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the new arrangements are, first, a standard rate which applies to reactors in stable herds where the statutory legal pre-movement testing requirements have been fulfilled; second, a standard rate plus for closed or stable herds where, in addition to satisfying the legal requirements, all bought in eligible animals since the last herd test, but in any event during the six month period prior to the breakdown, are post-movement tested within 30 days of introduction into the herd; and, third, an other rate for reactors in other herds which do not meet standard rate or standard rate plus requirements. Herds, including dealer, turnover and feeder herds, may qualify for other rate reactor grants. Herds categorised as other rate will not qualify for depopulation grants, income supplement or hardship grants.</P>
    <P>The milk deliveries basis for calculating dairy cow/in-calf heifer reactor grant entitlements will be retained but with the important change that <Col N="440" /> the add-on figure to reflect milk usage on the farm will increase to a standard 100 gallons in respect of each cow rather than the flat 5 per cent rate applying heretofore.</P>
    <P>There are certain other key alterations to previous arrangements under the brucellosis eradication scheme, including the removal of the requirement that the bought in eligible animals must remain clear in the 30 days post-movement brucellosis blood test, and the introduction of a pedigree supplement of £100 for specified animals in standard rate.</P>
    <P>For both the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes new arrangements in relation to the year to be taken into account in calculating milk deliveries will apply and monthly income supplement rates for the period 1 May to 31 October will increase by £5 across individual values effective from 1 May 1998.</P>
    <P>This new package has been agreed with the farming organisation.  To ensure a viable industry sustained by a high level of absence of animal disease I urge total co-operation by all those involved.  We must remember that the taxpayer is contributing a large amount of money to this area.  It is a national issue and the taxpayer should get value for money.  Those of us engaged in the farming industry must participate freely, fairly, honestly and honourably in the scheme to ensure the problem is overcome quickly.  I commend the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister and I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to the House.  This issue involves animal health problems which have existed for some time.  The announcement on the bovine disease levies is important because any reduction in the farming community's contribution to the cost of the schemes is most welcome.</P>
      <P>In any discussion on animal health it is important to consider people who are continuing to cause problems.  I welcome and support the Department's excellent efforts to flush out the small number of such people in the business.  Animal health is most important from the customer's point of view, particularly as up to nine out of ten cattle produced in Ireland are exported.</P>
      <P>A substantial reduction in the total cost to farmers was introduced some time ago.  These regulations involve a small reduction but it is most welcome.  When the previous reduction was announced, the price of beef in factories was falling from 120p a lb to approximately 85p a lb.  This reduction is being introduced when cattle are fetching 90p or more.  Therefore, it is a real saving to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of levies for the control of disease, I am aware of a case where a farmer bought a few cattle in a sale.  However, a departmental official told him he could not take them out because the test had expired by two days.  The official was prompt and efficient in noticing it, but one wonders how the cattle reached the sale ring? <Col N="441" /> They should not have got through and this area must be tightened to ensure further such cases do not arise.</P>
    <P>A number of complaints were made about the delay in blood samples.  I welcome the improvement in that regard.  The Minister stated that in excess of one million extra blood samples had been submitted to testing centres.  This was a huge increase; but now that the position has improved, once blood samples leave a farmer's yard, he or she should know the result within seven days.  It is most important to give farmers the maximum amount of time to decide where he or she will move their female animals.  They can only go to one sale within 30 days, but the more options they have the better.</P>
    <P>When farmers go to factories, occasionally one of the new plastic tags are missing.  These tags can be lost easily and the Department should use common sense and accept that can happen.  Will the Minister outline the percentage of people who seek new tags?  The Department should have an indication in that regard because there is a problem with the tagging.</P>
    <P>There are also problems in areas with a big turnover of land sales.  Farmers with a very good track record sometimes wonder how everything is checked out to ensure the movement of stock into new areas will not pose problems for them. That must be constantly monitored.  Land lettings must also be monitored, where cattle are moved from lands for testing.  We must tighten that up to ensure diseased cattle are not brought into areas where farmers have a good track record.</P>
    <P>It appears a number of inconclusive brucellosis tests are cropping up in some areas.  Those cattle are then found to be clear in the subsequent two tests.  Farmers are wondering why that is happening. We must do something in that regard.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, on their efforts in agriculture.  I welcome, from the point of view of farmers and beef producers, their recent good work in Brussels in securing the slaughter premium for the coming year.  Farmers were beginning to wonder whether they should stay in the finishing of beef; the securing of the premium for another year will give them confidence.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we continue to do more research.  The reduction outlined by the Minister of £2 per animal and 0.4p per gallon of milk delivered is very welcome at a time when farmers are very hard pressed.  I thank the Minister of State and wish him well in his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his portfolio.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Caffrey, that the levies should be completely abolished.  We have been extracting money every year since 1954 from the farming community.  The Minister stated that from 1979 to 1997 farmers have paid £315 million, which is a colossal amount of money.  It would be <Col N="442" /> fine if brucellosis had been eradicated but that is not the case.  The Minister proposes to reduce the levy by 0.1p per gallon, which is a very small and insignificant reduction.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Caffrey that those charges and levies should be completely abolished because we have been getting nowhere since 1954.  The problem still exists and has created severe hardship for many farmers, despite their contribution of £315 million.</P>
      <P>I come from County Mayo, which is virtually brucellosis and BSE free.  The Minister should take into consideration that farmers in Mayo must bear the brunt of all the levies, despite being virtually brucellosis free.  The value of the reactors should also be kept in line with current market prices because farmers have suffered severe hardship.  Why should areas which are brucellosis free have to bear the costs of all the levies?  The Minister should abolish all the levies.  We will not have a brucellosis free State unless some very harsh decisions are made.  Farmers cannot continue to pay enormous sums of money every year, when the job we set out to do in 1954 has not been completed.</P>
      <P>If a farmer is unlucky enough to have to have an inspection for REPS his money is held up for three months.  The Minister should speed up that process.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for arriving late.  I thank Senators for their contributions. I will try to reply to many of the queries which were raised.  The subject of disease levies is a very important one.  Many references were made to the cost of the levies, to which I will refer.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Caffrey, referred to the increased involvement of the Department.  It is necessary in the context of European Union schemes that we have effective procedures in place to monitor schemes and to avoid disallowances and other problems which can arise.  We must also provide the necessary guarantees to consumers in regard to the origins and treatment of cattle.  For these reasons we must ensure that cattle are properly identified with ear tags and have the appropriate documentation. We must also ensure that we observe EU rules and consumer requirements in relation to veterinary medicines.</P>
      <P>We seek to present the various arrangements in a consumer friendly way, within the constraints which exist.  We are committed to continuing this approach and have recently published our intentions, which Senators have probably read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of new brucellosis cases from 1988 to 1995 ranged between 350 and 450 herds each year, depending on the volume of testing.  The number of new breakdowns exceeded 600.  We identified 346 new herd breakdowns to 1 June 1996 compared to 184 for the same period in 1997.  Senators can see where the problem lies. <Col N="443" /> As the Minister said, these higher figures must be considered against the background of additional testing.  It is too early to draw conclusions on the progress of the disease, but these figures clearly do not give cause for complacency.  There is good awareness of the actions needed to tackle the disease.</P>
    <P>I was asked about veterinary legislation by my Cork friend and colleague, Senator Callanan, who is always very innovative in asking the kind of questions which one often wishes were not asked.  However, it is his right and privilege to ask questions in this House.  We are all very active in pursuing matters when we first become Members of these Houses.</P>
    <P>It is planned to introduce legislation in the near future to better regulate the veterinary profession, which is in need of updating.  My Department is concerned about that.  Plastic tagging measures are prescribed by EU legislation, which requires two tags for cattle at all times.  These rules meet consumer expectations regarding the identification and tracing of cattle.  This has become very important and Departmental staff have done much work in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely mentioned reactors.  Our policy is to move reactors at the earliest possible date and this objective has been achieved in almost all cases.  We encountered some delays on occasion involving contact animals rather than reactors.  Our first objective is to have safe herds, but where it is not considered possible to do so we recommend voluntary depopulation, though we are considering whether compulsory depopulation should be introduced in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>This is a very important issue which has taken up much of the Department's time.  Millions of pounds have been spent by farmers in this area, but millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has also been spent.  If we do not have discipline at farm level, it does not matter what procedures are put in place at departmental level or who the Minister is because there will be problems.</P>
    <P>I went to the Royal Highland Show in Scotland last week and met many people who were interested in purchasing Irish cattle, especially breeding stock.  They cannot purchase Irish cattle because of the testing problem.  Cattle are tested every three years in Scotland, but because of the nervousness and lack of discipline here, we have tuberculosis and brucellosis.  We should be beyond that problem, but the issue is one of discipline at farm level.  I congratulate my Department on its excellent work in this area under difficult circumstances.  However, I cannot repeat enough the need for discipline at farm level.  We must slow down the movement of female cattle particularly or the problem will continue.  There is little point in discussing levies because the farming community can solve this problem with orderly operation of cattle management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Last Sunday I got a telephone call from a farmer in County Limerick who was having 100 cows depopulated from a fine herd of Friesian cows.  There were particular problems in that farmer's area which were not of his making, though he was a victim of them.  I asked him for evidence of the case, but that was not forthcoming. This issue revolves around movement. We have the best veterinary and administrative staff in the Department, which has an excellent record of working on behalf of Irish farmers.  If we do not have co-operation on the ground the problem will get worse.  We had a clearance of TB and practically no brucellosis, but what has happened since?</P>
    <P>Our laboratory in Cork has been criticised, but the Minister, senior departmental staff and I recently visited it.  The laboratory undertakes a huge volume of work and is now working efficiently, returning samples quickly and satisfactorily. I visited the laboratory in Sligo yesterday. It is a smaller facility but it too is doing good work.  There are very good dedicated staff in both laboratories who are working hard for the veterinary sector and the farming community.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Moylan for paying tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, for his excellent negotiations in Luxembourg last week on behalf of Irish farmers. He successfully retained £16 million, or 60 per cent, of the beef scheme.  Nobody expected that when he left Ireland for Luxembourg.  He and the Department did other good work for Irish farmers at those negotiations.  It was great to see the IFA being so appreciative.  I am disappointed Senator Tom Hayes was not here today as yesterday he made statements in the newspapers about the Minister.</P>

      <P>Recognition is important because things are not always easy in farming negotiations.  We must have discipline in all areas because ours is an exporting country: we export 90 per cent of our beef, 65 per cent of our pig meat and practically all our dairy produce.  We must have the tags and remedies right and everything must be in order.  We are working hard on herd certification and hope to have it in place soon.  The beef scheme, which is of concern to Senator Callanan, is a big job but rapid progress is being made in that area.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult area and Members' co-operation is needed.  We must have discipline at farm level or else we will be here saying the same thing in 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 (1) states &ldquo;Each local authority may appoint a company (including a company established by a local authority) to be an authorised company for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) says an authorised company may deal with &ldquo;any provision of this Act in which that reference occurs falls to be applied&rdquo;.  Is the Minister proposing to establish an implementation or management company to oversee implementation of the provisions in the Bill?  I am not sure how the integrated area plans will be monitored and implemented.  Local authorities have a brief to draw up the plan and forward it to the Department of the Environment and Local Government which, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will decide whether to accept it and the plan will then be returned to the local authority.  Is the local authority responsible for its implementation?  Does this section establish an implementation company?  If so, are there any structures regarding its operation?</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter because there are no details of how the integrated plans will operate. It was different with other plans when we were simply providing tax relief for private investors building office blocks or residential apartments. However, this is an integrated plan which involves a wide range of functions.  Who has the authority and expertise to oversee implementation of the plans?</P>

Alternatively, the local authority can draw up the integrated plan.  There is only one such company in existence so far, namely, the Ballymun Development Company, which is carrying out its functions under the Urban Renewal Act as a local authority may if it draws up its own IAP.  Implementation, therefore, would be by the company if authorised to do so by the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" />&ldquo;(7) As soon as practicable after this Part comes into operation, the Minister shall report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the implications of extending the availability of home improvement grants in respect of private owner-occupiers of residential property in qualifying areas generally.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment which I ask the Minister to accept.  The ethos of integrated area plans is to broaden the scope to include the range of activities and concerns described in section 7, including introducing a socio-economic dimension, protection of the environment, employment, training and education.  Section 7(6) speaks of the &ldquo;objectives for the improvement of existing residential communities and the development of new such communities, including the development of housing for people of different social backgrounds&rdquo;. My main concern is that no plan to date has included consideration, good, bad or indifferent, of native communities geographically encompassed by them.</P>
    <P>People living in these urban communities, including their parents and grandparents, are not given any financial incentive to enable them improve their situation.  Incentives are given purely in terms of tax relief.  However, very many of these people are not in a position to avail of tax relief.  They have a roof over their heads, having purchased their small houses, perhaps from the local authority, when house prices were much lower than at present.  Many of these people are elderly and do not have the means to benefit from the tax relief envisaged in the legislation. Consequently, there is no financial benefit to them.  Yet these are the people around whom the area plan is constructed.  This means there is a serious lacuna unless we find some mechanism of allowing them improve their properties and homes.</P>
    <P>The amendment is specific and concerns private owner-occupiers of residential property within qualifying areas.  The same principle should apply to urban and rural areas, although this legislation is concerned with urban renewal. We hate to see dereliction continuing in little pockets while private residential accommodation and business and enterprise office blocks are built around them.  The Minister should look seriously at this issue.</P>
    <P>A prime example is the Custom House Docks development, which is like a fortress and from which there has been no spin-off to the local community. Sheriff Street is located on one side of the development with Amiens Street and part of the north east inner city on the other.  To ensure it is an integrated area plan, we must find a means to give some financial incentive.  The only way to do so is to provide home improvement grants because of the lack of means of people in this area.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this amendment in the context of the integrated area plans.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to this amendment. The problem is that people living in private accommodation which they own and who have little income are unable to refurbish their dwellings. That is what Senator Costello has in mind. A scheme is operated by the Minister's Department of which I have availed on a number of occasions for people living in such conditions. The scheme is run by the Eastern Health Board and perhaps the Minister might indicate if the other health boards have such a task force in place.  The scheme in this area is known as eastern community works, for which the Eastern Health Board receives a grant of £300,000 from the Department which pays for the inspectorate.  The labour force is provided by FÁS who carry out repairs for elderly people living in private accommodation who do not have the means to carry out the repairs.  The important words in Senator Costello's amendment are &ldquo;extending availability&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to extend that grant scheme, which works very well and for which £300,000 is made available.  If the scheme was extended, it would fulfil the requirement in Senator Costello's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also sympathetic to these schemes, which were in operation over the years and were availed of by people who found them extremely useful, particularly those who were a little hard up.  There were, however, many cut-backs in this area and virtually none survived.  In terms of the general concept of urban renewal, one of the principal problems in areas such as that in which I live is not that owner occupiers do not maintain their property in good condition but that a number of people who have many properties which were formerly residential do absolutely nothing with them and allow them to become completely derelict.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I drew the Minister's attention to a number of these properties and I hope something will be done.  The power exists to take such properties into public ownership and restore them.  I am very sympathetic to the idea of relatively modest grants being made available to people.  I am not under the illusion it will solve the problem of urban blight.  That problem will not be solved until and unless we attack problems like that which was exposed two weeks ago in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> of a Mrs. Underwood who has a property portfolio worth £10 million to £20 million which is all decaying and absolutely nothing is done about her.  Twice I have won against her in court and she was sentenced to six months in jail and was fined £35,000, but she got away with it.  There is no point giving grants to such people.</P>

      <P>While I accept the desirability of a targeted house improvement grant scheme, I do not accept it should necessarily be targeted solely within the integrated area plan.  My priority within the necessarily limited funding which is likely to be available for any house improvement grant scheme would rather be to target resources <Col N="448" /> at improving the housing conditions of low income groups and special category needs, such as the elderly and the disabled.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Government's, An Action Programme for the Millennium, I am examining possible options to extend the range of measures currently available to assist low income households in securing necessary improvement works to their housing, including the disabled persons house grant.  I regret, however, that pending completion of this examination and decision arising from it, I am not in a position to indicate the likely outcome.  In the circumstances I must oppose the amendment as being wrongly focused in that it could result in a higher priority being afforded to housing in the integrated plan areas compared to the categories of need to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Different points were made by Senators, including one on housing which is owner-occupied. Bringing back these grant schemes is a separate matter from urban renewal tax incentives to achieve certain objectives in the area of urban renewal.  Under the terms of this Bill they must have a socio-economic aspect to them so that the indigenous community will be seen to benefit from whatever plans are drawn up.  To ensure success in achieving that objective these planned areas are being drawn up at local authority level, where there should be active involvement by councillors and officials and where the local community should have an opportunity to contribute and to be made aware of what is proposed.  A wide consultative process is being encouraged to ensure that what is best for the area emerges as the plan from the local authority in the recommendations it makes to the Department.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the amendment is one in which I, as Minister with responsibility for housing, have a special interest.  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to seek to reintroduce a home improvement grant scheme which will focus on those in greatest need &mdash; obviously, those on low incomes and people living in homes which they own but which they are unable to repair without some grant assistance. That is a matter of extreme urgency.  I would not agree that such a scheme should be introduced and confined to the integrated areas which will be limited areas in the large cities and towns.  There will be a number of such areas in Dublin because of its huge population, but in most counties one town will be selected.  A certain area within part of a town will be designated for tax benefit to drive the objective the plan aims to achieve.  It would be wrong of me as Minister with responsibility for housing to agree to such a selective introduction of a home improvement grant.  I agree there is a need for such a grant but this is not the way to introduce it.  I have proposals with the Minister for Finance in this area which I hope will be decided on one way or the other by budget time when next year's Estimates are being put together.  That is the way to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> We hope that because of the new terms of reference and the bottom up approach to designation on this occasion, the socio-economic objectives will ensure local communities feel they have greater ownership of the plan and involvement in its success.  Previously, Ministers arbitrarily selected streets by rule of thumb and great tax incentives were made available to property owners in those areas which achieved the objective of renewal.  However, in many cases it was a crude instrument because there was much shadowing and many other businesses suffered.  A bloom was created through these tax incentives in a different part of the town.  These factors have been looked at carefully in relation to this new generation of urban renewal proposals.</P>
    <P>This is a more targeted, selective and focused way of achieving specific objectives than was attempted previously.  The local authority is involved on this occasion.  Rather than the Minister telling them which areas he is designating, local authorities may make proposals which relate to proper studies which they have carried out.  The plan will be integrated and will have an objective, all parts of which will be related to each other.  This is not the way in which to achieve a home improvement grant scheme because it would be too narrow in its focus and too discriminating against the vast majority of poor home owners who have low incomes and who cannot afford to repair their houses.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill and the concept of an area integrated plan as the basis of the Bill. However, I disagree with what the Minister of State describes as a selective scheme in terms of introducing home improvement grants.  The Bill is a selective scheme.  Its purpose is to select areas of socio-economic deprivation and put together a package of measures that will raise the entirety of the area.</P>
      <P>The amendment focuses on a lacuna in the package of proposals.  The Minister of State could improve the package if he dealt with the owner occupier.  I do not refer to the landlord rented accommodation sector.  It has enough incentives, and premises in this sector should be kept up to best standards.  If not, the derelict sites legislation should be rigorously imposed.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I also agree with Senator Norris's remarks on a landlady in the north inner city who is allowing many properties in her ownership to fall to ruin.  The problem should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Another element should be included in the Minster of State's selective package, which would deal with deprived socio-economic, disadvantaged areas.  Section 7(6)(a)(vi) provides that an integrated area plan may, where appropriate, in relation to the area to which it relates include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>objectives for the improvement of existing residential communities and the development of <Col N="450" /> new such communities, including the development of housing for people of different social backgrounds,</P>
    <P>This covers people who will not benefit by the package of tax incentives but who would benefit from a selective package of home improvement grants.  They are residential occupiers within the area specified geographically by the Bill.  By leaving them out, a pocket of disadvantage and dereliction will remain which will be an eyesore and be contrary to the intention of the legislation both in social and human terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the past, we are seeking to achieve these objectives through tax incentives. This is not a grant awarding scheme.  Senator Norris raised the issue of landlords who allow properties to fallow into dereliction and decay.  A landlord whose tenant lives in a privately owned building which is not being looked after can be reported to the local authority for not maintaining the building in a good and proper condition, as laid down under the Housing Act.  In such cases the local authority is obliged to have an engineer undertake a survey of the building. If he concludes it is not in a fit condition and does not comply with the requirements of the Act, he shall draw up a list of the works required, give an estimate of their cost and communicate to the owner of the dwelling directly, or, in the case of an absentee landlord, the rent collector, usually a solicitor, to the effect that such works must be undertaken.  If the owner refuses, the local authority has the power under the Act to undertake them and bill the owner with the cost.  If Senator Norris is aware of tenants who have been left in the terrible conditions he has outlined, he should report it to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(8) The adoption of an Integrated Area Plan shall be a reserved function of a local authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Although the adoption of the integrated plans is a managerial function there was widespread consultation in my local authority with regard to the sections of the north inner city covered by the Coombe, the Liberties, O'Connell Street, and the Kilmainham-Inchicore area, which was the subject of an area plan before the integrated plans system was adopted.  A colleague of Senator Costello, Alderman Connaughton, has a special interest in that area.  To Dublin Corporation's credit, it printed five separate booklets outlining in detail the five integrated plan areas in detail, which made interesting reading.  I hope Senator Norris found the copy for the north inner city I gave him of benefit.</P>

      <P>However, to my amazement I discovered that in other areas in other parts of the country there had not been this consultation process. The integrated plans are similar to development plans; therefore, when they are adopted by local authorities they should have a reserve function in respect of them.  I will not press the amendment because on Second Stage the Minister was kind enough to agree with me that if there is another round of integrated plans, they should be the subject of a reserve function.  This is not possible with the current plans, because they have already been submitted.  The purpose of the amendment is to put down a marker for the future that this approach should be adopted.</P>

Dublin Corporation was assiduous in the degree and level of consultation it employed in adopting the five integrated area plans it has presented to the Minister for his support.  This should be the model throughout the country.  The local authority is the proper body to be responsible for the plans.</P>
      <P>I raised the question of the home improvement grants because in its proposals to the Minister, Dublin Corporation recommended that such grants should be an integral part of the package. The local authority is the best body to understand the generality and the entirety of elements that should make up the package.  It would be good to have this incorporated in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The proposed framework for the new urban renewal scheme was notified to each <Col N="452" /> county and city manager on 14 May 1997.  Within that framework it was indicated that selection and prioritisation of areas for integrated area plans and the preparation of plans for areas so prioritised would be the responsibility of the relevant city corporation or county council.  No indication was given of any intention to make the selection and prioritisation of areas and the preparation of plans a reserved function.  Accordingly, it was a matter for each authority to decide on their own arrangements with regard to the exercise of their functions in relation to integrated area plans.</P>
      <P>The guidelines issued in relation to the selection of priority areas for the purposes of the new scheme and on the content of IAPs emphasised that wide cross-sectoral consultation and involvement should form an essential element in the preparation of each IAP.</P>
      <P>The process of identifying priority areas and preparing IAPs has been under way since autumn of last year with the requirement that completed plans be submitted to my Department by the end of March.  While the extent of the consultation which took place may have varied from one area to another, my understanding is that in general most plans were, in the course of their preparation, brought before and considered by the relevant local authority elected members.  In any event, the process has now advanced to the assessment stage involving the expert advisory panel which I appointed for this purpose.  It would not now be practical to revisit the completed plans through accepting the proposed amendment.  However, I have noted the Senator's comments carefully and it would be my intention that if a process such as this should arise again in the future, the adoption of integrated area plans will be formally made a reserved function of relevant elected representatives.  I agree with Senator Doyle's comments but I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;The area of Parnell Street from Parnell Monument to Gardiner Street shall be designated as a special incentive area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> I think a good job has been done in regard to integrated area plans being a reserved function of local authorities and I thank Senator Doyle for making the Dublin Corporation plan available to Members.  As someone who lives there, I notice no treatment whatsoever is accorded to the area between the Parnell Monument and Gardiner Street which is undoubtedly one of the worst blots on the face of Dublin.  I have raised this issue in as many fora as I could.  An advertisement appeared in the newspapers some six months ago seeking submissions to the Dublin Regional Authority which was applying for EU Structural Funds.  I would like to quote part of the detailed submission I made to the authority:</P>
    <P>I feel in any resuscitation of Dublin, it is absolutely vital that the north of the city should no longer be ignored.  The era of neglect of north side Dublin should be comprehensively brought to an end, especially under this Government with its enlightened northside Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>There are a number of major areas of blight. One of the most significant is the whole stretch of Parnell Street.  The worst part of this is between O'Connell Street and Gardiner Street. When I was on the panel of the Faces of Dublin Business Awards, I succeeded in getting the remit of this group extended to take in Capel Street and Parnell Street.  Whereas this had a significant impact in increasing the profile and business appearance of Capel Street, it had only a modest effect in Parnell Street, although it did have some.  It seems to me that that important street in terms of public visibility and centrality requires special incentives.  To date, successive Governments have done sweet damn all except to dump a half way house for prisoners and drug addicts in the old Kennedy's bakery (no doubt a worthy cause but not one which I see Dublin 4 or Foxrock queueing up to attract!).  What I would suggest would be a carefully worked out programme of incentives which should be initiated to encourage an architecturally, socially and commercially appropriate development of this street.  Moreover, if anything could be done to alter or remove the worst architectural blight on the north side of the city, namely, telephone house on Marlborough Street, that would be a wonderful bonus.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, the Minister could arrange for semtex to be decommissioned inside telephone house, thereby serving two functions, the removal of semtex and the removal of one of the most appalling buildings in the city.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Corporation have cooperated in drawing up a very imaginative plan to resuscitate O'Connell Street and that general area.  Perhaps the Minister could reassure me that something is in the pipeline for the very neglected area I have outlined.  If not, people will promenade along O'Connell Street and spill out into an appalling area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> Everything possible which could be done to make the area worse has been done, not only the location of a half way house for drug addicts in a distinguished old building but the granting of planning permissions and licences for four of the worst dens of iniquity in the city, namely, Fibber Magee's where drug addicts are constantly being arrested, Rumours night club, the Back Gate and P. J. McGrath's.  I previously warned that if action was not taken to address this problem, murder would be committed.  I have been proved right on more than one occasion since I made that statement.</P>
    <P>This problem may not appear to be directly related to architecture but I suggest it is.  Unless we provide incentives and implement the planning regulations and unless the Garda and Judiciary are prepared to carefully consider the granting of licences to these kind of premises, the blight will continue.  I suggest that any plan which does not take that stretch of O'Connell Street into account cannot really be regarded as an integrated area plan at all as it would be leaving out one of the principal elements of the jigsaw.  Perhaps I have not read the material sufficiently carefully but the Dublin Corporation plan does not seem to deal extensively with this area.  Even if the Minister is unable to accept my amendment, perhaps he will give some indication that the Government will focus attention on this disaster area.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to some of the business people who have stayed in the area through difficult times, decent pub owners and small reputable businesses, such as We Fit Doors, Westbrook Garage and others which provide employment and maintain decent premises.  They are not being helped.  I see small businesses driven out of the area on a regular basis by the intolerable conditions which prevail there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Norris's concerns about Parnell Street.  The particular stretch to which he referred seems to have been squeezed out somewhat as the other side has been incorporated into the O'Connell Street project and previous incentive projects in the HARP area.  The stretch from O'Connell Street to Gardiner Street has been neglected and should be incorporated into some plan.  It does not come under the north-east inner city plan and is, to a large degree, left in limbo.  Although one side of the street has received some designation, the street should be treated as an integrated project in its own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously not the Minister's responsibility to draw up the plans.  How receptive will he be to further local authority IAPs in the coming years? I understand approximately 78 proposals have been received upon which the Minister must deliberate and make recommendations to the Minister for Finance.  What will happen future IAP applications?  Will it be possible for Senator Norris, for example, to write to Dublin Corporation and request the city manager to compile an <Col N="455" /> integrated plan for Parnell Street and other areas?  Would the Minister be prepared to consider such a plan within the terms of the Urban Renewal Bill and within the period of its operation? Will there be a further tranche of applications in 1999 or 2000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Senator Norris made a submission to the Dublin Regional Authority to assist it in securing funding post 1999.  As its vice-chairman, I was responsible for that aspect of the authority's remit.  It was difficult to get some of the public bodies to make representations. I am thankful for Senator Norris' contribution but I do not know if funding from Europe will be spent on these integrated programmes in the way we intended .</P>
      <P>Before I gave Senator Norris Dublin Corporation's plans for the north inner city, I noticed that part of Parnell Street was included.  We were not involved as members in drawing up the IAPs and were not questioned about which areas we would like included.  In future it would be helpful if elected corporation members and members of the public could make contributions to the local authority, similar to the development plan but on a smaller scale, so that the areas of greatest need could be highlighted.  That was a weakness in the system which existed until now.  In future some provision should be made for that input.</P>

      <P>The Senator knows my mind on many issues.</P>
      <P>Section 372B of the Finance Act, 1998, provides that the Minister for Finance may on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, which recommendation must take account of an integrated area plan submitted by a local authority or a company established by a local authority, direct that an area or areas within the boundary of an area to which an integrated area plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of one or more of the urban renewal reliefs provided for under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the legislation before the House is to provide a statutory framework for the renewal of selected urban areas on the basis of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities or authorised companies taking account of criteria drawn up by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  The legislation sets out in detail the requirements in relation to the format and content of integrated area plans and provides that these plans may contain, or be accompanied by, recommendations from the local <Col N="456" /> authority or authorised company concerned that an area or areas within the boundary of an area to which a plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of one or more of the urban renewal reliefs.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for each local authority or authorised company, at the request of the relevant local authority, to decide on the area or areas for which an integrated plan or plans are to be prepared and submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  It is subsequently a matter for the Minister to decide on the making of recommendations to the Minister for Finance to the effect that an area or areas within the area covered by a plan shall be a qualifying area for the purpose of the urban renewal incentives.  The Minister for Finance makes the ultimate decision on the application of the incentives having considered the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's recommendations.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate in legislation of this nature to single out any one area for the application of incentives.  The basis on which the case can be made for any particular area considered by the relevant Ministers and ultimately decided upon is clearly set out in the Bill and in the Finance Act, 1998.  I assure the Senator that where a local authority has decided to prepare and submit to my Department an integrated area plan for any particular area, the case for applying urban renewal relief in support of any such plan will be given careful consideration.  Until such time as all the plans submitted to my Department have been considered, however, and the necessary clearances to the application of any proposal sent or obtained from the European Commission, it will not be possible to be more specific in relation to the areas in which incentives will apply.  In those circumstances I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned a particular area in the amendment.  Bearing in mind that this is an attempt to have a bottom-up approach and that the local authorities are to come forward with the proposals, the amendment would seek to give the Minister the right to assert that a certain area shall be included.  That is out of line with the spirit of the legislation and goes against the subsidiarity principle which we seek to continue to apply.</P>
    <P>The attempts to develop integrated area plans have been publicised since I came into the Department and my predecessor would have made references to it.  There was an opportunity for the public and local authority members to have a say in which areas should receive help.  In Dublin, because of the large population, there will be more than one integrated area plan approved.  Reference has already been made to the integrated area plan which Dublin Corporation has put together for the north inner city area which borders on the area Senator Norris mentioned.  The O'Connell Street plan also borders on the area mentioned.  Some of the streets mentioned have already been included in these plans.  It was a matter for Dublin Corporation to <Col N="457" /> submit them at that stage.  It has submitted other plans for other parts of the city.  I do not know what number will finally be approved.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris referred to some of the areas as disaster areas.  I walked around the north inner city with the Taoiseach early one morning and I have never seen anything as disastrous as the area in the vicinity of Sean MacDermott Street.  If any area needed attention at Government level and incentives to assist the local authority to rejuvenate it and give the community there some chance of a decent life, that is it.  I have never seen a worse area and I hope that is not repeated throughout Dublin city.  We should give it top priority and I am pleased that Dublin Corporation decided to focus on that area with an IAP. I am sure Senator Doyle has shown the Senator the north inner city plan.  It is excellent.</P>

      <P>It is a sad reflection of the lack of strength in the economy in the past that such areas could be neglected for so long.  I am interested in looking at the area Senator Norris mentioned as it borders that area.  By the stroke of a pen some of that area may have been left out but some of it is included in the plan.</P>
      <P>I hope these plans will succeed.  It is not a grant aided matter.  The house improvement grant is not the way to achieve what is required.  We must deal with that on a national basis.</P>
      <P>I issued guidelines on 24 November and my predecessor issued preliminary guidelines in May 1997.  Everyone knew they had to do this job and that proposals should be brought before the members.  The emphasis was on extensive consultation, participation and partnership.  That is one of the headings in the guidelines I issued.  On Committee Stage in the other House I stressed that the guidelines must be consulted when reading the Urban Renewal Bill; much of the detail is in the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines state that wide cross sectoral consultation and involvement should form an essential element in IAP preparation.  Any city manager reading that guideline should have arranged for the participation of his members and the public in the preparation of these plans.  Some local authorities held public meetings and invited <Col N="458" /> all organisations in the community to make proposals. The need for such consultation will first arise at the initial data gathering stage when the needs, strengths and weaknesses of the area are being analysed.  The second opportunity will arise when key issues have been identified and draft strategies have been formulated.  The section goes on to lay emphasis on the need for wide consultation. The opportunity was there for people to suggest that a particular area should be included.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendment as it is very specific and cuts across the spirit of the issue.  This is a decision that should have been made at local level.  However, if Dublin Corporation suggested to the Department that it may be possible to include part of this area in one of adjoining IAPs, then this proposal would be examined.  The initiative would have to be taken by the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed and careful reply and I am extremely heartened by his last comment.  I am not a member of the local authority but I try to respond to newspaper advertisements and have made various submissions.  I do not recall seeing the advertisement about the integrated plan.  Perhaps I thought I had submitted something under some other heading.  I have no record of the North Great George's Street Preservation Society receiving any consultation document.  There is a strong group in this area &mdash; the Parnell Street traders &mdash; and I do not think they have been involved either.  This may be an oversight and I am not making any accusations.</P>
      <P>However, I intended the ask the Minister of State the question he answered at the end of his speech, namely, if we managed to draw the attention of the City Manager and the corporation to the apparent inadvertent exclusion of a very significant area, would it be possible to look at that again?  The Minister of State has answered this very positively.</P>
      <P>I must declare a small but significant interest. We have worked extraordinarily hard in North Great George's Street.  This has not only led to private residences for our own glorification but remarkable places such as the James Joyce Cultural Centre in which the Taoiseach and members of the Progressive Democrats read on Bloom's Day.  We are trying to build a number of other such establishments.  Tourists come up O'Connell Street, a fine street which will be finer as the plan develops.  However, the problem is that there is a deserted, squalid area of a few hundred yards through which they must traverse before they reach the decent area we have battled to create &mdash; North Great George's Street.  That is a substantial disincentive for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that Sean MacDermott Street is a disaster area.  There are very decent people living there and I am delighted that they are part of an IAP.  I do not begrudge them this in the slightest and I cannot think of an area more in need of such development.  However, the section of Parnell <Col N="459" /> Street needs treatment just as much.  The Minister of State is right in stating that Parnell Street is parallel to Sean MacDermott Street.  I know both streets well as North Great George's Street leads on to Parnell Street and is one block from Sean MacDermott Street.  I chose to live there and to do my best to improve the area and I am delighted that some of my less fortunate neighbours are being given an incentive.  I am pleased the Minister of State said that his Department will look again if it received the appropriate prompting from the City Manager.  I will be sending this material to Mr. Fitzgerald who is an excellent and efficient man and I am sure he would welcome the opportunity to extend the area a little.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle suggested including one side of Parnell Street but this suggests that there is something arbitrary about the plan.  Perhaps it could be extended to include the whole street as this would make sense.  If only the left hand side of the street is included when both sides are equally bad, then it does not suggest an integrated plan in the sense that I would understand such a concept.</P>
    <P>It is like a jigsaw puzzle.  We have great plans for O'Connell Street.  We have done the work voluntarily in North Great George's Street and we are now talking about Sean MacDermott Street.  However, there is one, small, concentrated, intervening area which is a disaster and this is the area I specified in the amendment.  I accept the Minister of State's explanation, particularly with regard to subsidiarity.  In this amendment I am turning the principle of the Bill on its head.  I do not mind doing so but I will withdraw the amendment because I have got what I wanted &mdash; the opportunity to draw to the attention of the responsible authorities a significant problem in the north inner city.</P>

The advisory group I established to make recommendations has entered into discussions <Col N="460" /> with some of these authorities on their plans.  We are anxious to achieve the best possible results.  Nothing is written in stone, not even the 6,000 figure for population.  This was a realistic guide as one requires a certain population level if one is talking about urban renewal.  We are not talking about rural or village renewal so there was a requirement for a reasonable population level. An area would not be ruled out if it had a population of 5,999.  If it was recommended by a local authority as its priority it would need to be close to the figure of 6,000 but that figure is not written in stone.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister of State say he is prepared to consider proposals for an alteration to the existing plan from Dublin Corporation.  Councillors were not consulted about the geographic boundaries of the plan.  We were consulted on the input to the plan but the corporation did not take our views into consideration when the decison was made to extend the boundaries.</P>
      <P>There was tremendous consultation &mdash; on the northside there are the three areas of the HARP, O'Connell Street and the north-east inner city. One part of Parnell Street was included in the 1994-7 tax incentive scheme.  The present north-east inner city plan just touches the junction of Summerhill, Gardiner Street and Parnell Street but does not actually go into Parnell Street.</P>
      <P>Instead of coming east, the O'Connell Street plan goes west into Moore Street and Henry Street.  There is a small area in Parnell Street which could easily be attached to the O'Connell Street or north-east inner city plan.  We will be raising this matter with the Minister of State and I am glad Senator Norris referred to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not respond to my comments that there are other areas which we have identified, such as Ballybough. We have tabled a motion with Dublin Corporation and it has agreed to examine this matter in terms of an IAP.  This would be the next area which would be nearest to Sean MacDermott Street and the north-east inner city.  However, the area has not been included in the present tranche.  The North Inner City Business Association proposed Dorset Street but it has not been included in the current plan. How receptive is the Minister of State to further submissions, apart from those currently before him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entering into any commitments regarding the future.  What I said about people wishing to make further submissions altering or amending what they have already submitted relates to the current number of IAPs submitted following the invitation to do so prior to 31 March.  Those are under consideration and a decision will be made on them.  There is no commitment <Col N="461" /> about any future designation or future IAPs.  That is something for the future.</P>
      <P>The current IAPs are set out to be achieved over a period and their progress will be observed. It must be borne in mind that this is a new generation of a tax incentive driven renewal programme. Its success is something which cannot be adjudicated upon at this stage.  However, it has resulted from a close examination of previous tax designated areas by three groups of expert consultants. A major conference was held on the results of their work to which all local authorities were invited and in which they participated.  The new generation of IAPs has arisen from that study.  The decisions were based on expert consultants' earlier reports on the success or failure of previous schemes and what objectives should be set if areas were to be designated again for the purposes of achieving urban renewal.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the more areas are designated, the less attractive or effective the initiative will be because there are only so many people willing to make the necessary investment to regenerate areas.  A great deal of money will be required under some of the proposals submitted. If the tax incentive is applied broadly it will not have the same attraction or effect, which would mean some areas being designated and nothing happening.  It must be ensured the areas are attractive, that there is development and investment and that people see the resulting improvement in their area.  We cannot speak of the next generation of designated area until we see how this one works.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;The Minister shall lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for making or refusing to make any recommendation under section 9.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister of State speak of having visited the Seán MacDermott Street area and that he knows it is an area which requires considerable development.  While he has not fully indicated it will be on the list, I am hopeful it will be a priority in the integrated area plan which will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment refers to the principle of establishing criteria by which the Minister of State can judge the various plans in terms of selection.  He neither confirmed nor denied the figure I gave of 78 plans which he has received.  If that is the correct figure, how will he select from those plans? What criteria will he use?  What will make one plan worthwhile and another not?  He is the person who will make recommendations to the Minister for Finance regarding these plans.  What weighting system will he use for urban areas? There are five plans before him from Dublin Corporation and I am sure there are others from the <Col N="462" /> other local authorities in Dublin, all deserving of funding.  What parameters will there be for funding? It is important that it is not within the gift of the Minister to unilaterally select whatever plan he wishes, yet that seems to be what the legislation states.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough; we need a transparent system.  I am sure the Minister of State will be very assiduous in his selection of plans and in his recommendations to the Minister for Finance. However, the legislation should be transparent and should specify the criteria on which plans will be recommended to the Minister for Finance. This would tell everyone in local authorities and in local communities, who would be hopeful their plans would be successful, the reasons they were unsuccessful, were that to be the case.  There should be good and valid reasons.  The amendment is important in that it requests the granting of a statement of the reasons for making or refusing any recommendation.</P>

He satisfied me by saying that he would set up an advisory body to help him in the first instance and that it would then be a case of a decision being made between him and the Minister for Finance.  This is an important issue and transparency will be necessary to satisfy people that everyone has been dealt with fairly.  I ask the Minister of State to sympathetically consider Senator Costello's amendment.</P>

      <P>I have reservations about this. Seventy eight plans have been submitted and, if the scheme were spread over all those areas, nothing would happen.  This will be worthwhile legislation if it is implemented properly.  We have seen the benefits similar initiatives have brought to larger communities so it is high time smaller communities benefited from the economic boom. I am sure the Minister of State will favourably examine areas with declining populations and which need development.  I cannot agree with the amendment if the incentive is to be spread over 78 areas because that would be a disaster.  If each local authority were to submit just one priority area in an attempt to do something for small areas, benefits would be gained from the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an underlying principle in the new approach to urban renewal that decisions on the designation of areas for urban renewal reliefs will in future be based on carefully prepared integrated plans which set out a basis on which designation on a selective and targeted basis would assist in achieving the objectives of such plans.  The legislation accordingly provides that integrated area plans may contain or be accompanied by recommendations from a local authority or authorised company to the effect an <Col N="463" /> area or areas within the boundary of the area to which the plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of urban renewal tax reliefs.</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, having considered an integrated area plan and any recommendations contained in or accompanying the plan, may recommend to the Minister for Finance that the latter should make an order directing that an area or areas within the area to which the plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of urban renewal tax reliefs.  It is then for the Minister for Finance to make a decision on whether to make any such order having regard to all the issues involved, including the extent and nature of any designation proposed and potential cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that a response will issue to any submission by a local authority or authorised company in the context of an integrated area plan and that as much information as it is possible to give with regard to the grounds for any decision taken on the local authority's or authorised company's submission will be included in any such response.  However, the making of recommendations by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is just one step in a process which starts with the preparation of IAPs by local authorities or authorised companies and which must go through a number of stages before there is any decision on whether and to what extent incentives are to be applied in a case.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant, therefore, to introduce a formal reporting requirement along the lines set out in the amendment proposed by the Senators which would apply at a certain stage in a process which would not have terminated by then and which must have a degree of flexibility in terms of wider taxation policy built into it.  Following the making of recommendations by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the final decision as to whether tax designation will or will not be applied in the context of an integrated area plan rests with the Minister for Finance who is responsible for budgetary and taxation policy. There will undoubtedly be a need for considerable consultation between the two Ministers concerned before any final decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>Placing responsibility on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to formally set out reasons for making or not making a recommendation separately from any final decision as to the application of the incentive as it is proposed under the amendment would not, in my view, be appropriate in these circumstances.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intent of the Bill to have as much transparency as possible.  This tax incentive scheme for urban renewal is completely different from the previous renewal schemes because of the level of consultation and greater transparency.  It is not possible for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to take on the responsibility of making a formal decision.  The Minister for the <Col N="464" /> Environment and Local Government is not the final arbiter with regard to designating certain areas for tax relief.  The Bill does not propose that entire streets be designated.  Individual buildings and certain named streets will be recommended by local authorities in order to achieve an objective. Many people will be involved in the decision and any one person's reasons for making a decision could not present the sum of all the reasons for the final decision.  The House has always accepted that the Minister for Finance is charged with responsibility for taxation and budgetary matters and he carries the responsibility for any decisions made in those areas.</P>
    <P>In considering the recent house price crisis and seeking as much information as possible to help us draw up sound policy, the Government appointed a consultant who made certain recommendations. One of these recommendations which was not accepted was that section 23 tax concession for residential development should be ended from a current date.  We retained section 23 with the express intention that it would only be applied in specific cases, bearing in mind many other factors, and only within areas for which there were integrated area plans and where market conditions indicated that its retention was appropriate.  Section 23 will only be available on a very selective basis within the integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>It is not practical to suggest that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government should state the reasons for his recommendation when the process involves many people, of whom he is only one.  The final arbiter is the Minister for Finance who implements Government policy with regard to tax concessions for urban renewal. The Minister for Finance will make decisions after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government but the decision is ultimately his.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear references to the need for transparency.  The new scheme is more transparent than any previous one but I suppose that when one goes so far one will always be asked to go further.  It is a vast improvement on the lack of transparency and consultation and the arbitrariness with which previous schemes were administered by Ministers in different Governments since the 1980s.  There was no debate in either House about the designation of areas under previous schemes.  Decisions were taken at ministerial level, county managers were consulted but no local representatives were involved before lists of designated areas were published in newspapers.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since those days. Anyone who is concerned about transparency has the opportunity, under the Freedom of Information Act, to see the relevant papers in time. My recommendations will be based on the advice of the expert advisory group which is an independent and representative group many of whose members were appointed by my predecessor. That group will examine the integrated area plans and assess them on the basis of their compliance <Col N="465" /> with the guidelines.  One of the important guidelines refers to local consultation.  Extensive local consultation or the lack of it will be a factor in selecting plans for recommendation.  Members in both Houses have expressed concern at the lack of consultation with elected members of local authorities.  We will be monitoring the local consultation processes to ensure that the locally elected representatives are consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate issues: first, transparency in the method of consultation by local authorities in drawing up the plans and, second, transparency in the Minister's method of selecting them.  There has been a strong level of consultation.  However, in the case of my own local authority Dublin Corporation itself determined the boundaries of the integrated area and the consultation only concerned the projects within these boundaries.  There was no initial consultation before the areas were selected.  That left something to be desired.</P>
      <P>There is no transparency on how the Minister will select the integrated area plans for recommendation to the Minister for Finance for approval.  There is nothing in this legislation which requires the Minister to say what criteria he used in selecting a plan for recommendation. He may have an expert team of advisers but the legislation does not require the Minister to record the reasons for his decisions.  There is no transparency.</P>
      <P>I was half heartened to hear the Minister say that he intends to respond to local authorities' queries regarding his reasons for selection.  I would like him to elaborate on that.  Is he prepared to respond in writing to an individual local authority as to the grounds on which a decision was made to accept or reject their plan?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us when he intends to make his recommendations and does he know how much money the Minister for Finance will allot to the projects?  How much money is available from the Minister for Finance for the projects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to respond to the submissions, indicating as far as possible the reasons for whatever decision was made with regard to each integrated area plan.  The reasons cases did and did not qualify will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to when the decisions will be made, I indicated earlier that the European Union has been raising questions about the double rent allowance.  It will not be possible to make an announcement about the successful integrated area plans until the European Commission has given its approval to the tax incentives.  The Commission has already indicated its reluctance to approve double rent allowances but we propose to increase capital allowances in lieu wherever double rent allowances are not granted.  In certain cases that might compensate for the loss of the double rent allowance.  Until the European Union has given its <i>imprimatur</i> it will not be possible <Col N="466" /> or worthwhile to make any announcements.  The interest of investors or of those who seek to avail of the tax incentives cannot be finalised until they know what the incentives will be, so there is no point producing plans until the tax incentives issue is clarified.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to forecast how long it will take the European Commission to make its decision.  I am advised that it could be October.  On the other hand it might not make the decision before Christmas.  It does not appear to be a major issue, but the Commission moves slowly on matters such as these.  It takes a strong view of anything that might be an aid to industry and these cases, where commercial and industrial investment is being attracted, are also seen by the Commission as aids to industry.  That also applies to rate reliefs.</P>
    <P>I cannot answer the Senator's question at this stage.  My officials will discuss the issue with officials in the Commission within a few weeks of the Bill being passed by the Oireachtas.  We will submit information on the integrated area plans, although they will have no role in deciding which will be approved; that is the role of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  It is my intention to have it approved as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the obstacles that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Last autumn, I quoted 1 August as the anticipated date when decisions would be announced with regard to the IAPs.  Subsequent to that announcement, however, the Minister for Finance, on my recommendation, agreed to extend the time for completion of projects under the existing urban renewal scheme to 31 December to allow projects which were held up for various reasons, mostly to do with planning, to be completed. At the time, the date on which the old renewal scheme would end, 31 July, appeared to be a suitable date for the introduction of the new scheme, but the old scheme will now not finish until 31 December.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to wait until 1 January, however, as I wish to have this issue cleared up and to put these proposals into the public arena as quickly as possible.  That could be next October.</P>

It is a most important matter because the corporation has only enough land in the city to build 500 houses.  When that land is used there is no future hope of building houses in the city.</P>
      <P>The only place in which the corporation can accommodate people in social and affordable housing is the docklands area.  The master plan provides for 20 per cent of residential development in the area to be devoted to social and affordable housing.  However, that can only be achieved if it is underpinned by the commercial and residential development of the rest of the Docklands Authority area.  Will the Minister of State impress on the EU how essential this is for the future development of the docklands area?</P>

      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Doyle, who always keeps a tight eye on the development of land in the Dublin area, if urban development took place in our larger rural towns we would be able to ensure that a certain amount of housing is provided in that area.  This would alleviate the housing problems in Dublin and repopulate rural communities.</P>

      <P>The difficulty that has arisen with the European Commission with regard to double rent allowance will apply equally to the Dublin docklands as it will to any of the IAP areas.  It will not affect residential development.  The EC are only concerned with anything considered to <Col N="468" /> be an operating or industrial aid, which is how they view the double rent allowance.  Any proposals regarding social housing in the Dublin docklands area will not be affected by anything the European Commission are looking at with regard to tax incentives.</P>
      <P>Commercial development in the Dublin dockland area qualifies for 100 per cent capital allowance and is a very attractive incentive for a commercial development in that area.  As regards the two issues raised by Senator Doyle, one is not affected at all and the other one receives 100 per cent capital allowance on commercial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to introduce the Turf Development Bill, 1997.  Bord na Móna is one of the oldest semi-State bodies.  The company is a household name in large areas of Ireland and has come a long way since it was set up over 50 years ago.  The board operates in a number of competitive markets against major private sector companies. It has become extremely flexible and the opportunities now open to it would have been unheard of some time ago.</P>
      <P>The board needs flexibility to undertake options, delegate core activities to subsidiaries, the power to transfer assets and liabilities within the group of companies and the power to enter into joint ventures where appropriate, etc.  The Bill is designed to give the board this flexibility by providing for the conversion of Bord na Móna from a statutory corporation to a public limited company.  These changes in status reflect the evolving commercial mandate and business environment.</P>
      <P>When it was established in 1946, Bord na Móna was given a duty to develop the peat lands of Ireland in the national interest.  Since then, the board has acquired and developed approximately 88,000 hectares of bogland which, in turn, has supported whole communities in the midlands region.  Most of the Members present are aware of the impact of Bord na Móna on many communities. In that regard I always think of the village of Rochfortbridge and the rows of houses in Derrygreenagh Park.  Derrygreenagh bog is located in Senator Gallagher's and Senator Moylan's constituency, but people are leaving Rochfortbridge, which was a Bord na Móna village.</P>
      <P>The company supplies peat to five power stations, to a large number of homes in the form of peat briquettes and produces and markets horticultural products.  It has a turnover of £140 million and has become one of the top companies. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the board has the right structure to allow it to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of peat and the role of Bord na Móna continues to be supported because of the strategic <Col N="470" /> and social roles of peat.  Entire communities are bound up in working the bogs.  Despite massive cut backs and other exigencies over the years, the company has a workforce of 2,000 people.  If one company employed that number of people it would be regarded as a huge part of a community.</P>
    <P>The company has undergone major and painful changes and the process of change is ongoing. The first step was the successful operational restructuring that has been undertaken by the company.  The second step was the investment by the State of £100 million of equity, while the third step is the planned construction of the europeat power station.  The final step is the new corporate structure which the Bill will provide.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware of the rationalisation programme and the individual requirements of each division.  New self-directed work teams were introduced which allowed workers to be rewarded on the basis of output efficiency and quality of peat produced.  This and other innovations have resulted in an 80 per cent increase in productivity since 1988, which is an enormous leap.  Virtually all the board's milled peat is now produced by work teams and the concept of team based work systems and performance related pay has extended into other areas of activity.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna was the first State company to engage in a major process of change.  The workforce is to be commended for its foresight in recognising the need for the programme and for the hard decisions which had to be made.  What emerged was a clear understanding throughout the organisation that Bord na Móna was departing from an old corporate culture to a new one determined by the realities of the marketplace and the public finances.</P>
    <P>The successes of the rationalisation process were the beginning of a new era for Bord na Móna.  However, the company continued to be in a very serious financial situation in the late 1980s and early 1990s because of the huge level of debt which was on its books.  This debt had to be serviced. It was apparent that the solution to this problem did not lie within the company but with the State as its owner.  The accounts of Bord na Móna for 1995-6 show that the company had total borrowings of almost £170 million and a negative net worth of over £60 million.  The majority of this debt originated in the period following the oil crisis in 1973 to the early 1980s.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of peat being cheaper than competing fuels during that period and in light of the hardships imposed, Bord na Móna undertook a series of investments.  This was known as the third development programme and involved total investment of approximately £164 million.  While the programme resulted in increased utilisation of peat, it failed financially as it was predicated on oil prices remaining high, which did not happen. By 1993, despite rationalisation and a return to profitability, this debt remained on the books of Bord na Móna with the result that the company had a negative net worth.  The board engaged financial <Col N="471" /> consultants who reported that £126 million of the debt was unsustainable.</P>
    <P>The State had never injected any equity into Bord na Móna since its inception in 1946.  All the board's investments were funded by borrowings and in earlier years by repayable Exchequer advances.  In 1995 the previous Government decided to address the debt problem directly through a first ever injection of equity.  This was designed to bring Bord na Móna back to commercial normality.</P>
    <P>The decision to inject these funds was conditional on a commensurate reduction in the price of milled peat sold to the ESB.  The reduction in that price brings to an end the previous indirect method of servicing the unsustainable debt and involves savings of approximately £14 million to the ESB.  The equity injection had to be cleared with Europe, and immediately following this clearance £49 million was paid to the board in December 1996.  In September 1997 a further £51 million was paid, giving a total Government investment of £100 million in the company.</P>
    <P>Regarding the new peat fired power station, Bord na Móna needs to achieve minimum sales of three million tonnes of milled peat per annum over the next ten years to help ensure the board's continued viability.  The station is included in the National Development Plan, 1994-9, and the EU Commission has agreed to make £21 million in Structural Funds available to it.  The Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, confirmed to me last year that expenditure incurred to the end of 2001 will be eligible for co-financing under the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The development is proceeding in line with projections in terms of planning applications, various studies and consultative meetings.  The Senators who live in the constituency are aware of that.  When I took office last year I asked my officials to give me a report each week on what was happening with regard to the new station.  I was presented with this progress report every Monday morning and it was a great database for me.  It allowed me to follow the progress of the new station.  The Finnish IVO Group was the successful bidder and the station will be located at Clonbullogue in the east midlands.  The IVO company has moved rapidly to ensure there is no slippage in its schedule.</P>
    <P>The contracts between IVO, the ESB and Bord na Móna were signed in March, which was followed by a reception in the Merrion Hotel.  The application for planning permission for the site, including an environmental impact statement, was submitted to Offaly County Council on 28 May.  The engineering procurement and construction contracts were signed last week, on 24 June, and the company is due to commence a site survey within the next month to enable advance civil design, e.g. foundations and buildings, to continue. I hope there will be no upset to the onward march of that very important project, on which our officials, IVO and Offaly County Council <Col N="472" /> have worked in tandem.  I hope no one will be so insensitive or mischievous as to seek to hold it back.</P>
    <P>IVO is also conscious of the need to keep the local community informed of developments.  A public meeting was held on 19 May and two half day informal meetings were held on 24 and 25 June.</P>
    <P>The station will support 250 full-time and 250 part-time jobs.  Approximately 450 people will be employed at peak in its construction.  The money which will spill into the local community as a result will revive that area and bring it back to life.  The new station will be subject to the full planning and environmental requirements and will be state of the art design.</P>
    <P>The final ingredient required to further strengthen the board's future prospects is the legal restructuring of the company to provide it with a new modern corporate structure.  The objective is to provide the board with a company configuration.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the conversion of Bord na Móna from a statutory corporation to a public limited company.  It also allows for the injection of further equity into the new plc, as well as the updating of certain miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>The common feature in each business is the use of peat, but in all other respects they are quite different.  The peat energy division supplies milled peat to ESB power stations.  It is effectively a monopoly with a secure future.  The other three divisions, however, are open market divisions competing with the private sector under different and difficult market conditions.</P>
    <P>The solid fuels division is operating in a declining market.  The challenge is to manage that decline while maintaining profitability, which will be some job.  If this division is to survive, it must balance the decline in turf consumption by seeking alternative opportunities.  In this regard, Senators will be aware of the recent acquisition by Bord na Móna of the coal business of Suttons and Staffords North-East.</P>
    <P>The horticulture division is responsible for the production of the well known &ldquo;Shamrock&rdquo; brand of horticultural products based on peat, over 90 per cent of which are exported.  The environmental products division is still in its infancy.  I am not going to put it in a straitjacket as I want to see it grow and realise its potential.  I was very interested when I went to Bord na Móna to see the very professional, interesting young people working in that division developing projects.  I thought it had a great future.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 5 contain standard provisions in legislation.  Sections 6 to 11 provide for the formation of the new company.  Sections 12 to 17 provide for the issue of shares in the company. Sections 18 to 20 provide for the appointment by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, of the chairperson and directors of the board, all of whom are in place except one.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is an enabling provision for the further injection of equity not exceeding £10 million. <Col N="473" /> Sections 22 and 23 include a number of standard general powers.  Sections 24 and 25 are standard provisions relating to auditors.  Section 26 deals with the managing director.  Sections 27 to 33 relate to the remuneration of staff, etc., and provide that directors who become Members of either House of the Oireachtas or the EU Parliament cannot remain on the board.  Sections 28 and 29 relate to superannuation.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 to 40 provide for the establishment of Bord na Móna's business activities as separate limited liability subsidiaries.  Section 41 relates to the share capital.  Sections 42 to 44 provide for the appointment, terms and conditions of the chairpersons and the directors of each new subsidiary. Sections 45 to 50 are standard provisions relating to auditors.</P>
    <P>Sections 51 and 52 provide for the transfer of staff from the old company to the new company. Sections 53 to 55 are standard provisions relating to the performance of the functions of the new company.  Section 56 provides that the new company must afford appropriate protection to the environment and archaeological heritage.  Section 57 provides for the dissolution of Bord na Móna statutory corporation on the vesting day of the new company.  Sections 58 to 61 provide for the application of the existing Turf Development Acts and the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts to the new company and the application of certain provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The new corporate and legal structure proposed in the Bill is fully in line with the philosophy advanced in the Culliton and Moriarty reports on industrial policy, which recommended incorporation under the Companies Acts as a general model for commercial State enterprises.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Bord na Móna will benefit from this.  Bord na Móna has experienced some outstanding highs and, unfortunately, some very dramatic lows over many years.  There are no longer any safe harbours for companies seeking to operate commercially and viably.  However, Bord na Móna has reached a position where it knows the road ahead, equity has been put into it and it knows it must operate commercially and viably in each of its groupings.  It has a very stable board, chairperson and chief executive officer.  I wish to pay tribute to the work of the previous chief executive officer, and also to the present chief executive officer who provides a very steady framework for the ongoing work of Bord na Móna.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to place Bord na Móna on a commercial footing.  It is the most important legislation affecting Bord na <Col N="474" /> Móna since its foundation.  As a commercial company operating in a very competitive market, it is essential that Bord na Móna changes and becomes a public limited company.  The Bill will grant Bord na Móna plc status and will allow its four divisions &mdash; horticulture, environmental products, peat energy and solid fuels &mdash; to operate individually and with their own boards which will place them on a competitive and commercial footing.</P>
      <P>The last decade has been very difficult for Bord na Móna.  In 1989 the company lost £91 million; in 1991 it owed £187 million.  Wrong decisions were taken by Bord na Móna which left it with a crippling debt.  Its future is now based on the successful restructuring of the company which has been undertaken over the past ten years.  Over 3,500 jobs have been lost and difficult decisions have been taken by both workers and management.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna was set up over 50 years ago.  It has supplied energy, peat moss and turf to ESB power stations.  In particular, it has provided much needed employment in areas which would never have had any industry otherwise.  It employed thousands of workers in Counties Kildare, Offaly, Laois and Longford and part of County Mayo and gave economic stability to the people of those regions.  It gave young people, in particular, the opportunity to work and prosper at home.  It revitalised many depressed areas by providing essential employment and has made significant contributions to the social fabric of these counties.</P>
      <P>The Turf Development Act, 1990, gave Bord na Móna the power to form subsidiary companies but did not allow the delegation of any of its statutory functions.  This Bill will allow Bord na Móna's operating divisions to function as stand alone companies where their performances can be evaluated and monitored.  They will have to be profitable to survive in the real commercial world.  Bord na Móna will now be subject to all the legal obligations and responsibilities which apply under company law.</P>
      <P>The board was charged with developing our bogs under the 1946 Act.  It introduced new machine technology following consultation with experts in Russia and Germany.  Large areas of bog were acquired and drained.  When Bord na Móna changed over to milled peat, new power stations were constructed and major changes took place in drainage technology.  Bord na Móna was at the cutting edge of turf technology.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government brought forward the final portion of the EU approved money, bringing the total amount of money invested by successive Governments in Bord na Móna to £100 million.  This means that the company no longer labours under the crippling debt burden which accumulated during the energy crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives the company a structure which is fine tuned to the world of trade and commerce and to a marketplace which has undergone radical change in the past decade.  The solid fuel market <Col N="475" /> in Ireland is decreasing by approximately 7 per cent per annum.  Through goods branding and marketing, Bord na Móna is fighting to retain its market share.  By purchasing coal distributors, CDL, for £3.5 million Bord na Móna has increased its market share in a shrinking market, but it is facing a dwindling demand for its product as a home heating fuel as householders switch to cleaner and more convenient forms of heating such as oil, natural gas and electricity.</P>
    <P>The future of Bord na Móna lies in improved efficiency and output.  Its horticultural division has an annual turnover of £45 million and employs over 300 staff.  This is a competitive business and profit margins are very tight.  Market forces are driving horticultural peat prices down and the board's performance in this sector must be improved.  The peat energy division has ESB as its main customer, and this sector will receive a major boost when the new European peat station is built in the midlands.  Over one million tons of peat will be supplied annually to that station to generate electricity, and this 120 megawatt facility is fundamental to the future of the peat energy division. It not only meets the strategic objectives of fuel diversity and power generation but uses an indigenous energy resource.  In 1991, between gas and peat, the ESB found 44 per cent of its energy resources in Irish materials.  Bearing in mind the decline in capacity in coming years, that figure will decline to 11 per cent by 2001.  The European peat station will have the latest technology in thermal combustion and energy generating efficiency.  I welcome the decision of the EU Commission to approve in principle the injection of £21 million into this project.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has a very successful and innovative environmental division.  It has developed many new products and exploited the soakage capacity of peat.  This division has grown in turnover from £3 million to £5 million in two years and is expected to increase to over £10 million within years.  There are over 100 people employed by the board in the United States and the market shows tremendous potential for growth.</P>
    <P>It is essential the board takes a new direction and uses its valuable resources &mdash; land and skills &mdash; for major new developments.  It is involved in an extracting industry which is finite &mdash; the supply of peat left in commercially operated bogs will last approximately 30 years.  The company will have to change radically over the coming years, and bogs will have to be utilised for windpower and tourism.  The Minister said that approximately 2,000 people are employed by the board in the midlands, and I ask her for guarantees on Ballacorick power station, which has been a valuable asset to the people of Ballacorick, Bangor-Erris and Crossmolina.  That station has employed many people on both temporary and permanent bases since it was built.  The Minister did not mention it specifically, and although I <Col N="476" /> welcome the privatisation of Bord na Móna, I seek safeguards for that station to be put in place.</P>
    <P>What plans are being prepared to safeguard our raised bogs?  We need a debate on this matter. Bord na Móna has expanded and diversified in recent years into production of peat moss and horticultural exports and payroll costs have been halved.  There has been an 80 per cent improvement in the company's productivity.  I pay tribute to the commitment and partnership ethos of both management and workers.  I would like to see an employee shareholding option introduced by Bord na Móna, as this would put the workers on a par with those in other semi-State companies, cementing the excellent relationship between management and workers and help the company reach its full potential.  I wish the managing director, Mr. Paddy Hughes, and all the workers every success in this venture.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for her work on this Bill and to her predecessors, Deputy Dukes and Deputy Stagg.  It is surprising that the unanimity one would have expected for this Bill did not occur in the Dáil.  I am confident that there will be strong unanimous support here for this Bill as it is the aggregate work of this Minister and her predecessors.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to convert Bord na Móna from a statutory corporation into a company under the companies legislation, and this is a positive and innovative move.  It takes due account of the commercial nature of the company's operations in a highly competitive market. The Turf Development Act, 1946, which founded Bord na Móna, was a powerful, progressive piece of legislation for its time, but it now hampers the company in today's market of high efficiency, partnerships and strategic alliances.  Conversion to a PLC will enable the company and its subsidiaries to attract investment, to consider partnership arrangements and to generally facilitate the further development of its business activities, as well as providing scope for greater diversification. To survive, it cannot stand still and must have flexibility in its operations to take account of and to act in response to rapidly evolving market conditions. I agree with other speakers that Bord na Móna reaching a position of net worth is a great achievement.  The Minister has outlined the sometimes horrific experiences of the board before it arrived at that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> This phenomenal change in fortune is due in no small way to the workforce and management in partnership to turn the company's fortunes around.  The 1980s and early 1990s were a financial nightmare for Bord na Móna; and for me, as for others, the turning point was the appointment of Dr. Eddie O'Connor as chief executive in 1987. At that time the company's finances were a mess and getting worse.  He and his board found production levels continuing to fall and the financial performance getting worse.  He inherited the consequences of earlier commercial decisions which had turned out to be disastrous; the servicing of bank loans and overhead levels were crippling. The rescue programme put together was spectacular. Dr. O'Connor brought his board and the workforce's unions with him as he introduced self-directed work teams which maximised flexibility, and productivity levels were consequently improved.  The workforce was more than halved in that period from 4,500 to approximately 2,000 today.  Partnership in the workforce became a reality and was enhanced by the practice of rewarding workers on the basis of output, efficiency, and the quality of peat produced. There was investment in modern machinery and the cumulative effect was to turn the financial albatross of 1987 into the profitable concern Bord na Móna is today.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my utter disgust at the treatment meted out to Dr. O'Connor.  He successfully pioneered the first major restructuring of a commercial semi-State company and transformed the work culture and ethic within that company.  He had the courage of his convictions and spoke publicly about his philosophy and vision for the commercial semi-State sector.  His payment for such courage and vision was to be hounded from office by small minded and cowardly elements not fit to lace his commercial boots.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Connor's success was brought to fruition when the State finally decided to confront the board's historic debt problem.  As late as 1995-6, total borrowings were still in the region of £170 million and the company had a negative net worth in excess of £60 million.  A decision by the State to invest equity of £120 million, criticised by some, has been welcomed by almost all sides.  I join in the tributes to Mr. Paddy Hughes, Dr. O'Connor's successor, who has brought a very impressive record of service and a high degree of professional expertise to his new posting.</P>
    <P>On its foundation Bord na Móna was given responsibility for developing Ireland's bogs and providing the country with an indigenous energy supply.  As already pointed out, it was clearly intended by the then Minister, the late Seán Lemass, that it would develop along commercial lines.  Lemass stated that he was placing an obligation on the Turf Development Board to find a market for all its produce, which should be produced on an economic basis, something which is very important.  It is clear, therefore, that the company should be run on sound commercial lines and the Bill enhances its ability to realise <Col N="478" /> these commercial objectives.  Bord na Móna will become a holding company and its business and operations will be carried out by the new subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>The four main business activities are the peat energy division, the horticultural division, the solid fuels division and the environmental products division.  Sections 34 to 40 provide for the establishment of these divisions as separate limited liability subsidiaries under the Companies Acts.  The peat energy division supplies milled peat under contract to the ESB for electricity generation purposes.  Current projections show the annual quantities of milled peat expected to be consumed by the ESB will decline sharply over the next two decades, from approximately three million tonnes to a little over one million tonnes. On this basis, Bord na Móna would be unable to generate sufficient revenue from sales to remain viable.</P>
    <P>The major medium-term viability strategy, referred to by the Minister in detail, is integrally tied into the construction of the new state of the art 120 megawatt peat fired power station, namely, europeat.  The company needs to achieve minimum sales of three million tonnes of milled peat per annum over the next ten years and the construction of the new power station will facilitate this through an increase in annual peat consumption of approximately one million tonnes. The project is made more attractive by its inclusion in the national development plan and its qualification for £21 million in Structural Funds. I am reassured by the Minister that there is no difficulty or risk to this funding despite utterances from some quarters to the contrary.  I am aware that the Finnish Power From Peat group has been selected to build, own and operate the new peat powered plant in the east midlands, something the Minister referred to in detail.</P>
    <P>The other three divisions will operate as independent entities in the open market without any cross subsidisation.  As the Minister correctly stated, it is essential that the provisions being introduced be grounded on a solid pragmatic rather than ideological base so that these entities, through the board, have the necessary flexibility to respond to the increasing commercial complexities of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Up to last year the company's long-term borrowings were secured under Government guarantee. As a result of the equity investment and the provisions in the Bill, the board will have the necessary asset base and company structure to enable the holding company borrow on a commercial basis without Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>Strategic alliances and joint ventures will not only be possible but ultimately necessary.  Economies of scale will play an increasing role with larger sales and distribution systems effecting vital efficiencies and savings.  Alliances will promote access to funding and wider markets.  This will be particularly relevant to the solid fuel division. The domestic market no longer uses solid fuel as its main heating source.  The lower cost, <Col N="479" /> cleanliness and greater convenience of gas and oil have proven very attractive for householders.  The division must expand its market share, something it has already done on a number of occasions, even over the past year.</P>
    <P>The Minister, her predecessor and supporters of the Bill will be commended in the years ahead for facilitating the modernisation of this commercial semi-State organisation.  The provision of a modern company configuration as the last of four main pillars in constructing the board's future will significantly enhance its scope and prospects of achieving its potential through a more definitive commercial focus and will enable the board's commercial operations to continue to provide vital employment in communities and regions where it is badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his kind words and will not have time to do what I did last week.</P>
      <P>For a long time Bord na Móna has been a very sick company.  I do not approve of the method which this and the previous Government embarked upon to supposedly cure its problem. For many years the Oireachtas and semi-State bodies have been struggling with its problems. The company went from crisis to crisis and simply continued to incur debts which were guaranteed by the Government.  The chairman's statement in the last accounts issued by the company states that Bord na Móna is kept going by debt.  There is a genuine desire on the part of the Minister and others to resolve the problem and establish the company as a commercial body which can exist in the commercial world, although I am not sure this is possible.</P>
      <P>The fundamental flaw in the approach to the problem is that Bord na Móna is not really seen as a commercial body producing peat and turf but as a company with a social role.  In her speech the Minister referred to the social role of peat.  In the modern world a product can no longer be seen as having a social role.  I understand the political sensitivities of this for many people in all parties. As an employer Bord na Móna is viewed by politicians, almost by definition, as an employer rather than a producer, an inevitable view given the nature of politicians.  However, it is not the nature of the company and should not be the way in which the company is viewed.  The current and previous Bills ask us to ratify this attitude towards the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No longer is the debt of almost £200 million being guaranteed by the Government with Bord na Móna carrying on as if nothing was happening, but rather the debt is simply being paid off.  The payment is being cloaked in fancy words, as often happens nowadays, to confuse people.  In this case the term used is &ldquo;an equity injection&rdquo;, a wonderful phrase which simply means that the debt will <Col N="480" /> be paid off.  It sounds very pompous, as if the Government is doing something very noble&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and taking a serious, sophisticated commercial decision.  However, this has not happened.  Rather the Government, in two tranches, is giving the company £49 million one year and £51 million another year.  It is not, as described, an equity injection.  The money relieves the company from the right to pay off as much interest.</P>
      <P>Over the years Bord na Móna has been master of the concept of operating profit.  It is the only company which makes a consistent and disastrous loss every year but which manages to turn in an operating profit, something many people are fooled by.  The company says that were it not for all the interest it had to pay it would be making money.  However, this is true for all of us.  If we borrowed money and did not have to pay it back we would all make money; it is a simple concept. This is how Bord na Móna has been existing.  For years I have had arguments about this with Ministers, those on the board of the company and apologists for it.  The reality is that it has been living off other people's money, losing money hand over fist and declaring an operating profit. The company was living in a fairyland by saying that if it did not have to pay off the debt which resulted from borrowings it would be making money.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the future of Bord na Móna, to which the Bill or the Minister did not refer, whether it should exist and if the reason for its existence is the employment it gives rather than the profit it may be able to generate.  That is the difficulty.  If we continue to approach the semi-State companies with that particular motive as the priority, they will not exist without going from one crisis to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TEAM Aer Lingus is a classic case.  Media and political coverage and statements have concentrated on the 1,000 or 1,500 jobs which will be lost in TEAM Aer Lingus.  People forget that between £90 million and £100 million of taxpayers' money has been provided to keep those jobs, but the company is still losing money. TEAM Aer Lingus should have closed many years ago.  I may be wrong but I gather one Minister had the courage to suggest this at Cabinet. He was eaten alive by people who had different priorities and pressures.  Other Ministers at the Cabinet table &mdash; it was not this Government &mdash; said they could not live with it politically and would have to keep pushing TEAM Aer Lingus on and subsidising it.  Even to this day it is doubtful if TEAM Aer Lingus is making any money.  It may be making a small amount at the moment but that is at the height of the cycle and when the cycle turns, it will be back in deficit.  We are in a season in which it can make money and if it cannot do so, it never will.  The lack of commerciality <Col N="481" /> in semi-State bodies is apparent everywhere and nowhere more so than in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about EU funds.  It is my impression that Bord na Móna is still getting EU funds; I am not sure but I believe it is getting £21 million over a period.  It is difficult maintain that a company which has received £100 million as an injection to put it on a commercial basis &mdash; I do not believe it will &mdash; can justify still receiving money from the EU.  The money may be for a specific project but that is not the point.  If a specific project cannot stand on its own two feet, why should it get EU funds when it has already got £100 million?</P>
    <P>I have not seen any accounts in the past year and perhaps the Minister might indicate when they are due out.  The last accounts were issued this time last year and were signed in early July 1997.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with the delay in issuing accounts, a matter with which we dealt the other day.  I will be interested to know how Bord na Móna has been doing since it got part of this injection and how it has been affected by seasonality in recent years.  This is more a question for Committee Stage but there is a funny item in the accounts where two directors appear to have loans from the company for houses.  Is that normal in semi-State companies?  They are small amounts but it seems odd that directors in Bord na Móna should get special treatment for buying houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this legislation which we will support.  I would like to pick up on a point made by Senator Ross in respect of the Turf Development Bill and what it achieved.  By the lights of the time, it achieved an enormous amount.  It is true the activities which took place over an extended period were social in dimension, had a major national impact and were unprofitable.  However, by the lights of the time, that was what was needed in the communities in which the board existed.</P>
      <P>Part of the lack of profitability was probably caused by political factors as much as anything else.  If anybody even hinted that a briquette factory and anything else in an area might be closed, there was an immediate and unified response of outrage and horror.  The Government of the day responded to that and the board had to continue along its merry way adding to its losses and compounding its debt.  That was caused as much by political pressures as anything else and in the circumstances, it was probably appropriate for the political establishment to respond by taking the debt off the shoulders of the board, allowing it to operate commercially and get on with its work in a commercial way.  Given the circumstances of the late 1930s and 1940s and the need to produce turf from the bogs, it was appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriate response now is to have a commercial company which is modern, forward looking and can generate profits and would still be able to fulfil a social function in so doing.  The director of Lough Egish Co-operative said on one <Col N="482" /> memorable occasion that the co-operative had two purposes: one was a social purpose and the other was to make money and if it did not make money, it would not fulfil the social purpose but frequently it was put the other way around.  He was right about that.</P>
    <P>The activities of Bord na Móna are hugely important in County Kildare.  It is a matter of some satisfaction the board's headquarters are located in Newbridge.  I trust this was in response to the request I made when the 1990 Bill was passing through the House and I asked that the board's headquarters be located in Newbridge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and her colleague were well up to it.</P>
      <P>From a purely logistical point of view, the board did tremendous work over an extended period.  Its harvesting activities and the way it produced the peat was a huge and successful undertaking at the time.  We should acknowledge the work of these people and the management in the early years.  Until recently there was a monument in Newbridge to that activity during the Emergency when thousands of workers gathered in dormitory style buildings in Newbridge and went to work in the bogs.  They were heroes in their own right at a time when there was no Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>This Bill moves the board in the direction which is required in a modern society.  Like the 1990 Act, it is a major step.  The effect of the decline in the number of workers in the company has been extremely dramatic in parts of south Kildare, particularly the western part of the constituency, where a large number of people have lost their jobs in the past ten years not only in Bord na Móna but in the ESB and its associated activities.  That had a detrimental effect which was proportionately as severe as that experienced by the coalminers in Wales or by rural depopulation in parts of the west.  The positive aspect was that many skills were acquired as a result of the board's activities.  Many members of a family were employed by the board and they developed skills in the locality which are being put to good use.  The Minister referred to the new working procedures which operate, the teams and so on and the effect that has had on productivity.  That is a tribute to those living in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We reached a point where there was a £180 million debt around the board's neck and a negative net worth of £60 million.  In conventional terms, if the board was a going concern it would have been regarded as insolvent and would have had to be wound up.  If it had not been a State enterprise, it would have been wound up.  There <Col N="483" /> was the question of writing off the assets and investments made as a result of the oil crisis when people were projecting forward development based on that crisis and the debt became unsustainable from a commercial point of view.  The consultants confirmed that by saying a debt of £123 million was unsustainable.  I acknowledge the role played by Deputy Dukes and Deputy Stagg in injecting capital into the company.  This has been continued by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another factor has been the reduction in the price of milled peat.  When considering the relationship between the ESB and Bord na Móna it has always been difficult to decide which company has subsidised the other.  Was Bord na Móna charging too much for the peat it supplied, thereby reducing the profits of the ESB, or was the ESB getting the peat at the right price?  There was sometimes a difficulty in segregating the activities of the two companies.</P>
    <P>The construction of a new 120 megawatt europeat station in Clonbullogue is welcome.  I hope the ambitious time frame for construction will be met.  The target date of 2001 mentioned by the Minister must be met to draw down the funding of £21 million.  I hope all the planning procedures and construction work will take place on time to ensure the project will proceed and will create the 250 full-time and the extra 200 part-time jobs on the bogs and the 450 jobs in construction we hope for.</P>
    <P>The question of what the new plant will contribute by way of carbon dioxide emissions has received much attention.  The technology is now such that it is possible to greatly reduce these emissions.  It is also such &mdash; this was not stated in the Minister's speech &mdash; to ensure that power can be generated profitably from these plants because they are much more efficient than the older ones. In addition, sulphur emissions are in many ways more noxious than carbon dioxide emissions. Moneypoint springs to mind.  However, as a farmer, I welcome sulphur emissions because they contribute to crop health.  We would not have to spread sulphur based fertilisers.  It is unnecessary to do this in England because of the amount of sulphur emissions in the air.</P>
    <P>With regard to the division into four business activities, why is it necessary that they be stand alone activities or separate companies?  Why can they not be part of the overall parent company? This was raised by Deputy Dukes in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He set it up in that way; I could not get over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, Deputy Stagg appears to have taken a stance contrary to the one he took a short time earlier.  Perhaps something in the air in County Kildare causes us to take two contrary positions at the one time.  I hope I do not share that characteristic with my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned what might happen to the peat energy division in terms of the reduction <Col N="484" /> in the amount of peat which would be consumed other than by the introduction of the europeat station.  I believe the horticultural division has performed well.  Approximately 90 per cent of what it produces goes for export.  One does not question the merit of peat and its value for horticultural purposes, but environmentalists in Europe and Britain are becoming increasingly concerned about the use of what they regard as a scarce resource.  There may be calls for the use of alternative products.</P>
    <P>I welcome what has taken place with solid fuels, CDL, Suttons and Staffords.  It is important that the company, being a seller of fuel, should involve itself in other areas within that sector. However, the biggest potential is with the environmental products.  The Puraflow system has been strikingly successful.  The team of researchers in Newbridge is to be congratulated on the developments that have taken place.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a hugely versatile product in peat.  It has enormous potential.  There will be other uses which will develop over the years.  The questions of the cost of electricity &mdash; the Minister is aware of the key role this has in competitiveness &mdash; and of the contribution of the staff and management to the success of the activity are important.  I am glad of the plans to invest in Kilberry in south County Kildare.  Concerns were expressed about it, but it is very good for the manufacture of horticultural peat.</P>
    <P>There is a tourism potential with the bogs.  The cutaway and the use of them as wetlands must also be considered.  That is a debate for another day.  Peatland World in Lullymore is a valuable tourism asset.  There is talk that it may be closed down.  I do not know if it is the responsibility of Teagasc, Bord na Móna or the local community to keep it open.  However, I appeal that something be done to ensure that it continues to exist and that the heritage of the bogs and so on continues to be explained to people visiting that part of County Kildare, which is in the middle of the bogland areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators who have a strong constituency interest in this matter I welcome this Bill.  I followed its progress through the Dáil where most of my concerns were addressed. I will outline my remaining concerns later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Senator Ross has approached the debate from his perspective, we who know and appreciate the contribution of Bord na Móna to our areas have our perspective.  I am sorry he is not here.  I would like to bring him to the midlands to visit the various areas, show him what Bord na Móna has meant to us and tell him about the great celebration which occurred last year in Kilcormac to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the housing scheme there.  I would also like to show him all the small businesses, engineering companies, mechanical companies, small businesses and employers who learned their trade and grew out of Bord na Móna and the small industries and industries that <Col N="485" /> have developed based on the skills provided by the company.  I hope this would give him an appreciation of what the company means to us.</P>
    <P>There has been no lack of enterprise or innovation in Bord na Móna.  However, at times there has been a lack of opportunity for it to be expressed.  When opportunity has shown itself, whether it is in the innovation and production of new equipment, the development of the environmental side of the business, the support for and encouragement of the development of small business in the areas of its operation or the innovative and enterprising autonomous work groups which were established as part of the change of the company, Bord na Móna has been to the forefront of change at many times in its history.  Those of us who recognise its importance make no apologies for saying that employment has been, is and will continue to be a very important objective with regard to its activities.  Anybody seeking election to the Oireachtas in our constituencies who says employment in Bord na Móna was not important would not be successful.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the culmination of a long and difficult period of change for Bord na Móna.  It has secured the survival of the company and has left it much better to face the future.  When my colleagues in Dublin were confronting the crisis at TEAM Aer Lingus and when colleagues in other parts of the country were dealing with difficult problems of change, I always pointed out that in the midlands and other parts of the country Bord na Móna provided examples of where management and the workforce faced up to the reality and set out a strategy in dealing with it.  I join in complimenting all the members of management, workforce, boards of directors, the various Ministers and their officials who have been associated with this change, especially over the past decade.</P>
    <P>While the change has left the company fitter for the future it has been achieved at considerable human, social and economic cost in all our communities. I urge the Minister to look at this issue and do her best in the negotiations for EU funding on which the Government will embark to try to address the human, social and economic cost which we are still bearing.</P>
    <P>As members of Offaly County Council, Senator Moylan and I were recently involved in formulating a submission to the Midlands Regional Authority as part of its formulation of a submission for European support.  The facts and figures associated with the decline in Bord na Móna and ESB employment in west Offaly made stark reading.  The 1,500 lost jobs would be equivalent to the loss of 30,000 jobs in Dublin.  If 30,000 jobs were lost in Dublin, a national emergency would be declared.  We are still dealing with those job losses in the midlands in spite of the relative success of Bord na Móna and that fallout must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Other speakers spoke about the future of the industry; turf is a finite resource and Bord na Móna should be enabled and encouraged to diversify into the greatest possible number of <Col N="486" /> areas to ensure employment will continue to be provided in the future.  The Minister addressed that issue in her speech and the structures being put in place through this Bill will enable the company to attract the necessary investment to assist its diversification and ensure employment will continue to be provided even when peat runs out.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided a historical outline of why the changes in Bord na Móna were necessary. The reason Bord na Móna had to finance its development through bank borrowing was very simple &mdash; the shareholder did not put any money into the company.  Whether or not the recent equity investment was associated with the management of debt in the company, I am very pleased the State, as shareholder, faced up to its responsibility to invest in the company and enable it for the first time in its history to approach the future on a sound financial footing. No apologies must be made for that.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister's predecessors who worked in tandem with Bord na Móna in regard to the equity injection.  I want to mention my constituency colleague, Deputy Cowen, who was Minister when this was initiated and to place on record my appreciation for the attention which Deputies Spring and Quinn accorded to the representations I and others made seeking a response to the Bord na Móna submission. Deputy Quinn, then Minister for Finance, responded by approving the first tranche of investment in Bord na Móna.  I compliment the current Minister for ensuring the second tranche of funding was put in place.</P>
    <P>I understood the debt package amounted to £120 million, an injection of £100 million has been provided, but how is it proposed to manage the remaining debt?  I urge that flexible and favourable consideration be given in future to the issue of an employee share option in the company.  The Minister, given her experience in bringing the Telecom negotiations to a conclusion, will appreciate the value of such a scheme in any company. How will this legislation assist in implementing an employee share option scheme in Bord na Móna in the future?</P>
    <P>In spite of the relative success of Bord na Móna and europeat, the Minister is well aware of the severe difficulty being experienced in Ferbane, not far from her own constituency.  It is a shame to think that various Government Departments, including the Minister's own, and politicians from all parties have not done their best to resolve this issue.  The work forces in Bord na Móna and the ESB having initiated the proposal and the ESB board having put up £16 million for the job, it is a shame niggling matters which cannot be agreed at local level are standing in the way.  I regret the recent initiatives taken to attempt to facilitate agreement in this situation have been unsuccessful but I am confident the Minister, appreciating the problem from a local level, will do her utmost to ensure it is resolved.  Hopefully, investment in west Offaly which will benefit Bord na Móna and <Col N="487" /> the ESB will be drawn down and implemented as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Turf Development Bill is a very welcome piece of legislation which will allow Bord na Móna to operate in a modern, competitive Ireland.  To operate in such an environment it is essential that Bord na Móna be in a position to delegate core activities to its subsidiaries and have the power to enter joint ventures and transfer assets.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna is an outstanding example of success with a turnover of £140 million per annum and a strong and innovative management.  With a workforce in excess of 2,000 people, Bord na Móna is making a significant contribution to the economy of the midlands.  I do not speak from personal experience when I say that but any employer of that size would obviously be very important to a region.</P>
      <P>I listened with some amusement to Senator Ross's contribution.  I wish we lived in the kind of clinical environment in which he expects businesses to operate.  To deride an investment or equity injection of £100 million in an Irish owned employer whose profits are kept within the country is farcical.</P>
      <P>As with any organisation, it is vital to look to the future.  This Government is committed to the future of Bord na Móna and has already laid some foundations in this regard.  The Minister has outlined the measures being taken and I do not intend to go over old ground.  The operational restructuring of Bord na Móna is to be admired and the rationalisation of the workforce and implementation of new work practices are to be welcomed.  Change is always difficult and in an organisation which would have been perceived as particularly traditional, it could have proved especially difficult to bring workers and management along together towards the development of a successful business.  The self-directed work teams which have shown an increase of 80 per cent in the company's production levels since 1988 are examined and imitated by other organisations throughout the country.  The old ways went out the window when Bord na Móna considered restructuring.  Its management essentially took the bull by the horns in preparing the company for the future.</P>
      <P>The Government has addressed the debt problem in a focused and reasonable manner.  Any organisation can be crippled by debt and cannot survive in those circumstances.  The Government invested £100 million in the future of Bord na Móna and is to be complimented on that.  Its vision and the manner in which the investment was implemented is something of which we should be proud.  Bord na Móna is not getting a free ride or money for nothing.  The company must meet stringent objectives in order to ensure its continued viability and contribution to employment and the local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> Today's Bill is the third step in the strengthening of Bord na Móna's foundations.  It will allow the company to create the modern environment and necessary tools to compete in a modern environment.  The company has a number of platforms from which to do that, among them its peat and energy division, solid fuel division, horticultural section and environmental products section. The company's diversification is to be admired; the same company which produces the peat briquettes we burn and the peat moss we use in our gardens offers consultancy services abroad.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets the standards for Bord na Móna's continued contribution to the Irish economy. Bord na Móna will benefit substantially from this legislation.  Not only will the 2,000 people in the midlands benefit, the entire economy and the Government, as a shareholder in the company, will benefit.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Senator Burke asked about Bellacorick.  In the year 2000 Bord na Móna is to review the operation of a certain number of stations and Bellacorick is one of them.  I would like to see the station continue and I will bear the Senator's comments in mind.  Senator Liam Fitzgerald said that there are no bogs in his area but he is obviously interested in the subject.  His speech was studied and reflective.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross decried the social role of Bord na Móna.  I agree with Senator Cox's comments in that regard.  The Government no longer guarantees funding for Bord na Móna.  It must have an operating profit.  Senator Ross then asked if we still receive EU funds.  We received funds for the europeat station and they will come on stream when it is built.  He further inquired about loans to directors for housing.  The board provided housing, such as Waterford Bridge.  Moderate loans were issued to directors in the past but this practice has been discontinued.  In the past decisions were made which caused problems but we should now look to the future.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis displayed a great knowledge of the subject.  I have read about the conditions of turf workers in the 1940s.  They slept in bunks in spartan wooden huts.  A pub licence was granted at one such camp in County Kildare and people came to me recently seeking to revive the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator asked why the company must stand alone.  Europe does not want cross subsidisation. When we negotiated the State aid for Bord na Móna it was stressed that the company had to stand alone.  Last week the Court of Justice in Luxembourg decreed that the French aero industry will have to repay the 2 billion francs they received from the French government.  Aer Lingus, Air Italia and TAP, the Portugese airline, now face the same judgment.  The Commission is <Col N="489" /> to fight the action but it is a sobering thought. Governments cannot prop up public sector firms which are not viable.</P>
    <P>I welcomed Senator Gallagher's contribution.  I am interested in European funding for the midland region.  All the midland counties were proven to need greater assistance than areas which would have been deemed to be more depressed. The Taoiseach and I have discussed this informally and we will be pushing the issue as the figures now exist to prove that need.  The State faced up to its responsibilities here.</P>
    <P>In 1996-7, Bord na Móna made a net profit of £7.1 million and £4.8 million the year before.  The accounts for this year will be released in the next fortnight and I trust they will follow this improving trend.  There were bad times but the decision to inject equity managed to lift the industry.  As a result it focused and sorted itself out.  It is now doing modestly well.  When this Bill was being prepared the unions in the industry came to see me and they were very helpful.  Workers in Bord na Móna decided to sort out the industry themselves and they displayed great courage.  There is only £8.2 million left of the original £20 million debt.  Around £12 million has been paid back and the Minister for Finance should feel good about his home county when we put the case for repayment.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I wrote to the chairman of the ESB and told him that the situation in Ferbane is ridiculous.  The investment will be lost if the issue is not settled.  A sum of £16 million has been provided for necessary repairs in Ferbane.  That money has been available for months but there is a local difficulty due to the merging of two unions.  Some people are behaving in an obdurate fashion.  Through their own non-participation they may lose those funds.  I appeal to them to settle the issue.  Why are their peers not putting pressure on them?  It is they who stand to lose. Whatever their difficulties they can come to see me.  I will ask them what is the problem which is holding up an investment of £16 million.  I would not blame anyone for feeling frustrated.  I am extremely annoyed and frustrated by the lack of investment in the Midlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad on the developments in the Northern Ireland peace process since the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998.  It is just over two months since the Taoiseach addressed the Seanad on the Agreement, an occasion on which many Senators spoke in positive and helpful terms of the Agreement and the prospects which it had introduced for a new beginning in relations throughout these islands.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank Senators for their warm remarks during that debate.</P>
      <P>We are now started on the process of implementing the Agreement and it is opportune to have a further discussion on these matters before the summer break.  We have successfully passed the first two great milestones on the road leading from the Agreement towards a peaceful and stable future.  These were the referenda on 25 May and the first elections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly last Thursday.  Both were truly historic occasions.  On the morrow of the Agreement they appeared to many as very difficult hurdles to be surmounted and indeed were seen by opponents of the Agreement as opportunities to destroy the balanced compromise from whose creation they had absented themselves.  In the event, both the referenda and the Assembly elections have delivered a firm rejection of the politics of intransigence.</P>
      <P>The referenda on 25 May were exciting occasions for all of us who believe in democratic constitutional politics as the only way to resolve our differences.  As a key element in the construction of the new negotiating process, both the Irish and British Governments had long made clear that the outcome of the talks would be put to the people for their approval.  I am convinced that this open and democratic approach helped the parties to the negotiations to take the risks and make the compromises necessary by neutralising any charge that they were making deals behind the backs of their electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The referendum campaign was long and vigorous. Every household in Ireland received a copy of the Agreement and, judging by phone calls and correspondence to my Department, people read it carefully and made up their minds on what it meant and how they reacted to it.  Their verdict was an overwhelming &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the British-Irish Agreement and the new future it made possible. <Col N="491" /> In this jurisdiction 94 per cent voted yes.  In Northern Ireland, although almost all sections of the community were asked to make significant compromises and to move away from their old certainties, 71 per cent of a very high turnout voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It was widely reported that many people who had neglected to vote for years had come out to vote for their future and support the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The size of the majority in the South was gratifying. It put beyond doubt the overwhelming approval of the people for the approach of successive Irish Governments and its outcome in the Agreement.  An equally important factor for me and for all who regard themselves as Irish Nationalists was that the two referendums on 25 May provided the first opportunity since 1918 for all people on this island to vote together on their political future.  Across the island, some 85 per cent of people approved the Agreement.  As I and others made clear at the time, it is no longer possible, if it ever was, for those who continue to regard violence as a means to enforce their political will on others of a different belief to claim to be acting on behalf of Ireland or the Irish people. On the contrary, anyone who resorts to violence is acting against the clearly expressed will of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>After the referendum, the Northern parties moved directly into the campaign for the first Assembly elections, on which the dust is only now beginning to settle.  This exhausting pace, for both politicians and voters, was dictated by the Agreement and by the concern of all parties to maintain the momentum built up in the talks and not to leave the field free over the summer for those who prefer to fan the flames of sectarian confrontation. It was unfortunate, but perhaps related to some degree to election fatigue and competing attractions, that some of those new voters who came out in May to endorse the clear principle of the Agreement did not feel similarly motivated in June.  Nonetheless, the electorate delivered a solid vote in favour of the British-Irish Agreement. Despite the lower turnout, roughly three quarters of the electorate voted for parties favouring the Agreement, a higher percentage than the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum.  As David Trimble said, we would have all preferred a more decisive vote in favour of the pro-Agreement Unionist parties in the election.  There is no doubt that the electoral mathematics have delivered a tighter situation on the Unionist side of the new Assembly than we might have hoped for.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to keep a proper perspective on the results, as Mr. Trimble has done. Despite serious concerns among their supporters about some elements of the Agreement and concerted attacks from other Unionist parties, the UUP vote held up extremely well.  In such divisive circumstances, the Ulster Unionist Party leadership of Mr. David Trimble, Mr. John Taylor, Mr. Ken Maginnis and their colleagues have done a remarkable job in bringing the great <Col N="492" /> bulk of their supporters with them.  If we had been able to foresee a year ago such a degree of support for an inclusive multi-party settlement in a community which has traditionally been extremely wary of compromise and change, we would have been very satisfied.  It also emphasises the courage shown by the UUP leadership in endorsing the Agreement in April and sticking with it since then.  It might have been easier in the short term to side with those who loudly denounced any compromise, but that would have been to ignore the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the Nationalist side, both the SDLP and Sinn Féin are to be congratulated on their electoral performances and on the way in which they brought their supporters along with them.  For John Hume and Séamus Mallon, the increase in the party's vote, its number of seats in the Assembly and its achievement for the first time ever of winning the highest vote in a Northern Ireland election are a well deserved tribute and reward for their unflinching espousal for over 30 years of dialogue and compromise as the only way to bring together the two great traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>For Sinn Féin, the cohesion of the party's vote is a testament to the party leadership's remarkable success in explaining to its supporters the changed political landscape in which they are now operating.  Sinn Féin and its electorate have had to travel a substantial distance to reach the ground where we now stand.  The acceptance by the great majority of the republican movement of democratic politics as the only way to pursue their political objectives has represented a quantum shift in Irish politics and was a critical factor in creating the opportunity for a lasting peace which we have today.  It is clear, judging by the 2 per cent increase in Sinn Féin's vote, that those republican groups attempting to continue or initiate campaigns of violence have virtually no public support.  Their sterile and hopeless political stance is shown by their appalling efforts at both the referendum and the election to use the very occasion on which the people expressed their political verdict to try to increase division and conflict.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that two of the smaller parties who played a highly active and very positive role in the multi-party negotiations have made the breakthrough to be represented in the Assembly.  The plain speaking and openness to new ideas of David Ervine, Billy Hutchinson and their colleagues in the PUP points towards a fresh, non-sectarian approach on behalf of working-class unionism.  I am also glad that the dynamism and moderation which the fresh perspective of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition brought to the negotiations will also be brought to bear on the work of the Assembly.  Both parties have actively championed the Agreement which they helped produce and I am sure both will make a valuable and positive contribution to the new Assembly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> I am disappointed that the Ulster Democratic Party and Labour, two parties which made an active contribution to the talks, will not be represented in the Assembly.  Like others who took part in the talks, I have great respect for the commitment of Gary McMichael and his UDP colleagues to democratic politics which they demonstrated repeatedly during the talks.  I am sorry David Adams did not succeed in winning a seat in the Assembly.  He made a huge and important contribution to the peace process and I look forward to the continuation of that in other ways. His support is important.  It is unfortunate that they will not have the opportunity to express their viewpoint in the Assembly, but I hope they will continue the work of bringing about the new society towards which they have worked for so long.  My door will always be open to them.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of John Alderdice to the making of the British-Irish Agreement and to the many years of preparations which led to it.  While Lord Alderdice may have decided that the moment was right to step down as leader of the Alliance Party, I am sure he will continue to make an important contribution to the political life of Northern Ireland for many years to come.</P>
    <P>With the outcome of the referendums and the election, ownership of the Agreement now clearly belongs to the people who have endorsed it in such overwhelming numbers and no longer just to those who negotiated it.  It has become the framework within which all of us must operate if we believe in democracy and accept the verdict of the ballot box.  I believe many people who were unable to support the Agreement in the referendum because of sincerely held concerns about elements of it, or because they were not convinced it could work, will now accept it and will work for its success.  It was especially revealing that even those parties implacably opposed to the Agreement felt it necessary to tell their voters in the election that they would try to promote their views within the Assembly rather than wrecking it as they had previously said.  That is a major advance.</P>
    <P>As time moves on and the Agreement is implemented, I am convinced many of those who have felt unable to support it thus far will realise that the Agreement threatens no one.  Senators need no reminder of its provisions which were extensively discussed in the House and I stress that, under the British-Irish Agreement, the future of Northern Ireland will be given back to the people who live there and that the Irish and British Governments and the many Governments abroad who wish us well in this enterprise will recognise the verdict of the people in this regard.</P>
    <P>This has been an exhausting political season, running directly from the protracted negotiations into the referendum and then into the Assembly elections.  It is not over yet.  As many Senators pointed out in the debate in April, the British-Irish Agreement does not represent the end of the process but the starting point from which we must work.  In the spirit of the times, we are <Col N="494" /> beginning the second half and everything is still to play for.  With the election of the members of the Assembly, we can now begin the work of making a reality of the architecture and relationships carefully designed in the Agreement.  Some areas of it were elaborated in detail while others were sketched out or signposted, but all will require effort, willingness and active engagement on the part of all participants to make the whole package work.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement was negotiated as a carefully balanced package and it must be implemented as such.  Just as in the negotiations, each participant must live up in good faith to the commitments it made in respect of the elements it was unhappy with if it expects others to similarly accept the elements which are most dear to it.</P>
    <P>The next step comes upon us immediately with the first meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly tomorrow.  Following the election results, we can expect difficult issues and hard talking to arise there, perhaps right from the start, but we should not be discouraged by this.  As I said in my statement welcoming the conclusion of the election:</P>
    <P>Democracy is by nature a competitive process. The gift of the new Assembly and its institutions is that it removes that competition from the streets and harnesses its energy within the agreed terms of democracy and its standards of fairness and equality.</P>
    <P>We should also remember as the parties take their seats tomorrow that this is the first ever occasion on which all shades of political opinion in Northern Ireland will sit down together and try to work out their future in political debate.  Much of the responsibility for implementing the Agreement passes, as it should, to the politicians elected by the people of Northern Ireland to the Assembly.  The first task will be the election of a Presiding Officer and then of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  After that many tasks fall to be decided by the parties in the Assembly. The centralised organs of Government under which Northern Ireland has been administered during direct rule must be recast to provide for devolved Government under the democratic control of the Assembly and up to ten Ministers in the new shadow Executive.  The Assembly must flesh out the provisions of the Agreement relating to itself and agree standing orders and working methods.  The North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council must be established and, by 31 October, as laid down in the Agreement, the shadow Executive and the Irish Government must have negotiated and agreed the initial list of North/South implementing bodies which are to be set up.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial body of work by any standards and we all want to see it move ahead as quickly as possible.  We recognise, of course, that very few in the new Assembly will have any experience at governmental level and that the procedures and safeguards to ensure that neither <Col N="495" /> community can dominate the other may cause occasional delays.  However, every effort must be made to ensure that there is no slippage in the timescale set out in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Following 31 October the two Governments will move as quickly as possible to enact any necessary legislation for the establishment of the Ministerial Council and the implementing bodies. This will involve substantial work by, in this jurisdiction, the Government and the Oireachtas and we have tentatively targeted January or February 1999 to complete this task.  Once all this architecture is in place the British-Irish Agreement will come into force, which itself will trigger the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution which were approved by the people in the referendum in April.  At that stage, which I hope will be February 1999, the British-Irish Agreement will be fully operational.</P>
    <P>That is the rough timetable, as accurately as I can give it for Senators at this time, for the institutional elements of the Agreement.  There are, of course, other important elements to the overall package which must be progressed in parallel to these.  These include the new Policing Commission whose task, as set out in the Agreement, is to bring forward proposals &ldquo;to ensure . that Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy widespread support from . the community as a whole.&rdquo; I would like to pay a very warm tribute to one of our distinguished and most thoughtful and gifted colleagues, Senator Maurice Hayes, who has been appointed a member of the Commission.  Other elements of the package are the provisions for the reform of the criminal justice system, enhanced protection of human rights, release of prisoners, support for victims, de-escalation of security measures and decommissioning of weapons.  These are all essential elements for the creation and support of a normal and peaceful society in Northern Ireland within which the political structures can begin to work to break down the barriers between the two communities which 30 years of violence have so greatly heightened.</P>
    <P>Although much of this programme falls to be enacted within Northern Ireland, Senators will appreciate that in areas such as the implementing bodies and the new Human Rights Commission a great deal of work arises for the Government and the Oireachtas.  The Government is also jointly concerned with the British Government to oversee and support the overall implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>This work will involve the skills of many different Departments and the Government has set up an interdepartmental steering group chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs to co-ordinate this effort.  The steering group brings together the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the office of the Attorney General and other Departments as necessary, to examine and plan for the programme of action falling to be carried out in this <Col N="496" /> jurisdiction to implement the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>As Members know, the Government has decided, with the general support of all parties, to signal its strong commitment to the complete implementation of the Agreement by introducing legislation to cover the scheme of accelerated releases, even though this might perhaps have been done using existing powers.</P>
    <P>As a result of the election campaign we are all aware that there are still people who do not wish the Agreement to succeed.  Many obstacles will be placed in our path as we try to ensure that it does succeed.  The first challenge we face may be the resolution of the question of the Drumcree parade which the Parades Commission yesterday ruled could go ahead but could not use the Garvaghy Road.  In recent years, this issue has repeatedly led to serious disruption and increased polarisation between the communities.  It is my fervent hope that in the atmosphere of partnership and reconciliation in which the British-Irish Agreement was negotiated and approved by the people, this will not recur.  Again, I urge all concerned, be they residents or marchers, to act with restraint and goodwill in the interests of stability and harmony.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am conscious that in the past political initiatives in Northern Ireland have failed because they were not implemented and followed through with the same vigour, determination and imagination as were shown in their devising.  We are determined that this will not happen on this occasion and that the once in a generation chance represented by the British-Irish Agreement will not be allowed slip.  Success will depend on maintaining the factors which led to the Agreement &mdash; the unity and common purpose of the two Governments in promoting compromise and agreement, the support of the international community and above all the will of the parties themselves to secure a peaceful future for all in Northern Ireland.  After 30 years of conflict, peace must not be taken for granted.  The Irish Government will continue to do everything in its power to make this a just, productive and permanent peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is always welcome to the House and I welcome him this evening.  He is, perhaps a very lucky politician.  In the later part of his career he has been given a historic opportunity to be closely involved in events which will change and are changing the political landscape of this country.  The Minister has shown himself equal to this challenge and has played an important, constructive and worthy part in the events which we are in part celebrating and in part seeking to progress further in the direction which all of us desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given us an interesting and detailed outline of the timetable of events and the scale of the challenges we now face.  In one sense he has shown how far we have come from the euphoria after the British-Irish Agreement followed <Col N="497" /> by the extraordinary endorsement of the Agreement, to the detailed discussion of where to go next.  The momentum is being kept up and events are happening more or less according to plan.  All of us would like to think that in two years from now, when we are having a debate on Northern Ireland, we will be discussing boring things like roads, schools and hospitals and that the process of political normality will have gone that major step further so that constitutional and institutional items are not the only ones on the agenda.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister in praising those he singled out for praise.  I particularly praise the courage of David Trimble, John Taylor and my old friend, Ken Maginnis in facing down the naked hostility of people who are best suited to destroy and pull down.  They have faced up to that and signed onto the Agreement.  They made hard decisions and are showing themselves to be people of their word with the courage to stand by their word.</P>
    <P>Likewise, there is no need to add to our words of praise for John Hume and Séamus Mallon, the architects of the Agreement.  They have been pointing out for decades many of the elements which are now part of the Agreement.  The Minister and I are long-term friends of the SDLP; we travelled to the North to help that party when few others did so.  On many occasions the obituaries of the SDLP were written.  We were told that party did not have a proper organisation or coherent structure and that it would die away.  It is comforting to see the strong electoral performance of the SDLP, to see its new candidates coming forward and to know that there is an organisation in place which will sustain the party in its role as the leading Nationalist party in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin also deserves to be complimented. That party has shown a capacity to operate electoral politics extremely successfully.  It was possibly the best organised party in the election.  I hope it will adapt equally well to parliamentary politics.  There is a difference between electoral and parliamentary politics but I hope that Sinn Féin, having seen how well it can do within the political and electoral process, will adapt equally well to parliamentary politics.</P>
    <P>Many others were mentioned by the Minister. All Members salute the courage and sanity of Lord Alderdice and his party over many years and the efforts of David Ervine and of the Women's Coalition.  All played a part in bringing us to where we are today.</P>
    <P>However, many hard decisions have still to be taken and many hurdles must be overcome. Nobody, even in the euphoria following Good Friday and after the referendum, expected that things would be easy.  Everybody is aware of the capacity of Mr. Paisley and Mr. McCartney to be negative and destructive, to say no in an infinite variety of ways and to pull things down.  Even at an early stage some people suspected that Mr. Donaldson might have his own agenda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> Everybody knew the parades would be a problem; they are still a problem which must be overcome. Sadly, many people in Northern Ireland are inventive and skilled at reinventing and recycling grievances.  We heard many of their voices in recent days seeking to be negative and to avoid yielding an inch to the other, despite the different circumstances which now obtain.  There are people in Northern Ireland who do not want a settlement and who prefer to nurse and live on their grievances.</P>
    <P>This and much more was known when the Agreement was signed.  However, it is also known that the structure around which the Agreement operates and through which it will be implemented is extremely sound, sounder than anything that existed in the past.  Lessons have been learnt from the mistakes of Sunningdale, particularly by the British Government.  This Agreement has been endorsed and there is no viable alternative.  Virtually all groups in Northern Ireland now accept the political way forward.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is at the stage where this country was in 1927 when the Fianna Fáil Party entered the Dáil, bringing Civil War differences into the realm of parliamentary politics and ensuring that future differences would be worked out the parliamentary way through the apparatus, principles and conventions of politics.  Northern Ireland is now at that stage.  For the first time all shades of political opinion are sitting in the same parliament and are willing to work that parliament. The two Governments are also committed to that process.</P>
    <P>The elections showed that the majority of people in Northern Ireland want to make the Agreement work.  Some people do not, but the important factor is the fact that the majority do. It is not a small majority but a large one.  We are not in the business of preaching to the people of Northern Ireland but there is a clear message from this process.  Those who believe in the Agreement and who are committed to making it work, especially in the early difficult stages, must work together.  What unites them, their belief in the Agreement as the only way forward, is far more profound than the differences between them.  The differences on aspects of policy, matters about which the parties in these Houses disagree, can come later.  What is important is that all who believe in the Agreement do everything they can to help it put down deep roots.  That means, above all, that they must be prepared to compromise, as they have been in the past few months.  Things can only work if there is broad agreement at this stage.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is an odd political entity. When we see the huge worldwide media attention which the North receives, it is easy to think of it in terms of a major global trouble spot.  However, it is only a small landmass.  The problems of its people are no different from those of people in the Republic.  They are the ordinary, everyday problems of politics.  The people who represent the political parties in the Assembly comprise a <Col N="499" /> cross section of ordinary people.  They include teachers, doctors, farmers, barristers, one or two accountants, the unemployed, academics and people who were part of the terrorist process up to five or ten years ago.  With the exception of the latter, the members of the Assembly are broadly representative of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland should never forget it is a heavily subsidised part of the world which has absorbed the energies of two sovereign Governments over a period of 30 years.  The problem it must resolve is the problem of living and working together.  It should not be beyond its representatives. However, the key point is that it will only be successful this time if the centre holds together.  That centre comprises the Unionist Party, the SDLP and those who believe that the Assembly is the way forward.  If the centre holds, as I believe it will, the Agreement will work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of Ireland both North and South have, through the democratic process, resoundingly expressed their wish for peace.  Last Friday saw the reinforcement of this wish.  It was a day when the people of Northern Ireland went to the polling booths and ignored the retrospective dogma of those who have long deprived the people of the treasure of hope.</P>
      <P>Such dogma is the dated language of the expiring, not the aspiring.  Northern Ireland has long been a political backwater for the politicians who ventured there and hence for its people.  This Government and its leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, will be recorded in history as the surgeon who used the scalpel to heal and left no scar.  His predecesssor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was the physician who accurately diagnosed the disease.  Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, David Ervine and others proved to be good patients, but the champion of the patients must be David Trimble.  If ever a man in his political life has taken a risk and yet remained true to his beliefs, it is he.  This has shown his outstanding courage.  He has taken a step forward, unlike those before him who have chosen intransigence and retrenchment rather than advance and persistence with their emotional rhetoric rather than speaking with the voice of harmony.  I hope it will earn David Trimble the prize of being the first Minister for Northern Ireland in the new Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of reality, this is a long mile ahead and it will, I am sure, be a vicissitudinous journey with its own new perils.  These perils will take many forms.  We have splinter groups who are attempting to keep the gun in Irish politics. There are those who will use the ballot box and the gun and there are those who will endeavour to hijack and desecrate the democratic process. But the people have spoken and they have spoken with a loud and clear voice.  They defiantly say &ldquo;We do not want your violence, we do not want your intransigence, we want peace, we want harmony, we want to work with our fellow <Col N="500" /> citizens where we all can aspire to our own political goal and achieve the same by persuasion rather than coercion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the very near future the acid test will be in the laboratory when the Orangemen will wish to march and exercise their democratic right to walk the highways of Northern Ireland.  I appeal to those who oppose these marches, albeit the contentious marches have been few in number, to say now is the time for conciliation and to hold out the hand of friendship.  The Parades Commission has spoken and I have no doubt the law will be enforced, but I fear passions will be enflamed. Surely a gesture can be made at this very critical time.  This is a very sensitive issue and the past two years at Drumcree have left very deep wounds on many people on both sides of the community. The Protestant community in Northern Ireland see the right to march as their traditional right, a right born of their heritage.  People must understand the tenderness of the nerve when they perceive themselves to be deprived of their traditional means to express their heritage.  On the other hand we have the Nationalist community who feel they are being caged in their houses for the purpose of allowing the Orangemen to march and taunt and to flaunt triumphalism.  At the same time they feel the might of Great Britain is thrown against them.</P>
    <P>These two points of view gives rise to an explosive situation which has come to be known as the &ldquo;Portadown powder keg&rdquo;.  The voice of reason must prevail and Northern Ireland is on course for disaster over these marching weeks if these issues are not addressed.  Compromise is the order of the day and should not be viewed as defeat.  Compromise is not a policy of the weak but of those who hold strength.  I plead with all concerned to have dialogue to generate understanding. Both traditions have righteousness on their side but it is a matter of understanding each others reasons for conviction.</P>
    <P>The picture is not all doom and gloom.  What have we achieved against all the predictions?  We have achieved a unique accord signed by two sovereign Governments, by all the political parties save two, by those representing both traditions and those who have been actively involved and victims of the troubled years of Northern Ireland. We now have a man who has been a voice of reason for many years in Northern Ireland, John Alderdice, Lord Alderdice, who has recently been appointed to chair this new Assembly.  This is a man of high calibre, high integrity and deep understanding of all shades of opinion, an articulate man whom I respect greatly.  I wish him every success with this historic and herculean task.</P>

      <P>I would like to dwell for a moment on the opportunities that are becoming available to Northern Ireland as a result of the British-Irish Agreement.  The image of a terrorist state is beginning to alleviate itself.  The reality is <Col N="501" /> that there is a well educated and motivated loyal workforce waiting for employment and that is now becoming believable.  The fear of the executive of being branded a lunatic if he recommended investment in Ulster to his board is now abating.  The opportunities to build substantial internationally accepted companies will be lost for a long time, if not forever, as will the foregoing opportunities, if we get violence and counter violence in the coming months.  The likelihood of political pressure being put on David Trimble by others who wish to torpedo the political progress and the democratic Assembly is great.  I say to you all, hold out the hand of friendship and speak the voice of reason.</P>
      <P>I now revert to the opportunities that are available in the current political climate.  I say to those who are synthesising this Assembly: seek and insist on fiscal autonomy.  Scotland has partly achieved this and Northern Ireland needs it as an incentive to attract real industry and investment. Focus on these issues and many of our political difficulties will resolve themselves.  The time is right now for real cross-Border co-operation.  Let us hope that these proposed new institutions, or cross-Border bodies as they are called, will become a reality and that they will induce real co-operation and utilise the many strengths that exist both North and South.</P>
      <P>I have spoken many times in this House regarding the necessity for co-operation between the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland and the veterinary school at UCD.  To date my suggestions have fallen on deaf ears in the North. I can only believe that this silence was for political reasons.  What I proposed was that the Department of Agriculture or some other Northern Ireland body would make a financial contribution towards the development and maintenance of the veterinary school at UCD.  In return, some places would be guaranteed for veterinary students from the North.  There is no veterinary school in the North and any student wishing to study for this profession either has to go to England or come south.  I receive many letters and other forms of representation complaining about the lack of spaces for students.  Education is one area that transcends political divisions.  I urge the UK Government and the Department of Agriculture in the North to again examine this proposal closely.  I would also ask the Northern Irish public representatives to make representation in this regard, and if a cross-Border body is organised then this topic should be at the top of its agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is accepted or not, &lsquo;eurocreep&rsquo; is a reality.  Europeanisation is a reality.  It will change our circumstances and hence our attitudes.  The youth of the North have clearly expressed their wish to become part of an international society and shed the burden that bore down their forebears. It is heartening to receive the message from these young people, particularly through the democratic process afforded to them.  For the first time in their life they can experience real politics <Col N="502" /> and have been given an opportunity to express their wishes.  Those who would wish to be intransigent or dogmatic in respect of the ancient regime should take note that things will change, people want change and society wants change. Northern Ireland, indeed Ireland as a whole, is an integral part of Europe.  Our youth are forward thinking, they will no longer tolerate those who wish to destroy and stunt equality in their future, a right to which they are so wholly entitled.</P>
    <P>We owe this to the youth of the future.  We also owe much to the many people who gave their time and effort to solving the problems in this country.  I will not name all those concerned and I plead forgiveness if I do not mention some people who feel they have made an enormous contribution.  The Members of this venerable House of all shades of politics have over the years contributed greatly to pouring oil on troubled waters by their silence on occasions, their understanding and their temperate speeches.</P>
    <P>As the Front Bench spokesman on Northern Ireland, they have made my position easy by their consideration.  I ask them to continue to understand, as they have done in the past, that there are four societies in Northern Ireland, the Nationalist, the Unionist, those on both sides who want to heal the rift and those who wish to stir up trouble and create anarchy.  I ask Members to help and understand those who are trying so hard at this time in their political lives and who are living on a knife edge.</P>
    <P>There is also the very emotive issue of prisoners and the families who lost loved ones and those who were the victims of the troubles.  There is also the issue of the decommissioning of firearms. This is a red herring.  As John Hume has said on many occasions, what is the point of decommissioning if one can recommission a few weeks later?  What is really needed is the will to go forward, to succeed and understand and the strength to forgive.  The people of Ireland have given much in their long history.  I ask them one more time to give and together we will win for all.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the various people who have been involved in the successful outcome to date, particularly the Minister and his staff.  However, one person requires to be mentioned and that is Dr. Mo Mowlam.  We have been extraordinarily lucky in having a Northern Secretary of her calibre.  She behaved with extraordinary integrity, decency and balance when the British gutter press attacked her on a personal basis.  Apparently, it did not realise she was undergoing severe medical treatment.  She is a remarkable woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested by the paeans of praise that have been cast in the direction of Mr. David <Col N="503" /> Trimble and Mr. Gary McMichael.  This indicates that there has been a historic shift.  I cannot imagine this type of attitude being displayed five years ago.  As long as it brings in people and helps to take the gun out of Irish politics, I welcome it. However, I remember their backgrounds.  I recall Mr. David Trimble's extraordinary intransigence. He is no saint and we are not doing him any good by pretending otherwise.  The Rev. Ian Paisley quoted Mr. Gerry Adams saying &ldquo;well done, David&rdquo;, so sometimes our support can be counterproductive.  Even in the euphoria of the post-Agreement situation, it is important that we are balanced and remember and instruct ourselves on the past.</P>
    <P>The result of the referendum and the Assembly elections were historic.  Although one would have preferred a much stronger vote for the more flexible and pragmatic form of unionism, at least the two results were enormously satisfactory.  They end the absolute intransigence of mainstream unionism and they are historic for that reason alone.  They also finally put paid to any pretensions on the part of people such as the Thirty-two Counties Solidarity Committee, Ruairi Ó Brádaigh and Kevin Boland.  They have no legitimacy now.  They can forget about the 1919 Dáil election because the people of Ireland, North and South, have spoken unequivocally.</P>
    <P>It was a democratic result.  I heard Bernadette Sands-McKevitt and others saying it was not democratic and one must go back to nonsensical apostolic dissent from 1919.  This is plain nonsense. The people of Ireland are those who are alive now and living and experiencing these conditions. It does not matter a damn what people 70 years ago may or may not have thought about a spurious interpretation of their wishes <i>post facto.</i>  The people of Ireland have spoken and their voice must be listened to by anybody who regards himself or herself as a democrat.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the RUC.  If we are paying tribute to politicians, including some who have dubious ancestry in terms of violence, I wish to say that I have the greatest respect for the majority of RUC people.  They got it in the neck from both sides and on most occasions they behaved decently.  There were some regrettable incidents and I placed on record my dissociation from those events.  However, the RUC did its best in very difficult times and had among its members some honourable people.</P>
    <P>When accusations of sectarianism are levelled at it, we should remember that the IRA specifically targeted Catholic people who joined and then hypocritically complained that there were not enough Catholics in the RUC.  The same type of accusations of prejudice have been made in the South by the same sources against our police force whom they are happy to shoot in the back. Despite the fact that there are problems with some aspects of the RUC, having been a target for paramilitaries on both sides, it is time to salute <Col N="504" /> the honourable record of many people in the RUC.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a proper resolution of the business in Drumcree.  I stated previously that the British Army should have gone in, but I favour flexibility on both sides.  I understand the march is without bands and goes from a church.  It is silly and regrettable and people in the South do not understand the devotion to such events. However, perhaps a little imagination should be shown.  Nevertheless, Orange Order services should not be held in churches of the Church of Ireland of which I am a practising member because the order is based on a particularly nasty and unchristian form of sectarianism.  Until that type of sectarianism is rooted out and we refuse to give it any legitimacy, we will not have the type of peace we all desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the tributes to those who have been involved in the long and tortuous search for peace.  It has not been fully achieved yet but those who have taken us so far down this road should be recognised.  I wish to add a number of names to those already mentioned.  Deputy Albert Reynolds is ignored to an extent now that he is out of office.  Whether we approved at the time, he was the architect of the process and I am the first to admit that I thought some of the things he did were mistaken.  However, it was done with the best of faith and whatever has been achieved is greatly to his credit.  His part will be recognised in the years to come.</P>
      <P>I also recognise the role played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He is from a Nationalist background but he has the authority to hold out the hand of friendship to those who come from a different background.  He did this from a position of strength and with a liberal outlook which was vital in the circumstances in which he found himself in recent times, particularly in his dealings with moderate Unionist opinion.  I salute his work.</P>
      <P>The role of the Fianna Fáil Party should also be recognised.  This does not come easily to me but I am aware of the difficulties members of the party had with some of the measures taken recently, particularly on Articles 2 and 3, extradition and other elements of the Agreement which run counter to the tradition of Fianna Fáil.  We have managed in this part of the country to cross the narrow party political barriers which often divide us, but which are so insignificant compared with this issue that they do not really matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton deserves great recognition for what he did when in office.  I particularly appreciate his courage last night in saying in barely coded language that he thought a gesture was necessary and should be taken to help the Unionist position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing this weekend not just the first test, but the possibility of the end of this initiative unless it is faced properly.  It is a time when those of the Nationalist viewpoint might recognise the <Col N="505" /> extraordinary but immediate political difficulties faced by the Leader of the Unionist Party and might make a gesture which would help him carry moderate opinion with him in the weeks to come. I hope the Government will take that measure on board.  We will never know what is happening behind the scenes &mdash; I do not want to know what is happening &mdash; but I hope a sympathy for, and recognition of, the difficulties in which the Unionist leader finds himself will be acted upon. Some support should be given to him which would recognise that courage and prevent the process from collapsing.</P>
    <P>It is important that the crises which are coming in three particular areas should be recognised. Decommissioning is a crisis for some members of the community and we should not be content to let it meander on in the two years allowed for it until we face that crisis down the road.  There must be a move on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Those who still engage in terrorist activities should be taken out and dealt with severely, including the possibility of interning them.  There is no place in this post Agreement atmosphere for terrorists to take up arms on any side against either this State or the state in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The cross-Border bodies will obviously be a crux.  We will have to recognise the difficulties faced by the Unionist community when they are voted on and established.  We must hold out a great deal of sympathy and understanding in that regard.</P>
    <P>The jury is still out on Sinn Féin.  We must ask it to make a full and final declaration that the terrorist war is over.  The suspicion which lurks in the minds of many on the other side that it is holding its guns for only one purpose must be allayed.  The Irish Government and those of us who exert any influence down here should use our influence to help that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the remarks made about the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is my constituency colleague.  He has always had a great deal of respect.  Senator Manning described this as the later part of his career.  I do not know exactly what he meant by that &mdash; perhaps he was giving us a clue about what is going to happen after the next election.  The last time the House debated Northern Ireland the Minister's ears should have been burning because of the well deserved praise heaped on him.</P>
      <P>All of us who rejoiced in the framing of the British-Irish Agreement last April were in no doubt about the difficult path which lay ahead. Quite a number of us said in the debate we had at that time that it was just a beginning, and it has proved to be a very good beginning.  We were buoyed up by the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement in the North and South referenda in May, although I was disappointed the turnout on this side of the Border was not a little higher. The Northern referendum was a resounding success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> We then looked forward to the elections of the Assembly and hoped that significant elements of the Agreement would become a reality and bring normal democratic politics to Northern Ireland for the first time in its history.  Seven or eight years ago I spoke to politicians in Northern Ireland who maintained that politicians only had an effect on the politics of sweeping the street and burying the dead, with rather too much of the latter unfortunately.</P>
    <P>We can be satisfied in the wake of the elections, whatever our misgivings, that over 70 per cent of the Assembly's membership will be drawn from pro Agreement parties.  Those who have loudly declared their anti Agreement stance should be mindful that many of their supporters expressed the view in opinion polls conducted on the day of the election that they would like to see the Assembly working.  That sends a very strong signal to those people who are so vociferous in their anti Agreement stance.</P>
    <P>As a democrat, I accept that some of those elected to the Assembly have reservations about the Agreement.  However, I urge them to work constructively in the pursuit of their concerns and not to seek to wreck the huge potential which exists for a lasting peace and an all embracing political settlement.  The worst thing that could possibly happen is if people set out to wreck the Assembly.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those elected to the Assembly and wish them well for the future.  The Minister and others rightly praised political leaders in Northern Ireland.  The increase in support for the SDLP was particularly gratifying.  Many of us are aware that many misgivings were expressed in the months before the election about the future of the SDLP.  I heard remarks made that the SDLP was aging and running out of steam, that its position would be overtaken by Sinn Féin, that it would have no new blood and so on.  It was gratifying in that regard to see it do so well and to see the leadership shown by people such as John Hume, Seamus Mallon and others rewarded in such a concrete way.</P>
    <P>The result for Sinn Féin was very good.  I believe it is now solidly within the democratic process, which further marginalises those on the republican side who would embrace violence.</P>
    <P>It is tremendous that the Women's Coalition, which was a breath of fresh air, did better than people expected and gained two seats in the Assembly.  On the other hand, I regret that Lord Alderdice sees himself as something of a failure &mdash; which is extraordinary for such a gifted person &mdash; solely because the Alliance Party did not obtain the number of seats it targeted.  I expect he will continue to play a vital part in political life in Northern Ireland because he has given so much over the past 11 years as leader of his party.  He is temporarily ensconced as the Speaker of the Assembly, which may become a more permanent position.  I wish him well.</P>
    <P>There is no doubting the difficulties faced by Mr. David Trimble, Leader of the Ulster Unionist <Col N="507" /> Party, due to the makeup of the Unionist component of the Assembly.  I pay tribute to his courage in the face of growing internal dissent on the Agreement.  We should not lose sight of the fact that going into the referendum on the Agreement and the Assembly elections, a majority of his parliamentary party were implacably opposed to his position.  Those involved in politics will know how difficult that situation is.  Clearly there are people within his party who would delight in his failure, and some would no doubt like to see him go the way of the late Brian Faulkner.  I am not the only one who believes that this evolving process needs David Trimble.  So also do those like minded Unionists, who do not see the Agreement as a threat to their cherished position in the union but as a new political order which seeks to deal with the three key sets of relationships, giving each equal legitimacy and standing.</P>
    <P>What wonderful alternative is put forward by those who seek to wreck the Agreement?  That question was also asked of those who said &ldquo;No&rdquo; at the talks, but there was no response.  When the Assembly meets for the first time tomorrow I hope the emphasis is on the positive and that gameplaying will not be a feature as it was in the talks about talks.</P>
    <P>The future of Northern Ireland must be based on accommodation and compromise.  The engine for this new non-sectarian politics will be the Assembly, and everyone has a duty to do their damndest to make it work and to make the institutions that flow from it work, including the substantial cross-Border element.  It was valuable that the Minister sketched out a timetable in saying that the Agreement would be fully implemented by next year.</P>
    <P>Events in Portadown next weekend threaten to undermine much of what has been achieved in the last few months.  The Parades Commission has made its decision, taking into account a range of issues central to the maintenance of public order. It is clear that the Orange Order is determined to march down the Garvaghy Road and feels the Parades Commission is not empowered to dictate where it can or cannot march.  I hope common sense prevails and that an accommodation will be found which ensures that there is no violence or sectarian unrest arising out of Drumcree.  Dialogue over the next few days could bring us back from the brink of violent confrontation.  This is another time for courageous leadership from every quarter, and events on the streets cannot be allowed to undermine all that has been achieved in the last few months.  This year Drumcree does not take place against a background of political stalemate, as before, but against a panorama of unparalleled opportunity. Never before have we had such high hopes of lasting peace.  Never before has so much energy been expended on a positive political agenda which offers the people of Northern Ireland the chance to lead normal lives in a normal society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to the education proposals in Strand Two of the talks process, which I am looking forward to.  They are imaginative and leave room for development.  I am a member of an organisation, the INTO, which represents people on both sides of the Border and which has been teaching people in all parts of the island since 1868.  Our organisation has more than a little interest in the outcome of Strand Two, particularly the provision regarding Gaeilge, and the commitment for the first time in Northern Ireland to give political support to education through the medium of Irish.  Those of us who have supported teachers in Northern Ireland who have been trying to develop culture through and of the Irish language welcome this. We aspire to a State education system where a child from Gaeltacht Tír Chonaill could move to Northern Ireland and continue his or her education through Irish.  We also believe that those children from a Protestant Unionist tradition should have the choice not to be educated through Irish if they do not wish it.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises in that all discussion on education on this island take place on the basis of there being two systems.  Even though there is a commitment from the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to aim for a harmonised education system, the different bodies with vested interests in the area continue to talk in terms of two systems. We must aspire to a curriculum that encompasses the sash and the shamrock; there must be a place for both.  We must be strong enough to design and agree a curriculum that shows and explains the cultural heritage of all groups on the island.  We must recognise that cultural difference and ethnicity can enrich and improve society.</P>
      <P>One of the few areas specifically mentioned in Strand Two is teacher qualification.  If we are to make progress in the education sector, we must have a system where pupils, parents and teachers can move freely between both parts of the island and where their rights are maintained and protected. That means we must consider how teachers are qualified and trained; we must consider what qualifications we require to make teachers equally acceptable on both sides of the Border.  As things stand, that does not exist and there are four different methods of primary teacher training.  Teachers are trained in colleges of education in the South and in the North, but those in the North are trained in the Catholic college or the State Protestant college.  The latter would not accept that description, even though that is what it amounts to.  A graduate from Stranmillis College would probably not be acceptable to most Catholic schools in the North because he or she would not have a qualification for teaching religion.  Similarly, any Northern graduate, either from Stranmillis or St. Mary's, would not be recognised in the South because they would not have the qualification in Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extraordinary situation was brought to my attention this week involving a young graduate <Col N="509" /> from St. Mary's.  She has taken Gaeilge all through school and at third level and is a fluent speaker.  She sat the scrúdú cáilíochta in the South and felt she would have no difficulty taking an examination in a language she loved and spoke easily.  She failed the written examination and is not recognised as a teacher here.  That kind of nonsense is going on all the time and recognition should be opened up.</P>
    <P>There is full recognition in the North for teachers trained in the South; the reciprocal agreement is not there.  I look forward to dealing with this under Strand Two.  We must be open. Every child should be entitled to learn Irish in a local school and to be educated through Irish. That must be protected for children whether they are in Coleraine, Cork, Derry or Dingle.  It must be available to all.</P>
    <P>The challenge is not to allow people be partitionist in their view and to focus all discussion into a harmonised system.  The question of whether something will work in Belfast and Dublin should be to the fore in all issues.  If something does not work in Derry and Cork then it is not the way to proceed.  There will be huge resistance to this from the Churches, the Departments of Education, vested interests and those who are frightened of change and who must be reassured.</P>
    <P>One way of moving forward is by examining the issue of education for mutual understanding which is currently being successfully run in a small number of schools in Northern Ireland. There are two things wrong with it: it is restricted to Northern Ireland and was put together without any consultation whatever with teachers.  It is only used in approximately one fifth of schools in Northern Ireland and does not have the support and reinforcement which should exist.  People and schools cannot afford to take chances with it.  It is very easy to get the local Protestant and Catholic schools together for a game of soccer.  However, anyone trying to get them together for a game of Gaelic football or cricket would have their work cut out in terms of explaining it to parents.</P>
    <P>We should also examine third level education and the issue of recognition of qualifications for entry to colleges of education.  We should insist that, for example, those from Newry and Dundalk should only have to fill one application form for third level colleges North and South.  Designing a form which differentiates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK under UCAS and which includes colleges in the South should not be beyond the wit of humans.</P>
    <P>The idea of a teaching council is currently being discussed in the Department of Education and Science and the Minister has agreed to bring forward legislation introducing such a council. The same process is currently taking place in the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. As things stand it is likely we will end up with two separate teaching councils which will determine teaching qualifications within two years.  Will both Governments agree to a teaching council, if necessary for each jurisdiction, but with the same <Col N="510" /> criteria and approach and with an overarching body to ensure standardisation?</P>
    <P>If I had sufficient time I would deal with education for disadvantaged people, an issue which could draw both sides of the island together, a process which could begin by extending education and mutual understanding both North and South.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to take part in this historic debate at such an historic time.  Nobody would have believed me if I said a year ago there would be peace in Northern Ireland and elections to an Assembly.  We have come a long way and I am delighted that those of violence have put aside their guns and that we have peace and reconciliation. I look forward to prosperity for everybody on the island.</P>
      <P>I visited the North on numerous occasions and holidayed there.  It is a very attractive place which, in terms of tourism and development, has fallen behind the rest of the island.  I am sure that if the people there visited my part of the country and other tourist areas such as Galway, they would see how hotels, bed and breakfasts and accommodation in general has developed.  The troubles held back development in Northern Ireland and I am sure the people there can look forward to much prosperity in future.  I wish them well.</P>
      <P>I compliment those who played a strong role in forging the Agreement and who were determined that violence would be put aside.  I also compliment the people of violence who laid down their arms in order to give peace a chance.  It is high time that they tried the alternative.</P>
      <P>I emigrated to the US when I was 16 years old and worked with people of all races, including Chinese.  I never saw a black person before going there &mdash; I had read about them and seen them on boxes, etc.  I worked with all creeds; religion never seemed to bother me.  Like everybody else I did my business and everybody got on with life. People were worried about paying their mortgages and all the other things necessary to keep house and home going.  When I returned to Ireland things seemed different with religion playing a big part, something which astonished me.  I found this even harder to believe on reading history and examining the issue in more detail.</P>
      <P>Much credit must go to people such as John Hume who marched in Northern Ireland for civil rights and one man one vote.  Everything has moved at an enormous pace over the years.  Such people stood up for their beliefs and must be commended for doing so.  They were not people of violence but were looking for democratic rights.  Because they were of a different religious persuasion others thought they should not have the right to vote, speak, go to church, work or do anything.  The people who thought this were absolutely wrong.  All people are entitled to the right to life, to own a home and property and to live a normal life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> I am glad at what is now happening and commend everybody, including David Trimble, John Hume and also Gerry Adams for the manner in which he moved his organisation forward in an effort to bring peace.  Charlie Haughey, Deputy Reynolds, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, who brought the process to this stage, Tony Blair, who played a very active part in the process, and Bill Clinton must all be complimented.  It was amazing how Bill Clinton, who plays a central role in world politics, got involved in the problems of a small country with a small population which is difficult to find on a map, and that the story was carried on CNN and Sky News.  The peace process was put on the same par as the Middle East process.  Much effort was expended in an effort to bring peace and those concerned must be complimented. The Irish people have shown the world that peace can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the work of the new Assembly and wish it well and hope it is successful. I hope those involved see that the democratic process is the way forward.  There are still a few people on the wings trying to promote violence and upset the process.  I compliment the people of Tarbert, 99.5 per cent of whom voted yes for peace, the highest yes vote in the country, and the people of the island who voted for peace.  If people want peace they are entitled to it and will have to get it.  Those who want to give peace a chance must be commended, congratulated and supported.</P>
    <P>More than likely David Trimble will be First Minister in the new Assembly.  I wish him luck. He and the other leaders are people of courage and steel.  Those still trying to break the process and who advocated a no vote should examine their consciences to see where they are going.</P>
    <P>We are now in the marching season which will be a difficult time for people in the North of Ireland.  I call on all sides in the North of Ireland to be reasonable and practical.  If people believe they have historic rights and if agreement is reached, they should be allowed to march. Nationalists should stand back and enjoy the music.  If the Nationalists wish to march, Unionists and others should allow them to do so if they believe they have historic rights.  I would love to see 4,000 or 5,000 people come here to march. Bed and breakfast accommodation would be needed and we could generate some business. Perhaps these people are marching in the wrong part of our country.  It is a long time since we had good marching bands.  There is great musical talent in the country; there are thousands of excellent musicians and if they worked more on their music, sold it abroad and tried to attract people to this island, it would be better than creating violence.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this subject.  I congratulate the people involved in this Agreement; they are people of steel and with nerve.  They made commitments and were determined to achieve peace.  Much credit should <Col N="512" /> be given to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair and the President of the United States for their efforts in the final hours.  I wish the people of Northern Ireland well and I hope they will see the light.  We all want to live in peace and harmony on this island making it economically strong and vibrant.</P>

      <P>I am glad we are discussing Northern Ireland again as our last consideration of this issue took place a number of months ago. It is important we keep it on the agenda because of the quickly changing and developing situation. This is a week in which there is reason to be satisfied that an important part of the process, the elections to the Assembly, has taken place.  It is also a week in which to be worried given the difficulties which will be faced in Drumcree.</P>
      <P>The parties in Northern Ireland were anxious to hold the elections before the marching season got into full swing.  Thankfully, they have taken place in a relatively peaceful atmosphere and I &mdash; and I am sure every Member of the House &mdash; deplore the efforts made to derail the process and impact on the elections with the bombing in Newtownhamilton last week.  Following its first meeting tomorrow, it is a pity the Assembly will not have a number of weeks to do its business, settle down and make arrangements before facing the crisis of Drumcree.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am happy those who played such a vital role in the political process in Northern Ireland leading up to the Agreement took part in the elections and now have a platform on which to stand as the professional political representatives of their people.  They now have an opportunity to engage in what one might call normal political activity and get down to the job of representing their people and their interests, which many are anxious to do.  I hope they will have the opportunity to do the job we do in this House and which is also done in the other House.</P>
      <P>If the people of Northern Ireland are to improve their country, they need a say in how it is run.  The system which developed under direct rule was one of Ministers flying in on a Monday and out on a Friday.  It was a quasi-colonial system in which the local people had no say or input and had to bear no responsibility.  As a politician, I welcome those people into professional politics. Over the years many people did trojan work at great personal cost.  No more than the right of people here to get paid for engaging in political activity, it is proper that they should be rewarded for what will be a difficult job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Minister's satisfaction that the PUP and the Women's Coalition have gained entry to the Assembly in addition to the larger parties which were always going to be represented.  I <Col N="513" /> share his concern and regret that the UDP and the Labour Party did not gain entry because both parties, like the Women's Coalition and the PUP, played a constructive role in the negotiations.  It is ironic that a combination of systems between constituency representatives and a list which might have allowed them to be represented and which was sought by groups like the Women's Coalition, was strenuously opposed by the Alliance Party which, unfortunately, did not emerge with the type of representation it hoped. It is ironic it opposed the introduction of an element of the list system which might have helped Gary McMichael, Malachy Cullen and others to take their place in the Assembly.  For them there will be another day as those of us who have been disappointed at elections know.</P>
    <P>I would like to look briefly at the process between the referenda and the Assembly election last week.  An effort was made through violence to derail the process.  I condemn the activities of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons in recent weeks.  In the past we have had reason to deplore the attitude of the Conservative Party to Irish affairs and we saw the difficulties John Major had dealing with his backbenchers.  In Opposition, it deliberately set out not only to break the bipartisan approach with the Labour Party, but to foster division in Unionism and to undermine the leadership position of the Ulster Unionist Party, particularly that of David Trimble, Ken Maginnis and John Taylor.  It can take no credit for the developments in recent weeks and, indeed, all it can be credited with is helping to foster and increase factionalism within unionism.</P>
    <P>As in the past, we made allowances for Sinn Féin to bring its people with it.  We must also make allowances on this occasion for the Unionist leadership to bring its people with it.  Regrettably, the use the word &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; when referring to one's constituents does not help the process.  We must, however, be understanding.</P>
    <P>Drumcree is a difficult issue and I hope the mechanisms in place to deal with it will be used and that the rule of law will be respected.  Perhaps at a later stage intervention by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, which helped to bring about a successful conclusion to the British-Irish Agreement, might be needed.  If it is necessary this week, it should be forthcoming and it would be welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for sharing his time.  When speaking in America our President said that those elected to the Assembly had a sacred duty to make it work.  These were strong words and I hope those in Northern Ireland who have been elected heard them.  Coming from Ulster, she is someone who would understand the situation more easily than many of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be difficult days while the Assembly settles down.  There is a considerable number of things which those outside the Assembly can do to help those within it.  For example, Strands Two <Col N="514" /> and Three are in a way already in existence in terms of the interaction between many professional, sporting and cultural bodies on this island and in Great Britain.  The more we emphasise and solidify those links, the better.</P>
    <P>When Senator O'Toole spoke about education I could not help thinking that the same applies to health.  I bored the House on many occasions on the efforts I believe we should make promoting all-Ireland health initiatives.  An institute of public health on the island has been set up and the director who has just been appointed is a woman from Northern Ireland.  It is astonishing to read on the Internet about the amount of interaction between the Northern Ireland health service and the health service in Republic.  By promoting this type of activity, we will be able to show people in the Assembly who may be a little anxious about cross-Border institutions that interaction in many areas have been in existence for years and have caused no trouble.</P>
    <P>The College of Physicians is 300 years old and acts on an all-Ireland basis.  The College of Surgeons is not much younger, nor is the Royal Irish Academy, of which some Senators are members. There are also cultural and sporting bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is looking carefully at the Nordic Council to see if it can be guided by it on the proposed Council of the Isles.  At the outset I was sceptical but when I saw how clever those involved in the Nordic Council are at promoting their own region and when one considers that the Amsterdam Treaty will make regional co-operation within the EU less difficult, I was impressed by the idea.  We can look at this concept to allay fears and in a way which does not impinge on the Assembly.</P>
    <P>Those outside who could promote the work of the Assembly include prisoners and those released who have been involved in paramilitary activities.  I was cheered by the report that the graves of the disappeared were perhaps at last to be discovered.  While news on this appears to have faded, those with any knowledge of the graves could be asked to provide information.  It would mean an enormous amount to those who do not know the whereabouts of their loved ones.</P>
    <P>While some paramilitaries have apologised to those they have harmed, there is an opportunity for those others who have not done so and who are awaiting release from prison to consider apologising.  Many family members in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and other parts of the world feel an apology is owed to them.  It is the one thing that may make a difference.  Even though they are not in the Assembly, such actions would support and assist those trying to make it work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">

      <P>The problem with discussing Northern Ireland is where to begin.  Does one begin with the Act of Union, 1800, the 1921 Treaty or with Bloody Sunday in 1972?  In the referendum on the Agreement 94 per cent of voters <Col N="515" /> in the Republic of Ireland voted for peace. Living only a mile from the County Fermanagh border I appreciate the importance of peace, not only politically but, more importantly, socially and economically.  Some 71 per cent of voters in the North also voted for peace.  However, it would be unfair to say that the 29 per cent who voted no were against peace.  Perhaps some do want the war to continue, but most voted from a fear of change in a society which at present resembles shifting sand.  The results of the elections to the Assembly will not instil confidence in them.  We should have sympathy for them because times are changing very fast.</P>
      <P>It is important to go back in history and see how we have reached where we are today.  It is useful to dwell on what I was brought up on, which might now be called folklore.  It is also important to understand where both sides of the community are coming from.</P>
      <P>My mother and her family are from County Fermanagh.  She grew up in a community where Catholics were second class citizens, despite the fact that in her village they made up 95 per cent of the population.  Indeed, all large landowners and anybody with wealth were Protestant.  As a young person socialising at night with her friends they were invariably stopped and interrogated by the then B-Specials, who were often their next door neighbours and whom they would often meet the next day.</P>
      <P>These neighbours were the law and order in Northern Ireland.  On numerous occasions my mother's home was raided and ransacked by the security forces simply because they were Nationalists, not republicans.  Discrimination occurred as an accident of birth, depending on whether one was born into a Catholic or Protestant family.  It instilled in the Nationalist community a dreadful lack of trust in the security forces and a lack of belief in fair play.</P>
      <P>Last Friday's elections were the most obvious sign of change.  The fact that for the first time the SDLP recorded the highest first preference vote of any of the parties emphasised to the Unionist people that life as they knew it in Northern Ireland is changing.  The lack of unity in the Ulster Unionist Party did not help its position Last week Unionist members of one of the councils voted for an SDLP Lord Mayor.  As somebody remarked over the weekend, the Nationalist people are up off their knees and they have no intention of going back down on their knees for anybody.  This new found bravery among the Nationalist population is causing serious distress to the Unionist population.  However, while any change is a cause of worry and stress, the majority of the Nationalist people want equality, nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We owe a great debt of gratitude to all the leaders in Northern Ireland for their resilience in the face of adversity.  I have a new found respect for Mr. David Trimble who went out on a limb and has stood alone on a number of occasions. <Col N="516" /> He has already been castigated by members of the media, some whom have said he has engaged in political suicide.  Of all the leaders in the North he has the most to lose.  I congratulate him on his performance in the election, despite the opposition from those who were previously loyal followers.</P>
    <P>When listening at the weekend to members of the UKUP and the DUP I was reminded of a two year old child &mdash; people refer to the &ldquo;terrible twos&rdquo;&mdash; whose response to every question is no. One can be reassured that at least children will grow up, but one would sometimes wonder about the leaders of these two parties.  They do not appear to have the political maturity of men with a long number of years in politics to grow up.  It is sometimes very hard to change the ways of some people.</P>
    <P>However, I believe Mr. David Trimble has the nerve and self confidence to ensure that the Assembly works.  I have no doubt that with his determined effort and the efforts of moderate Nationalists, the Assembly can be made to work. It is a very difficult job, especially given the commencement of the marching season, where a compromise must be reached between both sides.</P>
    <P>We all understand why Nationalist communities do not want marches to pass through their housing estates or areas.  Equally, members of the Unionist community believe they have every right to march to express their heritage, unionism or whatever they wish to call it.  Listening to some of the reports over the past couple of days leads one to wonder if some of those involved, especially the Grand Master of the Orange Order and some of the leaders of the residents associations, have been listening to the 71 per cent of voters in the North who have asked for peace. One would sometimes think we had not moved ahead.</P>
    <P>In light of the fact that the majority of the people in Northern Ireland, Nationalist and Unionist, voted for peace, there is an onus on those in positions of power to work towards consensus in order that the ugly scenes which prevailed in the past do not continue.  It is easy for me to say there should be a compromise, but hatred should remain in the past.</P>
    <P>The issue of decommissioning has proved a problematic one.  Paramilitary groups could hand over their arms one day and recommence violence the next.  Convicted persons who have been elected to the democratic process are urging others to believe in the Assembly and work towards its success.  If these people can sit across from each other, realising, albeit belatedly, their past lives of torment and destruction were wrong, I cannot see why others cannot do the same.  Dialogue is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>In spite of the intention of some Unionists to block the workings of the Assembly, I believe it can and will succeed because of the commitment and determination of people like John Hume and others who have invested their entire political lives in the establishment of peace on this island. <Col N="517" /> They will not allow pessimists and bigots to wreck the Assembly.  It would be foolish and naive to believe that the coming months will be plain sailing. Punishment beatings and sectarian murders will doubtless continue; but as the Assembly gets down to its work, sporadic murders and attacks should become less common.  Regardless of what paramilitaries believe, life has changed in Northern Ireland.  I wish all those involved in the Assembly every success as they embark on their historic journey.  They can be assured that, despite the outspoken opposition of some who will continue to dwell in the past, the majority of the people in Northern Ireland are relying on them to ensure their wishes are fulfilled and Northern Ireland moves forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his very thoughtful contribution.  He and his Department have a huge responsibility in regard to the ongoing timetable of events following on the elections. We all welcome the new beginning in relations offered by the Agreement and I join with other Members in paying tribute to everyone involved.  As democrats, we all hail the Agreement. The new aspiration of building a structure of co-dependence which will render conflict impossible is the only sensible way forward.  The two traditions must properly respect diversity and display a patriotic respect for one another.</P>
      <P>The referendum on the Agreement and last Thursday's elections were truly historic events. Hopefully, the politics of intransigence will now become something of the past.  The 94 per cent yes vote in the South and the 71 per cent yes vote in the North were resounding, clear-cut results which expressed the overwhelming desire of people everywhere for peace.  Three quarters of the people who voted in the Assembly elections voted for parties who favoured the Agreement, although we might have preferred a more decisive vote in favour of the pro-Agreement Unionist parties.  I salute the courage of Messrs Trimble, Taylor, Maginnis and others in the UUP leadership on the stand they have taken and the manner in which they have spoken out and campaigned. I also congratulate David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson on their success.  Their non-sectarian approach is very refreshing.  John Hume and Séamus Mallon have been giants throughout this process.  I welcome the increased vote achieved by constitutional Nationalists and the increased Sinn Féin vote.  The acceptance by that party and the overwhelming majority of its supporters of democratic politics is something which must be welcomed.  I trust that republicans will now come forward and identify the graves of the victims of past violence and return their bodies to their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe John Hume deserves the greatest credit and respect for his 30 years of dialogue, his preaching of the politics of peace and compromise and his dogged and determined patience and persistence.  He has consistently called for all the Agreement represents, namely, the enhancement <Col N="518" /> and recognition of the traditions of the two communities while threatening neither.  He was largely instrumental in persuading the British Government to declare it had no selfish strategic or economic interest in remaining involved in Northern Ireland.  It was he who set out to engage Sinn Féin and others with paramilitary links to believe that dialogue and democratic means alone could win peace.  It was he who devised and recommended the idea of an all-Ireland referendum to ratify any settlement which would properly give ownership to the people as a whole and recognise and promote the belief that the people are sovereign.  The Agreement now truly belongs to the people.  It was John Hume who mobilised international, particularly American, opinion behind the ongoing peace process.  We must all be very grateful his persistence endured and survived all of the obstacles placed in its path.</P>
    <P>I regret that people such as Gary McMichael were unsuccessful in the elections.  I pay tribute to John Alderdice and am delighted he will be the interim speaker.  He has been a forthright and honest politician in the past and still has much to contribute.  It is tremendous that all shades of political opinion will be sitting down together for the first time tomorrow and I wish them well. David Trimble will make a fine First Minister and John Hume a great Deputy First Minister.  If they go forward in a spirit of partnership and reconciliation, they can overcome the difficulties posed by issues such as the Drumcree march.  I wish the Policing Commission well and am delighted our learned colleague, Senator Hayes, is a member as he is a rock of sense.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing a beginning of a breakdown in the blind allegiances of the past.  I listened attentively to Senator Leonard's comments about those who, in her view, have acted like spoilt children and have not grown up.  Sadly, I think they have grown up but their mind sets are buried in the past.  Notwithstanding that, past allegiances are continuously breaking down, and with the Assembly meeting for the first time tomorrow and politicians working together, a good example will be set.  The members of the Assembly have a very onerous responsibility and we wish them well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in acknowledging the highly successful referendum vote of the people of Ireland, North and South, almost two months ago.  I also want to acknowledge those who supported the Agreement in the recent elections and stood for election on the peace platform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the first meeting of the Assembly and I wish those elected to it well.  While the peace process was negotiated by many fine people who have been congratulated here by everyone, the situation has since moved on.  The Agreement belongs to the people because they voted for it, they supported candidates who stood on the peace platform in the six counties in the election. <Col N="519" /> I hope the euphoria that brought will last.  I hope there will be lasting justice and peace for the people who so deserve it.</P>
    <P>The chequered history of this country has been outlined on many occasions.  Whether we go back to the 1800s or come to 1998, division rests between our people.  Did those who voted no reflect nonacceptance of the peace agreement, or did they reflect something else?  The Conservative Party were mischievous during the recent election.  Its spokesmen did not help those people standing on a pro-Agreement platform.</P>
    <P>Perhaps for his own sake we should not congratulate David Trimble to the extent we are. Congratulations from this side of the Border may not help him and we would not wish to damage the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party at this time because he has a difficult task.  However, it must be asked if he gave the leadership to his party and supporters that they deserved during the election.  I hope his commitment will be as strong in the future as it was two months ago.</P>
    <P>Will the RUC implement the decisions of the Parades Commission?  I hope it will.  It will be tested shortly.  Last year the RUC failed during the Drumcree crisis.  Will it fail again?  These questions must be asked because we are talking about peace with lasting justice.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard gave many examples of the type of second class citizenship to which the Nationalist community were subjected down the years.  We should hope the supremacy and privilege to which the Unionist parties clung will disappear.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey made a plea that the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland recognise that the veterinary faculty of UCD needs financial support.  Students seeking to study veterinary science in this country can only do so in UCD.  Students find they have to go to England to complete their course.  Senator Haughey should be lauded for saying that.</P>
    <P>While looking at the many who gave leadership &mdash; the Taoiseach, Tony Blair, President Clinton and all the political leaders in the North &mdash; we must remember the organisations which took the greatest leap for peace and we must encourage them.  Sinn Féin and the IRA made a quantum leap to join the democratic process and we must encourage them to stay on that road.  I think they will pursue that road.  Sinn Féin's tremendous leadership has brought its voters along.  Those who did that should be congratulated.  We must acknowledge their success.  Equally we must congratulate the SDLP for the tremendous support it received.</P>
    <P>I wish the people of the six counties the very best.  Progress can be made and the acid test will be the cross-Border institutions and their roles. Last week, Minister Walsh brought about a success for farmers North and South for the first time ever.  A few months ago he played a vital role in helping to lift the ban on beef from Northern Ireland.  Let us recognise we can work together, <Col N="520" /> and the more we work together the more successful we will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the new Assembly well.  I pay tribute to all those who worked so hard to make a success of the peace process, in particular the priests and ministers who met secretly and did a great deal of work to bring this about.  The media revealed a meeting which they organised in County Clare and that was wrong.  These issues need to be carefully handled.</P>
      <P>This was an abnormal country in the past, the Border was a mini Berlin Wall.  You could not cross it before 9 a.m. or after 5 p.m. Otherwise you had to pay a hefty sum of money to get permission to cross.  Terence O'Neill and Seán Lemass righted that great wrong and I pay tribute to them.  They did Trojan work and as a result of their efforts you could drive from Dingle to Derry at any time.</P>
      <P>That was a step forward, but a section of people in Northern Ireland were not happy with that and Terence O'Neill was ousted.  Brian Faulkner followed him as leader and he was ousted because he tried to bring a semblance of normality to Northern Ireland.  For that reason I appeal to the people of the Garvaghy Road to be generous and helpful to David Trimble.  He has a tough job with his people.  If he is ousted we are back to square one.  They should bear that in mind.  To David Trimble I use the words of John Fitzgerald Kennedy &mdash; never fear to negotiate, never negotiate through fear.  Sending an open letter to the people of the Garvaghy Road was a step forward, but David Trimble should talk to them.  If they talk they will break those who say no, they will have peace and this march will pass off peacefully.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Catholic and Church of Ireland Archbishops of Armagh who have asked people to come together and not to disrupt the peace process.  No one wants another 30 years of violence.  We should not forget those who started this process.  Charles Haughey, some of his ambassadors and the clergymen I mentioned did much work behind the scenes to try to get the process going.  However, the greatest credit must go to John Hume, Gerry Adams and Albert Reynolds.  They took tough decisions which many criticised.  They were also criticised when their photograph was taken outside Government Buildings; however, they were proved right in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Rev. Ian Paisley amazes me by saying no to so many things.  He says no to Tony Blair and the British Government.  No one said no to or insulted the Queen more than he.  He says no to Southern Ireland but he was the first Unionist to set up a church in County Monaghan in a blaze of publicity . He later followed this with another church in County Donegal.  He comes here to preach the gospel and I appeal to him to remember the adage &ldquo;Love thy neighbour as thyself&rdquo;.  I am sure he reads the gospel more than I, but this is a very important phrase.  I appeal to him to <Col N="521" /> think of it.  He should stop saying no, be friendly with his neighbours and try to make the Assembly work.</P>
    <P>I hope this process is a success.  I have seen a lot of turmoil about which I have spoken before. Unionists should realise that they have a great future in a peaceful Ireland.  The farmers of Northern Ireland are grateful to the Minister for Agriculture and Food who negotiated a great deal for agriculture North and South last week. We do not hear many politicians paying tribute to him but the farmers in Northern Ireland know that they would be better dealing with an Irish Minister than with the Agriculture Secretary in London; they are getting a very bad deal and their cattle trade is in crisis.</P>
    <P>Unionists need have no fear.  Albert Reynolds often said that no one should fear peace but everyone should fear war.  I appeal to Unionists and Nationalists to sit down and negotiate in the five days before the Garvaghy Road march.  They should not let it be a day of turmoil or a day of success for the troublemakers.  They should make it a day of success for peace by sitting down and talking.</P>

      <P>In general, a woman's desire to be a mother is more sympathetically treated by society than a man's desire to be a father.  Lack of potency or fertility are frequently joked about but the sales of Viagra for the treatment of impotence show it is no laughing matter, unless one has shares in Pfizers, the makers of the drug.</P>
      <P>One group of men to whom the possibility of infertility has to be presented are those who develop cancers which require treatment by chemotherapy, radiotherapy or radical surgery which may result in loss of fertility.  Testicular cancer is the most common cause of cancer in young men.  There are about 80 cases per year for which orchidectomy, the removal of the testes, is the required treatment.  Male hormones can be replaced but sperm producing tissue cannot be replaced.  Leukaemia and Hodgkins disease, of which there are 200-250 cases per year, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma are all common in Ireland and it is young men who are frequently affected. No one knows the effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the DNA in sperm.  Research is needed in this area but we do know that the effects are not for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technology required to successfully freeze human semen has been available for many years. The development of successful human semen freezing techniques has proved particularly valuable in cases of men with cancers such as those I <Col N="522" /> have mentioned and in men with chronic illnesses which may result in a loss, or potential loss, of fertility.  Because it was recognised that Irish men should be in a position to benefit from such techniques, the Department of Health and Children approached the Human Assisted Reproduction Institute in the Rotunda Hospital some time ago with a view to setting up a semen freezing and storage facility.  The institute willingly did so, using £60,000 of its own money to buy the required equipment.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the need for the service is far greater than expected and looks like increasing even further as doctors and other medical workers hear of the facility.  It was expected that there would be 40 to 50 specimens frozen each year.  Instead, although the facility has been in place for only a few months, four to five cases are presenting each week.  Naturally the unit does not want to turn anyone away but the costs and the need for staff must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>The service is offered to men between 18 and 45.  I will not go into detail about the consent forms they must sign and the counselling they receive but ten men under 25 and 18 between 25 and 45 were seen in the first cohort.  At present, patients pay £200 for the initial service and £50 per year for storage.</P>
    <P>These men often cannot work because of their illness and they are likely to be out of work for at least six to eight months.  Many of those who are ill are relatively young and some have no money.  There is no help with finance from the health boards the VHI, BUPA or other insurance schemes.  Those who do not have the money are allowed pay later as the procedure must take place with haste because chemotherapy or radiotherapy cannot be delayed.  The Irish Cancer Society helps some patients who cannot pay but feels it cannot continue beyond the end of the year because there are many other pressing needs on its money.</P>
    <P>Testing for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B and C and other viral antibodies are carried out, as are many other costly medical procedures.  Data collection on patients is vital and the secretarial side is as important as the medical, counselling and technological aspects.  The HARI Institute has no increase in staff to deal with this facility.  It expected the facility to be quite small but it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>Oncology social workers are among those who stress the importance of this service, not just from a practical point of view but as a psychological boost for the patient.  It seems a positive sign if, in the chaos of cancer, a patient is asked if he would like his sperm frozen in case he would like to become a father in ten years time.  In such cases, the patient will think he is expected to survive at least ten years and this is important for rehabilitation &mdash; in the midst of stressful treatment the patient has some sense of control over his future.  Not all patients will want to become involved in this treatment but there is an anxiety <Col N="523" /> among some of the social workers that the cost may be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Treatments for many cancers are improving all the time.  The outlook for testicular cancer has dramatically changed for the better recently.  This is important for the parents, spouses or partners as well as for the young man who is ill.  All the main hospitals with chemotherapy services &mdash; St. James's, the Mater, St. Vincent's and the University College Hospitals in Cork and Galway &mdash; use this service.  It must be looked upon as a component of modern cancer management.  People from one of the hospitals told me that nine young men with testicular cancer were currently undergoing treatment there.</P>
    <P>We are notoriously bad at discussing anything to do with sex but, as a doctor and as someone who has spoken frequently on women's health issues, this is an area of men's health we cannot allow ourselves to fail to address.  I ask for funding to be made available for young men who will be helped at a most difficult time in their lives by being given some hope for the future.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising the issue.  The Minister for Health and Children is aware of the service provided by the human assisted reproduction unit at the Rotunda Hospital for men who wish to have their sperm frozen for possible future use.  Persons who avail of this service do so in a private capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows the need for such a service has been highlighted for some time.  He appreciates <Col N="524" /> the trauma which persons go through on discovering that they have cancer and that this can be exacerbated by the knowledge that treatment for their condition may leave them infertile. Patients will no doubt appreciate that the service is now available in Ireland and that they no longer have the added hardship of having to travel to England to have their sperm frozen.</P>
    <P>Services involving human assisted reproduction operate under guidelines on such treatment issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and approved by the Medical Council. The Minister understands these guidelines are currently being reviewed and awaits with interest the outcome of this review.</P>
    <P>Regarding the sperm bank at the Rotunda Hospital, the Minister is not in a position to make a decision on financial assistance at the moment. However, he will keep the matter under consideration and will bear in mind the contribution which Senator Henry has made.  Given the numbers which have come forward, the matter should be examined urgently and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  We could be waiting a long time if we have to wait for the in vitro fertilisation recommendations to be issued. This is urgent for these young men, not just because of the physical improvements for them, but because the psychological effects for them and for their families are enormous.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 July 1998.</P>
