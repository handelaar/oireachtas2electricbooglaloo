      <P>I have notice from Senator Leonard that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to provide funding for an electricity generating plant in the Cavan/Monaghan area to deal with the serious situation which exists as a result of the vast amounts of agricultural waste from the poultry and mushroom industry in the region.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the large number of factory closures in south Tipperary over the last year, the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to accept the proposal recently submitted by South Tipperary County Council to include Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir in the order of priority for urban renewal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to request the British Government to restore parity of esteem between the degrees awarded by the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians in the United Kingdom and in Ireland in view of the efforts beings made by the Government to establish North-South and east-west bodies on these islands with health being one of the designated areas.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Leonard and Senator Tom Hayes as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Henry may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is item 1 without debate; all Stages of item 2, with the Second <Col N="1278" /> Stage contribution of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, all other Senators' contributions not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time; and all Stages of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1998, to be taken not earlier than 7 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. The Leader will be aware that yesterday the British Prime Minister announced his Government's intention to deal with the millennium bug, the consequences of which for business, banking, and the public service are enormous.  His Government is putting in place, perhaps belatedly, plans to deal with the problem, such as helping businesses to train people.  My colleague Senator Avril Doyle has asked for time for a debate on this subject. The public needs to know that the Government has a plan, that a specific Minister is in charge of it and that an education process is under way.  This is a matter of urgent importance and this House could greatly assist by having a full debate and hearing the Government's plans. Perhaps the Leader could, as early as possible after Easter, arrange a debate on this topic.</P>
      <P>When will the Leader make time available for item 14, Second Stage of the Shannon River Council Bill?  This legislation has the agreement of all sides of the House and the enthusiastic endorsement of both Government parties.  We would facilitate the passing of Second Stage in an hour, so I make a small request to the Leader to give time later this week to get the Bill back on the rails.</P>

      <P>The Leader has ordered the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to be taken not earlier than 7 p.m. Do you wish to order the Motion for Earlier Signature in conjunction with the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There will probably be a gap of about an hour and a half between the conclusion of item 2 and the beginning of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which might be an appropriate time to take the Shannon River Council Bill. The idea behind the Bill is to have one authority for the operation of the river.  At present about eight Departments are involved, including the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  One agency is responsible for draining the river, another for counting fish and another for building houses in the vicinity.  So many authorities have an input that we should consider giving all the powers to one body.  This is not a question of debating the issue &mdash; the matter should be taken because all sides agree.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, or whoever the appropriate person might be, to take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again raise with the Leader item 17, motion 9, concerning the death penalty.  The last time I <Col N="1279" /> raised this it was said that the motion was an attack on the American authorities but it is not. It is directed at those states which use the death penalty.  It was also said that liberal Senators select America for criticism, yet they do not take any notice of other countries using the death penalty. We made it very clear, however, that we were talking about a democracy.  I may be wrong, but as far as I know, America is the only democracy which indulges in this barbarous practice and that is the reason it was singled out.  Items have also been placed on the Order Paper by Members of the Independent group concerning Tibet, East Timor and Algeria.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on mutuality and building societies?  In today's newspapers we have read again about the hundreds of thousands of pounds being paid to those who run building societies.  I have no objection to the salaries they are getting but I want to remind Senators on the Government benches that the £500,000 mentioned today will now have to be paid for by people with house loans.  In other words, it increases the price of houses once again.  We need to get back to mutuality as one important way of ensuring that house prices are kept in check.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business as set out by the Leader.  I welcome the introduction last Friday of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998.  This long promised legislation stems mainly from the 1995 report of the task force on travelling people.  I compliment the Government on introducing it in this House. As many Senators are also members of local authorities, they can offer direct insights into the issues to be dealt with.  Will the Leader indicate the earliest possible date for the Second Stage debate on this important Bill?</P>
      <P>I support the requests from all sides of the House for an early debate on the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998.  As a representative for County Offaly, I realise the importance of co-ordinating the various uses of the Shannon.  An early debate on the legislation, should the Government be able to agree to one, would be welcomed in all the counties that border on the river.</P>
      <P>When will the Leader permit time for a debate on a motion, which has been tabled for some months, concerning the effect of microwave transmitters for mobile telephones?  The request by the Labour Party group for such a debate has been supported by Senators Bonner and McGowan.  We had hoped the debate would take place during this session.  I would welcome an indication from the Leader on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the announcement by the Minister for Finance of a review group on the financial institutions and the laws relating to them, it is imperative that we should have a debate on the formation of that group.  I welcome the fact that, however belatedly, it is being set up.  The membership and terms of reference outlined in today's newspapers are not sufficient to deal with the <Col N="1280" /> scale of the problem and to restore public confidence in the banking system.  The Minister for Finance should attend the House to debate that subject with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader give the House some information about reports in circulation that, as part of the Government's discussions with the British on a proposed package for the referendum, between ten and 20 seats should be made available to candidates from the North of Ireland?  This House is entitled to know what the Government has in mind for the future of the House.  It raises certain serious questions about whether or not people can be represented without paying tax in a particular jurisdiction and how they will be elected.  What method of election will be used and what changes to the House are involved?  When will this matter be discussed?  It is important for this House to have an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>There were a number of glancing references to tribunals and I would like guidance from the House on this matter.  Like everyone else, I am continually receiving demands for information.  I have no objection whatever to filling them in but I take umbrage when I am told I must have the replies notarised, sworn before a solicitor and returned by registered post.  It is a small charge &mdash; about £5 for the entire operation &mdash; but I do not see why any Member should have to spend £5 of his or her money simply to inform the authorities that they have not received a bribe.  If the Government authorities or inquirers want this information they should pay for it.  I do not see why I should.</P>

      <P>Such a debate should be broadened to include all of the banking issues.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to investigate the position taken by the Central Bank on NIB? It has transpired that the Central Bank undertook an investigation and found nothing wrong.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to also investigate the operations of the Central Bank? <Col N="1281" /> It appears that the bank has a vested interest in banking circles in this country.</P>

      <P>The Governor of the Central Bank will attend a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service tomorrow.  As the Fine Gael Party Whip, Senator Burke can arrange to have his party members take a case to the committee and get a speedy reply to his inquiries.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Gallagher are anxious to debate the Shannon River Council Bill.  I will advise the House of the position later this week and of what progress, if any, I can achieve.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also requested a debate on the millennium bug.  Senators Avril Doyle and Finneran made similar requests previously.  I am endeavouring to arrange a debate during the first week after the Easter recess.  I realise the importance of the matter and will facilitate time to suit the Government representative.  We all look forward to debating the issue.</P>
      <P>We can facilitate Senator O'Toole's request for a debate on the death penalty.  The Senators and others requested a debate on the building societies, banks and other financial matters.  In addition, Senator Gallagher requested a debate on the new review group established yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  I will allow time for this in the first week after the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for his comments on the publication of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998.  It will be before the House in the week after the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher also requested a debate on telephone masts and microwaves, which Senator McGowan, one of the longest serving Members of the House, also requested on an earlier occasion.  I will order this debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris expressed concern about an article in this morning's newspaper about colleagues from Queen's University, Belfast, or the University of Ulster, Coleraine, joining him on the universities' panel.  I would rather not refer to that newspaper article at the present time.</P>
      <P>Senator T. Hayes asked for a debate on the River Suir.  Fine Gael has Private Members' time next week and perhaps the Senator could ask his Leader to afford him the time for such a debate.</P>

    <Title>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera) Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this debate on Second Stage of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill, 1997, in the Seanad.  This debate provides an opportunity to review the development of the functions of my Department, in particular those relating to inland waterways and the newly assigned responsibility for islands.  Senators will have the opportunity to express their views on the development of our inland waterways and on our offshore islands and I look forward to hearing them.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill is short, made up of eight sections, it is important.  When enacted, it will confer on the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands certain ancillary functions in relation to property, clarify and extend the Minister's functions in relation to inland waterways and ferry services to offshore islands and amend the Heritage Act, 1995.  There is also a degree of urgency attached to the enactment of the Bill as I have recently received legal advice that my powers under existing waterways legislation to close any part of those waterways apply only to the navigations and not to adjacent waterways property, such as towpaths and embankments.  The power to temporarily close such waterways property is necessary to enable me to carry out maintenance and restoration works on the waterways, including works under the operational programme for tourism.</P>
      <P>I will now deal briefly with the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard interpretative provision and contains definitions of various terms used in the Bill.  It defines inland waterway as meaning any river or lake, including canalised sections of a river or lake, navigation or canal specified in the Schedule to the Bill.  Section 2 provides that I, as Minister, may add an inland waterway to, or delete an inland waterway from, or amend an entry in respect of an inland waterway in the Schedule by order which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and that it is open to either House to pass a resolution annulling the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 sets out my powers and functions as Minister in relation to inland waterways.  The inland waterways to which these powers and functions apply are defined in section 1 and specified in the Schedule.  Subsection (1) provides for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands having a broad role in the management and development of inland waterways.  At present, my powers and functions as Minister in <Col N="1283" /> relation to inland waterways are restricted to the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Barrow navigation under the Canals Act, 1986, and to the Shannon navigation and the Shannon Erne waterway under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has no statutory role in relation to any other inland waterway and is precluded from any involvement with any other inland waterway.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that I may exercise any of my powers under the Canals Act, 1986, and under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, in relation to any inland waterway in the Schedule, but without prejudice to the rights of others under those Acts.  This section would allow me, for example, to exercise my powers to enter on any land to carry out works under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, on the Grand Canal or, if the situation should ever arise, on the Ulster Canal within this State or on any other inland waterway which might be added to the Schedule in the future.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that I, as Minister, shall be empowered to carry out works to public roads where the work is in respect of my functions relating to inland waterways.  At present I am precluded by statute from carrying out works to a public road within the meaning of the Roads Act, 1993.  This, in the context of the extensive programme of development works under the operational programme to which I referred earlier, has given rise to some serious problems.  For instance, it has emerged that Moran's Bridge over the Royal Canal at Mullingar is a public road within the meaning of the Roads Act, 1993, and I am consequently precluded from replacing this bridge, work which is necessary for the restoration of the navigation.</P>
    <P>In addition the necessary grading required on each side of the new bridge would also involve works to a public road.  In order to overcome this problem the Office of Public Works who have the necessary legal powers under the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Act, 1996, are acting as project managers for this project. Similar problems are in prospect in relation to other bridges over the canal.  The provision in this subsection will enable me to arrange for the necessary restoration works to proceed on schedule.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that I may, for stated reasons, temporarily close an inland waterway, any part of an inland waterway or any land adjoining an inland waterway including any towpath or embankment.  This provision is necessary because, as I indicated earlier, my legal advice is that under the Canals Act, 1986, and the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, my powers to close any part of those waterways apply only to the navigations and not to the adjacent waterways property such as towpaths and embankments.  The power temporarily to close such waterways property is necessary to enable me, for example, to <Col N="1284" /> carry out maintenance and restoration work on the waterways.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) is the interpretation provision for this section.  It defines the terms &ldquo;canals&rdquo;, &ldquo;develop&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the Shannon navigation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that I may finance the building, acquisition, overhaul or repair of vessels suitable for the operation of ferry services to inhabited offshore islands in the State and may subsidise such services.  At present, under the Aran Islands Transport Act, 1946, I may contract for &ldquo;a shipping service available to the public for the transport of passengers and goods for reward, between the city of Galway and the Aran Islands&rdquo;.  Beyond this narrow power I have no specific power to subsidise ferry services to islands in general.  This section clarifies the situation and will facilitate the implementation of the five year access plan for the islands.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the functions and powers of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to land and other property ancillary to the Minister's other functions, including power to acquire an inland waterway, to acquire intellectual property, to deal with buildings or other property either alone or jointly or through an agent and to provide financial assistance in respect of matters related to the Minister's functions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 10 of the Heritage Act, 1995, to state that this section shall apply to a building owned by a public authority which has been designated as a heritage building by order made by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands under the existing provisions of the section, and that the provisions of the amendment shall be deemed to have applied and have effect on and from 10 April 1995, which is the date of commencement of the Heritage Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Act, 1995, provided for the establishment of the Heritage Council as a statutory autonomous body and set out its powers and functions.  The main functions of the council, under the Act, are to propose policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national physical heritage. Section 10 of that Act conferred an important function on the council in relation to heritage buildings owned by public authorities, namely, the State, State agencies or local authorities. The intention of section 10 of that Act was to provide that a public authority will not proceed with a proposal to demolish, alter significantly or dispose of a building owned by it which has been designated as a heritage building by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands under that section on the advice of the Heritage Council or any land or other building adjoining such a building contrary to the advice of the council unless the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands agrees to the proposal or to a modified form of the proposal or the Government agrees to the proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> The interpretation of section 10 has been the subject of conflicting legal advice.  While I am satisfied, on the basis of legal advice available to me from the Attorney General, that the provisions of section 10 apply only to buildings designated as heritage buildings by order made by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands under that section, the purpose of section 6 of the current Bill is to remove any possibility of uncertainty over the interpretation of section 10 by amending that section to state explicitly that its provisions apply only to buildings designated as heritage buildings by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill specifies the inland waterways to which its provisions apply and includes the Ulster Canal, in respect of which &mdash; as I previously stated &mdash; a joint North-South feasibility study on its possible reopening has been commissioned.  The term &ldquo;inland waterway&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as meaning any river, lake navigation or canal specified in the Schedule.  As already stated, this debate provides an opportunity to review the development of the functions of my Department, particularly those relating to inland waterways and the newly assigned responsibility for islands.</P>
    <P>The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, now the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, was established by the Government in 1993, with the former Roinn na Gaeltachta constituting the core of the new Department, and with functions and staff from a number of Departments transferring to form the new Department.  The Heritage Service and the Waterways Service were also subsequently transferred from the Office of Public Works to the new Department.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent stewardship by the Office of Public Works of the national heritage and inland waterways over the years prior to the transfer of these functions to my Department.  Following the formation of the current Government, specific responsibility for the offshore islands was assigned to my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to inland waterways, completion and maintenance of the connected waterway network and the promotion of leisure activities and tourism on the inland waterways are my priorities. Our inland waterways are a living part of our industrial heritage, with their own unique ecology, all of which must be protected, while at the same time the leisure, amenity and tourism potential of the waterways should be developed. A major programme of investment in our waterways, amounting to £20 million, is well advanced under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal main line stretches 131 kilometres across the country from Dublin to the Shannon.  An offshoot, the Barrow line, is 45 kilometres long and connects the main line with the River Barrow at Athy, County Kildare.  Improvements planned for the Grand Canal under the operational programme have been largely carried out.  These involved the repair of several kilometres <Col N="1286" /> of embanked sections where the canal goes through bogs, the installation of several hundred mooring posts, provision of new jetties, quays and slipways, improvements to landing facilities at locks, repairs to a dry dock and improvements to culverts.</P>
    <P>The Barrow Navigation is a river navigation with lateral canals by-passing shoal stretches.  It is 69 kilometres long, 17 kilometres is in lateral canals and it extends from Athy, County Kildare, to St. Mullins, County Carlow, below which the river is tidal before entering Waterford harbour. The programme of works is well advanced and includes dredging the navigation channel and the lateral canals, the provision of new landing facilities, moorings, quays and slipways and the restoration of a dry dock in County Kilkenny.  Some of the finest scenery of any Irish waterway is found along the Barrow Navigation.  This waterway has yet to be discovered by a large number of the boating fraternity and indeed by business interests dedicated to tourism.  A consultancy on a marketing strategy for the Grand Canal &mdash; including the Barrow Navigation &mdash; has been commissioned by my Department and a report is expected shortly from the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal stretches from Spencer Dock on the River Liffey, through the north side of Dublin to the northern reaches of the Shannon. It is 145 kilometres long.  There is, in addition, a small branch line to Longford town of eight kilometres. Under the operational programme, £7 million is available for the restoration of the Royal Canal.  At present, approximately 80 kilometres of the canal are navigable from Dublin to Mullingar in County Westmeath.  In Dublin, removal of the low level railway crossing at Newcomen Junction, North Strand Road, has commenced and the installation of a new lifting bridge in its place will remove the last remaining obstacle to navigation to and from the River Liffey. This project will be completed in mid-1999.</P>
    <P>Dredging of the main line of the Royal Canal is now completed.  There are three sections where the canal goes through bogs.  Last year a start was made in repairing the embankments in these areas.  In addition the removal of nine culverted road crossings in County Longford and one in County Westmeath which impede navigation must be undertaken.  Consultants have submitted preliminary reports which set out various options in terms of designs and costs for six of the bridges in County Longford, which the Department is currently examining.  A contract was placed last year for the removal of the culverted road crossing and the raising of the road bridge on the Dublin road in Mullingar, County Westmeath, and works are now under way.  When works are completed next summer a further 30 kilometres of navigable waterway to Abbeyshrule, County Longford, will be available.</P>
    <P>Last year my Department commissioned a firm of consultants to examine the existing water supplies to the Royal Canal, which are on the low side for navigation purposes for the restored <Col N="1287" /> canal, and to ascertain where new supplies can be obtained.  A final draft report has been received from the consultants and is currently being examined by my Department.  A programme of lock gate replacement is also under way which should be finished this year.</P>
    <P>The Shannon navigation offers 258 kilometres of cruising waterway right through the centre of Ireland.  The Shannon navigation is a great success story with about 550 boats for hire, catering for about 50,000 tourists per annum.  A number of significant improvements are under way or planned for this waterway.  These include the extension of the navigation from Lough Key along a new canal, which is about 1 kilometre long, to a point closer to Boyle, County Roscommon, where a new harbour is to be constructed. The new canal will have ancillary facilities, such as mooring, car parking and a shower-toilet block.  This project is now under way.</P>
    <P>In Limerick city the dredging of the Abbey River, the reconstruction of Sarsfield Lock, the construction of a new weir and the provision of floating moorings is planned and work is expected to get under way soon.  This project will greatly improve navigation between the fresh-water and tidal reaches.</P>
    <P>The extension of the Shannon navigation into the River Suck will allow navigation from the Shannon to Ballinasloe, County Galway.  This requires the construction of a new lock at Poolboy, which is well advanced, and the provision of mooring facilities in Ballinasloe.  Additional moorings will be provided at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, and Ballyleague, County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The rivers agency in Northern Ireland, in co-operation with my Department, has commissioned a feasibility study into the possible reopening of the Ulster Canal which would provide a link between Lough Erne and Lough Neagh.  This detailed study will include a full topographical survey, a condition survey of the canal and associated structures, environmental considerations, a water supply and demand study, a navigation study and a preliminary appraisal of the economics of the options.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the results of this study will be available in the middle of this year.  Restoration of the Ulster Canal would complete the last major link in the connected waterways network on this island and would allow boats to navigate from the Waterford estuary in the south-east of Ireland to Coleraine on the River Bann in Northern Ireland.  However, any question of the future reopening of the Ulster Canal will have to be carefully considered in the context of the results of the feasibility study and, in particular, the major costs which would inevitably arise.</P>
    <P>Government policy on our offshore islands is now for the first time under the ambit of one Department, with the islands getting individual mention in the title of my Department.  The section of my Department dealing with the <Col N="1288" /> islands is in Na Forbacha, County Galway.  It is my intention, in co-operation with the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has specific responsibility for the islands, to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the access requirements of the inhabited islands.  Because of their geographic isolation island communities are hindered in their development by inadequate and irregular transport services and at the same time have to bear higher transport costs.  It is the priority of all islands to have a socially desirable, all year round minimum level of secure transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has already visited most of the islands and is in the process of analysing the priorities outlined to him during these visits. Access was one of the main issues brought to his attention on each island visited.  In consultation with local authorities and with other interested parties it is my intention to draw up a comprehensive five year plan to ensure that populated islands, both Irish speaking and English speaking, have suitable access.  Due to the fact that a number of different organisations are involved in the provision of access services to islands the strategy in the past has been somewhat fragmented. However, with overall policy for the islands now firmly established in my own Department and with the other Departments and organisations involved with island requirements fulfilling their own role, I am confident that the problem of access and the associated problem of landing facilities will be satisfactorily addressed during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>Our offshore islands have contributed in no small way to Irish life, particularly in terms of culture, history and language.  We all have a duty to preserve and promote this unique inheritance.  In implementing an action plan for the islands it is my intention to address the many other issues raised with Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív by islanders during his visits, together with those priorities identified by the local authorities.  Fundamental services such as roads, electricity, water and refuse are essential so that islanders can participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation.  Declining population is a major problem for most of our offshore islands.  The report of the interdepartmental committee on Island Development highlighted a 35 per cent fall in the overall population of our offshore islands between 1961 and 1991.  This, coupled with the fact that the average age of the populations on the islands is increasing, has major significance for the economic and social life of our island communities.  It also affects the demand for public services such as health and education.  It is heartening to note, however, that the 1996 census figures show an increase in the population of some of our offshore islands.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the Department of Health and the health boards, it is my intention to ensure access for islanders to all health services at equal cost to mainland communities. Special attention will be given to women's health, including pre and post natal care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> With regard to education, the Minister for Education and Science on 19 September 1997 announced that the means test associated with the remote area boarding grant for secondary school students was abolished from the commencement of the 1997-8 academic year.  My Department has now agreed to provide subsidies on a pilot basis for the ferry services from the islands of Inishturk, Inishbofin and Clare island. These subsidies will ensure that schoolchildren from the islands who are attending school on the mainland will be able to return home at weekends. One return sailing per week is also included in order to facilitate islanders wishing to make a shopping trip to the mainland.  In co-operation with the education authorities every effort will be made to provide education on islands where the provision of such service is sustainable.  I regard the displacement of young children so that they can avail of schooling on the mainland as having a very negative effect on island communities.  It is our intention that the interdepartmental committee on Island Development will co-ordinate activities pertinent to those Departments represented on it.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill before the House, the primary purpose of this Bill is to address deficiencies in the powers and functions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which have come to our attention over a period of time. My Department is still a relatively new Department and it is really no surprise, given this fact and the varied nature of my Department's functions, that certain issues require to be addressed in legislation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must refer again to the degree of urgency attaching to the Bill before this House. I am anxious that, as provided for in section 6 of the Bill, the gap in my existing powers be closed at the earliest possible date in order to enable me to temporarily close property adjacent to waterways, such as towpaths and embankments, for the purposes of carrying out maintenance and restoration works.  I am, therefore, requesting the support of Seanad Éireann to pass all Stages of the Bill today.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech contained many noble aspirations which I hope she will see brought to fruition during her term of office.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the introduction of this Bill to the Seanad.  It comes on stream at a time when a range of new initiatives aimed at allaying the fears of farmers in relation to conservation have been announced, including the appointment of the former State Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, as chairman of a new SAC Appeals Board.  There has been much local concern about special areas of conservation.  Our discussion on this issue comes at a time when there is a general feeling that local concerns should always be listened to and taken on board.  I am sure the Minister will aspire to that feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> We also discuss this Bill at a time when great initiatives and development undertaken by fishery boards, such as the Western Fisheries Board, is currently held up due to lack of finance.  This will have a detrimental effect on the fishing industry unless funding is made available so that the Western Fisheries Board can proceed with the works they have undertaken on the River Clare. I speak of these issues as areas salient to the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, which is effectively a piece of housekeeping bringing on stream regulations controlled by a Minister whose functions require co-operation across a very broad range of activities and impinge on the activities and lives of many people and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I, too, pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the great work they have done in this area. There are other groups, oftentimes forgotten, which I feel should be mentioned &mdash; the national monuments committees of the county councils throughout the country.  These advisory bodies show great interest, but unfortunately their advice and proposals often fall on deaf ears.  I speak having been a member of the national monuments advisory committee of Galway County Council for 13 years.  These bodies are made up of people who have their ear to the ground.  The introduction of this Bill and the granting of powers and functions to the Minister will result in the transfer of powers from the national monuments advisory committees to the new SAC committees.  These bodies should be thanked for the great work they have done.  I would also ask the Minister that the national monument advisory committees be represented on the SACs when they come on stream.</P>
    <P>Our inland waterways have enormous potential. In many instances this potential is only being realised.  When this Bill was discussed in the Dáil there was mention of the development of strong cross-Border co-operation so that people, regardless of their political affiliations or religious beliefs, could see this type of development as having enormous economic potential for the benefit of everybody.  Such co-operation between these bodies, North and South, would lead to enormous benefit for the people of Ireland as a whole.  I support the views of our colleagues in the Dáil with regard to this type of co-operation.</P>
    <P>I see this as a Bill with wide repercussions.  The Minister will have to establish strong relationships with many different bodies in the State and these relationships will have to be open, cordial and devoid of rancour.  There will have to be a close relationship between the Minister's Department, the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards.  A good relationship between the Department and Bord Fáilte is necessary as this is a unique island with beautiful waterways.  This was brought home when my secretary rang to inform me that I would be speaking on this Bill.  At the time I was making my way up the holy mountain of Croagh Patrick with two <Col N="1291" /> esteemed colleagues from the education world, a former chairman of Galway county board, Jimmy Halliday and Pat Gilmour, the Vice President of the Association of Community Schools of Ireland.  As I got the phone call we looked down at the beauty of the lakes below us, with their 365 islands.  We wondered why St. Patrick climbed this mountain.  Many say it was to do penance and to pray for the sinners of the world, but we were inclined to think on that beautiful day that he went up there to look down on the beautiful waterways and islands which are part and parcel of the west.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a beautiful country which has not been destroyed environmentally like other European countries.  This is important when the tourist board market it as a destination.  The tourists who avail of the magnificent lakes and inland waterways find their trips to be a wonderful experience.  It is vital that there be a strong working relationship between the Department, the tourist board and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are implementing many fine waterway development plans involving county managers, officials and local authority members.  In Galway there are plans for the expansion and use of inland waterways, canals, lakes and offshore islands.  I am deeply interested in these plans as a local authority member for County Galway and the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister has stated in her speech that Minister of State Ó Cuív, will have special responsibility for the islands.  His heart is in the islands and I am confident he will assist the island communities as they have great difficulty with access and it is not an easy life they live. Accordingly they deserve every Government support.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the problems in the farming community regarding the special areas of conservation. In the context of this Bill farmers and farming organisations must be brought on board and there must always be channels of communication open between the Minister's office and the farming community.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was being discussed in the Dáil, drugs were mentioned, both the challenges this scourge present to this and many other countries and the danger that the waterways would be used for the transportation of drugs.  I would hope this type of nefarious activity would never appear on the waterways of this country, but we should always be alert and a close relationship between the Department and the Garda Síochána is essential. I speak as a teacher who would be deeply concerned about young people getting involved in the drugs culture.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister great authority and strong powers.  I note that under its provisions island ferry services can be subsidised.  I hope that in the future the Minister will extend the subsidisation of ferry services to other areas which deserve support because they are remote and access is required.  I refer in particular to the area <Col N="1292" /> that extends from Headford in County Galway to Moycullen, with which the Acting Chairman is familiar.  There is a great need in this location for a ferry service between the Kilbeg and Knockferry piers.  There has been much discussion over the years about putting a bridge across the River Corrib which would greatly alleviate traffic and open a gateway between Galway and Mayo.  It would also be of enormous benefit to tourists to this part of Ireland.  However, for various reasons, successive Governments have not provided funds to the local authorities to build the bridge.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider extending her powers to include the provision of subsidised ferry services to remote areas, particularly those which cater for tourists.  This would be of enormous benefit to the people of the area and the tourism trade.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter.  There is no need to carry out any further studies on the benefits of a link up in this area.  The idea of a ferry between Kilbeg and Knockferry should be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from the south Galway area which has been subjected to serious flooding in recent years.  The Minister also has responsibility for this matter.  Many difficulties were encountered by the action group when it endeavoured to develop low cost schemes to alleviate the problem of flooding by the provision of new water channels.  As the Minster is aware, this area has been the subject of a major study recently.  In the context of the Bill, protection should be provided to action groups which propose tested and meaningful low cost alleviation projects, such as the tried and tested scheme in south Galway to deal with the flooding in recent years.  Thankfully, the weather this year has ensured that the terrible flooding of the past three years did not recur.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister important powers. For example, the legislation gives the Minister the power to bring the islands into the 21st century in terms of the provision of access and facilities. These are most important to people who live off-shore on the various islands round the coast.  I am particularly familiar with the three Aran Islands and Inishbofin.  The Bill gives the Minister the authority to do an effective job in providing people with the opportunity to benefit themselves and their communities.  It is exciting legislation which is more important than many people think. It will have far reaching repercussions.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in her endeavours in the context of the Bill, which is important to many people.  The legislation will have major repercussions and strong powers will be bestowed on the Minister.  However, I am sure she will use them in an effective and meaningful manner for the benefit of island communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator McDonagh in welcoming the Minister.  In keeping with the tone of the debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas, I enthusiastically welcome this important Bill.  The Ministry involved has tremendous scope for creativity and as I said previously during the debate <Col N="1293" /> on another Bill, the Minister, Deputy de Valera, has demonstrated that she is more than equal to the task.  I echo Senator McDonagh's comments in wishing her well with this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will not comment to a great extent on the islands, not because I am not interested in them but because my friend and colleague, Senator Cox, whose constituency borders many of the important islands on the west coast, will address that matter among others during her contribution. It is important this enabling legislation includes provision for policy initiatives relating to the islands.  They have been forgotten communities for many decades, perhaps because of a lack of resources rather than political will.  The Bill could not have come at a better time because the country has a relatively prosperous environment at present.  The Minister and her cousin, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, are brimming with ideas and I look forward to their initiatives in relation to access and improving the quality of life of people who choose to live on the islands, which are an integral part of the nation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify an aspect about which I am confused.  Last year in the House, two of our then colleagues, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy and Deputy Brendan Daly, introduced the Shannon River Council Bill.  The purpose of the Bill was to establish an authority which would focus exclusively on the wellbeing of the Shannon navigation area.  As this side was then in Opposition, the Bill was not passed and it is ironic that a similar Bill sponsored by Senator O'Meara was given a First Reading in the House in the past fortnight.</P>
      <P>Although I live in the upper Shannon region, I have great concern for and interest in the entire Shannon area.  As a result of ongoing representations, I contacted the Minister's office after Christmas to establish whether she intended to reintroduce the Bill initiated by the former Senators.  I subsequently received a reply which stated that it did not come within the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and was a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I am confused about how that can be the case because this enabling legislation relates to Shannon navigation. Perhaps the Minister could clarify this matter with her officials during this or the Committee Stage debate.  It is important that such a council is established to assist the Minister in her deliberations.  However, it is a policy matter and I am interested in the Minister's thinking in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the comments made about the Ulster Canal.  The Minister referred to the canal and it is included in the Schedule to the Bill because it is part of her expanded remit on the Southern side, which is welcome.  However, it appears the Department is cautious about the potential cost.  I understand the Minister's position in that regard, but there is a tremendous <Col N="1294" /> ground swell of support on both sides of the Border for this development.</P>
    <P>The current position of the Ulster Canal, as enunciated by the Minister and others in official positions, is similar to that which pertained to the development of the Shannon-Erne Canal; there is a great deal of talk about costs.  It was suggested &mdash; and has not been refuted &mdash; that if it had been left to the civil servants in Dublin, Belfast and London, the Shannon-Erne project might not have got off the ground.  What it required, and received, was a personal political intervention by the two Governments.  As was stated in the other House, the initiative was taken by Mr. Haughey as Taoiseach and irrespective of what one might think about him, given his current travails, the people who live near, work on and gain economic benefit from the Shannon-Erne Canal will be forever grateful to his administration for taking that initiative.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seize this opportunity.  As has been said in both Houses, it would be to her eternal credit if she focussed on the development of the Ulster Canal once she receives the Commission report.  There may be other obstacles which we cannot prejudge, and the Minister has indicated as much, but if the only obstacle is one of funding I suggest that she pursue the matter. Whatever else she does in the Department, this measure would benefit the tributaries of the canal and have associated benefits all the way down to Waterford and the south-east, as she indicated in her speech.  This initiative would stand the test of time and be to her eternal credit.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Irish Central Border Area Network, which was set up about two years ago and comprises representatives from the local authorities in Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim in the South and Fermanagh, Armagh and Dungannon in the North.  This initiative was one of the first initiatives suggested by ICBAN in its first plenary session some 18 months ago, and the proposal was made by the Unionist side, who saw the potential of the project.  In the spirit of the Minister's comments in the other House about cross-Border initiatives, I rest my case in that regard.</P>
    <P>The upper Shannon region, where I come from, has benefited enormously from the active intervention of the Office of Public Works through the years.  The most important local development was the re-opening of the Lough Allen Canal. Whereas the Shannon-Erne Canal development was undertaken by ESB International, much to the chagrin of the Office of Public Works, the Lough Allen Canal development was exclusively under the aegis of the Office of Public Works and it is a credit to their expertise.  The development not only opened up the first lake on the Shannon to navigation for the first time in 60 years, it also regenerated the immediate area.</P>
    <P>However, there is frustration in the Lough Allen basin with what is perceived to the slow rate of development by the Office of Public Works once it had put the structure in place.  Lough Allen <Col N="1295" /> is seven miles long and three miles wide.  If one takes a boat into the lake from Drumshanbo, one cannot get off the boat anywhere else &mdash; one can only moor at two platforms at opposite ends of the lake, both of which are about 300 yards off-shore. Locals are annoyed that the Office of Public Works has not responded to calls from the community and its political representatives to provide on-shore marina facilities for the communities on the east and west of the lake.</P>
    <P>Mr. Pierce Piggot &mdash; who sadly has retired, although thankfully he is still in full health &mdash; took a particular interest in the upper Shannon region. He was the main driving force behind the Lough Allen Canal and I record my personal appreciation of his outstanding work on that project.  Prior to his retirement he was aware that the infrastructure in the area was inadequate &mdash; this relates to the Minister's point about the resources and priorities within the Department.  I urge her to look at the lack of infrastructural development in the Lough Allen basin and examine whether she could kick-start that initiative.  I understand that land was identified on one side of the lake, near Drumkeerin, for purchase for the provision of a marina but I am not certain whether a similar plot was available on the Ballinagleragh/Dowra side.</P>
    <P>This development would be a tremendous economic boon, considering the amount of money involved.  Although Drumshanbo and its immediate hinterland is getting considerable economic benefit, the communities to the north and east are not.  They see boats entering the lake at the Blackrock Lock near Drumshanbo, sailing around the lake, stopping at the platforms some 300 yards from shore, and leaving again.  The people on the boats are not spending money or staying in the area, they go back to Drumshanbo or Carrick-on-Shannon.  The Minister has shown her interest in developing small communities and helping their continuing economic viability in her work on the islands; similarly, she should look at the provision of on-shore facilities for these communities so that people who visit the upper Shannon can get off their boats and spend some of their money.  They will receive a traditional céad míle fáilte in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister respond to queries about the relationship between her Department and the fisheries boards, now that the enabling legislation is in place?  This question relates to infrastructural development.  My area has traditionally depended heavily on coarse angling whereas boating is a relatively new, and welcome, phenomenon.  The Operational Programme for Tourism identified £19 million to be spent on coarse fishing facilities between 1994 and 1999.  I had a number of jousts with Deputy Gilmore, the then Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, about the use of this money.  He was not inclined to devote any of it to on-shore development because he thought his mandate was to spend it anywhere except on land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The single biggest difficulty facing many coarse fishing communities &mdash; not just in Leitrim, north Roscommon and west Cavan but in other areas &mdash; is access to the fishing lakes.  The fisheries boards have done excellent work in providing fishing platforms; the Minister will be familiar with them in her county.  Where they have the resources the boards are also providing road access but in many cases it is non-existent.  It is all very well to encourage people to come from all over Europe to fish in our lakes and rivers but they sometimes have to cross three or four fields or climb over stiles to get to the river.  We need to enhance the product to get added value.</P>
    <P>I am curious to know the funding relationship between the Department and the boards, if not in the current programme then in the one which will run from 2000 to 2006.  The Minister should perhaps take more power to herself in this regard. She is already at the coalface of this development, as she indicated in her contribution, so she should go a step forward and take on some of the development activities of the fisheries boards.  I am not talking about water quality or fish but exclusively about development.  It is a frustrating and cumbersome procedure to have to encourage and make representations to various fisheries boards who, in turn, must pull money from the central pool, while the Central Fisheries Board has to go through the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  That Minister should not be responsible for many of the things the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has outlined here today.  Her Department should be responsible for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and I am curious to know what are the implications of that phrase in this enabling legislation. I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well in her endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and her Department on the extraordinarily good work that has been done on the inland waterways. I support the Bill and its intentions but I would like to ask a few questions.  I have raised with the officials my concern over the Schedule which nominates particular waterways, starting with the Grand Canal and including the Barrow navigation.  Does the Bill include the Longford canal running from the Royal Canal to Longford town?  While I know it is a slightly different case, will it include the new Tralee canal which is now being built?</P>
      <P>I have issued an outstanding invitation to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and a family friend, Deputy Louis Belton, to travel on my boat from Richmond Harbour to Longford Harbour when that section of the canal has been completed.  I am glad to see the work in Mullingar is progressing at some speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not precisely within the area covered by the legislation, the Bill gives the Minister power and authority to improve inland waterways. Will the Minister give me a progress report <Col N="1297" /> on that?  I raise that matter because, unfortunately, the way the development of the Royal Canal has taken place, while probably good from the point of view of the planners, is not very good for the canal users.  One can neither enter the canal from the Dublin end nor from the Shannon end.  While it would be unfair to say that all the work that has been going on for the last seven years has been wasted, the canal it is not usable.</P>
    <P>The most beautiful village in Ireland has to be Cloondara, an inland village with a beautiful and unexpected harbour in County Longford close to the Shannon.  The stretch of canal from Richmond Harbour in Cloondara up to Longford town should be completed as a priority.  A number of bridges on that section need to be cleared. One of the big mistakes made over the years in the Longford area was to flatten a number of bridges over the canal which have made it impassable.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of opening up local areas and giving them something new.  It would take one bridge and a lock to bring boat traffic as far as the picturesque village of Killashee and it would take another bridge to take the boat traffic to Longford town.  That would bring about an extraordinary change in the culture of those areas, extending tourism well in from the banks of the Shannon.  Six bridges between Longford and Mullingar would need to be improved before the canal could be opened.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the canal is open from Blanchardstown to Mullingar but it is difficult to get a boat as far as Blanchardstown or Mullingar unless one has a truck, trailer and clear roadways.  What is the timescale for the completion of that stretch of the canal?</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow changes to take place such as those currently under way at Jones Road and Croke Park which I saw recently.  How does this fit into the plan?  How soon will boats be able to use the Royal Canal?  It would be an amazing tourist attraction to offer cruises on the Grand Canal through Dublin city and county into Kildare, including a trip down the Barrow navigation through the Midlands, including Tullamore, to the Shannon.  Tourists could then cruise up the Shannon as far a Termonbarry and enter the new Royal Canal section at Cloondara, up through north Leinster and back down into north Dublin and the Liffey starting point.  That would be a magical tour by anybody's standards and it would require very little investment &mdash; sorting out 12 or 13 bridges &mdash; to achieve it.  We should impress upon the Government the magic of what is available there.  There is something there which is not available in most other places and it would make the area a very attractive destination.  The Minister should examine that possibility and it should be given priority.</P>
    <P>Section 3(4) states that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may for stated reasons temporarily close&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) an inland waterway, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> (b) any part of an inland waterway, or</P>
    <P>(c) any land contiguous to an inland waterway including any towpath or embankment.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if subsection (c) is correctly worded. Can one close land?  The subsection goes on to mention &ldquo;any towpath or embankment&rdquo;.  Perhaps it should be written the other way around.  I mention this in case it is smartly raised by someone in court in future.  It makes absolute sense to say that the Minister may, for stated reasons, close a towpath or an embankment but I am not sure how one closes land.</P>
    <P>In her response, will the Minister indicate what is envisaged in the phrase &ldquo;stated reasons&rdquo;?  I know some of the reasons involve the repair and upkeep of inland waterways as well as having to make fundamental changes but the Minister should outline the reasons in detail.</P>
    <P>We have a shy Leader of the House who has been slow to respond to our recent questions about the introduction of the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, that will give control of the whole Shannon area to a council.  Although the Leader smiles at us wryly, laconically and sardonically, we do not get a clear answer.  If the Bill was being rewritten I would like to extend it to include the Barrow.  Will the Minister state, for the record, how many Departments have an input into aspects of the Shannon &mdash; be they drainage, fish, river banks, harbours and waterways?  The area also includes industry, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and various port authorities.  So many different groups, including the ESB in Ardnacrusha, have control and every one is a power unto themselves.  The most powerful man in Ireland is surely the one who controls the locks in Ardnacrusha for he can decide to raise the level of the Shannon before going to lunch on any day.  That is real power, even more than a Taoiseach could so.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how many different authorities, groups, companies and Departments have an interest in the Shannon area?  When one takes water from the Shannon to fill one of the canals, how many different groups are we dealing with, including the Office of Public Works?  Does the Minister feel it would tidy up things considerably if there was a council to deal with the Shannon and related matters?  I know that is some way from the functions of the Bill, which in the main refers to canals, but it touches on the Minister's brief in a wider way.  It is important for the Minister to have the powers set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason for the Bill is the phrase: &ldquo;It shall be and be deemed always to have been a function of the Minister.  . . &rdquo;.  I presume this is to allow the Minister to legislate for something that may have occurred earlier.  The wording is similar to that used in previous legislation recognising judges who were incorrectly appointed.  It is a favourite phrase of the parliamentary draftsman.  The Minister is shaking her head; it appears I have interpreted <Col N="1299" /> the wording incorrectly.  Why is it necessary to state &ldquo;It shall be and be deemed always to have been.  . . &rdquo;?  My Latin teacher would have loved the phrase &ldquo;deemed always to have been&rdquo;. I am not sure what case it is.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with regard to the inland waterways.  It is a hugely important area in the developing tourism industry.  It is also important in terms of giving people pride in their place.  I ask the Minister to extend the provisions of the legislation during her term of office.  For example, there is much interest in extending the Ballyconnell canal to Killeshandra.  This would open another community and would simply entail a dredging operation.</P>

      <P>I live in the constituency of Galway West.  There are a number of Irish and English speaking islands off the coast of County Galway. In the past, the English speaking islands have been somewhat neglected.  To this extent I welcome the appointment of Deputy Ó Cuív as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands with special responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It was a good move by the Taoiseach and the Minister because nobody understands the commitment and needs of the islanders, living as they do on the periphery of Europe, to the same extent as the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív.  This will enable him to undertake a worthwhile and valuable job.</P>
      <P>Access and equality are the two most important issues for people living offshore. Access is the greatest barrier to the development of any island.  It is a barrier to employment, education, health care and social development.  A number of weeks ago a deputation visited the Minister for Education and Science.  They had to leave the island the day before, stay overnight in Galway, travel to and from Dublin by train and stay overnight again in Galway after making frantic telephone calls at 4 p.m. to ascertain if they could get space on a boat the next morning to bring them home.  This kind of access is unacceptable today.</P>
      <P>We know what it is like to try and run family households on a budget.  If an islander is not making much money because of the lack of jobs, the additional worry about the cost of transportation for basic things, such shopping or visits to the dentist or doctor, is unacceptable.  Access must be regular, cost effective, affordable and available throughout the year.  It must also be the same for Irish and English speaking islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable that inhabitants of islands off the coast would expect air access.  I hope, for example, that Inishbofin will receive funding for a much sought airstrip, thus allowing it to be connected to the mainland by air.  A number of good airline companies are willing to run a service for the islanders at a reasonable rate.  In this regard I welcome the commitment of the Minister to addressing the issue of access in a planned and <Col N="1300" /> comprehensive manner and to the hard work already done by the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív.  Access must be effective and must make a difference.  Plans to introduce equality of access over the next five years will make life on the islands more accessible and, I hope, more desirable.</P>
    <P>Many people living on the mainland may not be aware of the impact on family life of living on an island.  For example, during the winter months expectant mothers are often compelled to travel to the mainland and live in bed and breakfast accommodation or with family members for the two or three weeks before their due date.  They sometimes have to continue to live in such accommodation after the birth because it is not possible to return to the island home.  Often brothers and sisters are not able to see the new baby until he or she is two to three months old.  They miss their mother, and sometimes their father, from the home for three or four weeks at a time when the birth of a baby has a huge impact on family life.</P>
    <P>The Minister is interested in the health of all islanders, especially the health of women.  A survey by the Western Health Board on the effectiveness of the services on the islands highlighted the inadequacies in the system and the difficulties of access.  An attempt is being made to address these issues.  I am delighted to note that there will be greater co-operation between the Department of Health and Children and the Departments with responsibility for the islands at ministerial and national level.</P>
    <P>The issue of education is uppermost in the mind of the Minster and the Minster of State, Deputy Ó Cuív.  Given the lack of access to boarding schools on the mainland within easy reach, children must stay in digs or guesthouse accommodation from 12 or 13 years of age until 17 years.  That is unacceptable.  It is unfair on those who chose to live on the islands and who make such a contribution to the national economy and to the rural development and life on the islands.  Study for the leaving certificate is difficult enough without having to do it in that kind of environment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment to endeavour to provide education on site on the islands where possible.  When I visited the Aran islands during the presidential election campaign I was amazed at the creativity and enthusiasm of the children attending the national schools and their capacity for hard work.  Their generosity to their visitors led us to believe that the provision of education at home will enable children to return to live on the islands when they have finished their education. It is something to which we should all aspire.  In this regard, I welcome the provision of subsidised ferries on a pilot basis to Inishturk, Inishbofin and Clare Island.</P>
    <P>Jobs are vitally important if we are to encourage people to live on the islands and to develop an economy where island life is sustainable and it makes sense to live there all year.  Tourism is a very big industry, particularly for the Aran <Col N="1301" /> Islands.  However, on a note of caution, we do not want the islands to become too tourist oriented and over developed, because their culture and heritage is extremely important.  One of the reasons people love to visit the islands, particularly the smaller ones, is for the sense of peacefulness and history as they look over the cliffs at the sea crashing against the rocks, which is one of the islands' most important selling points for tourists from America, the Continent and parts of England who spend two and three hours every day in traffic jams.  I would hate to see the islands becoming over developed.</P>
    <P>We need indigenous jobs.  With the move to the computer age and the availability of ISDN lines, the IDA and Forbairt should work to develop on site computer based facilities for the islands. People can work on computers in their homes or community centres using the Internet and other technology to do work sent in from the United States and Europe.  That type of employment is ideal for the islands, given that they are on the periphery of Ireland which, in turn, is on the periphery of Europe.  It would keep young people in employment, generate money, help stem the decline in population and lower the average age of people on the islands.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  Tourism is a vital part of our economy and the islands are a vital part of that tourism.  Our heritage is vitally important and the waterways are a key component in that success. The continued development and guarding of our heritage, waterways and island living are assisted and protected by the Minister and her Department.  I fully support this very necessary Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  The development of the powers and functions of the Minister proposed in the Bill is necessary for the development of the Department, which was founded in 1993.  When driving home last night I heard the end of a lecture on RTÉ in which reference was made to music in education.  It was pointed out that Count Plunkett was the first Minister for the Arts in the Second Dáil.  The Ministry died a death until it was restored as a Ministry of State in 1982.  It was then elevated to a full Ministry in 1993 with the formation of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It was then further expanded and developed into the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It has probably come as far as it is possible to do in such a small country.  I was very struck by Senator Cox's powerful advocacy of island causes.  I will move a little closer to home in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Ministry is established and developed and as experience is gained on the ground, as functions are transferred from other Departments and the Department embarks on its own agenda of work, it is only natural for it to become apparent within a relatively short period of time that the simple transfer of existing functions from other Departments is not sufficient to allow a full scale <Col N="1302" /> Department operate to its full capacity and meet the existing demands to the fullest possible extent.  Therefore, the extension of powers and functions and the further clarification of them in this Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Department was drawn together from many different sectors and Departments in other areas of the public service.  The departmental staff should be complimented on how quickly it got to work in 1993.  There were various ups and downs in terms of its relationships with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance but they have now been ironed out.  The Department is recognised at ground level in every community as providing a very important lead and support, not only in community development but, as has been mentioned, in the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>I hope this will not be the only Bill to extend the powers and functions of the Department in the lifetime of this Seanad.  It may become apparent as the Minister's staff deals in practice with various problems, initiatives and controversies, that further elaboration and clarification is necessary. We would be happy to give such clarification to the Minister if it were needed.</P>
    <P>It is one matter to transfer powers from other Departments but it is quite another to find the staff to implement them.  It is one matter to give the Minister powers in this Bill but another for her to go through the process of having to argue with the Minister for Finance to ensure the Department has adequate staff to meet the demands.  I am concerned it is not possible for the Department to realise its potential without an adequate complement of staff.  It is obvious the Department requires more staff and the Minister would have our full support in her battles and discussions with the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the ongoing difficulty in relation to the National Museum.  A number of us met staff last week who were in the vicinity of the House in regard to the number of contract staff employed in and by the Department.  Those of us who are aware of the Department's work and its various branches on the ground realise the difficulties experienced by the heritage and waterways services in meeting demands.  People are conscious of the potential of the waterways, national monuments, historic properties, wildlife and the national parks service.  However, it is frustrating, not only for those of us active in communities as members of local authorities but also for the Department's staff, not to have adequate numbers of staff to ensure the demands are met. I am afraid that if the Minister for Finance does not listen to the Minister's pleas and does not recognise the Department's staffing needs, communities might start losing faith in the possibility of delivering on the potential which exists.  The Minister has our support in that regard and I wish her luck.</P>
    <P>I will give two examples, of which I know the Minister is aware.  The development of the historic monastic site in Durrow in County Offaly <Col N="1303" /> has been fraught with difficulties since money was allocated to it under the current round of Structural Funds.  It is a difficult subject.  There are legal difficulties in implementing the decision to provide visitor facilities there.  However it is a matter of great frustration to the local committee, the local authority and all interested in the history of the county that the money provided in 1994 cannot yet be drawn down because of legal difficulties. I am aware the staff in the Department do their best when we contact them.  However, I have a strong fear the money will be lost if that matter is not resolved quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently made a sensible decision on the implementation of the habitats directive.  I do not envy her staff who must travel around the country dealing with groups at local level because there is not enough of them to do it.  I have no problem with the concept of the directive.  The arrangements put in place by the Minister's predecessor and advanced by the Minister in respect of the appeals mechanism, consultation, etc., are lovely on paper but unless the national parks service has trained personnel who appreciate community development and local issues and who can listen to people at local level, we might be looking for a further postponement of the implementation of certain aspects of the directive.  I hope that does not happen and that the necessary staff will be put in place to operate the sensible consultation arrangements announced by the Minister. The Clara bog group in my constituency believes the problem has gone away.  However, it remains to be dealt with and that can only happen if there is adequate staff.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the waterways service because the longest stretch of the Grand Canal and a fairly long stretch of the Barrow are located in my constituency.  I welcome the higher profile given to the inland waterways and I compliment the Office of Public Works for the work it did down the years.  The needs of the inland waterways are well represented at Cabinet by the Minister and these developments show the importance of such representation.  The money made available through the operational programmes is being well spent but more is needed.  I hope that, whatever arrangements are put in place for the transition period following 1999, the canal will continue to get funding because we are only starting to realise its potential not only for tourism but also for community development.</P>
    <P>As regards the Grand Canal harbour basin in Tullamore, Tullamore Urban District Council has in its draft development plan zoned the canal area as a location for major development.  In the submission we will make this week to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for urban renewal status, we will focus on the canal as the centre for development in the town.  That will pose some difficulties for the Department because it states that further work must be carried out on the canal basin.  Having grown up beside it, I understand the need for a base there. <Col N="1304" /> We appreciate the fact it is located in Tullamore but the full use of the canal basin and surrounding buildings is not required by the Department. An interesting proposal has been made in our urban renewal plan to provide alternative facilities for the Department and to free up that large area in the centre of the town, the canal basin and its associated buildings for major tourism investment and development.  I hope the Minister looks favourably on that proposal.</P>
    <P>Work has been done by the Department along the Grand Canal in County Offaly.  The Minister's predecessor visited Edenderry to look at work carried out on the first phase of the development plan.  I hope its further phases are put in place as quickly as possible to encourage people to stop off in Edenderry now that tourism trade on the canal has increased substantially.  The Minister's predecessor also awarded one of the barge restoration projects to the development association in Shannon Harbour.  This was an ideal location on the junction between the Grand Canal and the River Shannon.  I hope the support the Department, FÁS and other agencies have given to the restoration project will be continued so that a boat repair project can be set up to provide ongoing employment for boats using both the canal and the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>I support the calls for an urgent debate on the Shannon River Council Bill which was introduced by Deputies O'Kennedy and Daly during the last Seanad and which is now back on the Order Paper.  The Leader said he would try to ensure it is considered as soon as possible.  Co-ordination of the various efforts by the Department, the development association in Shannon, local authorities, the ESB and many other agencies cannot be harnessed properly without a Shannon river council.  I would welcome the Minister's support for such a council and the co-operation of the Department and the waterways service in its implementation if this Bill is accepted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ongoing work to extend the Shannon navigation into the River Suck to connect with Ballinasloe, County Galway.  It is right and proper that it should benefit from traffic on the River Shannon.  I ask the Minister to ensure that work begins on the extension of the jetty and mooring facilities in Shannonbridge, County Offaly, within the funding period of the current operational programme.  It was scheduled to take place after the work on the River Suck but, as we head rapidly towards 1999, there are fears in the area that work may not commence by the funding deadline.</P>
    <P>Shannonbridge, Shannon Harbour and Banagher are the three towns in County Offaly which benefit most from the River Shannon.  Shannonbridge could benefit from more visitors if mooring points were built.  There are no shortage of attractions there but it is a disincentive to foreign and local visitors if existing places are full.  Many will not be inclined to tie up alongside other boats.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could <Col N="1305" /> inform me of the current progress of the work undertaken by the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is the first of many to extend the Minister's work in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Senators spoke about the inland waterways and canals but few mentioned the Barrow navigation which I will now discuss. A number of years ago I did further studies in UCD in landscape architecture.  As part of a major design thesis I studied a stretch of the River Barrow and how tourism could be developed through the medium of the landscape. Much of the background information I got on that project centred around the Brady Shipman Martin report which has gathered considerable dust over the years.  It was taken out from time to time and certain things were done but, unfortunately, the level of commitment required to develop the waterway did not exist.  It is in that context that I welcome this Bill because for the first time the Minister can grasp this nettle.  She should put pressure on the Minister for Finance, particularly with his background in relation to inland waterways, to get all she can.</P>
      <P>The Barrow navigation is possibly the most scenic inland waterway in the country, particularly the area around Graiguenamanagh and St. Mollins, and it has enormous tourism potential. The large tourist area in Kilkenny centres around the medieval city.  Carlow now markets itself as the Celtic capital of Ireland and has good reason to claim that title.  One of the town's main attractions is the River Barrow, the only navigable river in the country apart from the Shannon which links with the Grand Canal and the national canal network.  Developments such as the Shannon/Erne system open up the area of canal navigation for huge tourism development.  I would like to see such tourism developed in the Carlow-Kilkenny area.  Considerable work has been carried out over a number of years in St. Mollins and Graiguenamanagh but much needs to be done in Leighlinbridge, Carlow and Athy. Not many years ago a group of German tourists decided to travel the full length of the Barrow navigation.  The trip took three weeks because of the poor state of the river.  If those tourists were to come back and take on the same challenge today I think they would find their journey much easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major towns have tended to turn their backs on their rivers.  Carlow, with the help of urban renewal schemes, has begun to face back to the river and, fortunately, a private investor has built a marina.  This type of investment must be encouraged.  More mooring points are needed and our lock gates need to be updated, although my preference is for wheel operated lock gates rather than the modern card operated type. Automatic lock gates may be needed on the crowded stretches of the Grand Canal and other waterways but traditional lock gates are part of the fun of leisure boating.  Development of the <Col N="1306" /> Barrow navigation would relieve pressure on busier canals and rivers.</P>
    <P>There is nowhere nicer to walk than along the towpath of a canal or river, surrounded by the wildlife of the river and the surrounding land. Unfortunately, in some cases towpaths are not maintained to an acceptable standard.  At one point in Carlow, for example, an oil lorry backs up along the towpath to deliver oil to a factory. This is a dangerous practice.  Traffic should not be permitted on the towpaths of canals or rivers.</P>
    <P>Because Carlow is the main town on the Barrow navigation it provides a wonderful opportunity for boats to stop.  The town contains much fine architecture and archaeological sites.  Many interesting houses are in close proximity to the river.  The ingredients for an excellent tourism package are in the area but they must be pulled together.  The river could form the back bone of such development and it must take place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Carlow Rowing Club which is the third oldest rowing club in the country boasts, at the moment, two world champions.  Some years ago a suggestion that the river should be straightened to alleviate flooding was vigorously opposed by the rowing club.  Thankfully, a different solution was found to the problem and the twisting, winding course, so enjoyed by oarsmen and women was retained.  Carlow has a history of boating which we wish to maintain and develop.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's commitment to it.  She will be hearing from me from time to time to insure that tourism investment comes our way.</P>

      <P>Tá fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Tigh.  Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal gairid a rá mar gheall ar an mBille seo.  Tá cuid de mo cheisteanna nach mbaineann leis an mBille seo in aon chor ach gabhaim leithscéal an Aire iad a chur.  I welcome the Bill.  I realise that some of my questions may not be relevant to the contents of the Bill but I may be forgiven for finding an excuse to raise some local issues.</P>
      <P>It is only in recent times that we appreciate the benefits that our canals can provide.  Senator Gibbons is correct in saying that many towns through which canals pass do not value them as highly as they should.  Inland waterways were, because of financial restrictions, neglected for many years.</P>
      <P>I must commend the television programmes of Dick Warner.  Dick Warner's personality, as he huffed and puffed along the waterways in his old boat, and his knowledge of history, archaeology and wildlife were inspirational.  The benefit of his programmes to Irish tourism could not be counted. I would hope that future programmes by Dick Warner could be aided by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recently as last weekend I encountered a problem concerning off-shore islands.  A ferry service to the Blasket Islands was established two or three years ago.  Two ferries operate the service. I am not sure if the Blaskets should be called <Col N="1307" /> inhabited or uninhabited islands but the history and heritage of the islands cannot be denied.  The Blasket Island ferrymen have invested approximately £250,000 in two ferries.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to matters that are <i>sub judice</i> or to recent court cases.  However, prior to recent court cases, approximately £2 million of EU funds had been granted to upgrade the pier at Dunquinn.  I understand this may now be pie in the sky and that the money has disappeared. That means the ferrymen will be obliged to continue to land their craft at an awkward spot in Dunquinn.  The proposal and plans that were being put in place seem to have vanished.  It is difficult to provide a complete picture because I do not want to refer to names or the problems relating to the island.  Perhaps this matter could be investigated to see what could be done to provide short-term help.  The ferrymen informed me that a small amount of money would make the pier safer.</P>
    <P>Another issue to which I wish to refer involves the canal in Tralee.  I have no intention of anticipating amendments which may have been tabled for Committee Stage, but I understand the canal is owned by Kerry County Council.  Development of the canal is being carried out by a semi-private company over which the Minister has no jurisdiction. If she did, I would like to have seen reference to the canal in the Bill so that the county council could obtain the various grants available in respect of it.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that legislation is only now being introduced to give the Minister the necessary powers.  I believed these should have been in place when the Office of Public Works held responsibility for this area.  The arguments put forward by the Minister in respect of bridges, footpaths, access, etc., are valid.  I welcome the Bill because it represents a further step towards enhancing our waterways.  To be honest, I have little knowledge of waterways other than the River Shannon and what I learned from Dick Warner's recent television series.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the comments made by the Minister and Members in respect of the Bill, which can only do good.  To realise the potential of our waterways, we need only consider the way traffic on the River Shannon has increased in the past 20 years because approximately 50,000 people now use the river each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution is of an impromptu nature.  Since my colleagues from Counties Offaly and Carlow referred to the Barrow, I thought it best to mention the bit in the middle because it might otherwise fall by default. Therefore, I must make the case for the part of that waterway which runs from above Monasterevan to below Athy and on to the border of County Carlow, and its various tributaries which reach as far as Rathangan and elsewhere.  In addition, I will also refer to the Grand and Royal Canals which also flow through County Kildare. <Col N="1308" /> I commend the Bill and I realise the necessity for it.  I hope the powers it confers on the Minister will be used to the advantage of our waterways.</P>
      <P>My acquaintance with our waterways began over 30 years ago when, in the days before outboard engines, I rowed a boat on the River Shannon from Banagher to Meelick weir.  There was a small harbour &mdash; a relic left by the mill in Banagher &mdash; which, in the past, was used in transporting grain.  At that time, it was extremely rare to see a cruiser on the Shannon.  The only boats of any significance using the river were two large canal barges used for pleasure purposes.  These barges came down from Athlone and when they arrived people in small rowing boats had to beat a hasty retreat to the bank otherwise their craft would be swamped.  That was the extent of the traffic using the river at that time and it is tremendous to see the number of pleasure craft now using the Shannon and other inland waterways.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago I had the pleasure of boating on the Canal du Nivernais which flows through Auxerre in France.  I was informed that several of the French canals were on the point of closure and would have been lost but for the development of the tourist trade.  We must be conscious that we do not lose any of our waterways. In the past there may have been a tendency to consider them superfluous and only of use to wildlife or anglers and it was believed that, as navigable watercourses, they were not of any consequence. It is a matter of significant regret that on the old main road into Naas &mdash; the Cork road &mdash; a bridge was constructed across the canal which would not allow traffic to pass underneath. At the time that was probably regarded as a forward looking development but it had a deleterious effect.</P>
      <P>When the Heritage Act was debated in the Houses, much debate took place in respect of the heritage value of canal locks, lock-keepers' cottages, etc.  A recent occurrence, of which the Minister must take cognisance, is the encroachment of development onto the borders of canals and a loss of lock-keepers' cottages through inappropriate conversions.  Members of Kildare County Council are aware of the necessity to retain the corridor on the banks of the each canal. Senator O'Toole raised the question of land and I am glad the Minister has been given powers in respect of that land.  This will ensure that the more undesirable aspects of development do not occur.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by the Minister's statement that she was precluded by statute from carrying out works to the public roads within the meaning of the Roads Act, 1993.  That is a real problem in parts of west Kildare, particularly in respect of the crude junctions of canals, towpaths and roadways. As the Minister is aware, it is very difficult to get a county council to repair a roadway but it is a downright impossibility to get it to repair roadways, some of which are in an appalling state, beside canals.  We must attend to that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> To return to the Barrow navigation, I attended an important conference in Carlow a short while ago where the interests and users involved with that river assembled.  A good discussion on the future of the Barrow took place and there was a tremendous commitment on the part of those present to ensure the protection and enhancement of this waterway.  I applaud the work carried out by the Office of Public Works.  I saw pictures of the work done at Graiguenamanagh where a pier with fine capstones was rediscovered. Tremendous restoration work has been carried out.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the multiplicity of agencies associated with the river.  Fisheries boards, the Office of Public Works and drainage boards, among others, are responsible for the Barrow navigation.  The problem that arises as a result of that is a lack of coherence in respect of managing the waterway.  One of the buzz phrases used in angling circles at present refers to a &ldquo;catchment&rdquo; approach.  In the case of the Barrow, we are dealing not only with a navigable waterway but also with the rivercourse because the two are intertwined. A strong case must be made, as in the case of the Shannon, for an overall authority to co-ordinate the various aspects of managing the navigation.  It does not seem proper that at the top of the river the drainage boards are responsible for its upkeep, the middle &mdash; the Barrow navigation &mdash; is cared for by other bodies and the tidal area below St. Mollins is the responsibility of the Commissioners for Irish Lights, etc.  Co-ordination is required because there is an element of what I term &ldquo;administrative ball-hopping&rdquo;, where no one takes responsibility.  At the conference, people were not prepared to take responsibility for some of the areas for which they obviously are responsible.  Careful consideration must be given to this issue.</P>
    <P>The integrity of towpaths must be maintained. They are prime examples of unrestricted access where people can walk for long distances, especially as regards walking tours, which are an increasingly important for tourism.  With the increase in tourism traffic, bank erosion must also be looked at.  Banks were not built for cruisers travelling at speed but for horse drawn barges. Edenderry was referred to, where there was a breach in the banks several years ago.  One of the fascinating aspects of that was that it took longer to repair than it took to build, which says something about modern technology.  We sometimes assume we are more able and organised than people were two centuries ago, which is not always the case.</P>
    <P>In the early part of this century, salmon caught in the River Corrib in the morning were shipped at midday and were in the Billingsgate fish market in London the following morning.  I suspect there would be serious difficulty achieving a similar timescale in these modern times when we have aeroplanes.  Perhaps people were not as stupid or unorganised as we assumed them to be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> I am sure the operational programme money will be well spent.  I hope when we are looking for the next tranche of funds, which will be reduced, that moneys of this nature will not be eliminated.  It is important that moneys are channelled into the protection and enhancement of these waterways, to continue the work which has been so well done on the Barrow.  It is a pleasure to see and it makes us very proud to visit that waterway.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for this useful debate which is an opportunity to relay information on this issue.  I hope this will continue in every aspect of my Department.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator McDonagh for his encouraging words on the SACs, the appeal boards and the liaison committees.  I am aware of the anxieties in local communities about the SACs.  Because of that, the Minister of State and I looked at this issue since we entered office to see how best we could involve local communities and give them a direct input.  That is why there is now an appeals board and why the Minister of State and I decided that the best way forward was to have a local input through liaison committees, which would be elected by local people in their respective communities to represent their SAC on an appeals decision.  This is a positive move.  When I was in Opposition I was aware that before the signing of the regulations in February 1997 there was not the kind of consultation there should have been.  I intend to continue the consultation process initiated by myself and the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh is aware of my decision on turf cutting on raised bogs.  We have allowed turf cutting until the end of 1998 to facilitate further negotiation and resolution of the matter.  I have met farming and conservation groups to discuss the issue.  The opportunity for further consultation will be given to those who require it and the same will apply to the negotiations on the compensation package.  Continued turf cutting on the raised bogs within SACs will only pertain until the end of this year and will give us the flexibility to stand back from the situation so a resolution can be found.  All of the groups involved realise this and they have thanked me for giving them an opportunity to bring about that resolution.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McDonagh about the advisory bodies, with particular reference to the national monuments aspect of my Department and county councils.  Councillors have done a tremendous amount of work and are in many respects the unsung heroes for what they have done for our local heritage, particularly our national monuments.  I hope a structure can be put in place so that local heritage plans can interlink with national heritage plans for the promotion of our heritage generally.  Many Senators referred to the cross&mdash;Border study on the Ulster Canal which I will refer to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> The importance of access to education and health for the islands was referred to by most of the Senators and I am pleased they are supporting myself, the Minister of State and the Government in this regard.  Senator McDonagh said the Office of Public Works had responsibility for flooding.  It is not the responsibility of my Department. With respect to Senator Mooney, he confused the role of the Office of Public Works and Dúchas, which comes directly under my Department. It is important to make that distinction. The Office of Public Works, local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government have direct responsibility for flooding.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney and other Senators referred to the Shannon River Authority Bill.  When this Bill was originally introduced in this House, the primary responsibility was with the Department of the Environment and the then Minister and not at any stage with my Department or the then Minister.  I cannot direct Senators on this matter. I suggest they should contact the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about their proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also raised the feasibility study on the Ulster Canal.  The Department felt it was necessary to initiate such a study, which I support, and it is important that we wait and see what the recommendations are.  We should not pre-empt such studies, which are done for a particular purpose by experts in the field who can highlight different issues, of which we do not have specialist knowledge.  It would not be responsible to begin initiating policies before discovering the findings.  I agree we should grasp an opportunity when there is one.  However, it is not only a question of being cautious, but responsible.  We must find what we are prepared to grasp in any such initiative; and, unfortunately, cost must play an important part, not only in this kind of proposal but in every facet of every Department.  We cannot ignore the constraints of finance on creative decisions.  We must see how best we can incorporate and plan for any phased development of such proposals once we can agree in principle to their initiation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators who referred to the canals as an important element of tourism, a fact which was only realised in the past few years.  Senators also mentioned fishery boards.  My Department has an extremely good relationship with the fishery boards and the local communities along the canals.  When we think of canals we should remind ourselves of all the communities along that navigation system.  I am pleased to say that all the elements within that system work very well with my Department and there is good co-ordination there.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that extra platforms for anglers are being provided and that improvements are being made along the canal banks.  One of the reasons this Bill is of great importance is that we <Col N="1312" /> want to be able to maintain, improve and repair our canal system.  That cannot be done under the present legal system, as referred to by Senator Dardis.  The Roads Act is a prime example of this.</P>
    <P>Water quality and fish stocks do not come under the remit of my Department but under the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; water quality is also within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of intellectual property.  This refers to any documentation that would be made available to the general public concerning canals.  This is an important aspect in promoting our canals and we need to refer to this in the legislation.  It is proposed to bring forward legislation covering the general aspects of copyright and that Bill will be brought before the Dáil in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the upkeep, repair and maintenance of canals.  He also asked me to outline all the Departments and agencies involved with our canals.  Those that spring readily to mind are the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, SFADCo, the port authorities, my Department, the ESB, etc.  I would be interested in proposals from Senators for a council consisting of all these bodies so we can adopt a more co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to section 5 which covers the functions of the Minister.  He may be allowing his paranoia to run rife on this occasion but I can assure him that there is no hidden agenda behind this section.  Section 5 states: &ldquo;It shall be and be deemed always to have been&rdquo;. This is drafted in that way because the parliamentary draughtsman and ourselves followed the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for his complimentary comments about my Department and for his encouragement.  Although my Department has expanded since 1993, I agree with him that we do not have enough staff.  I also thank him for saying he is willing to support any &ldquo;battles&rdquo; we might have with the Department of Finance when we try to rectify this situation.  While there is not enough staff in my Department, other Departments suffer staff shortages as well.  Unfortunately, the same rules apply with regard to staffing for every Department and the Senator will be aware of the constraints involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher also mentioned the consultation/compensation process with regard to Clara bog.  I covered this matter in my reply to Senator McDonagh.  Perhaps I could contact Senator Gallagher in writing to give him the up to date position on his specific proposals on constituency problems.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Gibbons said this debate gave him a further incentive to return to this House to express his views on the Barrow navigation system.  I was interested in his views on locks, particularly the use of the old locks as <Col N="1313" /> opposed to the new ones.  As he said, it all depends on the level of traffic.  This issue also needs to be addressed because the old locks have a role to play in our industrial heritage.  We could adopt a logical approach to this issue which could solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis and Gibbons referred to towpaths. They need to be restored because there is more traffic, of a different nature, on them now than was originally envisaged.  The issue of whether horse riding along the towpaths should be allowed has been raised in both Houses.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Fitzgerald's views of the work done by Dick Warner.  I congratulate Mr. Warner on his wonderful work and for whetting the appetite of many people, particularly the young, with regard to wildlife and canals.  It would not be appropriate for me to discuss the Blasket Islands as the matter is still <i>sub judice.</i></P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the Tralee Ship Canal and correctly pointed out that it is owned by Kerry County Council and Tralee Urban District Council.  The restoration works on this canal can be undertaken by the Office of Public Works on my behalf under the operation of the programme for tourism.  It is considered appropriate that the management of this canal should rest with the Tralee UDC and that was the reason I gave in the Lower House for not including it on the Schedule and that is why it is not referred to in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators Dardis and Cox referred to the importance of canals to our tourism industry. Senator Cox also referred to the importance of the islands.  This is only to be expected because she hails from County Galway which has very strong connections with the islands.  I am pleased to note she supports the work the Government is doing in this respect.  Again, Senator Dardis referred to the importance of having an integrated approach to the corridor of canals for their tourism benefits and difficulties caused by the erosion of banks.  I have already referred to this.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their tremendous support and encouragement, not only for me but for those who work in the Department.</P>

      <P>This amendment gives the Minister various functions, for example, to demolish buildings.  It seeks to ensure that it will be crystal clear in the legislation that these powers will be exercised in line with all legal requirements such as planning permission. The Minister will be more familiar than I with the controversy that arose in relation to developments by the Office of Public Works at Mullaghmore which culminated in a revision of planning law by the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government. While the Minister may say that all powers under the legislation will have to be carried out in accordance with the law, I think the reading and implementation of this Bill would be improved if it were specifically stated that the powers were subject to compliance with any legal requirements, as outlined in my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In providing financial assistance under subsection (1)(d) or otherwise to the Arts Council, the Minister shall determine the amount of such assistance as shall be expended by the Arts Council for the sole purpose of grant-aiding the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company, the National Concert Hall Company and the National Theatre Society Limited.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> This amendment proposes that funding for the three national cultural institutions relating to the arts be ring-fenced.  As these are national institutions it is important that the Minister take a direct interest in determining the funding to be made available to them.  I can foresee an element of conflict and competition arising if they are simply incorporated under the Arts Council.  Other national groups and groups at local level sometimes feel too much money is allocated by the Arts Council to institutions in Dublin.  While these institutions are situated in Dublin they are national institutions providing a very important national service.  It would be better to state that these national institutions &mdash; as with national institutions in other areas of culture, such as the National Museum and the National Library &mdash; will have their allocations determined by the Minister.  The Arts Council is then free to proceed with its determination of arts funding for other organisations operating at both local and national level.  I believe this would streamline the allocation process and reduce or eliminate the possibility of competition or sniping between other organisations and these very important national ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Senator Gallagher has made a very important and pertinent point.  If this particular area of funding was ring-fenced and clearly defined it would leave other funding devoid of controversy.  I am a member of an arts committee under the auspices of Galway County Council.  We sometimes feel, as Senator Gallagher has outlined, that we are given limited funding.  Many people decry the amount of funding available for brass bands, the St. Patrick Day parades, pantomimes, arts festivals, drama festivals, the Galway Arts Festival and the Clifden Festival.  If there was a clear distinction, as outlined in the amendment, it would take away the belief of many agencies, which are so deserving of funding, that they are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  If the allocation of this funding were clearly defined it would lead to less controversy when other funding comes on stream.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendment No. 3, there is a feeling in both national and local dance companies that they are not getting the support they should from the Arts Council.  It is unfortunate that dance is not mentioned in existing legislation as an art.  I find it difficult to understand how that could be given the importance of dance in various aspects of Irish culture.  What I am attempting to do &mdash; although perhaps not the most perfect means &mdash; is to provide in legislation greater support for funding for dance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my proposal to include creative communication and sign language, the report of the Council on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that arts for the disabled be given greater recognition.  I am informed that it is unclear whether current legislation empowers <Col N="1316" /> funding for a number of aspects of art involving people with disabilities.  My amendment seeks to specify creative communication and sign language in an effort to try to address some of the deficiencies and ensure this area is properly recognised in law as a legitimate beneficiary of public funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher is to be commended for tabling this amendment.  In my capacity as adult education organiser for County Galway VEC I attended a conference in Maynooth on the importance of sign language.  It brought home to me and those attending the importance of communication, something people with hearing and speech often take for granted. It is important that every assistance be given to these people.  In recent times I became aware of a family with eight children who have hearing and speech difficulties.  What is being proposed by Senator Gallagher is that proper and adequate funding be provided to meet those type of cases. Often those people have great talent which can be expressed through dance or the arts.  The vocational training opportunity schemes provide opportunities for those people through the performing arts groups to get involved in this type of activity.  I am glad the National Council for Vocational Awards has accepted the importance of dance and the performing arts and is providing certification in the area of creative communication.</P>
      <P>This is a fair and important amendment which could have a profound effect on many people and I appeal to the Minister to respond to it in a positive vein.  I strongly support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 2.  I am reviewing the funding arrangements for the National Concert Hall, the National Museum of Modern Art and the National Theatre Society Limited.  It would be premature, therefore, to make provision in legislation as proposed at this time.  I am undecided as to the efficiency and relevance of the new funding arrangements for the National Theatre Society Limited, the National Concert Hall and IMA which were introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Higgins.  I am, however, aware that the National Concert Hall and IMA have never been entirely happy with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 3, I assure the House that I have a particular interest in art for those who are disabled.  I have made it known that I hope the extra moneys given to the Arts Council by my Department to ensure the arts plan could be completed by the end of this year, a year ahead of schedule taking the last Government's time-table, will place emphasis on the question of regionalisation for the arts, the disabled and the Irish language.  I am strongly in favour of access and participation for all for the arts but I cannot accept amendment No. 3 because this is a matter properly within the competence of the Arts Council which may, at its discretion, provide <Col N="1317" /> funding for dance and other art forms, including creative communication in sign language.  It would be inappropriate for me to seek to influence the Arts Council in how it distributes its global allocation or to seek to provide funding for a specific art form.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with regard to dance as it is one element of the arts in which I have a particular interest myself.  The absence of a reference to dance in the definition of the arts has not inhibited the council from supporting the art form to date.  There has been support directly from the Arts Council for dance recently.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to have a general review of the Arts Acts in the light of almost 50 years of operation rather than dealing with the reforms piecemeal.  This is where we could hold a debate on the establishment of the arts in terms of legislation at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister has stated that she is reviewing the funding arrangements for national cultural institutions in consultation with the institutions themselves, I will not press amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding how desirable it might be to amend or review the Arts Acts, what we are seeking is a specific improvement in enabling the Arts Council to fund dance and creative communication in sign language.  I accept the Minister's interest in dance and her exhortations to the Arts Council and that specific absence in legislation may not prevent the council from assisting in this area; but if we brought that argument to its logical conclusion it would not be necessary to provide in law for anything.  My original argument stands &mdash; specific provision for these two areas of creative activity in law will strengthen the applications of groups and individuals who are interested in these two areas in their efforts to secure funding from the Arts Council.  I will therefore be pressing amendment No. 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <P>I ask the Minister for clarification in her reply.  While I have the greatest sympathy and understanding for what is being proposed, I am taken aback that this amendment is being inserted at this time into this legislation.  It may be an enabling Act but its functions relate to inland waterways, ferry services and property ancillary to other functions, including the islands.  It is a quantum leap to suggest an amendment related to directing the Arts Council to expend funding in specific areas which, unfortunately, is not in the remit of the Minister because of derogation of powers.  This is the right amendment in the wrong place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

I was surprised. I had been of the opinion that the Office of Public Works traditionally had a long and impressive list of publications relating to its activities in the area of inland waterways.  I understand this legislation enables the Minister to acquire outside intellectual property along these lines.  How would the Minister see her role in this regard?

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister because this confirms my thinking.  I would like to convey a concern I have about the various visitors' centres throughout the country where there are items on sale relating to the attraction which the Office of Public Works covers.  I declare a vested interest here.  This matter first arose with the Parke's Castle Visitors' Centre in County Leitrim, which is the largest visitors' centre in the county.  The figures for last year indicated that 120,000 visited it, despite the best efforts of my friends and colleagues in County Sligo to claim Parke's Castle as part of County Sligo, as they have been claiming part of Yeats' land for years. I am shouting stop, Parke's Castle is firmly within <Col N="1319" /> the administrative boundary of County Leitrim. It is Leitrim tourist attraction and we guard it jealously.  Others should take their hands off it.</P>
    </Speaker>

They then tell others about this wonderful attraction in County Sligo and encourage them to visit it.  Leitrim has enough problems without its few tourist attractions being removed from it.</P>
      <P>I wish to declare a vested interest.  I was responsible for producing a cassette approximately 18 months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My point arises in the context of the Minister's reply.  I approached the Office of Public Works in relation to Parke's Castle and asked if it would be prepared to purchase the cassette and sell it at the visitors' centre.  I received a firm refusal and I subsequently discovered, as a result of further investigations, that the Office of Public Works has refused on numerous occasions to take on third party merchandise, such as books and other items which relate to the specific attraction. The only items it will sell are postcards or merchandise which is strictly confined to the attraction.</P>
      <P>This is not a matter a policy and I believe a decision has been taken unilaterally by the people in the Office of Public Works who operate visitors' attractions.  I appreciate I am throwing this matter at the Minister in the context of the Bill. However, I ask her to investigate this aspect of her new functions as an extra means of finance.  It would generate more money through the various visitor attractions throughout the country. Parke's Castle is a relatively small attraction but 120,000 people visited it last year and larger numbers visit other attractions.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this matter and I will communicate with her on it also.</P>

I neglected to mention earlier that County Offaly is celebrating the bicentenary of the 1798 uprising and also the bicentenary of the arrival of the canal in Tullamore. The Minister's Department is co-operating with the programme of commemorative events and I hope the Minister will visit the area during the celebrations.  We might then have an opportunity to discuss the other constituency matters I mentioned earlier nearer the location.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment, I understand the three canals were included in the Schedule to the Bill as originally drafted by the Minister's predecessor. However, the references have been deleted and I ask the Minister to explain why that is the case and to ensure that they are restored in the Bill.  The future development of the three waterways and their surrounding areas is most important in terms of local tourism and increasing the complement of tourism facilities available to overseas visitors.  It is most important that the Department has a strong involvement and overseeing function in the continuing development of the three waterways.</P>

      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Gallagher.  I am particularly interested in the Eglington Canal and the Claddagh Basin in Galway.  They are important channels and contribute much to the development of the city.  I am interested in the Minister's response to the amendment.  Perhaps Mutton Island could have been included in the Schedule.  It will come on stream in the near future and will have a hugely positive impact on the city and county of Galway.  However, I am interested in the Minister's reply, particularly with regard to the Eglington Canal and the Claddagh Basin.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 4.  It would not be appropriate at this time to include the waterways in the Schedule.  I previously explained the difficulty with regard to the Tralee Ship Canal in response to a point raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  However, I will reiterate my comments.  The Tralee Ship Canal is owned by Kerry County Council and Tralee Urban District Council.  Restoration works to the canal are being undertaken by the Office of Public Works on my behalf under the operational programme for tourism.  It is considered appropriate that the management of the canal when restored should rest with Tralee UDC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The Eglington Canal comes under the powers of the Corrib Navigation Trustees.  Negotiations are in train with the trustees in respect of potential works to the area round the Parkavera Lough.  Difficulties have been experienced in obtaining a legal definition of this waterway. When this issue has been clarified, the waterway may be added to the Schedule by order.</P>
    <P>Due to the prohibitive costs involved in reopening the Boyne navigation, it is not feasible to consider carrying out any works to the navigation in the foreseeable future.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to include this waterway in the Schedule.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for agreeing to consider the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1998, tonight at such short notice.  It passed all Stages in the Dáil about 15 minutes ago.  The reason for the urgency in dealing with this Bill arises from the need to have the proposed amendments operative as early as possible.  For instance, today is the last day for political parties to furnish donation statements to the Public Offices Commission for the period 15 May 1997 to 31 December 1997.  One of the substantive amendments proposed in the Bill has a major impact on the content of such statements. The content of donation statements already furnished will also be covered by the amendments as well as the donation statements by unsuccessful candidates, election expenditure statements and claims for reimbursement of election expenses in connection with the recent Dáil by-election.  I will deal in more detail with these matters later but they are the reasons for the urgency of the Bill and the Motion for Earlier Signature by the President to be taken at the end of the debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a few substantive changes to the Electoral Act, 1997.  While the Bill contains 18 sections the major changes are contained in just six of them.  The other sections contain consequential drafting amendments and the normal standard sections found in a Bill.  Each section is explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.  The Dáil agreed to six amendments to the Bill which are not covered in the explanatory memorandum and I will refer to them later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> As the 1997 Act was the subject of lengthy debate only last year, I do not propose to deal at length with the principles of that Act.  However, the Government accepts the principles of Part IV of the 1997 Act dealing with the disclosure of donations for political purposes and the amendments proposed will not interfere with those principles. Likewise, the Bill does not make any changes to the expenditure limits set out in the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also required at this stage to clarify certain matters arising from the legal interpretation of some of the provisions in Parts IV and V of the 1997 Act by the Public Offices Commission. While I accept that the commission is independent in the performance of its functions, its legal interpretation of some of the main sections of the 1997 Act dealing with the disclosure of donations and expenditure limits at elections requires that the Oireachtas be more specific about certain aspects of the 1997 Act so that there is no doubt as to the intentions of the Oireachtas.  Some amendments also arise from experience gained from operating the provisions of the 1997 Act which is new to Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 21 of the 1997 Act which provides for the reimbursement of election expenses of candidates at Dáil and European Parliament elections.  The first amendment to the 1997 Act in paragraph (a) was agreed by the Dáil today as a further amendment which was not in the Bill as published.  It provides that candidates at a Dáil by-election will be treated in an equal fashion to candidates at a Dáil general election with regard to the number of votes to be obtained to qualify for reimbursement of election expenses up to £5,000.  The two other amendments to section 21 are drafting amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for amendments to the definition of donation as used in section 22 of Part IV of the 1997 Act.  The first amendment in paragraph (a) provides that benefits derived by a candidate from a service rendered at an election by an individual in the employment of a political party will not be regarded as a donation to the candidate, provided the individual is not in receipt of any extra reward or benefit for that service. This is in keeping with the general thrust of the 1997 Act that benefits derived by individual candidates, elected representatives or political parties from services or facilities which are publicly funded are not deemed to be donations or an election expense.</P>
    <P>Senators who are familiar with their party headquarters will know that it would be almost impossible to apportion the costs of an individual employed at party headquarters over candidates of the party at an election.  This would involve keeping detailed records and increased bureaucracy and expense, especially for the larger parties which may have over 100 candidates standing at a general election.  The administrative work involved in such an exercise is out of proportion <Col N="1324" /> to the benefits obtained by the individual candidate.</P>
    <P>The amendment in paragraph (c) provides that expenditure by a political party on behalf of its candidates at an election will not be regarded as a donation to the candidates, except in the case of a monetary contribution to a candidate which will be regarded as a donation.  This amendment clarifies a point raised by the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>The section also includes in paragraph (d) an amendment to the 1997 Act which provides that a donation received by a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a representative in the European Parliament or a candidate at a Dáil, Seanad or European election will be regarded as a donation to the person involved unless it is passed on by him or her to his or her political party and a written acknowledgement of the donation is received by the person from the party.  In that case, the donation will be regarded as a donation to the party and will have to be disclosed by the party if it exceeds £4,000.  Disclosure by the elected representative or candidate is not required in these circumstances.  This amendment will clear up a legal doubt raised by the Public Offices Commission which would require double disclosure even though an individual was merely a channel between the donor and the intended beneficiary, the party.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties of operating the 1997 Act as it is currently is the requirement on political parties to contact each individual member or branch to obtain details of all donations received in a year in order to ascertain if any donor gave donations the aggregate of which exceeds £4,000.  Section 6(b) will amend section 24 of the 1997 Act to require a donor who makes donations to several members of the same party in the same year to furnish a donation statement to the Public Offices Commission if the donations for the year, when aggregated, exceed £4,000.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to make it unnecessary for political parties, not only the larger parties but also the smaller parties, to introduce elaborate bureaucratic procedures to trace all donations, even very small donations down to raffle tickets, to every member of the party in order to ascertain if the aggregate of donations from any one source exceeds £4,000 in any year.  The large bureaucratic exercise required would far outweigh the benefit sought from the present legal requirement.  The amendment will put the onus on an individual who makes multiple donations to the same or different members of a political party or directly to the party to make a donation statement to the Public Offices Commission.  A member of the Oireachtas, an MEP or unsuccessful candidate at all elections except local elections will still be required to submit a donation statement for any single donation exceeding £500 or multiple donations from the same source exceeding £500 at an election or in a year whichever period applies.  The donation statement by a donor of <Col N="1325" /> multiple donations to the members of the same political party exceeding £4,000 in a year will have to include the names of the political party and of the individual donees to whom the donations were made.</P>
    <P>The Dáil agreed earlier today to two further amendments to section 24 of the 1997 Act.  The main amendment provides that a donation directly to the party as well as to individuals of the party will be included in the total sum of donations made by a single donor in a year for disclosure purposes.  The second amendment is a consequential drafting amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 restates, with amendment, section 24(1)(b) of the 1997 Act and provides for an extra month for political parties to furnish donation statements for the period from 15 May to 31 December 1997.  The latest date for furnishing such statements will be 30 April next; the deadline for submitting donation statements by political parties will revert to 31 March in future years. The extension of time this year is necessary due to the changes proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the insertion of a new section in the 1997 Act to prohibit an elected representative, a candidate of a political party at an election or any other member of a political party from accepting a donation if he or she knows or has reason to believe that the donor in question will be required to make a donation statement and does not intend to comply with the requirement.</P>
    <P>If, notwithstanding the prohibition on the acceptance of such a donation, an elected representative, a candidate of a party at an election or any other member or agent of a party receives a donation in such circumstances, he or she will be required to notify the Public Offices Commission and surrender the donation or its value to the commission.  The Public Offices Commission will be required to cause a copy of such notification to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and to dispose of the donation or its value in such manner as directed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This prohibition on accepting a donation where the donor is considering not submitting a donation statement is a corollary to the change proposed in section 6.  The prohibition in the section demonstrates that the amendment proposed in section 6 is not made lightly and there is no change in the Government's attitude to the principle of disclosure of donations for political purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the 1997 Act provides for offences and penalties for non-compliance with the various requirements in Part IV of the 1997 Act.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for an amendment to insert new subsections (1A) and (1B) in section 25 to designate as an offence non-compliance with the disclosure of section 24(1A) and with the prohibition on the acceptance of a donation or other requirement of section 24A inserted by section 7.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Section 10, which amends section 31 of the 1997 Act, will clarify that the expression &ldquo;election expenses&rdquo; means all expenditure for electoral purposes incurred on the provision of property, goods or services for use during the period of the election.  In the case of a Dáil general election this period commences on the date of the dissolution of the Dáil and ends on polling day.  In the case of a Dáil by-election the period extends from the date of the issue of the writ to polling day and in the case of a European election it commences on the date of the polling day order and ends on polling day.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 31 also clarifies that all election expenses incurred at any time before the commencement of the relevant period for an election on the provision of property, goods or services for use during the election period will also be regarded as an election expense and will have to be accounted for by the relevant election agent.  The reason for these amendments is to assist candidates at an election and the Public Offices Commission in implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>The amendment at section 10(a) defines generally what &ldquo;election expense&rdquo; is for the purposes of the Act &mdash; that is, all expenditure for electoral purposes incurred in the provision of property, goods or services for use at an election during the period referred to in subsection (3).  A revised subsection (3) is included at section 10(c) and it states quite clearly and unambiguously the election periods for a Dáil general election, a by-election and a European election.</P>
    <P>It also deals with expenditure incurred before the operative date.  This is important to ensure that, if expenditure is made in advance of the election period for property, goods or services for use during that period, then the expenditure will form part of the candidate's election expenditure. This will cover such items as posters, leaflets etc., or services of agencies engaged to design which are ordered, delivered and paid for well in advance of an election.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on whether an elected representative's normal constituency work is to be regarded as an election expense. This work was never intended to be so regarded. Normal interaction between an elected representative and his or her constituents is not to be regarded as an election expense.  This was recognised by the Public Offices Commission in the guidelines issued for the recent by-elections.</P>
    <P>Section 32 of the 1997 Act sets out the limits on election expenses which may be incurred by candidates and political parties at a Dáil election. Section 33 provides that election expenses at European elections will be set by ministerial order which must be approved in draft form by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are four amendments to section 32.  The amendments in paragraph (a) and (c) are consequential drafting amendments.  The amendment in paragraph (b) removes the ceiling of 50 per cent of the election expenses of a candidate which may be incurred by the candidate's political party <Col N="1327" /> with the candidate's agreement.  This will le leave it open to the political party and the candidate to agree in writing an appropriate division of the candidate's expenditure limit as may be appropriate to the circumstances.  A rigid limit is not appropriate when one does not know what exactly the expenditure at an election will be.  The removal of the 50 per cent limit will facilitate both the candidate and the political party to come to whatever arrangement satisfies both.  No change is being made in the expenditure limits, only that it will be open to a candidate to agree in writing with his or her party on the part of the candidate's expenditure limit &mdash; if any &mdash; the party can spend on a national campaign or in the candidate's constituency or both.</P>
    <P>The provisions that expenditure by a political party under sections 32 and 33 of the 1997 Act is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the candidate will be replaced by two new provisions which specify that expenditure by a political party under section 32 in a constituency, other than expenditure by the national agent of the party, will be deemed to be expenditure incurred by the candidate and must be accounted for by the election agent of the candidate.  In other words, if the expenditure by a political party is not by the national agent or under this authority, then the expenditure is the responsibility of the candidate and his or her election agent.</P>
    <P>The amendment, at paragraph (d), also inserts a new subsection (4) which clarifies that expenditure by a party in a constituency, including expenditure by the national agent, will be deemed to be expenditure by a candidate for the purposes of the reimbursement of election expenses of the candidate.  This will change the present position that all the expenditure of a party could be used by a candidate to claim recoupment of election expenditure.  The new arrangement clarifies that only expenditure in the constituency can be included in the candidate's claim.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is a transitional provision which provides that a donation statement or a presidential election donation statement already furnished to the Public Offices Commission, or a statement of election expenses to the commission relating to an election held before the coming into operation of the Bill, will be deemed to be valid if the statement in question complies with the provisions of the 1997 Act as they now stand or the provisions as amended by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Dáil agreed today to two further amendments to ensure that donations made between 1 January of this year and the date the Bill is enacted are covered by the Bill's provisions.  The Bill will apply to donation statements to be made by unsuccessful candidates at the recent by-elections. The amendment provision on reimbursement of election expenses will also apply to unsuccessful candidates at the recent by-elections.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the amendments proposed in the Bill will make the 1997 Act, as amended, more <Col N="1328" /> workable for candidates at an election, those to whom the duty of making donation statements applies, and the Public Offices Commission in carrying out its functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is a technical Bill which provides a number of amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997.  It may come as a surprise to some that a Bill passed by the Oireachtas only a year ago now requires to be amended.  Following the recent general election and the strict interpretation placed on expenditure by the Public Office Commission, certain aspects of the Act required clarification.  This is not a criticism of the Public Office Commission which was interpreting the law as it was.  The core principle of the 1997 Act has not been changed by this new legislation.</P>
      <P>There are no new principles enunciated in this Bill and for that reason I do not intend to reopen the long debate which took place on the 1997 Electoral Act, except to say that under the existing Act total spending by a political party in a five-seater constituency must be held below £20,000, under £17,000 in a four-seater and below £14,000 in a three-seater constituency.</P>
      <P>It was always understood among politicians that the capped expenditure related to the period three weeks before an election but politicians were alarmed when they discovered that the Public Office Commission was interpreting this in a different way.  The commission was of the view that money spent by TDs and Senators on clinics, newsletters and advertising during the lifetime of a Dáil or Seanad would have to be accounted for as well.  If this matter was not clarified there would be very little funding left to a politician at election time; indeed, one could find oneself without any funding at all.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1998, makes it clear that from now on election expenses will be calculated from the date of the dissolution of the Dáil until polling day and, if it is a by-election, from when the writ is moved.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a clear distinction between expenditure committed by a politician in carrying out his or her duties and expenditure committed at election-time in order to be re-elected.  That is the most important issue in amended legislation before us.  It goes without saying that money spent on election material before the date of a dissolution will have to be accounted for as an election expense.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides an amendment to the definition of a donation.  Any benefits derived from services rendered by the staff of a political party will not be regarded as a donation for election expenses of a candidate.  In addition, expenditure by a political party on behalf of its candidates at election time will not be regarded as a donation to the candidate.  This is a reasonable approach to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> More importantly, section 5 also provides an amendment to the 1997 Act which will clarify the situation where a Member of either House of the Oireachtas receives a donation which he passes on to his party.  This will not now be regarded as a donation to the person involved but as a donation to the party, provided that the recipient receives a written acknowledgement of the donation from his party.</P>
    <P>Another welcome amendment provides that any person who makes donations to several members of the same party in the same year will be required to furnish a donation statement to the Public Office Commission if, when aggregated, the donations exceed £4,000.  This replaces the existing requirement on political parties to disclose such multiple donations.  This particular change will mean an end to the administrative nightmare for political parties who currently have responsibility for disclosing donations totalling over £4,000.  Under the previous Act, party administrators were legally obliged to gather details of all contributions from local branches but those very same branches were not obliged to tell them anything if they did not want to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the insertion of a new section into the 1997 Act whereby politicians will be legally barred from accepting donations from any person if they have reason to believe the person has no intention of filing a statement to the Public Office Commission.  This will be a rather difficult decision for politicians to make.  They will have to know that a person will not make the return and I find it hard to understand what information has to be made available to them to come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>Another major headache for political parties will also end with the introduction of Amendments 11 and 12 whereby the ceiling of 50 per cent of election expenses of a candidate, which may be incurred by the candidate's party, is being deleted.  Expenditure being incurred by the party will now be deemed to be expenditure incurred by the candidate.</P>
    <P>I understand there is broad agreement among the political parties to the amendments proposed in this Bill.  The changes proposed in the Bill will make a significant improvement and I hope they will be interpreted by the Public Offices Commission in the spirit in which they have been put before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amending legislation because there was much confusion concerning the 1997 Act.  The amendments are both practical and necessary.  Most importantly, they clarify the situation regarding election expenses for candidates from the time an election is called. Dáil and Seanad candidates incur much expense in advertising their clinics in local newspapers and in printing flyers.  I am glad this section of the original Act has been clarified by this Bill.  Other sections concern donations to political parties through a candidate to whom a receipt is forwarded by party headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time I had the pleasure of the Minister's company was in an equally gracious Georgian building when he was also dispensing largesse.  On that occasion it was to a wonderful heritage project and in a judicious manner.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal about this situation from the point of view of political parties.  That is necessary and appropriate because we want to address standards of accountability, transparency and disclosure.  However, I want to make one point strongly to the Minister.  It is regrettable that there is no provision in this legislation for Seanad Éireann, except in so far as disclosure is concerned.  If we are compelled to make disclosures about donations, which I am very happy with, then we should also participate in the benefits. I speak particularly strongly as an Independent.</P>
      <P>When the previous Bill was going through the House under the previous regime, my distinguished colleague, Senator Dan Kiely, made this point fairly strongly.  In the Official Report of 14 May 1997, column 962, the Senator said:</P>
      <P>If the political system is brought into the public arena, Senators and county councillors should be included.  All politicians seem to be tarred with the same brush.  If one politician is reported to have received a donation from an entrepreneur to help run his or her campaign, every candidate is labelled with the same tag. The Seanad elections are different as one does not have a campaign team.  However, there is expense involved.</P>
      <P>That is only partially true.  Independent Members on the University panel will probably have a campaign team and expenses which are not similar to those applicable to our colleagues on the panel system.  The expenses include the production and distribution of an elaborate manifesto to a multiple of thousands of people &mdash; approximately 35,000 in my case and 90,000 in the case of the NUI.  The only method of contacting this kind of electorate, which is very substantial, is to write individual letters to all the people on the electoral roll, which involves a great deal of money in terms of printing, posting, etc.  I stood for election for Seanad Éireann on six occasions over a period of ten years before I was elected.  It cost me somewhere between £50,000 and £60,000 and it took me a number of years of receiving my Seanad salary to pay off the backlog before I received a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to whinge; I am merely putting facts on the record.  Indeed, it would be inappropriate to whinge because nobody told me I must be a Member of the Seanad.  I decided I wanted to be a Member.  It was a personal choice.  I wanted to contribute.  I did not do it for the money, but my access to the democratic process was not assisted by the considerable sums of money involved.  If that was true of me at a time when I was employed by a university in a professional <Col N="1331" /> capacity and had much greater sums at my disposal than the average person, how much more true would it be for a candidate from some of the more marginalised areas, either of the city or the country?</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, be useful to extend this benefit, especially when one takes into account the fact that this expenditure is a <i>sine qua non</i> of political life in the Seanad.  One will simply not be elected without spending this money.  Yet, despite this, and for technical reasons I understand but which I still deprecate, it is not possible even to write off this legitimate expense as a business expense for tax purposes.  There is not even a tax break involved.  This puts people at a considerable disadvantage.  Senator Fitzgerald also echoed this call.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with Ministers of the previous Government and was given an undertaking that this would be addressed, either by additional legislation or supplementary regulations. It is important that we be given an indication that the Government will introduce this kind of legislation.  I speak in a partisan fashion on behalf of those who are Independents.  However, it should be extended to all elements within the House.  I am sure my colleagues in the party system, both on the Government and Opposition benches, would be happy to furnish and support this kind of argument because it appears to be extraordinary that the Upper House should, uniquely, be excluded from the operation of this otherwise worthy Bill.</P>
    <P>When I first ran for election I understand there were fewer than 10,000 registered voters in the University of Dublin.  This could be just about handled by a good team stuffing envelopes, folding material etc.  Nowadays this is virtually impossible within the time scale and we must acquire the services of professional companies who will print, sort, fold and stuff envelopes, etc. It becomes an increasingly expensive operation.</P>
    <P>I made a point on the Order of Business which I now repeat for the Minister's edification and amusement.  It is extraordinary that we are required to fill in forms regarding donations and then get nothing.  On the last occasion I filled in one such form it stipulated that it was not good enough for me to say it was the truth.  I had to have it notarised and then sent in a registered envelope.  I do not wish to be seen as some kind of Protestant niggard &mdash; that is N-I-G-G-A-R-D, in case anybody accuses me of racism &mdash; penurious and penny pinching in the extreme when I say it cost a mere £5.  I grudged it because I went to the inconvenience of filling out this form to say I got nothing and then having to pay for the privilege of returning the information on a notarised form in a registered envelope.  I submitted a bill for my expenses and requested payment by return.  For some inexplicable reason my letter was not replied to.  I cannot understand that; it is most unusual.</P>

      <P>My great friend and colleague, Senator Norris, contested elections to the House on six occasions before being elected on the seventh occasion.  He is certainly consistent, to say the least.  He put a very good case to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am confident the Minister understands the difficulties experienced by all public representatives. He started off in Meath County Council and became secretary of, LAMA which, with his chairman colleague, Councillor Willie McKenna, he considerably enhanced.  I have had the pleasure of being a colleague of the Minister for a long time.  I wish him well.  I did not have the opportunity to speak on legislation he has introduced to the House until now and I am delighted he has become Minister for the Environment and Local Government and look forward to him serving four fruitful years in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section of the Bill which removes the onus from the political parties to the donor because we in Fianna Fáil have to face a mammoth challenge and undertaking.  Our party has 50,000 registered paid up members.  Presumably Fine Gael has 20,000 to 25,000 members. One can only imagine the number of comhairle ceanntair, comhairle Dáil ceanntair, raffles, dances and golf classics, not to mention our national collection and the almost 3,400 cummain that participate and it would not be practical for all those units of the organisation to tabulate their income and make a return to our headquarters.  I congratulate the Minister for acting so swiftly to end a practice which was not really possible.  I can see the logic of where his predecessor was coming from, because he wanted to do everything in his power to put everything above board and in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the section of the Bill which clearly places the responsibility on the donor and makes <Col N="1333" /> it easier for people.  All the secretaries, treasurers, chairmen, vice chairmen and presidents of all the units in all political parties operate in a voluntary capacity.  We are the chosen few of the political party system who are reimbursed for the time we spend in Parliament and working in our offices on behalf of our constituents.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  I know the Bill must be passed by the House this evening for an early signature so I will not delay its passage.  I concur with everything said by Senators Joe Doyle and Dan Kiely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what the previous speakers said.  We all realise elections are a very serious and costly business.  The one election system with which I am very familiar is that for the Seanad; thankfully, I was successful on the two occasions on which I ran.  There is a huge cost involved in running for election to the Seanad. One generally covers 10,000 miles during a Seanad election campaign and Senators around the country have estimated the cost at £1 per mile.  Most of our respective bank managers could confirm we spend about £10,000 on a campaign. All literature and documentation for Seanad campaigns must be funded from candidates' own pockets.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the Seanad election system when we are examining the funding of various elections.  It is crazy to regard the entire country as a single constituency for Seanad elections, requiring candidates to travel thousands of miles.  It would be much more appropriate to adopt the European constituency boundaries for Seanad elections whereby Senators would be elected on a regional basis.  That would make much more sense and I hope the Minister will examine it before the next Seanad election next year or whenever it comes.</P>
      <P>Nobody in the country is well disposed to politicians receiving sums of money or the provision of huge funding for election campaigns.  However, it goes without saying that no politician receives the type of election funding which has been mentioned and inferred by innuendo.  There must be transparency and any subscriptions or donations, big or small, must be upfront.  The provision of funding along those lines is being enshrined in this Bill and there must be no strings attached to, or favours given for, any funding.  We all agree on that point.</P>
      <P>Anyone who contributes to an election campaign does so out of respect for the work done by politicians in their respective areas.  The subject of funding for political parties and politicians has been blown out of all proportion.  I favour legislation to streamline the process and to stop the innuendo, the winks and the nods and the total exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real test will come next year as parties endeavour to entice candidates to enter the local election fray.  We should thank the Minister for giving us an extra year as the elections will not take place until 1999.  However, when that time <Col N="1334" /> comes many will be called but, in the current climate, few will respond because there is an easier way of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports this amending legislation.  It is important to point out this amendment does not change the substance of the primary legislation which was passed last year.</P>
      <P>In the context of all the talk about tribunals, investigations and inspectors, despite the amount of time and paperwork required to comply with the Electoral Act, which provides for declarations by candidates and parties of the accounts of their expenditure on political campaigns, and the legislation which was passed some years ago requiring declarations of Members' interests, these Acts protect our reputations at a time when political, religious and financial institutions which the public respected in the past are under attack and investigation.  That legislation allows us to say to those who put us here that we have nothing to hide and we can declare we got here under our own steam or under that of someone else.  We can then demonstrate that the snide remarks and innuendo which are made from time to time are without foundation.</P>
      <P>I appeal to those in the print media, in particular, who are very quick to throw allegations at us, to spend some time going through the donation statements, declarations of interest and the accounts made by the political parties of their election expenditure.  They will find, by and large, that the type of overblown innuendo and allegations made against Members of these Houses have little or no foundation.</P>
      <P>I recognise it is not easy to carry out that exercise in the spirit of tribunals which are now sitting to examine planning matters and the funding which it is alleged was received by people such as Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  However, it is important to point out those tribunals were established by mechanisms undertaken by these Houses.</P>
      <P>It is important for us, as the primary national political institutions, to show we can regulate our affairs and that we have mechanisms to deal with questions.  The type of allegations about past practices which are now being investigated can be answered or stood over now in a far simpler manner by means of the mechanisms which we have put in place.  The mechanisms put in place by the Electoral Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act will stand the test of time better than many of the self regulating mechanisms put in place by other professional bodies, such as financial institutions, which are also under attack at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments in this Bill, as passed by the Dáil today, have been well drafted by virtue of consultation with all the parties in the House, all of which, bar some of the smaller parties, assented to the proposed changes.  We are supporting this Bill because they are not changes of substance but are required because of practical questions which have arisen in the course of Members seeking to comply with the provisions <Col N="1335" /> of last year's Act.  These questions have arisen as a result of dealings with the Public Offices Commission over the past number of months.  They are sensible questions which will make the legislation more workable and enable us to protect our reputations, stand over what we do in public and defend in an open and accountable way any criticisms or questions levelled at us.  I am happy to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not oppose this Bill, although it is unnecessary and a cumbersome way to achieve a simple objective.  The Houses have run before ill-informed media comment on this issue.  I do not blame this or the last Government for dealing with it, but a wrong decision has been made.  It reminds me of a decision by a previous Government not to give official drivers to Ministers of State.  It makes no sense.  The public believes it is accountability but it is only creating a huge administrative mess.</P>
      <P>Legislation, requiring every Member of the House to make a declaration each year of donations above a certain amount received and to publish their electoral accounts should replace the Electoral Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act.  It is of little value to restrict people otherwise. If Senator Ross and I are on the same panel and it is shown that I receive a certain amount of support and money from the trade union movement and Senator Ross gets it from a business environment &mdash; I am not suggesting he does &mdash; it clearly indicates to the voter from where somebody is coming.  I do not understand how we can interfere with that activity in a democracy.  The legislation should be simplified.</P>
      <P>I am not blaming this or the last Government. When the newspapers wrote about politicians on the take, everyone ran to be open and informative and not to hide anything.  I was appalled to see that the motion on the Order Paper to appoint Mr. Kevin Murphy as the Information Commissioner, which I support, included his home address.  That is an invasion of privacy, even for the Information Commissioner.  We are running in front of a mad view which is ill-informed and mischievous.  Those of us who had pickets placed outside our homes would not wish it on anyone.  Although public representatives must put up with it, public servants should not have to cope with such intrusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a conflict between this legislation and the Ethics in Public Office Act in relation to campaign donations.  This Bill demands that people declare donations for electoral purposes.  Every January, under the Ethics in Public Office Act, Members of both Houses are required to declare donations over the course of the previous year. This means they must declare the same things all over again.  We are tying ourselves up in knots, which cannot be right or necessary.  People should look out for themselves.  When such donations are disclosed and made available to the media &mdash; I am not suggesting they should not &mdash; they will <Col N="1336" /> appear a second time.  What the Minister declared last summer will now appear as an additional amount.  People will then ask did he not get a certain amount of money six or seven months ago and conclude that he is on the take.  We are unnecessarily setting ourselves up for such reactions. We should keep it simple and disclose once a year donations above a certain amount received the previous year, whether for electoral or other purposes.  That form should then be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>I did not believe there was a conflict between the two pieces of legislation.  The Select Committee on Members' Interests of Seanad Éireann asked the Public Offices Commission to clarify if the provisions of the Electoral Act , 1997, requiring Members to &ldquo;register certain political donations are in addition to or are in substitution for the requirements relating to gifts under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.&rdquo; The reply we received stated that &ldquo;Members must comply separately with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Electoral Act, 1997.&rdquo; I want the Minister to state that this should be changed.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to accept an amendment to the Bill to insert a new section which states that candidates who make returns to the Public Offices Commission regarding electoral donations in compliance with this legislation will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, in accordance with those particular donations.  This would ensure we do not have to make two declarations. My proposal will get rid of confusion and clarify the issue for ourselves and those we represent. It will also comply with the highest standards of transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>This issue is like the confidentiality argument. There is a view that honest people tell everyone what they are doing.  If people read my mind from morning to night I would be out of a job.  The idea that leaders cannot have unspoken thoughts or that people should have access to the inner discussions of Cabinet in order to make decisions about running the country is nonsense.  In Dingle, where I was reared, transparency was another word for simple.  If someone was described as transparent, they would not be sent to the quay to buy a box of fish or to the fair to sell an animal. Transparency is not an attractive or a good quality in leaders and I would not be interested in voting for someone who is transparent.  The Government Whip, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, would be able to tell the House where transparency would be held in low esteem.  The idea that someone would tell everyone their business would not be regarded as a source of pride in west Kerry, whatever about the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say he cannot accept my amendment because he is under pressure of time to get this Bill passed because of the dates given.  I ask him to consider it or to indicate in his response how he might address the issues to <Col N="1337" /> which I have referred.  I understand the time limits and why political parties feel the need to support it.  I speak as an Independent &mdash; people who are often considered to be different from other politicians, although I do not consider myself to be any different from or better than my colleagues in political parties.  This Bill is not dealing with what we are required to do.  It is too complicated and steeped in administration and it duplicates another piece of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate and for facilitating the passage of the Bill so far.  I cannot accept Senator O'Toole's amendment although I do not disagree with what he said.  We can, in this or the other House, wrap ourselves in the mantle of propriety and political correctness but I believe that the vast majority of the Members of both Houses, past and present, have been decent, upstanding and honest individuals.  I doubt that we needed to go to such depths to oblige Members to declare their honesty.  Senators will recall the first publication of statements of interests by Members of the Oireachtas under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  I have an abiding memory of the disappointment expressed in newspapers that the statements contained no juicy information and that most of us were working full time as public representatives for a not very large salary.  Even then, the usual suspects insinuated that we had not told the full truth.  We bend over backwards to justify ourselves to people who will not believe even what we swear to or, in Senator Norris's words, have notarised.</P>
      <P>We are not changing the principle of the Bill. The Government did warn that the Bill, as originally drafted, was unworkable.  I have no doubt that we will be obliged to return to this legislation when other aspects of it are found to be unworkable.  I take Senator O'Toole's point about duplication. No matter how carefully the declaration is made Members will always be worried that they have forgotten something, that it will come to light and they will be tarred with a particular brush.  While I cannot accept Senator O'Toole's amendment, the Minister for Finance is preparing a Bill which will deal with standards in public office and I will convey the Senator's views to the Minister and support them.  One declaration of interests should be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act is being amended because sections of it have been found to be unworkable.  The current provision of section 24 of the Act would require a political party to declare aggregate contributions in excess of £4,000.  In order to establish whether a person donated more than £4,000 in aggregate the party would be required to write to every member, every unit and every public representative in the party.  Fianna Fáil, for example, has 50,000 members and each person would be required to itemise and declare to the party general secretary every contribution no matter how <Col N="1338" /> small.  The general secretary would then be required to cross check all donations to see if any individual had contributed a total of more than £4,000.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State and I thank him for coming before the House to deal with this matter of paramount importance to the people of the Cavan-Monaghan area.</P>
      <P>The poultry and mushroom industries are the two most important for people living in County Monaghan.  Poultry and mushroom production account for 47 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, of the county's gross agricultural output. The figures for national gross agricultural output are 4 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.  There are substantial export markets for both products, with a projected increase of 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in the next decade.  The production and processing areas of these industries also create substantial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both industries were developed in County Monaghan by small individual concerns and they have slowly and steadily built on their success. However, as everyone is aware, success often has its downside.  In this instance, the disposal of poultry litter and mushroom waste is causing increasing problems for the county.  At present, we face great difficulty because land-spreading of these by-products is being seriously restricted due <Col N="1340" /> to the high levels of phosphate and nitrogen discovered in the soil.  These high levels are also causing problems in respect of the county's waterways. In 1993, Interreg funded a study which showed that the county's water catchments contain very high levels of contamination and are the most polluted in the country.</P>
    <P>It seems the only solution to this problem is to follow the British example where waste is burned to generate electricity.  From the most recent information I received from the Department, it appears the Government's energy strategy is designed to increase the share of renewable energy generated by independent producers to 6 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>In 1994, when the first alternative energy competition took place, a project was initiated in County Monaghan to establish a plant to generate electricity from waste material.  At that stage, 75 megawatts were available, of which 15 megawatts were to be dedicated to electricity generated from biomass or waste.  A company called Monopower was established and a site was acquired for the proposed plant.  In addition, a group of people involved in setting up the plant travelled to Scunthorpe in England to view a similar plant, which is situated in the middle of a residential area.  At the time in question, successful negotiations took place with the Department of Finance to have the corporation tax reduced to 10 per cent to bring it in line with the rate applying to manufacturing companies.  Everything appeared to be in place to bring the plant to County Monaghan but in the spring of 1995, following a change in Government, the competition was redirected towards wind and hydro energy.  Needless to say, there was great disappointment in County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>A second competition was held in 1996 which resulted in a 30 megawatt licence for north County Dublin being granted to a consortium comprising a US company and the ESB, with the provision that its operation should be up and running by 1999.  My most recent inquiries to the Department revealed that the project has not yet passed the planning permission stage.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because a third alternative energy competition is expected to be announced shortly.  I understand that 19 megawatts will be dedicated to wind projects, three megawatts to hydro energy and seven megawatts for biomass and waste.  There is a need to dedicate at least 15 megawatts from that project to generation of electricity from waste because the projected provision of seven megawatts would not be adequate to cater for the waste material produced in my constituency alone.</P>
    <P>This matter affects the entire Border region, particularly County Monaghan with its poultry and mushroom industries.  It will also affect County Cavan which has a large number of pig producers.  In that context, I wish to highlight the fact that a plant in Denmark burns dried pig slurry to generate electricity.  The provision of an electricity generating plant in the area would be <Col N="1341" /> a bonus to both counties and the Border region, North and South, because many factories involved in these industries are situated on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to explain the seriousness of the situation obtaining in County Monaghan at present.  The problem has become so grave that restrictions will be placed on further expansion of the poultry and mushroom industries.  Recently, fears arose at county council level that planning permission to build new mushroom and poultry houses would be refused on the grounds that there was no suitable site at which people could dispose of waste.</P>
    <P>One of the comparisons made is the cost of such a plant.  I am aware this is an expensive proposal. It cannot be compared to wind or hydro energy because it costs more to dispose of the waste.  For many years Monaghan has been known as an entrepreneurial county and we have depended on individuals who have put their necks on the line by starting industries &mdash; of which the mushroom industry is an example &mdash; which would not have been popular in the early 1980s.  They have done this on their own, although they received grants.  They took many risks and have done a great deal for our area.</P>
    <P>Most of our farmers are small farmers and many of them have mushroom and poultry units on their farms to earn a living from them.  The situation is so serious that we are at risk of losing our small farmers.  I cannot stress highly enough the importance of such a project to our area.  I am fed up of hearing about the Celtic tiger because we, particularly the small farmers in the Border regions, have not seen the face of the Celtic tiger. If something is not done in the near future, it will sound the death knell for our agri-business, particularly mushroom and poultry production.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to Monaghan in future competitions.  We are an entrepreneurial county and although the wheels were set in motion for this proposal, it was unfortunately taken from under our noses.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Leonard for raising this urgent matter.  I know it is close to her heart and in the interest of her constituency and she has already raised the matter with me outside this House.  I welcome the opportunity to clarify for the House the role of my Department in the development of alternative energy sources and the related but separate policy on waste management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium recognises as key issues the implementation of waste management policies, the control of farmyard pollution and the use of alternative energies. My Department is responsible for identifying and supporting the development of alternative energy sources.  Significant steps have been taken to increase the use of renewable energy, including biomass-waste, in the electricity production process. In 1995, my Department announced the <Col N="1342" /> results of its first alternative energy requirement competition, AER I, which offered contracts for a total of 111 megawatts of additional electricity generation capacity from alternative sources. Twelve megawatts of that total were for landfill gas electricity stations.</P>
    <P>As a follow on, in December 1995 a second competition, AER II, was launched to secure an electricity generating station of between 10 megawatts and 30 megawatts fuelled by either biomass or waste, or a combination of both.  The winning AER II bid was for the construction and operation of a 30 megawatt waste to energy facility in north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>In early 1997, my Department announced the details of the AER III competition.  This competition seeks to secure an additional 100 megawatts of electricity generation capacity from renewable energy sources and includes a sub-target of 7 megawatts from biomass-waste.</P>
    <P>This competition is being conducted by ETSU, an independent agency retained by my Department. The results of that competition will be announced in the coming weeks, probably this side of Easter.  The type of project mentioned in the motion would constitute a qualifying project under that scheme but at this stage I cannot comment one way or another on the likely winners. Indeed, neither I nor my Department are privy to the detail of bids in the competition.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the AER competitions is to support those projects, identified in a competitive bid process, as the most economically efficient alternatives to conventional generating capacity and the adverse environmental impact of such technologies.  It is not open to me to give preferential treatment to any project under the AER programme.  On the contrary, any such action could be immediately challenged under competition law.</P>
    <P>In addition to the AER competitions administered under the aegis of my Department, the European Commission administers an EU THERMIE programme.  The programme can provide up to 40 per cent of the energy technology costs of projects, including biomass-waste projects.  THERMIE has been the catalyst for considerable growth, enterprise and innovation in the Irish energy sector and for this reason all Irish THERMIE supported renewable energy projects now qualify for an ESB power purchase agreement of up to 15 years.  The EU Commission launched the last call for proposals under the current THERMIE Programme on 17 September last.  I have no way of knowing the likely winners but the opportunity to submit a qualifying project presented itself.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I have to inform the House that the objective of this motion, justified solely on environmental grounds and seeking to address what is first and foremost an agriculture issue, is not compatible with the established principles for identifying successful alternative energy projects.  It would most likely fall foul of the competition rules or the rules on State aid.  Furthermore, <Col N="1343" /> outside of the AER process, I simply do not have the funds at my disposal for such a project.</P>
    <P>I opened this contribution by emphasising the separate key issues of the use of alternative energies, waste management policies and the control of farmyard pollution.  The fact that preferential treatment cannot be given to the proposal under alternative energy competitions does not foreclose <Col N="1344" /> on the opportunity to bring forward to the appropriate authorities proposals which would deliver an acceptable solution under the latter categories.  However, any such decisions are outside my remit.  All I can simply advise at this juncture, in relation to my area of responsibility, is to await the outcome of the AER III competition.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 April 1998.</P>
