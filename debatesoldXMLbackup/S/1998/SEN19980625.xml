      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to provide suitable accommodation for the FCA unit in Granard, County Longford.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1, Second Stage, to be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; Senators may share time.

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. What business does the Leader propose to ask the House to transact between now and the end of this session?  The flow of advance information from his office has been very helpful in recent times and I thank him for that.  Yesterday the photograph on the front of <i>The Star</i> was raised and the House expressed in general the public revulsion about that picture.  It has had a big reaction outside.  Over recent weeks all parties have had reason to feel aggrieved about the way, each in different ways, they have been handled by sections of the media.  It is natural that this should be so as there should always be tension between <Col N="322" /> politicians and the media.  However, at an early stage in the next session we should try to have a debate on the nature of the media in Ireland, the need for a press council and so forth, but it should be a two sided debate.  There are important issues about which we need to hear from the media's perspective.  It might be possible for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to look at a way this debate could break ground where we could invite representatives of the media into the House to put their point of view so that it does not just become a media bashing exercise, which would be of no help to anybody and would end up with both sides feeling aggrieved.  In a constructive way we are moving into a new era in public life and it might be a helpful and useful exercise for the House to do something along those lines.  I will talk to the Leader and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the House will go into recess?  I know he may not have full information and that there are problems related to building; certain commitments have been given to make space available for the people who must start building the new Seanad offices. However, at the same time we need to make our own plans.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue related to Senator Manning's comments.  Speaking as an Independent &mdash; and this is not to be seen as a criticism &mdash; the parties are almost feeding the frenzy in the media currently.  What may have been an appropriate way of accounting in 1990 may be seen as totally unacceptable in 1997.  It has reached the stage where nobody knows what is right or wrong and all new information is seen as wrong, whether it is or not.  People are past the stage of passing a judgment; they simply accept that an individual got money from somewhere and it appears to be wrong.  I raise this issue because we have a duty to assess this issue.  I am not directing it at parties given that I also receive contributions about which I must make declarations under the 1913 party political fund.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two appeals.  The parties should own up and say how they did their business because this will come out anyway.  I prefer to see the parties controlling it and saying &ldquo;this is what we did and if somebody says it is wrong, we will correct it&rdquo; so that they at least manage the way the news is released.  That is an important point. I am not trying to open a debate on that now, but it could be dealt with in the debate requested by Senator Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may be on the point of making a most serious error in that he intends to set up an ethics committee comprised of people from outside the Houses.  If anyone is to set the standards for politicians it should be politicians themselves. I know that would be initially assaulted by the media but it is up to us to be seen to make it work and to create trust and confidence.  I plead with the Leader to appeal to the Taoiseach not to go down the route they have gone down in <Col N="323" /> Westminster.  We must set our own house in order, take the rap, implement the rules we draw up and ensure they work.  I ask the Taoiseach to have that sense of trust and confidence in politicians from all parties and in both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>You never give me that much latitude.  I thank the Leader for agreeing to have a debate next week on the Murphy report on swimming abuses before the end of the session.</P>
      <P>I support the call by Senators Manning and O'Toole for a debate on the media, which we probably cannot have before the autumn. Members of this House regularly complain about a broad range of issues concerning the media &mdash; yesterday there were complaints about a photograph in extremely bad taste and at other times complaints are made about the media's feeding frenzy on political issues.  It is time we discussed the issue of whether we should have a body such as a press council or whether we should, as I believe, extend the remit of the office of the Ombudsman to include monitoring the activities of the media.</P>
      <P>I condemn the huge bomb blast in Armagh last night and those who are still recalcitrant and determined to wreck the peace settlement in Northern Ireland.  I wish well all the political parties which have striven so hard over the past 30 years to obtain an agreement and I hope today's Assembly elections will have a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important issue is the last one raised by Senator Costello.  We had hoped we had come to the end of having to condemn bombings and atrocities on the island.  Unfortunately, there was another malicious attempt yesterday to derail the peace process and the British-Irish Agreement.  I support the call made by the Northern Ireland newspapers this morning for people to ignore the attempt to provoke them to vote in a particular direction.  It is to be hoped that, as was stated yesterday, those candidates in favour of the Agreement will get the endorsement from the electorate which they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning and others referred to the photograph in <i>The Star</i> yesterday of a body floating in the Liffey.  Yesterday I asked <i>The Star</i> if any expert advice had been sought before that photograph was published, to which I have not received an answer.  Another body was taken from the Liffey this morning in my home town of Newbridge.  That must be seen in the context of the comment on the front page of <i>The Star</i> which stated &ldquo;But perhaps some good, however minimal, may come as a result of this new tragedy&rdquo;. It appears there was another tragedy at 8.30 a.m. <Col N="324" /> today in my home town.  I ask the <i>The Star</i> to consider if it had any influence on that matter.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate for us to discuss broadcasting and the press in an early debate in this House.  I agree with Senator Costello that, irrespective of whether it is a press council or an ombudsman, there must be some system of regulation of these matters, even if it is voluntary self-regulation.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that these issues have not been debated.  However, they have been debated very fully; there were repeated debates on the matter here when Deputy Neville was a Senator, which I do not think received any coverage. This moralising is, therefore, rather hard to take.  Deputy Neville wrote a very good article on the subject which appeared in my local press &mdash; I wonder if the national press gave any consideration to publishing it.  It is untrue to say these issues have not been discussed.  I find some of what I read in <i>The Star</i> this morning difficult to take in the context of what I know happened earlier today.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to be in conflict with any Senator on the Order of Business or to be repetitive.  However, I must remind Senators that the only matter to be decided on the Order of Business is the business to be taken in the House on any particular sitting day.  Any matter which does not impinge on that is not relevant to the Order of Business and any Senator raising such a matter is not really in order.</P>
      <P>However, there is a tradition in the House that a certain amount of latitude is allowed to the Leaders in the House, which I wish to continue. There is also a tradition that Members are allowed to request debates on matters which they consider to be of importance.  I do not wish to curtail that tradition but I ask Senators to be as relevant as possible in their contributions and to ensure their interventions are not very lengthy.</P>

      <P>I will be as relevant as possible. The Leader indicated we will have debates on agriculture and the North next week.  However, I wish to raise a matter which is urgent in view of the serious allegation which was made when the Council of the West met Oireachtas Members. The council stated there have been blockages of development funds for the west.  Will the Leader make time available to discuss this serious matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of conscientious and serious people are participating in a programme to develop the west.  If those people believe that any Oireachtas Member is involved in blocking that <Col N="325" /> programme we are entitled to debate it.  In May 1996 the then Taoiseach announced an allocation of £100 million for that development programme. It is time for the House to seek clarity on and debate that matter and give an assurance that no one is involved in any attempt to block that development.  &ldquo;Blockage&rdquo; is an unfortunate term to use and I ask for an urgent debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>Given the importance of tourism to the economy, will the Leader ascertain from the Government when it is intended to appoint a new chief executive to Bord Fáilte?  When, if ever, is it intended to fill the other two vacant senior marketing positions?  It is of great concern that no progress is apparently being made on these matters.  Consequently, the industry is being left rudderless.  The strategic direction of Irish tourism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange, as a matter of urgency, a debate on road safety?  I know we have had such a debate but on my way to the House from Mullingar this morning I had to stick my car to the road to avoid hitting a motor cyclist. There is a practice among motor cyclists to weave among traffic, which is very dangerous.  It is outlawed in other countries.  It should be outlawed here and it is time something was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we debated car insurance, especially its application to young drivers.  Insurance companies seek telephone number insurance premiums from young people, especially those under 25 years of age.  Premiums can be higher than £2,000.  It is unreal and discriminatory.  Will the Leader invite the appropriate Minister to the House to debate the matter and have it rectified? <Col N="326" /> I have practical suggestions, but I will not preempt the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Leader's reply to our request yesterday for a debate on the hazard of nuclear waste.  A debate is urgent in view of the report launched last night by Dr. Thompson. Every Member can have a copy within the next few weeks.  The threats to Ireland and England and the fact that in England alone over 100 local authorities would join a nuclear free local authority association whereas none would have joined in 1985 indicates the seriousness of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request for a debate on the media and on standards in the media.  Those of us who think democracy is important must be appalled to see how rumour can be elevated to the status of reality and how allegations can be given the same attention as facts.  That has happened repeatedly in recent weeks.  If it continues it will amount to a steady erosion of democracy.  It is time we signalled our intention to debate this and related issues logically and calmly, especially with regard to public service broadcasting, with a view to insisting that those who expect standards of others maintain some standards in their work.</P>

Ní raibh focal Gaeilge in aon díospóireacht ó tháinig an Seanad seo le chéile, beagnach bliain ó shin, agus mar sin tá súil agam go mbeadh díospóireacht anseo le gairid faoin nGaeilge.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate as soon as possible on overseas development aid? At the meeting yesterday of the Subcomittee on Overseas Development Co-Operation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs concern was expressed about the problems in Sudan where 1,200,000 people are in danger of dying within the next few months if the international community does not react positively, not only to the position there but also in many other countries.  The debate needs to consider how the international community is working to alleviate poverty.  The EU has cut off £264 million worth of aid to the poorest countries in the world following a judgment by the European Court of Justice on a case taken by the British Government, which should be ashamed of its action.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader call on the Minister for Health and Children to urgently address the ridiculous stand off between the Eastern Health Board and the voluntary organisation involved in the establishment of a centre for homeless children?  Both parties are refusing to talk because of a dispute about the running of the <Col N="327" /> centre.  The Taoiseach officially opened it months ago, but it has not been in operation.  At present, upwards of 60 or 70 children are roaming the streets of Dublin.</P>

For next Tuesday I will propose statements on bovine levies, the Urban Renewal Bill, the Turf Development Bill and statements on Northern Ireland; for next Wednesday the Parental Leave Bill, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages; the Turf Development Bill &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages; Fianna Fáil Private Members' Business and statements on the interim Murphy report to the Minister for Tourism Sport and Recreation, which was requested by all sides of the House yesterday.

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Quill, Dardis and Costello expressed concern about the consequences of the article in <i>The Star</i> yesterday, which the newspaper tried to justify again on its front page today.  It is a shameful exercise.  I said all I had to say on it yesterday.  I do not wish to add credence to any further action taken by <i>The Star.</i></P>

      <P>It is harmful to say the least and I agree with the sentiments expressed here this morning.</P>
      <P>I will, as a matter of urgency, arrange a debate on the media and the establishment of a press council.  I agree with Senator Quill's comments on the media's expectations of standards from their public representative.  We will ensure they too have standards and that they are accountable.  We are entering an age where people are asked to deny or justify printed speculation.  That is irresponsible and it is not something we have become accustomed to in Ireland.  We will not lower our standards to those of another country across the water.  We are proud of our values and we will not stand by as parliamentarians and let this happen. The media is unwilling to cover Seanad Éireann because its deliberations are unspectacular and do not give rise to speculation.  There is an urgent need for a press council in Ireland and it is time it was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> Senator McGowan requested a debate on the blockage of funding for the west.  I assure the Senator the blockage is not on the Government's side.  I will inquire into the matter this morning and come back to the Senator this afternoon. Second Stage of the Urban Renewal Bill will be taken today.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, one of the best known Ministers from the west, will be in attendance.  Perhaps Senator McGowan will inquire about the position of him.  He will have first hand information.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan called for a debate on the hazards of nuclear waste.  I will arrange for a debate on this topic in the next session. Senator McDonagh requested a debate on the Irish language. Senators O'Toole, Ó Murchú and the Government Chief Whip, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, all express views in Irish.  I would welcome greater use of the Irish language in the Chamber.  As Senator McDonagh knows, we have the right to use the Irish language if we wish.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan called for a debate on overseas development and I will leave time aside for this.  Senator Liam Fitzgerald raised the issue of the homeless children roaming the streets of Dublin and the urgent action required by the Eastern Health Board to alleviate this situation by opening the residential care unit immediately. I will discuss this with the Senator after the Order of Business and contact the Minister's office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be here today on a matter that I know is of great interest and importance to the Members of the House.  I am sure nobody here will forget the economic conditions which prevailed in the 1980s, conditions which discouraged investment generally, and led to no investment at all in our less attractive urban areas in particular.  There is no doubt that much of the development which the tax incentive based urban renewal schemes has brought about would not have occurred without the benefit of those incentives and it certainly would not have happened in the areas where it has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an overstatement to say that the success of the various urban renewal initiatives taken since 1986 has far exceeded everyone's expectations. Much of the large scale dereliction and <Col N="329" /> urban decline which prevailed until the late 1980s has been eliminated.  Areas previously written off have attracted extensive investment in commercial and residential development, bringing new life to the core of cities and towns which were in serious decline.  We must acknowledge, however, that we have been fortunate the later years of the urban renewal schemes have coincided with the strongest period of growth we have ever experienced. That is not to say that physical decline in urban areas is no longer a problem.</P>
    <P>It is now reasonable, however, at this time of strong economic growth, high levels of investment, a booming construction industry and pressure on house prices, to question the need to continue with the tax incentive based urban renewal schemes.  My response to that question is that, provided we start to look at urban renewal from a different point of view, then there is most definitely a very strong case to continue with the scheme.  Such a new perspective is one which takes account of the social dimension to urban renewal policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for a new urban renewal scheme, one of the key goals of which will be to nurture and enhance the social dimension to urban renewal.  This requires the integration of issues such as community development, education and training, employment and local economic development opportunities into our future plans for physical urban renewal.  The objective will be to ensure that the benefits of urban renewal accrue to the many less well off communities in disadvantaged urban areas and not just to developers, investors and new residents. This new policy focus is intended to be responsive to the deep rooted spatial, socio-economic divisions in many urban areas.  It also forms part of the new public policy approach to tackling poverty and social exclusion &mdash; reflecting the growing view that marginalisation and poverty can only be addressed through changes in core policies and service delivery structures and systems.</P>
    <P>Urban disadvantage and poverty can be linked in three ways.  First, there is a higher risk of poverty in areas of urban deprivation.  Almost one-third of all poor households live in public housing in our five main cities.  Second, there is evidence that residents of urban areas with high poverty concentrations experience cumulative disadvantage in terms of long-term unemployment, educational disadvantage and social isolation.  Third, the quality of life in areas of urban disadvantage is significantly inferior to that in more affluent areas in terms of crime levels, drugs, environmental conditions and socio-economic features such as access to banks and shops, local business activity and the provision of recreational amenities.</P>
    <P>The Government's national anti-poverty strategy recognises that tackling poverty in Irish society cannot be left to social welfare mechanisms alone.  Intervention across a wide cross-section of public policy measures is required.  Disadvantage <Col N="330" /> in urban areas is one of the five key themes of the strategy, with urban renewal identified as one of a number of policy actions which can make a contribution to achieving the objectives of the strategy.  It is vital therefore that urban renewal programmes for the future identify the potential community gains arising from initiatives in this area, including measures to increase local employment, support the development of local economic bases and provide for social housing and environmental improvements.</P>
    <P>In 1996, ten years after the first urban renewal scheme commenced, it was time to carry out a review &mdash; informed by an in-depth study &mdash; of the schemes as they have operated up to now.  Such a study was commissioned from a team of consultants consisting of KPMG, Murray O'Laoire Architects and the Northern Ireland Research Centre.  The report from the consultants suggested that physical urban renewal can no longer be seen to operate in isolation.  The delivery of wider economic and social benefits under the scheme in future would require a more focused, integrated strategy.  The consultants made the following statement:</P>
    <P>Urban renewal must address the physical, economic, social and environmental regeneration of urban areas having regard to the local situation, the overall situation and any individual conditions.  As such, the diversity of issues urban renewal policy must address, has led to the conclusion that, in the future, measures and programmes for renewal must be linked to area based integrated strategic planning.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the recommendations from the consultants the key elements in the new approach to urban renewal which the Government has adopted are as follows: the new scheme will provide for a more targeted approach to the award of urban renewal incentives, both in terms of their scale and in the areas to which they will apply; under the new scheme designations for urban renewal will be based on the concept of integrated area plans, which will address not only issues of physical development such as appropriate use, quality of design and conservation, but will also cover wider issues of local socio-economic benefit, including training, education and social housing; integrated area plans will have to identify targeted, focused sub-areas for designation, justify the proposed designation by reference to the objectives of the plan and indicate the basis on which incentives are sought.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Government took office last year I appointed an expert advisory panel to assist me in preparing for the new scheme.  The panel's terms of reference included the provision of advice on guidelines for identifying priority areas for which plans should be prepared and on the suggested content of plans.  The panel has also been asked to assess the extent to which completed plans comply with the guidelines with a view to providing advice to me in the making of recommendations in relation to proposals for designation. <Col N="331" /> Guidelines as finalised by the panel were subsequently issued to county councils and county borough corporations which were given responsibility for identifying and prioritising the most appropriate areas for which plans might be prepared having regard to the criteria laid down in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>The criteria for selection of areas for which plans should be prepared included relevant development plan policies and objectives, the extent of physical decay and social and economic disadvantage in the area, the need for incentives to support development in the area and the capacity to benefit from such incentives, together with the potential for synergy with other area based plans and programmes.</P>
    <P>On the important issue of the size of urban areas most likely to be suitable for consideration under the new scheme, the guidelines made the point that few towns of less than 6,000 population received designation under the schemes up to now and that such towns would be likely to have even greater difficulty qualifying under the criteria for the new scheme.  This indicative population level has been the subject of debate since the guidelines were issued.  My response has been that the guidelines did not seek to set a minimum population threshold as such for the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The population level mentioned is of an indicative nature only and does not equate to setting a strict population threshold as such.  It does, however, reflect the fact that the scheme is concerned with urban renewal and that it must therefore, of its nature, be confined to areas with strong urban characteristics.  The indicative population level also reflects the fact that the successful implementation of a scheme of this nature in an urban area requires a minimum level of scale.</P>
    <P>A number of requests to have the 6,000 population guideline reduced were received.  The issue was considered by the expert advisory panel as part of its overall consideration of the guidelines for the new scheme.  The panel's recommendation was that the 6,000 guideline should remain unchanged on the basis that while it is only a guideline, it provides a reasonable baseline indication of the minimum size of urban area likely to be able to meet the criteria for designation under the scheme.  We must remember that we are talking about urban renewal, not village or small town renewal.  No town will, however, be excluded solely on the basis of population.  All the criteria spelt out in the guidelines will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The designation of an area for tax reliefs under the new scheme can only be considered if it falls within an urban area which the relevant local authority decides is a priority area for which an integrated area plan has been prepared.  In that context, if a town with a population of less than 6,000 was considered to be a priority, the relevant local authority must, as in all other cases, demonstrate clearly how that area meets the criteria for the new scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> As regards the content of integrated area plans, the guidelines for the new scheme make it clear that these plans should create a vision for the future of the area to which they relate which balances physical development, economic and community development, conservation and environmental and amenity improvements.  Within core urban areas in particular, conservation of the built environment is expected to underpin the strategy of any plan for such an area.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report on previous urban renewal schemes recognised that a number of excellent conservation initiatives had been undertaken in designated areas under the schemes operating up to now.  The report found that it was in those areas where conservation objectives have focused on the reinforcement of the essential character of an area that they have been most effective.  However, in many designated areas the practice of conservation, according to the consultants, simply resulted in the gutting of buildings and the retention of facades.  This may have been variously attributable to the difficulties of complying with statutory building and fire regulations, the misfit between new uses and old buildings or the widely cited problem of cost.</P>
    <P>To facilitate reconstruction and improvement work on existing buildings, my Department has issued revised technical guidance on the national building regulations which took on board a number of suggestions from the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland.  The institute, in partnership with my Department, is currently working on a further special technical guidance document for work carried out on buildings of outstanding architectural and historic importance, including listed buildings.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme consultants also found that there was a tendency to concentrate on the retention of isolated historical features and facades.  They were of the view that there is a need to evaluate the total spatial, social and historical context of each building in a streetscape. That is why the guidelines on the 1998 urban renewal scheme which issued to local authorities specifically addressed the issue of conservation and set out a basis on which the problems highlighted by the consultants' report might be addressed, while taking account of best practice in terms of both building and streetscape conservation.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report also noted that, in the absence of a strategic policy on conservation at national level, it was not surprising that there have been mixed results from conservation initiatives in designated areas.  However, since the time that report was published, the Government has made significant progress on the overall issue of building conservation, particularly with the publication last month by my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, of the Government's proposals, entitled <i>Protecting Our Architectural Heritage.</i><Col N="333" /> These proposals will deliver on a commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium by putting in place three significant measures.</P>
    <P>The first of these consists of a proposed new planning Bill which will transform the legislative protection afforded to architectural heritage.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will also bring forward a Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory basis.  The inventory will act as a crucial database in identifying buildings throughout the State which are worthy of protection.  Second, I am pleased that the Government has given approval for a new budget line of £5 million per annum from 1999 onwards to ensure that the package of measures can be fully implemented. Approximately £4 million of this will be available for grant aid for protected buildings.  The remainder will go on the third measure, employment of the necessary conservation expertise to ensure that all buildings worthy of listing are identified, the legislation enforced and the grant scheme operated effectively.  The employment of adequate expertise and knowledge by local authorities will be specifically supported with central guidance and support as necessary.</P>
    <P>The new conservation measures being introduced by the Government will closely complement and help to underpin the approach to conservation required under the integrated area planned approach to urban renewal.  There is strong emphasis in the guidelines for integrated area plans on preference for refurbishment of existing buildings for sustainable uses over new buildings.  Plans are expected to show how incentives can be used to support investment in conservation and repair and adaptation to new use.</P>
    <P>This Bill is directly linked with the provisions for tax reliefs for the new urban renewal scheme included in this year's Finance Act.  The application of those reliefs is subject to the passing by the Oireachtas of an Act providing for the renewal of certain urban areas and the submission of integrated area plans in respect of areas identified on the basis of criteria drawn up by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into four parts.  Part I is made up of mainly technical provisions dealing with matters such as the Bill's commencement and definition of terms used in the Bill.  Part II deals with integrated area plans, including the functions of local bodies and the Minister in relation to these plans, and also with rates remissions.  Part III clarifies and extends certain additional functions to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which was established under the provisions of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997.  The opportunity is taken in Part IV to make specific statutory provision for the urban and village renewal grants which are being made to local authorities and certain other conservation bodies under the urban and village renewal sub-programme of the EU co-financed Local Urban and Rural Development <Col N="334" /> Operational Programme.  A number of amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, are also provided for in Part IV.  While these tax legislation provisions are included in this Bill, the intention is to incorporate the provisions subsequently in the Taxes Consolidation Act via the 1999 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 6 deal respectively with the issues of the Bill's short title, various commencement provisions, interpretation of terms used in the Bill, the linking of the Bill with the relevant provisions in the Finance Act, the appointment of authorised companies for the purposes of the Bill's provisions and the payment of any expenses that may be incurred by the Minister in administering the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the drawing up by county councils and county borough corporations or companies authorised by them of integrated area plans, which I might later refer to as IAPs, for a part or parts of their areas for the purposes of the new urban renewal scheme, with provision for the inclusion of part of the area of another county council or corporation, with the consent of the latter.  Section 7 also lists objectives which must or may be identified in an IAP.  These objectives include the securing of the economic and social renewal of the area and its physical renewal with provision for addressing the various issues relevant to the renewal of the area.  The section also requires consultation with a wide cross-section of interests in the preparation of lAPs.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that lAPs may contain or be accompanied by recommendations from local authorities or authorised companies that parts of the area to which a plan relates should qualify for tax incentives or alternatively that the whole of the area to which a plan relates may qualify for certain of the residential incentives in certain circumstances. The provision allowing residential incentives to be applied throughout an area to which an IAP relates, where this can be justified, has been framed to take account of the recommendations in the Bacon Report on House Prices by confining this option to conversion or refurbishment of existing property in the case of section 23 type relief for rented residential accommodation and to residential property for owner-occupation.  Section 23 type relief for new rented accommodation could only be applied in sub-areas within an IAP area where this can be justified.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides that in recommending the application of incentives a local authority or authorised company must have regard to the following criteria: consistency between the types of development for which urban renewal reliefs are to be provided and relevant provisions of an integrated area plan; the significance of the reliefs to be provided in a qualifying area for the overall development objectives of such a plan; market conditions in the area covered by the plan; and the nature and extent of any impediments to the development of <Col N="335" /> the type envisaged in the area in which the tax reliefs will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, having considered an IAP, to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance that an area or areas within the area covered by an IAP should qualify for urban renewal incentives.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows rating authorities to remit on a sliding scale over ten years the rates leviable on premises constructed or improved over a period to be specified by order of the Minister, within an area covered by an IAP.  This provision would allow rating authorities to grant rates remissions on this basis in any urban area covered by an IAP regardless of whether tax reliefs are applied in the particular case.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that developments qualifying for the tax reliefs must be consistent with the objectives of the relevant IAP, with local authorities providing certificates to this effect.</P>
    <P>Section 12 covers the putting in place of arrangements for monitoring and reporting for each year on the implementation of IAPs in cases where areas within the area covered by the plan become qualifying areas for the purposes of tax incentives.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, section 13 provides, for the avoidance of doubt, in response to legal advice given to the authority, that the authority may recommend to the Minister for Finance that one or more of the relevant incentives for the docklands as provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, may be applied to qualifying areas in the docklands area.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that qualifying developments in the docklands must be consistent with the master plan for that area and that this must be certified by the docklands authority.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in section 15 to allow minor variations to the Dublin docklands master plan by the council of the Docklands Authority to take account of any changed circumstances that may have arisen since the adoption of the plan without the need to invoke the full review procedure in relation to the master plan provided for in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 16 increases the present limit on borrowing by the authority from £50 million to £100 million to support the major investment to be undertaken by the authority in implementing the master plan.  Section 17 makes specific statutory provision for the grants payable under the urban and village renewal sub-programme of the local urban and rural development operational programme.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 contain the provisions which will be incorporated in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, at a later stage.  Section 18 will have the effect that double rent allowances for lessees of buildings can apply irrespective of whether capital allowances were granted on a <Col N="336" /> building.  This is in line with the taxation provisions in relation to the new scheme under which the intention is that the Minister for Finance may direct that areas within the boundaries of an IAP shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of any one or more of the urban renewal tax incentives.</P>
    <P>There have been ongoing consultations with the European Commission on the applicability, in the context of EU rules on State aids, of the various tax incentives for the new urban renewal scheme, the pilot rural renewal scheme for the upper Shannon area and for those in the Custom House area in so far as these schemes are of benefit to commercial and industrial development. I want to give the House some background information on the circumstances which have led to this.  In May 1997 the European Commission wrote to the Irish authorities about the enterprise areas tax incentive scheme.  The reason for its writing was the extension of the enterprise area scheme in the 1997 Finance Act to the regional airports and the press publicity generated by that decision.  After lengthy discussions and examination, the Commission approved the enterprise areas designated in the 1997 Finance Act last December but retained the right to examine each airport enterprise zone designation on a case by case basis as they arose.  As a result of these developments it has become necessary to obtain EU Commission approval for the new urban renewal scheme and the new rural renewal scheme, both of which will have to be notified to it.</P>
    <P>The Commission is also examining a proposal regarding the extension of the capital allowances for buildings in the extended Custom House area beyond January 1999.  Apart from some transitional cases, it will also be necessary to notify the European Commission about the tax reliefs in the wider Dublin docklands area; EU Commission approval is not necessary in the case of tax reliefs for residential accommodation. However, a problem has recently emerged in regard to the continued availability of the double rent relief for tenants of buildings in all tax designated areas in the context of the new European Union regional aid guidelines which are to come into force.</P>
    <P>The Commission officials consider that this relief is not compatible with the new guidelines in the context of Ireland's improved economic position and, therefore, should not be granted, except in limited cases.  The EU Commission's objections are not expected to arise in the case of the capital allowances for commercial and industrial development but these will be subject to the aid intensity ceilings, arising in 1999, under the new regional aid guidelines.  There are still many issues which have to be resolved between ourselves and the EU Commission before the full picture with regard to the future availability of the various allowances becomes clear.</P>
    <P>With a view to assisting in obtaining EU approval for the new urban and rural renewal schemes, certain changes in the existing taxation <Col N="337" /> provisions relating to these schemes are provided for in section 19.  The effect of the provisions contained in the section is as follows.  In the area covered by the rural renewal scheme, double rent allowances for lessees of buildings will apply only for activities specified in regulations to be issued by the Minister for Finance setting out the circumstances in which those allowances would comply with the Commission's rules on State aids. In the new rural renewal scheme where double rent relief continues to be available, 50 per cent capital allowances will apply as heretofore to commercial buildings, but where double rent relief is no longer available 100 per cent capital allowances will apply.  In the new urban renewal scheme, 50 per cent or 100 per cent capital allowances may apply for commercial buildings but 100 per cent capital allowances will not apply where double rent relief is also available.</P>
    <P>The selective incentive specific designation process which is part of the urban renewal scheme will be operated in a way which ensures that the incentives for this scheme are applied in a way which complies with EU requirements.</P>
    <P>Arising from delays in obtaining EU approval to an extension of the current deadline for the incentives in the Custom House Docks area and the EU objections to certain aspects of the incentives as they have applied to development in that area up to now, including double rent allowances in particular, it has become necessary to modify current legislative provisions relating to the incentives in that area.  The proposed modifications are provided for in section 20.  Specifically, section 20 extends, from l May 1998 to 1 August 1998, the deadline in section 409A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, by which a contract for the development of a building in the Custom House Docks area must be entered into if it is not to be affected by the £25,000 ceiling which has been placed on the amount of capital allowances which a passive individual investor can offset against non-rental income in any given year.</P>
    <P>Section 20 also provides for the following variations as between particular termination dates for the different tax reliefs in the area: 24 January 1999 for double rent allowances; 31 December 1999 for the residential reliefs; and also 31 December 1999 for the capital allowances for the construction of commercial buildings.  However, where at least 51 per cent of the qualifying expenditure is incurred before 1 January 2000, the capital allowances qualifying period will be extended to 30 June 2000.  These changes will come into effect by way of an order to be made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that the process of selecting areas and preparing lAPs has been ongoing since last year.  The total number of lAPs received by my Department was 78 &mdash; well beyond the 50 or so we anticipated.  Given that the urban renewal scheme applies in 35 urban centres at present and in view of the well signalled intention that the new scheme will be targeted at the areas <Col N="338" /> where needs are greatest, it is clear that there will have to be limitations on the extent to which designation can be applied under the new scheme. Widespread and extensive designation would defeat the whole purpose of the new scheme. However, until such time as all the lAPs have been fully assessed by the expert advisory panel and recommendations made to me, no decisions will be announced.  This process is continuing with a view to ensuring that decisions on designations can be announced as soon as the new scheme can be commenced, following the completion of the continuing negotiations with the EU.  At this stage there is no possibility of a decision being made now by 1 August 1998.  It is more likely to be late September or early October and that is assuming the European Commission does not make further objections.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the new urban renewal schemes being prepared by county councils and by county boroughs in an effort to provide urban renewal reliefs to these areas.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal schemes were first introduced in 1986 as a result of the passing of the Urban Renewal Act.  This provided for the designation of certain areas where tax incentives would be available for the redevelopment of such areas.  This measure was badly needed at the time because there were many areas in the country, especially in our large cities, where large tracts of land in the middle of city areas were lying derelict. This was particularly true of Dublin.  I remember as a member of the planning and development committee, that, prior to 1985, we had received very few applications for development in the inner city.  If development was taking place at that time &mdash; and there was very little development taking place in the mid-1980s &mdash; it was taking place in green fields.  It would also have to be remembered that in the mid-1980s we were in the middle of an economic recession, the building trade was at its lowest ebb and there was a strong case to be made for the introduction of a scheme to promote investment in our cities and towns. Tax measures and other financial incentives in the Urban Renewal Act gave that incentive to developers and the redevelopment of our inner cities and towns commenced.</P>
      <P>In Dublin many schemes were initiated which provided for the rejuvenation of the centre of the city; the quays were rebuilt and many other areas of the city which were lying derelict benefited from the development which was taking place.  I have in mind the Custom House Docks and the Temple Bar areas of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1985 the only developer providing accommodation in the inner city of Dublin was Dublin Corporation with the provision of local authority housing, and it was essential for a living city that we have a mix of social and private housing. Many of the residential apartments that were <Col N="339" /> built as a result of the tax incentives did bring a balance of public and private housing into the inner city.  I think one of the weaknesses of the redevelopments which have taken place is that the residents by locking themselves away in their apartments seem to exclude themselves from the rest of the community.  I hope in time that the new residents of these apartments will play their part in the community in which they reside.  In hindsight &mdash; hindsight is a great gift and I will refer to it later &mdash; we should have insisted that a certain proportion of apartments being built at that time, perhaps 10 to 20 per cent, should have been made available as social or affordable housing.</P>
    <P>It was right that this scheme, after running for more than ten years, should have been reassessed and the then Minister for the Environment commissioned KPMG &amp; Associates to study the urban renewal scheme.  This study is the basis for the legislation before the House today.  Indeed, the study itself was critical in many ways of the urban renewal scheme.  While the urban renewal scheme had many benefits for our cities, as I have outlined, nevertheless there was a cost involved and I believe if the study does anything at all it brings to our attention the cost to the taxpayer of the urban renewal scheme in the ten year period between 1986 and 1995.  Almost £2 billion was invested in designated areas and £500 million was invested in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>It must be said, and said often, that this had a positive effect in terms of residential and commercial development.  Without this incentive, even though the economic climate had improved, the developments we have today would not be in place.  It must also be said that the investors, developers and new residents have benefited exclusively from this scheme, sometimes at the expense of poorer communities in disadvantaged areas.  The consultants were quite clear on this issue when they stated that urban renewal must address the physical, economic, social and environmental regeneration of urban areas, having regard to the local situation, the overall situation and any individual conditions.  As such the diversity of issues that urban renewal must address has led to the conclusion that in future measures on a programme for renewal must be linked to area-based integration of strategic planning.</P>
    <P>In a city like Dublin, where £500 million has already been invested under the urban renewal schemes, there are still large areas of social exclusion and deprivation.  Of the 11 disadvantaged areas formally identified by the Drug Task Force nationally, ten are in the Dublin region with seven in the Dublin Corporation area and the remaining three areas in South Dublin County Council.  The impacts of social exclusion are many.  They generate a sense of hopelessness; it continues the cycle of unemployment and can be a major cause for crime, vandalism and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Recently I attended a function where the Taoiseach launched a programme for the protection of children in a run down area of Dublin.  I do not wish to name the area because it will only stigmatise that area further.  I was horrified to see the social exclusion and deprivation that still exists.  It is very important that local authorities in the greater Dublin area prepare plans to address specific geographical areas of exclusion and urban renewal within their remit.  Integrated area plans have been prepared by South County Dublin for Tallaght and Clondalkin, Fingal County Council for Blanchardstown and Balbriggan and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council for Dún Laoghaire town centre.  Dublin Corporation has prepared five integrated plans to cover the HARP area, Kilmainham/lnchicore, O'Connell Street, the north inner city and the Liberties/Coombe area.  There is no doubt that the implementation of the integration area plans will act as the engines for the comprehensive development of localities which, without such focused strategies, are destined to experience further social, economic and physical decline.  I am of the view that the implementation of integrated area plans should be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about one of these integrated area plans, the HARP, which mean the historic area rejuvenation project.  The north west sector of Dublin's inner city is an extensive area which supports a growing population. It is an area with distinctive architectural and civic design character, strategically located in the heart of and abutting the city centre.  It is a short walk from the thriving retail and cultural centres of Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  The area is clearly defined by and is separated from the remainder of the city by O'Connell Street to the east, the River Liffey to the south, Collins Barracks &mdash; now the new National Museum &mdash; to the west and the old Richmond Hospital buildings to the north.</P>
    <P>In spite of the area's strategic location, the north west inner city has suffered from a significant decline in its economic and social fortunes since the end of the 19th century.  This is reflected in extensive physical decay and dereliction, a run-down physical environment and significant areas of social and economic deprivation.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation for some time has recognised both the area's strategic importance within the inner city and the urgent need to reintegrate this area into the physical, social and economic mainstream of the city's life by designating the core of the area as the Smithfield Rejuvenation Area in the 1991 Dublin City Development Plan, with the objective of seeking its rehabilitation and renewal.  The adoption of the HARP plan as an integrated area plan will consolidate the programme of physical regeneration undertaken as part of the HARP framework allowing private investors to take advantage of the rehabilitation of the physical environment and the consequent changes in the perception of the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> It could be said that the HARP integrated plan was before its time.  It was probably the first plan of its type to adopt an integrated approach and its finalisation pre-dated the present legislation. Nevertheless, the integrated approach is similar to the proposed integrated approach outlined in the guidelines in this Bill.  It provides a scheme of tax designation of selected sub-areas and developments to provide the necessary linkage to ensure that the social and economic objectives &mdash; jobs, enterprise floor space and community facilities &mdash; are targetted so as to be of actual benefit to the local community.</P>
    <P>With the expected ending of the URBAN community initiative at EU level, it is imperative that the specific measures supported are continued and strengthened with funding from the Government so that the development programmes and the unquestioned success which the pilot programmes have achieved are not &ldquo;once off&rdquo; or &ldquo;short lived&rdquo; initiatives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals which the Governments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The proposed introduction of a new planning Bill which will transform the legislative protection afforded to our architectural heritage is very welcome.  At present, I am a member of a group known as &ldquo;The Historic Heart of Dublin&rdquo; which is an EU funded group carrying out an inventory of buildings in the city which will act as a crucial data base in identifying buildings which are worthy of protection.  I am also pleased to note that the Government is making funding available for the conservation of historic buildings. Each year Dublin Corporation in its estimates provides more than £120,000 for the conservation of buildings in Dublin but, as chairman of the planning and development committee, I am saddened each year by the number of very genuine applications to which no assistance can be given.</P>
    <P>I understand that more than 80 integrated area plans have been received by the Government from local authorities and I further understand that only about 50 of these will be successful.  This Bill includes no mechanism for the selection of these areas.  The Minister might, in his reply, indicate the mechanism that will be used to select the successful plans.  I hope the areas of greatest need will be given priority by the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the Dublin Docklands Authority and its functions.  I am pleased that the new conference centre has been recommended by the Government for the docklands area.  This will be the flagship of the area and I hope it will be approved by Cabinet if it has not been already.  I am a member of the Council of the Docklands Authority.  The general duty of the authority is to secure the social and economic regeneration of the Dublin docklands area on a sustainable basis and to improve the physical environment of the area.  The authority has prepared an excellent master plan for the area.  This plan envisages that over the next ten to 15 years 11,000 new apartments <Col N="342" /> and homes will be built in the area and that 20 per cent of these dwellings will be affordable and social housing, primarily, for people from the docklands.</P>
    <P>The master plan, under <i>Incentives for Development,</i> section 9.3.1, states that tax incentives will be necessary to promote sustainable development of the docklands area because there are certain parts of the area where development will not take place without incentives.  Furthermore, a special package of tax incentives to apply to the Dublin docklands area were provided in the Finance Act, 1997, including housing incentives for new construction and refurbishment of existing dwellings. The most sustainable of all developments in the Dublin docklands area will be the provision of new and refurbished dwellings for local people. This is one of the main aims of the master plan where it is proposed that more than 2,000 dwelling units will be for local people.</P>
    <P>Hindsight is a great thing but if in 1986, when the original urban renewal schemes were introduced, a condition was attached to the housing incentives that these incentives were only to be given to developers if they provided 20 per cent social and affordable housing in their developments, the housing crisis we have today might never have happened.  We should learn from our mistakes and I am glad to say that the Dublin Docklands Authority has shown the way with its master plan.  I hope the Department of the Environment and Local Government will look carefully at any recommendations the Dublin Docklands Development Authority might make in regard to the application of the housing incentives provided for in the 1997 Finance Act.  While it is a fact that new apartments are being built in the Dublin docklands area without incentives, these apartments are of little benefit to the local people who cannot afford to pay the prices being asked.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Docklands Authority is currently preparing its policy on the provision of affordable housing for the docklands and I am sure this policy will be more effective if there are tax incentives to encourage the private sector to deliver part of the 20 per cent social and affordable housing initiative.  As a member of the Dublin Docklands Authority Council, I will be urging the authority to make the appropriate recommendations in this regard and I urge the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government, when reviewing any such recommendations made under section 13 of this Bill when enacted, to take into account the importance of social and affordable housing for sustainable development in the Dublin docklands area.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to hear the Minister say that a problem has emerged concerning the continued availability of double rent relief for tenants in designated areas, that the EU Commission is of the view that this is not compatible with the guidelines in view of Ireland's improved economic position and that it should not be granted except in limited circumstances.  While we have <Col N="343" /> benefitted from EU funding, there are still areas of huge social exclusion and deprivation in our major cities.  This should be brought to the attention of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the delay in some provisions of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997.  Can the Minister clarify if section 20 of the Bill will modify the provisions in the Finance Act, 1997, to provide incentives for development in the docklands area?  If that is the case it is a matter of grave concern to me.  The development of the docklands area provides one of the great hopes for social and affordable housing in Dublin.  It is the only area left for further development in the city.  If we are to provide 20 per cent social and affordable housing we must encourage private developers to develop the other 80 per cent at whatever price they wish.  The EU Commission should be encouraged to move along those lines.  That is the remaining hope for the Dublin housing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for what is becoming his regular weekly visit.  I particularly welcome him on this occasion to introduce this important Bill.  The Bill provides the framework for the new urban renewal scheme to which we all look forward with some anticipation.  I specifically welcome the inclusion of the integrated area plans which will tackle the socio-economic issues as well as the physical renewal of urban areas.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been in operation since 1986 and it has had a positive impact on many towns and cities.  It has addressed urban blight and large scale dereliction in many places.  The new scheme will take account of the social dimension and will include community development, education, training, employment and local economic development.  The scheme has attracted investment into urban development which would not have occurred without the incentives.</P>
      <P>Increasing urbanisation is and will be a challenge as more people move to live in towns and there will be a consequent degree of deprivation and marginalisation.  The integrated area plans and the urban renewal schemes will be important elements in tackling this.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State alluded to the KPMG study on the scheme.  The Exchequer has invested approximately £400 million in the scheme in terms of revenue foregone and it is appropriate to analyse the benefits of the scheme.  In general the scheme was favourably considered by KPMG, although there were criticisms and it is important to note them.  One related to architectural and conservation measures.  Perhaps the quality of the architecture being produced is not as good as we would like and the three year or five year deadlines imposed may give rise to some difficulty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IAP may have advanced plans to a greater degree than heretofore, but people have tended to wait to see whether areas are to be designated before drafting plans.  The time constraints sometimes <Col N="344" /> lead to inadequate attention being given to design.  Planning considerations also impose deadlines and a refusal may put the attainment of the benefit of a scheme in jeopardy.  It is an issue that should be considered, perhaps with a view to extending the time limit.</P>
    <P>The incentives in the scheme have related mainly to new buildings.  There are many listed buildings of architectural or historic significance the cost of refurbishment of which may be prohibitive. Provision might be made in the scheme for the refurbishment of listed buildings, wherever they may be.  It would give an incentive to refurbish and preserve these buildings for the future.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Bill and of many of the integrated area plans which have been prepared has been the designation of certain streets to promote &ldquo;living over the shop&rdquo; as it is called.  As towns have become more prosperous many shopkeepers have moved to the outskirts and, consequently, town centres have suffered.  Hopefully, the provisions in the Bill will encourage renewal in town centre living.</P>
    <P>Projected demographic changes will lead to an increased demand for housing and rented accommodation in particular may play a more significant role in housing stock than has been the case to date.  The unoccupied accommodation over shops is a resource which could be harnessed and would provide the dual benefit of providing accommodation for those who need it and regenerating the town centres.</P>
    <P>Due to the escalation in house prices and on foot of the Bacon report the Government has introduced certain restrictions on incentives for investors in the residential letting sector.  It is important that under the urban renewal scheme section 23 relief should be operated on a focused basis.  Capital allowances and, hopefully, the deductibility of interest will be part and parcel of that.  It is important to give some benefit to owner occupiers, but it is also important to have a balance between owner occupation and rented occupation. Some housing developments have been purchased exclusively by investors, but this does not provide the best foundation to underwrite the future value of the developments.  There is a need for balance.</P>
    <P>In some towns, particularly those with populations of fewer than 10,000, it may be difficult to secure the necessary numbers of local owner occupiers to underwrite developments without allowing a certain component of investors.  The section 23 incentives will be critical in this regard. It may be ideal to strike a percentage balance between owner occupiers and investors, although I do not know whether the Minister of State could prescribe that.  However, it may succeed in getting a balance to ensure the success of schemes.</P>
    <P>Enniscorthy, County Wexford, was only recently designated and the scheme is reaching completion there.  Many apartments have been built and many of them have been purchased by <Col N="345" /> investors.  The developments have improved the streetscapes and the economic outlook for the town.  New hotels, swimming pools and offices have been built.  The investment of over £16 million in the town has transformed it.  Many towns in the south-east have benefited greatly from similar investments.</P>
    <P>As part of the scheme there should be an emphasis on grants for urban authorities.  In some cases where private funds have been invested the planning and resources have not been available to provide the necessary upgrading of footpaths, roads, lighting and amenity spaces.  These elements contribute to the investments and should be part of the urban renewal scheme.  The Bill makes provision for such grants.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was discussed in the Dáil, Members took the opportunity to mention their local areas.  It would be remiss of me if I did not remind the Minister &mdash; although he does not need reminding as the chairman of the council has contacted him on the matter &mdash; that New Ross has been put forward for urban renewal designation by Wexford County Council.  We missed out on designation in the past, much to our disappointment.  Given the competition from Waterford and Wexford, it is important that towns such as New Ross can avail of the benefits of this scheme.</P>
    <P>New Ross is the first town tourists come through after the major europort of Rosslare. First impressions are important.  We hope the scheme will be extended to New Ross.  The River Barrow has been an important focus of the integrated area plan, particularly the tourist project at Dunbrody which involves the reconstruction of an emigrant ship that is being built in New Ross. This will be launched later in the year and will be one of the central themes of the IAP.</P>
    <P>I wish to compare the urban renewal scheme with the seaside resorts scheme which has given more generous incentives to developers and investors.  As part of the scheme, 1,200 to 1,500 units will be built in Courtown, County Wexford and the investment will range from £70 million to £100 million.  This type of investment in accommodation without commensurate investment in the service industries such as restaurants, bars, golf courses, tennis courts and other entertainment, could mean the people staying in these units would have nowhere to go and nothing to do.  This may ultimately lead to no lettings and areas of dereliction.  Perhaps the Minister will consider extending the integrated area plan process to the seaside resort scheme.  Without an integrated approach the scheme may not be as effective as we would like.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill covers the general standing provisions.  Part II relates to the preparation and content of the integrated area plan which sets out objectives for social inclusion and physical renewal.  Part III relates to the extension of functions and powers to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  As Senator Doyle said, the provision of a conference centre in that area <Col N="346" /> will be a significant enhancement of the development.</P>
    <P>At a time when many commentators are critical of politicians for various reasons, it is important that we recognise the magnificence of this initiative. The IFSC is a credit to those who had the vision to drive it forward and the area has been revitalised as a result.  When one looks at Temple Bar, one sees how the capital is becoming one of the more attractive cities in Europe.  This is a credit to all concerned.  Part IV of the Bill deals with miscellaneous provisions and covers grants to local authorities for urban and village renewal and the conservation of buildings of architectural or historical significance.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill which will enhance the already significant contribution the scheme has made to many of our urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill which encourages the integrated development of urban areas.  I am shy about speaking after the contributions of two experts on local government, Senator Doyle and Senator Walsh.  My experience is different to theirs so I hope my contribution will be useful.</P>
      <P>We have all been startled by the remarkable success of the incentive schemes of designation which have dramatically changed the face of many of our provincial towns and cities.  Sometimes tax incentives do not achieve their intended effect and when they do the results are not very visible.  This is not the case in this instance. However, the development so far has not been balanced, which is why I welcome the thrust of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Development so far has been overwhelmingly commercially driven.  We have built a great number of offices and shops, although there has been some residential building.  However, this has not been successful in creating real communities.  As Senator Walsh said, the residential element of development has been almost totally investor driven.</P>
      <P>The occupiers of houses and apartments tend to be transient rather than permanent residents. We must aim for balanced development rather than create commercial ghettos which tend to become deserts at night.  We should aim for urban renewal rather than urban replacement.  It is great to see former derelict areas throbbing with commercial life.  However, this is not the vital urban environment where people live, work and shop. Each activity complements the other.</P>
      <P>There is a practical difficulty in making integrated development happen.  This Bill recognises this problem, but I am not sure it addresses it. When the pressures of commercial and non-commercial development exist side by side, the commercial pressures tend to win out.  Integrated local plans are at the heart of this Bill.  However, plans are different to what actually gets built. Plans look great on paper but are not a true representation of the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> For example, the Custom House Docks development is a major success.  The International Financial Services Centre is a massive tax earner for the State and its development is almost complete.  However, there is a yawning gap between the original master plan and the actual development.  The original plan stressed the concept of &ldquo;festive&rdquo; shopping and the development of a dockside entertainment centre which has been a great success elsewhere &mdash; for example, in Baltimore, Boston and Capetown. These dockside areas are so successful that they have become tourist attractions.  They were previously derelict but are now fun places to be. They have achieved this status for a mixture of reasons.  As Senator Walsh said, the conference centre development may help us to move in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks development is very different from the plan which was drawn up ten years ago.  The IFSC has been successful in some areas but not in others.  Despite the original plan, the promoters could not make this festive shopping work in commercial terms.  What we have now is not the integrated balanced development originally envisaged, but a cluster of office blocks and very expensive apartments supported by what the occupiers and residents complain is an inadequate level of retail and entertainment facilities in the Customs House Docks area.  My point is not to undermine in any way the undoubted success of that project.  I am merely trying to underline the fact that it had aspirations to achieve something different &mdash; to become a much more integrated development than has proved to be the case.</P>
    <P>Plans are not the reality and there is a real danger in an integrated plan that the more commercial elements are built every time, while the less commercial elements are put on the long finger and sometimes end up being dropped altogether; the integration stays on paper and does not actually happen.  I do not have an answer to this and neither does the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a need to find some way of monitoring actual performance against the original plans on a continuous basis to see if it is actually happening. That is particularly so for the biggest scheme in the pipeline at the moment, the Dublin Docklands project.  It is clearly an exciting project and one that can achieve a great deal.  There are great plans for it but can we find a way of monitoring whether it is achieving what it set out to do?  There is a danger that the commercial elements will always get built, but the non-commercial aspects will not happen.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between general tax incentives and tax breaks available through designation.  I have been an enthusiast for designation because I have seen what it can do.  On the one hand, a general tax break is available to everybody who fulfils the conditions attached to it; if one meets the conditions, one qualifies, in other words, the tax break is open to <Col N="348" /> all taxpayers and no person or place is unduly favoured or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Tax incentives through designation, however, are based on the principle of deliberately creating inequality of treatment.  Many years ago I was involved in a court case that involved the definition of the word &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo;.  The argument was made that in the Constitution &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo; means to discriminate against.  In fact, the court case ended up being settled on the basis of the Irish language, which takes precedence in the Constitution.  It turned out that the word used in the Constitution &ldquo;idir&rdquo;, which means to differentiate between as opposed to discriminate against. The word &ldquo;idir&rdquo; can distinguish between both versions.  We can forget that it is possible to discriminate in favour of something.</P>
    <P>That is why designation has been so successful. One can favour some places at the expense of others in order to direct activity into chosen areas.  We designated inner urban areas because without special treatment no one would have put those areas at the top of their list.  With designation these areas were able to jump up everybody's priority list because the arithmetic had changed overnight.  It is a powerful way of getting things done.</P>
    <P>I have had this experience.  My company became involved in urban renewal schemes in Kilkenny, Carlow and Clonmel.  They have been very successful and have changed the face of those two towns and one city &mdash; I must never make the mistake of referring to Kilkenny as anything but a city.  Those schemes, which have been very successful, would not have happened without designation.  They are not the only examples of where the scheme has worked so well.</P>
    <P>Tax breaks that have inequality built into them should be purely temporary measures.  I am not for a moment saying that we should not rely on designation as we have done.  There is no doubt that it has brought great benefits to areas which would otherwise have been by-passed altogether or perhaps put on such a long finger and nothing would ever have happened.  However, while using designation as a temporary tool we should continually keep in mind that it does create inequality in the tax system and, as such, it undermines the fundamental fairness that should be a cornerstone of any tax system.</P>
    <P>I am aware that designation provisions always carry an expiry date in the legislation, and that is right.  However, these provisions have so often been extended that it is tempting for us to fall into the trap of thinking they are acceptable on a permanent basis yet, if they are to be fair to the nation as a whole, they are not.  I must be careful how I word that point because I am an enthusiast for the use of tax incentives to get things done.  It is like using a carrot rather than a stick and it has worked well.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to the seaside resort scheme.  It seems to me that when one designates some towns and not others, one is accused of discrimination. We must avoid the slippery slope <Col N="349" /> and keep a clear gulf between what we do on a temporary basis and what we do as a permanent part of our taxation system.  Our long term aspiration must be towards a tax code that treats every part of the country on an equal footing.  I hope we will be able to reach that position in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight the extremely dynamic and changing nature of urban development, and I speak about this with a degree of experience.  It has changed so rapidly in recent years that those of us involved in business have found ourselves making mistakes by doing things that three or four years ago we thought were correct.</P>
    <P>There is a lovely saying that, &ldquo;If you want things to remain the same, things are going to have to change&rdquo;.  If we wish to maintain our cities and towns as we want them we will have to recognise that things change very rapidly indeed.  We have all been startled by the extent to which urban renewal has worked.  Whole towns and inner cities have been transformed within the past decade and this has changed the way people in and around those areas behave.  Shopping and traffic patterns have also changed.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this we have had a virtual explosion in car ownership mainly fuelled by the economic growth of the past five years.  People have changed their shopping habits and now shop where they did not do so before.  Nowadays if people want to buy a newspaper it would not dawn on them to walk to the shops, they drive there.  That would not have happened a few years ago.  Whether it is laziness or a greater use of cars, we are now using the car more and, overnight that has created a totally new situation in towns up and down the country.  Traffic congestion is a part of the daily life in small towns where this would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we keep in step with these changes and acknowledge that urban renewal brings massive changes in its wake.  These are changes we must adapt to or we will undermine the new benefits we have created.  For example, I think the time has come to make decisions about where we want to locate different types of shopping. I have spoken on this issue to chambers of commerce in Naas, Bray and Waterford.  I am declaring a vested interest; we must recognise changing shopping habits.</P>
    <P>Years ago, when we came across shopping malls that were being developed in America, we were stunned to discover they had no grocery stores.  On this side of the world people questioned how one could build a shopping centre without a grocery store in it.  The Americans explained that people make two different kinds of shopping trip.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the centre of Dublin, for example, there are almost no grocery stores there any more.  Those who come into Grafton Street or Henry Street tend to do it as a different shopping experience than in a shopping centre.  There is a difference between essential or convenient shopping on the one hand and comparison shopping <Col N="350" /> on the other.  People make two different trips.  There is the trip for grocery shopping and the things that go with it, perhaps buying a newspaper and getting something from the chemist or the dry cleaner.  I wish it was not the case but many people consider this an essential chore, whereas comparison shopping is an entertaining and pleasant experience.</P>
    <P>There has been an assumption that grocery shopping should be retained in the centre of our towns.  A number of these towns &mdash; Naas and Bray are two examples &mdash; have become clogged up by people doing their grocery shopping.  Stores offering comparison shopping for dresses, shoes, jewellery, etc., have been affected as a result and they are in danger of losing business to competitors in locations outside these towns.</P>
    <P>We can siphon off much of the congestion by locating convenience or essential shopping on the outskirts of towns while maintaining thriving concentrations of comparison shopping in town centres.  It is difficult to explain this to people who feel threatened by the transfer of grocery shopping out of town centres.  However, it is essential that we do this because towns such as Naas and Bray have become over-congested with people doing their grocery shopping.  It is important to recognise that if all shopping is concentrated on town centres we are unlikely to avoid the congestion by which they are threatened.</P>
    <P>Towns have matured to a point where the division of shopping between comparison and essential shopping is appropriate and necessary.  If we continue to concentrate all shopping in town centres, we run the risk of choking them to death. That would be the ultimate irony, given that we recently succeeded in bringing those towns back from the state of dereliction they had reached.</P>
    <P>Those are the three points I wish to make.  I accept that the last one is difficult to understand but I will now highlight an example of the difference between essential and comparison shopping. A new shopping centre is being built on the M50 at Liffey Valley, on a site which was originally called Quarryvale.  I understand that this major development will include no grocery shopping, with the exception of a Marks and Spencer food hall, because the people responsible for its construction recognise that there are two types of shopping trips.  If we do not distinguish between the two types of shopping and put only one in place in our cities and towns, we will congest those cities and towns, choke the environment and lose business to the people who discover a better solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his efforts and I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  I wish it every success in what it is attempting to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who is, as Senator Walsh stated, a frequent visitor to the House.  I also welcome this important Bill and, while I retain a number of reservations about it, its general thrust is positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> As a number of speakers indicated, urban renewal has had some very positive effects in recent years and it has rejuvenated many of our towns.  We want to see this process continue.  For many years our towns were affected by what is termed the &ldquo;doughnut&rdquo; effect.  This involved the transfer of business to the outskirts of towns which led to the death of town centres.  The process of urban renewal which took place in the past eight to ten years has changed this, but I am concerned that it has created a different type of doughnut.  The development of the centres of larger towns, which in some cases has been predominantly geared towards accommodation without maintaining a proper balance, has created a situation where smaller towns and villages are dying.  I will return to this matter later.</P>
    <P>One of the most positive aspects of the Bill is the use of integrated area plans, which will introduce a social dimension to the process of urban development and will try to bring about a balance which was lacking in previous schemes.  Senators Quinn and Walsh stated that while these schemes were successful, they did not go far enough and they have not yielded the results originally envisaged. As Senator Quinn indicated, the plans look good on paper and include architectural artistic sketches of people pushing prams and carrying shopping bags.  However, it has not worked out that way in reality is some cases.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we may have created minor ghettos of the future in a number of areas because investors bought a large proportion of newly built accommodation with the intention of letting it.  I live in Carlow and one of the financial institutions in the town bought a block of apartments and let it out in its entirety.  Such behaviour does not generate a sense of community spirit and there is a tendency for this to happen in a town such as Carlow which houses an institute of technology that caters for many students.</P>
    <P>I will now return to my main point about the redevelopment of larger towns at the expense of smaller ones.  Towns such as Castlecomer, Castledermot, Athenry, Borris, Bagenalstown, with populations of between 1,000 to 2,500, have suffered greatly as a result of developments which took place in the past 25 years.  The damage inflicted on them was exacerbated by previous urban renewal schemes.  People left these towns to seek work in larger towns and, with the removal of Garda stations, post offices and other facilities, they have begun to die.  If we are serious about urban renewal, we should try to retain these towns &mdash; not necessarily in their past form &mdash; as vibrant units where people can live.  There should be greater emphasis on this matter in the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The guideline which stipulates that only towns with a population in excess of 6,000 will qualify under the new scheme is ridiculous.  I understand why a figure of that magnitude was chosen but it will have serious consequences in the future and it will hasten the rate at which smaller towns are <Col N="352" /> dying.  Another scheme could be put in place to cater for these towns; but, if we get the new scheme right, they can be retained.  Senator Quinn referred to the congestion caused in our towns by people doing their shopping.  We must ensure that our smaller towns and villages remain vibrant and active if for no other reason than to reduce the level of congestion in larger towns.</P>
    <P>A criticism of industrial development policy in recent years was that everything was to a great extent focused on Dublin.  I welcome the change over the past 12 to 18 months whereby most IDA industrial development is now taking place outside Dublin, because the capital as well as the rural areas will benefit from that.  The same is true on a smaller scale and the important towns in this context are the smaller towns within ten to 15 miles of larger centres like Thurles, Mallow or Kilkenny.  We need to adjust the population limit. The Minister has explained it is not definitive as regards the urban renewal scheme, but a town with a population of 4,500 or 5,000 might not be deemed big enough.  We need to think in terms of smaller towns and village.  The current town and village renewal scheme is not working as it should because it is not helping smaller towns. We should integrate these schemes better so that smaller centres do not fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Walsh about listed buildings of architectural or historical significance. They should be included in the scheme so that more of them could be retained, because our tourism industry benefits enormously from them. We have lost many fine buildings and if we do not do something to retain the few remaining we will have none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, who is something of an expert in this matter having piloted the Bill through both Houses.  He comes from Galway where the scheme failed to provide a level playing pitch in that a newer area was created within the old scheme which made it more difficult for the traditional shopping area to expand and thrive.  That said, in most respects the previous scheme eliminated widespread dereliction in towns where it applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of this Bill is good but it lacks clarity. The process for making decisions on the application of tax relief is woolly in that a definable basis is not laid down.  Despite much unevenness, the success of the past scheme has been proven; but legislation on potential tax breaks and rates remissions should be definitive and that is not so here.  There is no indication of how widely urban renewal tax relief will apply.  In accordance with the process for the preparation of integrated area plans, specified in section 7, the Minister said in the Dáil that 78 such plans had been received &mdash; that may have increased since &mdash; but how many of these include recommendations for partial or full tax relief and what criteria will be used to decide which will qualify?  The point is well made that extensive and widespread designation would defeat the purpose of the scheme, but who <Col N="353" /> will be the final arbiter as to where the line should be drawn?  We do not want any more lines in the sand.  Undoubtedly, if investor capital is chased by a multiplicity of centres, the impact of the scheme will be lessened.</P>
    <P>The core of the Bill is sections 8 to 10, inclusive, dealing with tax and rates provisions, and it is here that the legislation primarily lacks definition and direction.  I accept that much dereliction has been removed and, despite a slow start, tremendous efforts were made in many towns. That, combined with and assisted by the strong growth in the economy, brought about many worthwhile improvements.  As the Minister said, after ten years it was time to review the scheme and I welcome the KPMG/Murray O'Laoire study and the establishment of an advisory panel to assess the plans and see how well they comply with guidelines.  I am also glad that relevant development plan policies and objectives must be taken on board because too often our planners, perhaps because of overwork, have allowed ad hoc developments to creep into schemes.  It is not good that a plan is abandoned within a few years of being adopted and that planners have tried to inculcate other ideas in the mind of local authority elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Like many speakers I question the lower population limit of 6,000.  The Minister said it was not a strict threshold but it was largely accepted as such by local authorities and I imagine he did not receive plans for many towns under that limit.  I was delighted to hear of the preparation, by the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, in partnership with the Department, of a special technical guidance document on buildings of outstanding architectural and historic importance, including listed buildings, because some unfortunate and frightful mistakes were made in the past.</P>
    <P>The key question on this Bill concerns how section 23 relief for new rented accommodation will be decided in sub-areas, where justifiable. Also, how will the balance between commercial and residential areas within IAPs be decided?  I agree with Senator Gibbons that in many places where the scheme has operated the heart of the town lacks a community.  By their nature, being investor owned, they have tended to have a transient population, made up of people who do not intend to live there in the long-term but stay for the present because the accommodation is available. The new scheme could ensure that people who need to be close to shops, churches etc.  &mdash; for example, the elderly or those with mobility problems &mdash; could be moved closer to town centres.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows local authorities to remit, on a sliding scale over ten years, the rates leviable in an area covered by an IAP.  How will this be decided?  Perhaps the Minister could indicate the EU Commission's position on State aid to business and their fears about double rent relief and rates remissions, which he mentioned in his Dáil speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> The Bill provides for local authorities to monitor the progress of plans and to produce written reports to the Minister; but local authorities are not able to monitor the implementation of the Planning Acts and planning permissions because, through no fault of their own, they do not have enough staff.  They are inundated with work and stretched to the limit.  There has been a huge increase in the volume of applications coming before all planning authorities.</P>
    <P>This measure is good in that it is designed to assist cities and towns but we must be careful to ensure that is what it achieves.  In this respect I welcome the ministerial directive on superstores and large-scale retail shopping developments, because they could have had a devastating effect on towns and villages and might have set at nought much of the good which was achieved over the past ten years under the previous scheme.  I gently take issue with my learned colleague, Senator Quinn, because we have sufficient convenience shopping on approach roads to and on the fringes of our towns &mdash; every petrol station now has a shop.</P>
    <P>Many towns are clogged and our capital city is the worst example in terms of transport and traffic.  Towns need more centrally located off street car parking and link or ring roads and there is no need to wipe out town centres by attacking the outskirts of them.  We have a serious duty and I accept it is the Minister of State's desire and that of the Minister to protect the heart and fabric of towns.  That was the purpose of the ministerial directive.  Too much public and private investment has gone into our towns over the years, not to mention the sweat and blood of the traders therein.</P>
    <P>Many areas have thankfully been transformed, but there has been unevenness and some dreadful decisions were made.  I am aware of one town where apartment buildings in narrow lane ways were initially allowed to be built four storeys high.  The planners then had to rethink and reduced the buildings to three storeys following further applications.  The people confined to three storeys probably felt aggrieved because they knew there were four storey buildings beside them.  Then, because one neighbour did not like another, an appeal was made to An Bord Pleanála, which decided the buildings should not be higher than two storeys.</P>
    <P>I recently visited Enniscorthy and I was struck by how attractive it is and the fact that no damage has been done to it by attacks from the outside. It has good shops in a compact area involving a number of streets and there is a great focus on the river.  I agree with Senator Walsh's remarks earlier, and the town has a beautiful scenic river walk.  A mistake was made and urban authorities should have had more of a role in the preparation of IAPs.  I mean no disrespect to county authorities, but towns should have been consulted more.  The county authorities wanted smaller towns, but they felt they would not be able to do that because of the limits imposed.  Unfortunately, <Col N="355" /> they may have misread the Minister of State's intention.  I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill and I hope it will work very well.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, have been two of the hardest working Ministers since the Government took power.  I compliment them on their work and thank them for the new and important legislation which they have introduced.  I am glad the Bill has been introduced and I am pleased with the new and different formats outlined in it.  It provides for the urban renewal scheme and one of its key goals will be to nurture and enhance a social dimension to urban renewal.  That is the most important aspect of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Towns which took part in the urban renewal scheme were very successful.  They improved their image, appearance and businesses and this is a success story.  Some places advanced more than others because the Celtic tiger has reached certain areas quicker than others.  There is a boom in construction and the urban renewal scheme is evident everywhere.  However, in my home town of Tralee not one industrial job has been created. This will be an important factor in the future when the scheme is put to bed.  There will no jobs to take up the vacuum that will be created by the building of expensive and extensive apartments and houses.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge attraction from rural areas into urban areas for this development and rural areas have been seriously affected.  I am glad this legislation will cover areas which will not meet the criteria of a population of 6,000.  Tralee has the largest population in Kerry, 25,000, and the next largest town is Listowel, which is historic in terms of arts, culture and the literary world. However, it has been deprived of any form of urban renewal.  Hopefully, under this Bill it can take part in the scheme with its increased population. People have moved from that area and been attracted to Tralee following its development in terms of shops, supermarkets, etc.</P>
      <P>The tourism scheme has worked.  I am very parochial as I speak about my county, but Ballybunion was designated under the scheme.  Since the scheme was initiated 68 houses have been built there and planning permission has been granted for a number of apartment blocks.  That will benefit this seaside resort, which was dying, but I want more to be done.  People did not take advantage of the scheme during its first year of operation because they did not realise what was happening.  It is only now there is excitement about it as it comes to an end.  It will have to be looked at in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> I refer to the price of houses, about which I am very concerned.  Under this Bill other areas will open up for development and if more land is made available, the price of houses must come down accordingly.  The price of land drives up the price of houses and when people take advantage of designated areas, it creates a serious problem. There is a mechanism in the Bill to broaden the umbrella of the scheme to look at towns with populations of 4,500 or 5,000 which have a few villages around them and try to put them under the one umbrella.  I will make an application on behalf of Listowel because it is dying.  The last two censuses have shown a decrease in population and one must look at that seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is one of the most important to come before the House because it offers lifeblood to many small towns.  I come from a Border county where there has been major development and major funding has been pumped into towns such as Derry, Strabane and Omagh along the Border.  Until recently the difference between the pound and the punt provided a disincentive to the entire business community and they were forced to go from Dublin to Newry.  For example, in Derry a multinational set up there, was given a free site and a grant to build.  Even if it was over-developed there was no risk attached.</P>
      <P>Where a town has received one element of designation, it should not receive another.  I am glad the Minister of State said that while the figure of 6,000 people remains as a guideline, he is not tied to it.  The second and third biggest towns in a county must be seen to survive.  It is very important to encourage people to develop and build up their towns and counties.  It is important people start to believe in themselves because the timing is perfect.  Some 80 per cent of all funding from the International Fund for Ireland, the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and all American and European funding is pumped across the Border &mdash; they do not know what to do with it.  I hope that will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In towns which have received urban renewal funding the traffic has been redirected with very restrictive parking, but no consideration has been given to buses and lorries.  There are no parking facilities, even in good towns, which is a mistake. The Minister of State should take that into consideration and make some recommendations in that regard.  Towns must have a structure and an atmosphere, even after urban renewal, similar to that which one would like in one's own house or hotel.  A great deal of craftwork has gone into urban renewal schemes, which I appreciate.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see retail multiples selling petrol.  The filling station provides a unique service. When one pulls up at a filling station one can get one's tyres tested and so on, which provides people with a livelihood.  If the cream of that business is given to large multiples it will destroy that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> The Bill is very welcome and I wish the Minister of State success with it.  He is pumping blood into rural Ireland, which is very important and welcome.  I hope he will recognise the towns which have not been recognised so far.  Only good can come from this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and the Minister of State.  The Bill obviously builds on the success of earlier imaginative work in targeting money at areas of deprivation and urban blight. That work largely focused money on the cities and much of the success has been in Dublin.  This Bill will extend those positive provisions towards towns with a population of up to 6,000 throughout the country, in addition to confirming the view that it is important to restore and protect parts of our cities.</P>
      <P>One of the stories which has been by and large successful, although I have some difficulties with it, is the development of Temple Bar, and also the Financial Services Centre and docks area.  The Minister of State indicated towards the end of his contribution that his commission is examining a proposal regarding the extension of the capital allowances for buildings in the extended Custom House Docks area beyond January 1999.  In the light of this practical proposal, will he also examine the situation in regard to Temple Bar?  I know there are some difficulties there because the authorities no longer want to direct money towards all the types of development which have taken place in Temple Bar since the quotas for some forms of development have already been well filled.</P>
      <P>I must declare an interest in this regard because I was involved in the first development in Temple Bar, which has remained unrecognised.  The Hirschfeld Centre at 10 Fownes Street created the atmosphere in Temple Bar in 1978 which brought life into that area before the Temple Bar Authority was heard of.  The building was burnt but it is possible it may be redeveloped.  Given that that building was the engine which generated the whole success of the area, I would like the Minister of State to consider extending the existing tax incentive scheme to sites and buildings which have a plan or building programme in progress by the end of July 1999.</P>
      <P>The integrated plan is a very good idea. However, Parnell Street, particularly the stretch between O'Connell Street and Gardiner Street, has never been properly targeted.  I appeal to the Minister of State to include this area for specific incentives, if that has not already been done.  That stretch is the worst blight in the north inner city. If the Minister of State goes to look at it he will confirm what I have said.  We should make a deliberate effort to do something about that stretch of Parnell Street, which is a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with great interest the Dublin city authorities' plan for a major development of O'Connell Street.  Why spoil that by spilling people out into one of the worst areas of urban blight? Recent Governments have not added greatly to <Col N="358" /> the situation by dumping a half way house for female heroin offenders in the old Kennedy's bakery.  We have paid our social dues, so let us have some focused and targeted development to improve that area and not spoil the plan for O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is clearly sensitive to the question of integrating issues such as community development, education and training, to which he referred in his speech.  It is absolutely true that deprived areas must be given a feeling of ownership of the new and beautified city.  If people who live very close to these areas of renewal are disadvantaged &mdash; or not advantaged to the same extent as business interests by the improvement of their environment and surroundings &mdash; they will naturally not take an interest in it and vandalism and so on will continue.</P>
    <P>How is it possible, in the light of everything that has been said, including statements I have made in this House, that planning permission and licences continue to be given for vast aerodromes which pump alcohol at a high level of intensity into 20 year old kids, who are then flung onto the streets between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.?  Is there not some integrated authority which can oversee this?  There are now four of these dens at the top of O'Connell Street.  They are a social disaster in terms of tourism and the people who live in the area.</P>
    <P>As one of the people who live in that area, I listened with great interest to what Senator Quinn said about the difference between comparison and convenience shopping.  We must listen with great care to what he says because he is a very successful businessman with interests in this area.  However, since there has been a move of people back to the inner city, it is important that grocery shops, delicatessens and other convenience shops are retained for the people who live in that area.  I am not suggesting we should have large supermarkets but that the decent life of the community needs to be sustained in those areas.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister of State, Senator Quinn and others spoke about the type of investment there should be.  It is very dangerous to just develop blocks of single bedroomed apartments behind a facade because that leads to a transient population which does not develop or care for the area.  We must aim for a situation of permanent ownership rather than a transient population which is there because of investment interests or people behind the scenes.  That will keep life in the area.</P>
    <P>We must try to counteract higgledy-piggledy development with a total visual conflict between jarring architectural styles.  There must be some degree of sensitivity to the appropriateness of the buildings.  I was pleased by the recent launch in North Great George's Street by the Ministers, Deputy Dempsey and Deputy de Valera, of the proposals entitled &ldquo;Protecting our Architectural Heritage&rdquo;.  This is greatly welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> I wish to pay a compliment to the Minister, Deputy de Valera, who I know is not from the Minister of State's party but they are very happily ensconced in Government together.  I remember the Minister's grandmother who wrote fairy stories for children and also little plays which we did in our school.  Her father was one of the first people to recognise the importance of John Field, one of our great classical composers.  I am not surprised the Minister, like the Minister of State, has a passionate interest in the arts.</P>
    <P>We need to bridge the gap between vision and reality.  Senator Quinn also spoke about this.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to an article in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> of 21 June entitled &ldquo;£35 m. Duchess lives in basement.&rdquo; She does not live in the basement next door to me but she owns it.  I won a succession of cases against her in court. She has been sentenced to six months in prison and fined £35,000 but she has not met either of those obligations.  The house next door to me is falling into the back garden.  It is dangerous and a risk.  I raised this and the cases of Nos. 5 and 6 North Great Georges Street a number of years ago when the then Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, was responsible for the Derelict Sites Bill.  I was told it would be all right, but it was not.  I had to telephone him and get him out of a Government meeting on the day Nos. 5 and 6 were going to be levelled under a dangerous buildings order.  We managed to stop that.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest the Minister of State look at the question of Nos. 13 and 17 North Great Georges Street because we have the power under various Bills to take those threatened buildings into public ownership and refurbish them.  If we are serious this is what we should be doing.  I would like to see some action, and also with regard to No. 36 North Great Georges Street.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I suggest to the Minister of State that, since we have in North Great Georges Street a community who have rescued the street that was on the point of being flattened, it might be no harm to establish a co-ordinated study of the street to see what remaining problems can be affected by the operation of this kind of legislation. I can guarantee to him that I and my fellow members of the North Great Georges Street Preservation Society will co-operate fully with this endeavour if he decides so to do.  I recommend he might take this idea on board.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the International Financial Services Centre, which has been a remarkable success story, except for the fact that the ancillary services &mdash; the entertainment and festive shopping that was described at the beginning &mdash; has not taken off.  We need to look at this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions extending these measures to small towns in the countryside.  I take a specific and perhaps parochial interest in Parnell Street, which is a crucial element in the building block of the great plan for O'Connell Street, which I welcome.  I suggest and offer to the Minister <Col N="360" /> of State that we also target for completion the whole area of North Great Georges Street. By our individual efforts and the work of things like the James Joyce Centre we have almost merited that.  I do not say this in a niggling way.  We have received support from Government and the local authority.  Dublin Corporation has been extraordinarily helpful.  The new city manager, Mr. Fitzgerald, has followed in the tradition of Frank Feely in being helpful and approachable and accessible to people.  We have also been supported by Irish businesses.</P>
    <P>In the light of all this and in the light of the community employment schemes involved in the area, I would like to think that this area would be targeted, and also Parnell Street, which is a disaster. I hope the Minister of State will find it possible to look at that and perhaps to read <i>Ireland on Sunday.</i>  There is a case for action, ready made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has been involved in local government and has been a member of many Governments.  There is no better Minister to implement these proposed urban renewal policies.  He will do an excellent job.  He has been carefully listening to the many important points raised by Senators.  I know he will take some of them on board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change in the direction and focus of urban renewal policy.  The Minister of State has referred to a scheme that will feature a more focused approach, targeting the remaining areas of need.  It is important to emphasise the need for an urban renewal policy.  It is also important that he has given local authorities the role and responsibility to lead the preparation of the plans submitted.</P>
      <P>Although there has been much criticism in the past of local authorities, they are best suited to bring forward these plans.  Some have submitted a number of applications and have not prioritised them.  Local authorities see the need for spread of development in their county.  My own Offaly County Council submitted applications focused on three areas: Tullamore/Clara, Edenderry and Birr.  We focused on small areas of need in the hope the Minister of State would accept our submission. In this regard, it would be unfair if a town was excluded from the scheme because of the provision regarding the population figure of 6,000.  The populations of towns of that size have always been based on rural areas and smaller villages in a five to ten mile radius.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The designation of sites and areas for tax incentives has been an important measure in the redevelopment and renewal of many of our towns and cities.  We have only to look at some of the major towns to see the improvements.  The object of the plan was to provide a planned, integrated and focused approach to urban renewal.  Some of <Col N="361" /> the submissions include areas of physical dereliction and investment which have been hampered by a poor image.  We must try to rectify this in the future.</P>
    <P>The bigger cities and towns have benefited in the past from urban renewal schemes.  The first schemes, established in the middle 1980s, have resulted in an excellent development in many parts of the country.  In any future schemes we must ensure that the architectural features of the developments are maintained and that there is no demolition of old and historic buildings.  We must also recognise the number of excellent conservation initiatives in designated areas under previous schemes and ensure nothing happens to listed buildings.  They are set out in the county development plans.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to include the areas I have outlined from the submission by our county.  Clara in the past has been a good industrial town.  However, over the past 20 years much of the surrounding area has fallen into disuse.  It would benefit greatly from urban renewal, as would Edenderry and Birr, which is a heritage town.</P>
    <P>Our county has lost a huge number of jobs, possibly in excess of 2,000, because of the Bord na Móna/ESB situation.  Offaly depended on peat extraction and agriculture in the past.  Those industries were major sources of employment and economic development.  The ongoing rationalisation of these industries has contributed to a significant increase in long-term unemployment. The failure to attract alternative sources of employment has left the county weaker in terms of social and economic development.  The expected reduction in employment in Bord na Móna will further exacerbate the weakening of the fabric of society in the county.  Unless a major strategic initiative is undertaken with the support of Government, with urban renewal as a focus, there will be serious problems.</P>
    <P>If we do not attract industrial and commercial development into the larger towns in the area, the need for residential development will be limited. Some Senators called for balance in urban development.  That balance will come about if we attract industrial development &mdash; the residential areas will appear.  In allowing the smaller towns to develop under the urban renewal scheme, the Minister will be known as the Minister who saved rural Ireland.  I hope he will allow us to include the smaller areas in County Offaly.  He may not be in a position to do that now but he should give careful consideration to it in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Moylan in calling for development for Clara and Edenderry. They were towns with high employment throughout the sixties, seventies and eighties but they are now areas in urgent need of investment.  I also join with Senator Norris in calling for the development of North Great George's Street.  He made an excellent case for the area.  Any urban renewal scheme for the area should include Parnell <Col N="362" /> Street.  Parnell Square West has been earmarked for development by Dublin Corporation, but Dorset Street and Granby Row should also be included.  They were included before but there was lack of investment and the area had a serious drugs problem.  Now there is confidence in the area and only incentives are needed.</P>
      <P>Something is happening in rural Ireland which has been highlighted by urban renewal.  In County Westmeath, Athlone and Mullingar received urban renewal funding and the deprived parts of those towns were transformed.  Anyone who played in Cusack Park will remember what a major eyesore Flanagan's Sawmill was in the town of Mullingar.  Now it is an uplifting experience to see the new harbour development there.</P>
      <P>In north Westmeath there are vacant classrooms, churches in one parish may have to close and there has been a population decline of 30 per cent in Castletown, Finnea and Coole &mdash; an area which elected five local authority seats 20 years ago and now may be reduced to three seats.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the budget benefited County Roscommon.  County Cavan has been granted for special derogation because it is a Border county which will benefit from cross-Border funding as a result of the British-Irish Agreement.  The Minister probably has pockets in his own constituency where there has been a massive population decline.  A scheme similar to that proposed for the upper Shannon region would provide light at the end of the tunnel.  I welcome the Minister for Finance's proposal in the upper Shannon region directive but north Westmeath will find it impossible to attract industry due to the incentives which exist in other areas.  I know the Minister cannot include this area in the urban renewal scheme but his officials should come to the area and I will show them the decline there.  As Senator Moylan pointed out, the forestry industry is no longer a major employer, Bord na Móna has closed and the orthopaedic hospital in Coole has closed.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take these points on board when considering which areas will receive money in the next tranche of funding and that our area be highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have some reservations, I welcome the thrust of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the urban renewal scheme and the initiative taken in the mid-1980s to develop run-down urban areas.  In the heart of the city of Dublin there was a doughnut effect where, since the 1950s, there was a declining population.  Only in the past few years with the advent of urban renewal has that trend reversed.  There has been a tremendous amount of work done to eliminate dereliction and to restore physically areas which were architecturally appalling prior to the initiation of the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the scheme focused on the development of office blocks and residential apartment blocks.  The perception was the private market would focus on that area as it would attract development with the various tax incentives <Col N="363" /> available to ensure the scheme would be a success. I understand the direction of the scheme and I do not want to be the first to criticise it in retrospect. It was very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is little point in carrying on with this scheme unless it is changed radically.  At present the housing market is booming and there is no need to stoke that boom with further tax incentives.  Unless there is a different scheme we should not allow the Exchequer to avail of what would otherwise be revenue for it.</P>
    <P>The first failing in the previous scheme, however, was the lack of consultation on the ground.  No local community or local councillors were consulted, no form of democracy was consulted in the drawing up of the schemes.  While the Custom House Docks Development Authority engaged in <i>ad hoc</i> discussions with community groups, nothing came of them.  Temple Bar was set up under separate management without any local interaction.  There was also minimum consultation when the heritage area rejuvenation project &mdash; the HARP project &mdash; was set up in the Smithfield area on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A steering committee was appointed to look <i>post factum</i> at developments taking place in Dublin Corporation and on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the private sector and to consider what amenities could be provided with local authority and European money.  However, this is not an integrated system and there is a danger that the final development will be hotch potch.  A good example of this is the development of North King Street.  There is a great opportunity to plan a streetscape for North King Street which has been lying idle for the past 30 years.  Dublin Corporation sought to buy up various houses along it so that it could widen it.  However, this is only an engineering plan not a housing plan.  There is also no connection between the Custom House Docks development along the quays and the development of Sheriff Street.  A local authority development on one side is cut off from an urban renewal scheme on the other side.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not take advantage of the good times over the past five years to introduce a social housing policy to cater for the housing needs of local authorities.  This would have prevented the current housing crisis. There is a shortage of land because it has been sold off to private developers.  We are now introducing such a policy with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and I hope it will be successful. However, we could have done this five or six years ago.</P>
    <P>As this process of urban renewal was taking place over the past ten to 12 years, the country was experiencing its worst drugs crisis.  There was no attempt to use the money available to help people in urban renewal areas.  There was local neglect of such communities.  We were good with <Col N="364" /> bricks and mortar but bad with people.  It was questionable at that time if the forces of law and order would be able to gain control because of the ghettos growing up in the midst of plenty. While the situation has improved, there are still major social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poor educational attainment and lack of access to training, which must be addressed.  I welcome this belated attempt to introduce integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>The report from the consultants, which included KPMG, states:</P>
    <P>The delivery of wider economic and social benefits under the scheme in future would require a more focused, integrated strategy. Urban renewal must address the physical, economic, social and environmental regeneration of urban areas having regard to the local situation, the overall situation and any individual conditions.</P>
    <P>This legislation is fulfilling that purpose and philosophy. Dublin Corporation has presented five plans, three on the north side and two on the south side, to the Department for approval under the scheme.  The three on the north side are the HARP project, the O'Connell Street plan and the north-east inner city plan.  It has been agreed that more will be included, including the Ballybough area development plan and the Dorset Street plan, but I do not know if the Minister can consider them.  Perhaps he could clarify the number of applications, how many will be selected and what criteria will be used.  For the first time wide ranging consultations have taken place between the local authority, councillors and the local communities. They have drawn up the criteria for the plan which I hope will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that tax relief should be granted for rented residential accommodation and residential property for owner occupation. While this is desirable, grant aid must also be given to owner occupiers for home improvements. Only those with capital funding or access to tax relief on such funding benefited in the past. In many cases they dislodged native communities or built around them.  People who live in these areas, or whose ancestors lived there, have not benefited from such developments.  Incentives should be given to those who live in areas such as Rutland Street or Seán MacDermott Street. Many elderly people on social welfare live in houses or small cottages on these streets which have been handed down through generations and they would benefit enormously from a home improvement scheme.  It would be easy to ringfence this scheme so that landlords are not included.  The price of these small cottages will increase as they are bought by people who have money to develop them.  Landlords will benefit from these tax incentives.</P>
    <P>We are going to introduce an integrated scheme and we will create an imbalance because we are not prepared to give any money directly to people in private accommodation which is <Col N="365" /> almost the equivalent of social housing.  That is a mistake.  If the Minister accepts an amendment, it should relate to that area.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is looking at the profile of the area.  People do not realise that 60 per cent of the houses in that inner city community are local authority houses.  One does not find such a profile in many other parts of the country.  Therefore, it is important to stimulate the small private housing sector with owner-occupier relief.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is going to demolish a number of flat complexes.  It will reduce the accommodation provided by flat complexes from 60 per cent to about 40 per cent.  There will still be an extremely high density of local authority accommodation in flat complexes but there will be an improvement, and I ask the Minister to further assist in the improvement in the manner which I suggest.</P>
    <P>In that context I welcome the fund which will be made available to protect heritage and conservation listed buildings because Dublin Corporation is demolishing four houses in Seán MacDermott Street which should be listed buildings.  For the past 15 or 16 years these buildings have been in the possession of Dublin Corporation, which allowed them to fall into rack and ruin.  It prepared a number of development projects which it never implemented and now it is starting from scratch, having demolished them and ruined the side of the street which could easily have been preserved.  All of this has been going on and little attention has been paid to it, so I am glad there is an element in the Bill which I hope will do something about that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The second item I want to turn to is the question of education and training, which is an essential element of the Bill.  There is a problem about that of course because the local authority draws up the plans.  The local authority has no expertise in education or training.  It is difficult for the local authority because, although it has planners, engineers and other officers, it does not normally deal with that area.  The local authority has not been in the position, as I understand it, to buy in the expertise.  Therefore, that side of the developments has been fairly <i>ad hoc.</i>  The local authority has been consulted but it has not had the same in-house expertise as it has in other areas.</P>
    <P>Much needs to be done.  The local authority is trying to look at the pre-school element of it in disadvantaged areas, which is an <i>ad hoc</i> system. I have always believed that if we were ever to implement the Constitution's commitment to State funding of primary education, it should be defined in terms of the first level of education, which would be pre-school rather than primary or national schools.  Work must be done on pre-school because it is lacking.  There is a high dropout level in primary schools.  We are fighting to retain teachers in Breaking the Cycle at present.  They are being taken away by the Minister with one hand while he provides different resources with the other.  The number of people from the area who go to third level education is <Col N="366" /> small, so there is much work to be done there in enhancing access to third level education and resources.</P>
    <P>Adult education is also an issue.  Then of course there is the all important interface with training for the jobs, which the local community did not manage to avail of the last time.  That is why there is a drugs problem.  Nothing happened in the past. All the development took place in a vacuum and there was no spin-off to the local community. Unless we get the integration right and transfer the benefit of the developments to people across the board to improve their social circumstances, education, training and employment prospects, this is not an integrated plan and it will not work.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have something done in that respect.  An Education Bill is being debated at present.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has ruled out regional boards of education; but we should replace them with local boards of education because there are tiers of education operating in parallel and they never meet.  The pre-school never meets the primary level, the primary level never meets the second level, the second level never meets the third level, adult education operates alone and FÁS trains.  There is no system or structure for bringing them together.  Education is the most disparate of all the services being provided.  It is as if each element can operate happily and successfully totally separate from each other.  One of our biggest problems will be how to get the education side of these proposals up and running.</P>
    <P>The third area I want to address is the management structure.  The Bill is silent on the kind of management or implementation structure which will be put in place.  We are talking about the parent body, the local authority, but how will the local authority devolve the day to day implementation of it?  Who will be responsible?  Will the councillors be involved?  Will community groups be involved?  Will it be left to the manager to draw up a body or will there be no body?  Instead, will it be left to the local authority to do it without regulation or structure?</P>
    <P>Those are my thoughts on the matter.  This is a good Bill.  I want to see it improved in a number of areas.  I would be pleased if the Minister would take on board the three issues I raised: the provision of funding to owner-occupiers who do not have the means to develop their homes; the need to boost the education and training side of the Bill; and the provision of a streamlined management or implementation structure which would allow the development to take place in a more planned fashion than in previous developments.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a most important Bill in that it will affect the livelihood <Col N="367" /> and regeneration of many counties.  Its implementation needs much direction and management.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's enthusiasm in bringing forward this Urban Renewal Bill which involves a social dimension of urban renewal and the integration of community development, education and training, and investment.</P>
      <P>There are lessons to be learned from the examination of the previous urban renewal provision which involved the introduction of <i>ad hoc</i> tax incentives.  It is fair to say that in the early stages the initial take up was not huge in some areas because the economy was not ready for it. However, there is evidence that the first rounds of urban renewal have been taken up and that they have played an important part in the development of many town economies, particularly in the bigger urban areas.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of lessons to be learned from this.  The division between rich and poor will get bigger.  Tax incentives for urban renewal will play a major part in directing some of the newly generated wealth to areas where it can have a substantial effect on economic development.</P>
      <P>Some tax incentive schemes in the past were badly planned.  They caused overheating in local economies and drove the price of property above the reach of young house buyers.  Recent Government decisions following the Bacon report attempt to address this problem.  It is fair and honest to say that most major building contractors await Government decisions on matters such as this.  Substantial profits are to be made from developments in designated areas and their investment decisions are made in the light of area designations.  It is important, therefore, that we plan urban renewal schemes very carefully and that decisions regarding the designation of areas are taken in accordance with a long term coherent plan.</P>
      <P>Following a recent seminar on the new urban renewal scheme, it appears that a minimum population of 6,000 is an important criterion in designating towns for urban renewal schemes. Some submissions have been made by groups of smaller towns in areas of great socio-economic deprivation.  The Minister should consider such submissions.  I realise that if the scheme is applied to a very large number of towns there will be very little benefit to any, but it is important that an overall plan of tiered development be drawn up and applied at county level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us if he sees the need for another scheme for the renewal of smaller towns and villages, or does he regard this Bill as dealing with such places?  Do the terms of this Bill cover the long term development of smaller communities &mdash; perhaps on a group basis &mdash; or is new legislation for that purpose needed? Major towns are developing rapidly and this is having a detrimental effect on smaller centres. County councils must draw up county plans on a tiered basis to ensure that economic development is spread equitably.  If this is not done our purpose <Col N="368" /> will be defeated.  Urban renewal schemes offer a great enticement to developers.  The Government now have an opportunity to improve the socio-economic fabric of small rural towns.</P>
    <P>An integrated plan for the Knock, Charles-town, Ballyhaunis and Claremorris area has been drawn up.  Can the Minister say how such a plan would fit into the scheme contained in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £4 million for the protection of buildings of historic and architectural importance.</P>
    <P>The scheme as outlined in the Bill is based on good planning and development, the need for investment and the maintenance of the socio-economic fabric of our developing society.  It will play an important part in the overall development of local economies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him and his officials on the exhaustive and extensive preparation of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will confine myself to consideration of my own geographic area because, given the limited time at my disposal, I would be unwise to do otherwise.  The advantages of the earlier urban renewal schemes were such that we were all envious because they did not extend to rural towns. This scheme allows that to happen.  I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that County Cork is an extensive area with three administrative housing and sanitary areas.  Because of that, Cork County Council chose to submit a number of towns for designation.  I impress on the Minister the need to bring the Celtic tiger to rural towns. In our small towns we have rural impoverishment. I am glad the Minister has focused this scheme on towns of a certain size with specific criteria.  The 6,000 population criterion does not include or exclude the general criteria.  Bandon &mdash; a town to which I am very close &mdash; is included with Mallow and Cobh.  Bandon has suffered from its proximity to Cork city and, like all towns, suffered impoverishment in the 1980s.  The Minister said he would address the problems of smaller towns and villages.  I welcome that because our small towns and villages need regeneration. Bandon is a beautiful town with two rivers flowing through it.  It has suffered decay over many generations.  I hope the Minister will see that Cork is treated fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on a Bill which will bring prosperity to many towns over the coming years.  It will provide the framework for a new urban renewal scheme involving the preparation by county councils, county boroughs and corporations of plans for the social and economic renewal of their areas for submission to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Town centres were once at the heart of life but over the years, as towns spread outwards, much of the business moved from the town centres leaving them underdeveloped or derelict.  It is important that these areas be redeveloped in a planned <Col N="369" /> fashion which will bring business back to them while ensuring the areas' character remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal schemes have been a great success, giving incentives to bring business and development to areas.  Monaghan town is a prime example of the success of the scheme in attracting new investment and development.  The growth and development of Monaghan town in the past few years has been significant due to the urban renewal scheme.  Ballybay, Castleblayney and Clones could do with a lift and I hope this new scheme will provide it.</P>
      <P>As the economy continues to grow with an increase in job creation, it is timely to put in place this legislation for a new urban renewal scheme to ensure life remains at the heart of our towns.</P>

      <P>Tá sé soiléir ón méid atá cloiste agam go bhfuil an-suim ag na Seanadóirí san Bhille seo agus go gcuireann siad fáilte roimhe.  Tá áthas orm faoi sin.  Tá cuid mhaith ceisteanna curtha agus déanfaidh mé iarracht roinnt acu ar a laghad a fhreagairt san am atá fagtha.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe Doyle raised the issue of reserved functions.  The proposed framework for the new urban renewal scheme was notified to each county and city manager on 14 May 1997.  Within that framework it was indicated that the selection and prioritisation of areas for integrated area plans and the preparation of plans for priority areas were the responsibility of the relevant corporation or county council.  Many Senators indicated that I should select towns which may not have been submitted by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>This scheme is an exercise in subsidiarity &mdash; a bottom up exercise, so to speak.  The opportunity was given to the local authorities to develop the IAPs within the clear guidelines given.  One cannot understand the Bill fully without reading the guidelines.  Many of the questions raised about management and the objectives that might be met are on matters dealt with in the guidelines.  I recommend to Senators to read the guidelines. We will examine any proposals made.  The advisory committee will make the recommendations, I will examine them and they will go on to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>At the time notification was made to the city and county managers in May 1997 no indication was given of an intention to make the selection and prioritisation of areas and the preparation of plans a reserved function.  If in the future an opportunity arises to take similar action I agree it should be a reserved function.  However, I cannot change that now.  The process is under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators raised the issue of mixed public/private development.  I fully agree that it must be at the core of public housing policy.  This issue will be important for the new schemes.  The guidelines specify that in general 15 per cent of all housing provided in an area covered by an IAP must be social housing.  There is continued <Col N="370" /> provision for the issue of guidelines on the size, mix and quality of residential developments. Existing guidelines on such developments have succeeded in improving quality and these will be strengthened if necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle raised questions about section 20.  It relates only to developments in the Custom House Docks and does not provide incentives to other dockland areas.  Incentives for other areas will be subject to EU approval generally. Reference was made to residential incentives in docklands and we will look carefully at any suggestions from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh suggested an extension of the time period.  Given the cost of the scheme, it is important to get maximum value for money over the shortest possible period.  That is the purpose of the three year deadline.  The issue of extensions can be considered at appropriate times depending on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh and others raised the issue of listed buildings.  It is not possible to separate the listed buildings from the IAPs but new grant measures which I mentioned in my speech will enhance the protection of listed buildings in the future.  The issue of &ldquo;living over the shop&rdquo; was raised and it can be included by a local authority in the IAP it submits.  We intend to look at further ways to support the concept.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked about the provisions for monitoring and reporting.  The guidelines provide details on those issues.  Local authorities will be obliged to certify that qualifying projects are consistent with the IAPs, giving them a considerable measure of influence and ensuring the objectives of the plan are met.  They will have a better chance of being delivered because of the need for certification and the monitoring of the implementation of the schemes.  Incentives will be applied in the future in support of objectives set out in plans aimed at achieving social and economic benefits in deprived urban areas.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme does not seek to locate all shopping facilities in town centres.  It seeks to achieve a range of uses at the centre which will help to keep towns alive.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to section 23 relief for new residential accommodation.  This can be applied to the sub-areas within the IAPs when a good case is made.  One of the recommendations of the Bacon report was that section 23 relief should be abolished.  However, we retained the section 23 relief to have it as an option for use in IAPs in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Given the current state of the housing market, the scope for section 23 relief for refurbished rented accommodation is likely to be more flexible than for new houses in view of the emphasis on promoting new uses for old buildings.  The state of the housing market will be one of the factors with regard to the residential tax incentives for new houses or apartments that are approved.  It is taking some time to assess all the IAPs submitted because they must be examined <Col N="371" /> closely.  Local circumstances are among the requirements that must be taken into account. The housing market is overheated at present and in many cases it would be wrong to provide tax incentives on top of the existing market demand.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator McGowan, the scheme guidelines indicate that issues such as traffic management need to be addressed.  In reply to Senator Costello, local authorities are expected to work in partnership with relevant education and training statutory bodies in pursuing education and training initiatives in the context of the IAPs.  He asked from where the expertise will come.  It is already there and it is a question of inter-agency co-operation.  The guidelines suggest models for a management structure to monitor the implementation of the plans.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been well covered. The initial selection of areas to be included in an IAP is the responsibility of local authorities.  They will submit their selections to the Department before 31 March.  The Department will then submit those to an expert advisory group which will examine whether they comply with the guidelines, whether their objectives are reasonable and what tax allowances should be made available. The group will then make its recommendations to me.  I will then make recommendations to the Minister for Finance as regards the granting of tax allowances.  He will make the final decision. That is the only reasonable manner of selection. The Minister for Finance is responsible for taxation and budgetary policy.  The final decision on the granting of tax concessions cannot be made by anyone other than him.  The process is as open and as transparent as it can be within the law.</P>
      <P>This is a new approach to the tax designation of areas for development when compared to the arbitrary manner in which it was done in the past. The basis was laid by the previous Government. We have accepted it and moved it forward to this stage.  I am satisfied the decision making process is transparent.  The Freedom of Information Act means that people will have access to their files and can examine the decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad for the Second Stage debate on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil took a great deal of time as many amendments were tabled, including several substantial ones which were debated at length.  All parties are anxious to pass this legislation before the recess.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals principally with the management and operation by Aer Rianta of the three State-owned airports &mdash; Cork, Dublin and Shannon. The Dáil has already considered this Bill and examined it on Committee Stage.  There was a most useful debate in that House and several beneficial additions resulted from the Committee Stage interventions.  A total of 108 amendments were considered on Committee Stage and 41 on Report Stage during the passage of this Bill through the Dáil and I will refer to these again. Some of these amendments were debated and not accepted.  The resourceful Deputy Stagg has tabled them on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to end the present State airport management arrangement in which the Minister owns the airports and Aer Rianta operate the airports as an agent of the Minister.  To end this arrangement it is necessary to transfer the assets at Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports from me, as Minister, to Aer Rianta and to assign to the company certain functions previously undertaken by myself and my predecessors in relation to the management of the three State airports.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to amend and update miscellaneous provisions in civil aviation legislation generally.  In particular, a new offence of unruly behaviour on an aircraft in flight will be created under this legislation.  This measure was proposed in an amendment tabled by Deputy Yates on Committee Stage.  It was redrafted by the draftsman and will close off a loophole in the law as it stands at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been a long time in gestation. Apparently, work began on drafting the heads as long ago as 1969.  The principle of what is proposed has been agreed by all sides of this House and recommended by joint Oireachtas committees and several working parties over the years. It is said that the wheels grind slowly &mdash; eventually they ground exceedingly well in this case. However, various events intervened, the first being the oil crises of the 1970s which led to a major economic downturn and a decline in civil aviation.  Later it was funding issues which forced a rethink.  The measure was deferred by successive administrations until, finally, the previous Government approved the scheme of the Bill in October 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal impact of the Bill is that the current agency status of Aer Rianta will be ended. For the first time in its history, the company will own the assets it manages.  This will put it on the same footing as all the other commercial State-sponsored bodies.  There are no implications in <Col N="373" /> this Bill for the ownership of Aer Rianta itself. The Minister for Finance has held 100 per cent of the shares in the company since it was first incorporated under the Air Navigation and Transport Act of 1936, and that continues to be the case under this Bill.  Aer Rianta, which was established as a limited company in 1937, was a holding company for Aer Lingus and its objective was to promote aviation generally.  Its airport management functions evolved over time and it became a public limited company in 1985.</P>
    <P>Being the agent of the Minister for Public Enterprise means effectively that Aer Rianta is, theoretically, merely a name under which the Minister acts.  The company as of now has no assets, functions, activities or revenues in its own right in the field of airport management.  While Aer Rianta has itself funded all airport investment since 1988, the company simply holds these assets in trust for the Minister of the day, who is their legal owner.  Clearly, this arrangement is outdated and outmoded and the object of the Bill is to bring that situation to an end.</P>
    <P>To put this in context, it may be appropriate to recall briefly the development of the management structure of the three airports.  Neither Cork nor Shannon airports were managed by Aer Rianta when they opened.  Cork Airport, which opened in 1961, was managed directly by the Department of Transport and Power.  Likewise for Shannon Airport, which began construction in 1936 and was managed initially by the Department of Industry and Commerce and later by the Department of Transport and Power.  Aer Rianta was given responsibility for the management of Dublin Airport from its construction in 1940 and has exercised that duty ever since.</P>
    <P>In 1969 an administrative arrangement was entered into which extended Aer Rianta's responsibility to include the management of Shannon and Cork Airports.  At that time the late Erskine Childers, the then Minister for Transport and Power, indicated that it was his intention to regularise the status of Aer Rianta at the earliest possible opportunity.  Almost 30 years later the Bill is at last before this House.  I cannot account for those delays.  As well as the oil crises they may be due to the various elections and changes in Government.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has a long history stretching back to the foundation of the aviation industry in this State.  It has been highly successful in its core job of ensuring good quality airport facilities at the three airports it manages.  It has also built on that success abroad where it is involved in airport related business in many countries, acting as an ambassador of Irish enterprise and opening the door for others to follow.</P>
    <P>This Bill regularises Aer Rianta's corporate and commercial mandate.  It challenges the company to continue to be competitive and innovative in securing its place as the prime provider of air access gateways to and from Ireland.  The Bill provides a basis for sharing the benefits of its competitiveness with its customers, the airlines <Col N="374" /> and the travelling public, as well as rewarding the shareholder.</P>
    <P>The text before this House follows closely on that general scheme brought forward in October 1996.  The main effect of the Bill will be to transfer all of the assets held in the Minister's name at the three State airports to Aer Rianta's balance sheet.  Because all of the assets are currently vested in me, as Minister, neither corporation tax nor local authority rates were payable by the company, though a small amount of corporation tax was paid by subsidiaries.  So a side effect &mdash; and, I am sure, an unwelcome one &mdash; of this legislation is that following the change of status of the company, full corporation tax and rates will be paid by Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>At present the authorised share capital of the company is 60,000 ordinary shares of £1 each. Some 51,000 of these shares have been issued and have been allocated to the Minister for Finance. He is well off.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of meeting the requirements of the Companies Acts regarding the minimum number of members of a company, a further nine shares have been issued to each of the members of the board of Aer Rianta and one each to the Secretaries-General of the Departments of Finance and Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>This level of issued share capital is far too low for a company which will have more than £200 million in assets.  Therefore, the Bill provides that the old shares be surrendered and a new share issue be made which will be equal to the value of the assets on the company's balance sheet, less the liabilities.  It also provides that the Minister for Finance may transfer a share to one or more persons for the purpose of compliance with the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill to privatise Aer Rianta.  There was much debate on this point in the other House and no small amount of confusion.  Lest it be thought that that is the end of thinking about Aer Rianta in any other guise, except that envisaged by the legislation, since we came into Government &mdash; as I told the board of Aer Rianta recently &mdash; the winds of change are blowing through the semi-State companies.  There is no secret and we all know it.  The change is coming form all sorts of viewpoints.  There is the worldwide need for competitiveness, trading in a global economy demands that one is competitive.  There is the EU compulsion because we are now subject, and properly so, to ideas on liberalisation, deregulation and competitiveness.  Therefore, if there was no compulsion from Europe, there is a compulsion on all of us to have constant regard to our competitiveness.  Aer Rianta does that admirably.  I salute the company's staff members who are present in the Public Gallery, including the new chief executive.  He is giving great service, as does everybody who works in the company.</P>
    <P>There is no ideological push in this Government to knock off all the semi-State companies one by one and say: &ldquo;Ha, ha.  That's you gone, <Col N="375" /> now on to the next&rdquo;.  That is not the way we do business.  In the Programme for Government issued last June we laid out clearly that each semi-State company would be viewed in a pragmatic fashion as the company's and customers' needs unfold.  It is not a matter of wholesale privatisation, which, when applied in one fell swoop in the UK, led to many unhappy situations because it was privatisation from an ideological point of view.  The UK authorities did not look at State assets and decide what was best for the company, the consumer and the country.</P>
    <P>There has been a gradual unfolding.  Telecom Éireann led the way when the previous Government brought in a strategic partner.  Last year there was Esat and there will be IPO next year. There will be a loosening of the ties, whether it happens through a strategic alliance, privatisation, through public and private sector involvement, or by way of employee share ownership.  It is correct that it should happen that way.  If we are to supply goods and services which are viable and sustainable then we must obey the global rules of trade, commerce and competitiveness which are at our door.</P>
    <P>While the winds of change are blowing, they are not doing so in an ideological or threatening way company by company.  I think that would be wrong.  They are blowing in a practical fashion. During the week I attended a conference on semi-State companies and I quoted the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, who when he was setting up a semi-State company in 1959 said he was doing so from a pragmatic and practical point of view, not for any ideological purpose.  Forty years on the emphasis is still the same.</P>
    <P>The Bill is silent on the matter of disposing of the shares of Aer Rianta to any third party other than transfers for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the Company's Act, where the Minister for Finance remains the beneficial owner.  The Bill does not change the current rights and responsibilities of the shareholder.</P>
    <P>Whatever position colleagues may wish to take on this issue, and there has been some recent media speculation on Aer Rianta as a privatisation candidate &mdash; although I hate that phrase &mdash; it is not the subject of the Bill and it should not cloud our discussions on the issues raised by the Bill.  Clearly, anybody is entitled to raise the issue on the floor of the House and discuss it as much as they wish.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill for the payment of dividends to the Exchequer by the company where profits allow and for the regulation of the borrowings of Aer Rianta and its subsidiaries. Controls of this type are fairly standard among semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>The core element of the Bill transfers to the company all of the land and property vested in the Minister of the day.  All new assets were, in fact, acquired by the company and are held in trust for the Minister.  However, the original lands and some property were acquired and paid for <Col N="376" /> directly by the Exchequer.  It is good to recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has to pay for any assets being transferred.  The amount in question will be a matter to be finalised by myself and the Minister for Finance on vesting day, but I expect we will talk about it beforehand.  The intention is that it will closely reflect the written down value of the property in question.</P>
    <P>I plan to vest the lands in the company on 1 January 1999.  The first payments of corporation tax, rates and normal dividends will not arise until the year 2000, so there will be no question of Aer Rianta having to pay on the double in any one year.  That issue accounted for a whole day on Committee Stage.  Deputies Stagg and Yates mounted opposition to the &ldquo;double whammy&rdquo;.  I do not know which Deputy coined that phrase but it is a good one.  I do not know if I am allowed to talk about what arose in Cabinet, but when this matter came up I recognised the danger and got a tail put on the Cabinet decision which allowed that if difficulties emerged we could all talk about it.  That is what we did.  The officials went to the Department of Finance, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I worked out a formula avoiding the &ldquo;double whammy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was buoyed up not only by the Cabinet decision but also by the debate on Committee Stage which put forward in a logical way how we could get around the problem.  The end result was a far better Bill and a better deal for Aer Rianta. That shows what can be done if one is prepared to listen.  We have worked that out.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also concerned with the ending of the outmoded agency arrangement between Aer Rianta and the Minister.  Accordingly, in addition to transferring the assets to the company, the Bill transfers a number of powers such as the right to establish airports and to acquire or enter onto land.  These are powers which up to now were exercised by the Minister of the day but would more appropriately reside with the company.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there are a number of general provisions in existing legislation in regard to the administration of commercial State companies which should be provided for in respect of Aer Rianta.  The Bill sets down the principal objects and general duties of the company and it deals with the appointment or removal from office of the chairperson, directors and chief executive, reporting procedures to me and requirements in respect of the conduct of directors and employees of the company.  These provisions bring the company up to date as regards corporate governance and individual responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Minister will retain certain rights, including the power to approve changes in airport charges.  Access costs are a key issue in maintaining Ireland's competitiveness and airport charges are a component of those costs.  I hope that all factors will be taken into consideration in deciding on any adjustments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> The day to day regulation and control of airport users, including the making of by-laws and the appointment of authorised officers, is transferred to the company in this Bill.  Other aviation related legislation is also amended in this regard. These changes are necessary either because of the knock-on effects of the provisions of the Bill or because a lacuna has been discovered in the legislation in question.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Yates who brought forward a new provision to cater for the growing problem of unruly behaviour on board aircraft in flight.  Current law adequately provides for serious offences in the air but has not provided for public order type of offences, which are on the increase.  <i>The Irish Independent</i> carried an article last week about a person who, while not intoxicated, got the notion into this head that he wanted to pilot the plane on which he was travelling. He stormed up the aisle and had to be restrained and brought back to his seat a number of times.  The individual in question continued to believe he was the pilot and the cabin crew were almost obliged to tie him down.  It must have been a difficult situation with which to cope.  On the next occasion that person takes such a notion into his head he will be fined heavily but I do not believe he will be allowed to travel on aircraft in the future in any event.</P>
    <P>The Bill was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I took on board many other substantive amendments proposed by the Opposition and many technical amendments.  If Members wish to peruse them, these amendments are attached to the supplied script.  I already mentioned the new section dealing with unruly behaviour on an aircraft. I have also inserted a clause which ensures that the chief executive is automatically a member of the board.  The position of the three worker directors is strengthened by an explicit reference in the Bill.  The power of the Minister to direct the company has been modified and a basis for revising the ceiling on borrowing has been added. A procedure for avoiding an excessive charge on the company, or double whammy, on vesting day has been agreed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is long overdue and I look forward to the debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which, as the Minister stated, has the support of all parties. This Bill will give Aer Rianta autonomy to run its affairs and manage and develop our airports in an efficient manner.  Aer Rianta is a major employer and it promotes business and enterprise in Ireland.  The company needs the freedom to operate airports in an increasingly competitive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta dealt with more than 13 million passengers in 1997, breaking all previous records. That is a staggering figure, given that Ireland is such a small country.  Aer Rianta's total revenue for 1997 was £247 million, which represents an increase of 7 per cent on the previous year.  Profit after taxation was £42 million and the company <Col N="378" /> paid to the State the sum of £14.9 million.  As it stands, Aer Rianta is an efficient and effective company and the Bill will provide it with the opportunity to develop its business on a larger scale.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta engages in significant activities abroad, particularly under the auspices of Aer Rianta International, and it has invested in Birmingham and Düsseldorf Airports.  In terms of duty free shopping, the company has outlets in Russia, the Middle East and the Far East.  Aer Rianta is an extremely active company.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to note that 23 different airlines, providing services to 61 scheduled destinations, currently use Dublin Airport and a total of 19 scheduled destinations are served from Shannon Airport.  Aer Rianta's objective is to provide safe and efficient facilities and services at the airports in Cork, Dublin and Shannon at the lowest possible cost to airlines and passengers. Airport charges in this country are consistently among the lowest in Europe.  In a league table of 40 European airports, Aer Rianta ranks 47th lowest in terms of charges.  Per passenger, airport charges decreased from an average of £5.18 in 1993 to £3.07 in 1997.  These charges have not been increased for 11 years.  Extensive work to provide new facilities in our airports is continuing. At Shannon Airport, a major development costing £28.5 million is underway.</P>
    <P>I welcome the constructive approach taken by Aer Rianta to industrial relations, particularly the compact for constructive participation in the company which involves staff and management working on a true partnership basis in respect of all matters affecting the company.  This is a unique approach and it is the first occasion on which a radical transformation in organisational relations has been attempted in Ireland.  Aer Rianta is showing the way and other companies could learn from its modern dynamic approach to employment and employee relations.  Maintaining effective communications with staff continues to be a major priority for Aer Rianta and it received international recognition for excellence in internal communications in October when it was awarded the <i>Irish Independent</i> communicators business award for Ireland's best staffed terminal.</P>
    <P>I welcome Aer Rianta's commitment to equal opportunities for its employees.  A recent audit was completed within the company, the purpose of which was to compare employment patterns of men and women and establish a detailed profile of company employees.  This support was based on renewed equal opportunities within the company. I also welcome the employee assistance programme which provides a confidential advisory counselling and referral system for staff.</P>
    <P>Customer service continues to be important in terms of every aspect of Aer Rianta's business. Upgraded flight information display systems, together with baggage indicator display systems, have been provided at Dublin Airport.  Aer Rianta has also embarked on a major environmental improvement programme which includes <Col N="379" /> the phasing out of noisy aircraft, the construction of an acoustic facility designed for engine test run-ups, the introduction of new compactors to reduce the amount of waste being recycled and an increase in the number of air quality monitoring stations.  Additional ground outlets for aircraft were also introduced and exhaust emissions from aircraft engines and noise from auxiliary power units have been reduced.</P>
    <P>Aircraft noise is one of the problems faced by residents living near airports.  I understand that residents living near Dublin Airport make complaints, particularly during the month of August, about the amount of noise which seriously affects their quality of life.  As Deputy Haughey stated in the Dáil, these people often cannot listen to their televisions or hear each other speak.  I hope Aer Rianta will continue to put in place the most modern techniques aimed at reducing aircraft noise levels.  When travelling on the Ashbourne road, I have frequently seen signs objecting to aircraft noise.  We must listen to the case put forward by residents in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome Aer Rianta's community relations initiatives, particularly the Dublin Airport arts festival which is a wonderful innovation and which is now in its tenth year.  The festival has given a new dimension to the airport.  Having read the company's annual report, I welcome its placing information on CD ROM.  This will prove useful to those of us who do not have an opportunity to read everything the company publishes and I found it excellent in terms of considering the company's results and programmes.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is a dynamic modern company and this Bill will help it to become more efficient and effective.  One of the major problems it faces is the question of how it will react when duty free shopping is abolished in June 1999.  This will pose major difficulties for all airports, not merely those controlled by Aer Rianta.  If duty free is abolished it will have a significant economic impact on transport and tourism and will also lead to substantial job losses in other sectors.  Aer Rianta has indicated it may have to cut 300 jobs in its duty free sections, but that is only the tip of the iceberg because it will radically affect how the company is run and will cause other problems such as increases in landing fees.</P>
    <P>In <i>Business and Finance</i> last May, the chairman of Aer Rianta, Mr. Noel O'Hanlon, said the new powers given to the European Parliament under the Amsterdam Treaty might mean that the Commission's decision to abolish duty free could be reviewed.  The Parliament now has specific responsibility for social and economic affairs.  All our political parties and representatives in the European Parliament should &mdash; and I believe they will &mdash; make the case for not abolishing duty free, or at least delaying the abolition with a view to saving jobs.  The Parliament is against abolition.</P>
    <P>This move will also have a major impact on our smaller regional airports because they rely even <Col N="380" /> more heavily on duty free income to stay viable. The sale of duty free goods allows Farranfore and Knock Airports to operate viably &mdash; Knock Airport breaks even solely because of duty free.  This issue will affect not only employment at those airports but the local economies.  We need these regional airports but we should consider whether we have too many.  If they are not going to be viable how can they continue?  These airports are important for our tourism infrastructure &mdash; tourists can quickly and easily reach remote parts of Ireland through the airports, which is important for local economies and services such as bed and breakfast accommodation and car hire.  We must think seriously about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted the proposal to legislate for disruptive behaviour on flights.  A person acting abnormally can have a profound impact on an airline trip.  Section 69 deals with this matter and I welcome it because for the first time there will be a clear legal follow up to drunkenness and hooliganism, which is unfortunately increasing on our aircraft.  Bringing people from other countries to Dublin for parties, etc., has become a big business; this is causing many problems on the ground and is probably also doing so in the air.</P>
    <P>However, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Yates, that the fine for a person convicted under this section is small &mdash; persons found guilty under section 69 (1) and (2) are liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500.  The fine should be in thousands rather than hundreds of pounds.  The Minister said in the Dáil that she was following the Attorney General's advice on this matter; but a person being drunk on the streets is a relatively minor matter, whereas it is far more dangerous to be drunk on an aircraft and it affects everyone on board.  The fines should therefore be tough.  Other provisions of the Act provide for imprisonment for four months.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in her reply the Minister could deal with the issue of worker directors &mdash; specifically, whether employees of the Great Southern Hotels and of Aer Rianta International can vote for worker directors of the main company.  The history of Aer Rianta shows that it is a company which welcomes such developments and we should facilitate it as much as possible.  The question is whether it should be put in the Bill or done by order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>What is the present status of the report commissioned by the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, on the enterprise development task force for Dublin Airport?  I understand its proposals included an enterprise centre for Swords, advanced factories and, closer to County Louth, a pilot training technical school in Gormanstown. Airports have a significant effect on the surrounding community and there was an interesting debate recently about the land held by Aer Rianta.  The company is wise to keep that land for future development of the airport and it should be cautious in selling it.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta and Ryanair are both successful companies and I do not like to read that they are <Col N="381" /> in conflict, although that may be exaggerated by local newspapers or those who make speeches at lunchtime events.  I have great respect for the enterprise, initiative and dedication of the employees and board of Aer Rianta and for the management of Ryanair.  It would make a lot of sense if there were more communication between them.  Ryanair is a dynamic airline, the European leader in the low fare sector, and it should co-operate with Aer Rianta.  Differences of opinion are healthy but in this case there is too much conflict. Ryanair has considerable difficulties with the operation of Dublin Airport and would like to change many things.  This problem should be tackled and a meeting between the parties would be a positive move for the industry.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Bill the Minister has brought to this House in this Seanad session and I compliment her for the manner in which she has facilitated the birth of the legislation, which has been 30 years in gestation.  She has notched up another piece of history which will be remembered in years to come, because it is defining legislation.  I also compliment her for the open and refreshing approach she has taken to bringing the Bill through both Houses.  The record shows the number of amendments she was prepared to consider and incorporate in the Bill &mdash; Senator O'Dowd has mentioned those accepted from his colleague in the other House and more were accepted from other Deputies.  It is a mark of the maturity of our political debate that there is such an openness of approach to matters to which the Minister and her officials, with the best will in the world, might not have given due emphasis.</P>
      <P>I compliment her on that and I compliment Senator O'Dowd for the very positive and constructive approach he adopted.  I share some of his concerns regarding the tensions that exist.  I recall late, great and famous politicians often talking about creative tension being very healthy. I am sure the Minister is mindful of that expression.  Creative tensions can be healthy whether they are between politicians or companies, but I agree with the Senator that it appears what emanates in the public arena goes beyond creative tensions.  They can be complementary while the opposite can be damaging and destructive. I fully endorse his sentiments that greater co-operation, communication and a greater level of commitment to collaboration between two successful companies, one semi-State and one private, would be very much welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with our State airports and their operation and management into the next millennium and beyond.  It provides a new framework for their operation by providing Aer Rianta with a measure of commercial freedom and responsibility. The Minister outlined the many needs for that and why the time has come to give a company with such a record more of a head.  One of the fundamental principles in the Bill is the establishment <Col N="382" /> of Aer Rianta as a normal State commercial body on the same footing as other semi-State companies.  The Bill also regulates areas of its activities in which the exposure of the Exchequer is greatest.  This combination strikes a fine balance between the need for promotion and facilitation of greater innovation and freedom while at the same time protecting against undue risk to the public purse and the rights of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the balance right in this respect and I agree with Senator O'Dowd that the Bill is long overdue.  The long period of gestation has already been referred to.  The Minister postulated, reflected and considered the many reasons it took this Bill to come into the public arena. However, the Bill deals with the current agency status of the company and transfers to it assets, properties and responsibilities currently under the aegis of the Minister and her Department.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta was incorporated in 1937 as the holding company of the national airline and it was given responsibility for the management of Dublin Airport in 1941.  This was enshrined in statute by section 23 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950.  The Air Companies Act, 1966, separated Aer Rianta from Aer Lingus and left the company responsible for the operation and management of Dublin Airport.  In 1969 responsibility for the management of Cork and Shannon Airports was transferred from the Department of Transport and Power to the company without legislation.  The late Minister, Mr. Erskine Childers, had drafted the heads of a Bill but, unfortunately, for various reasons they never saw the light of day.  However, the company continued to operate on the basis of being an agent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In 1992 a joint Oireachtas committee report and an interdepartmental committee strongly recommended a change of status for Aer Rianta. It was only in 1997 with the publication of this Bill that the late Minister Childers' intentions were finally carried out and the period of gestation came to an end.  Despite the lack of statutory funding and with no underpinning legislation, Aer Rianta has operated as a commercial semi-State body since 1969 with its agency relationship and, indeed, without owning the assets involved.  Despite its agency status it established itself as a successful and progressive company in its own right.</P>
    <P>Up until 1986 the Government spent £57.1 million on capital investment at the three airports but since 1987 all new capital expenditure has been funded by the company out of its own resources. Up to and including 1997 £282 million had been so invested.  The capital projects undertaken by the company included the new runway at Dublin Airport, which I welcome very much, major extensions to the terminal building in Cork and an extension of the pier at Shannon.  Many other projects have started or are in the pipeline which will involve an investment programme of more than £200 million in airport facilities over the next <Col N="383" /> few years.  Between 1969 and 1997 Aer Rianta contributed £222.44 million to the Exchequer. The growth in passenger and freight traffic in recent years has been spectacular &mdash; for example, total passenger traffic through the three airports in 1996 reached 11.9 million and this figure represents a 13 per cent increase in passenger throughput &mdash; and there was an 18 per cent increase in freight traffic over 1995.</P>
    <P>It has been a phenomenal success and inevitably it put a great deal of strain on the company's development and expansion programme.  While these programmes must be subject to periodic review, there is no doubt the evidence available supports the continuance of the planned programme. I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the retired chief executive officer, Mr. Tadhg Keogh.  His skills, management style and vision played a huge part in the steering of the company to such great achievement from the time he moved there from the Department of Transport and Power in 1969 and his innovative style played no small part in the development and promotion of the now famous compact for constructive participation, which involves management and staff on a partnership basis in all matters which affect the company.  I wish Mr. Keogh well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Burke, the new chief executive officer, and I know with the new challenges and opportunities afforded him through the Bill he will bring the company to greater heights in the years ahead ably assisted by the board, the company secretary, Margaret Sweeney, and staff, all of whom I compliment on a job extremely well done through the years.  The management and development of the three State airports is Aer Rianta's core business, yet it has been spectacularly successful through its associated industries and subsidiaries in branching out and diversifying in many different ways.  Indeed, it has shown a tremendously innovative and enterprising spirit in promoting such diversity of product.  The same commercial ethos has propelled the development of the highly successful and lucrative duty free retail network at home and abroad and this area of its operations is a significant part of the financial strength of the company.</P>
    <P>The proposals to abolish the intra-EU element of this are frightening and are a serious matter for the company.  The principles upon which the decision to abolish intra-EU duty free was arrived at in terms of the EU Internal Market and while it seemed logical and sensible at the time subsequent events, with the failure to harmonise taxes in so many other ways, have rendered this decision almost irrelevant in economic and fiscal terms in regard to the Internal Market.  Excise duty rates are widely divergent and there is no sign of movement towards convergence.  VAT rates range from 0 to 25 per cent and there is no definitive VAT régime in sight, let alone in place. Against such a background the economic and <Col N="384" /> monetary arguments advanced for the abolition of duty free for intra-EU travel become irrelevant and to persist with it amounts to a monstrous manifestation of bureaucracy.  Duty free retailing is one of the EU's most dynamic industries.  For example, the current EU turnover is in excess of £4.5 billion.  Intra-EU duty free sales in Ireland exceeded £115 million in 1996.  Commissioned studies which have been published point to the serious and significant impact not alone on direct employment but also very significant damage to indirect employment generated as a result of this business.  For example, it will have an impact on air fares, charges, access cost, export costs for manufacturers and the pricing structure of the services provided at airports by Aer Rianta.  That will inevitably have a serious impact on the current tourism boom.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Minister has embarked on a personal crusade to confront the EU decision to abolish duty free sales by June 1999. She has availed of every possible opportunity to confront, debate, cajole, convince and win over her EU counterparts to her conviction that the final abolition of this service is in no one's interest.  The more one analyses this, the more one is convinced the Minister is right that no one will benefit from this &mdash; the only outcome, under the present single market tax climate, is direct and indirect widespread damage.  Unlike Senator O'Dowd, I believe the Minister can win this fight, which she is determined to take down to the wire. I commend her for that and urge her to continue with that challenge, in which she is ably assisted by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. She has played a spectacular leading role in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its enactment will undoubtedly enable Aer Rianta to rise to even greater heights under its new chief executive and board of management in taking on the ever increasing and highly competitive challenges of the market place.  The Minister has made history as the Minister who facilitated the birth of this legislation after 30 years of legal pregnancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister, although I do not welcome her Bill.  I have never in my time in this House heard such undiluted gobbledygook as I had to listen to from the last two speakers.  When there is a consensus of opinion, with Members on the Government side congratulating Members of the Opposition on their attitude, it is time to raise one's hand and say &ldquo;Stop, there is something wrong here&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something very wrong when we have to listen to these extraordinarily euphemistic platitudes about a company which has had the softest run of any company in the history of this State.  We have not heard a word of criticism of Aer Rianta in any of the speeches made today. That is amazing because there must be something wrong with this body &mdash; it must have made some mistake at some stage in its career, despite its greatly advantageous position.  I contend that Aer <Col N="385" /> Rianta is beyond criticism because it does not have to compete with anyone, it is in the easiest position of any company in this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing a Bill to change its status from a State agency to a semi-State body, which will still leave it under State control.  That is playing with semantics.  She is introducing a new patient to the sanatorium of semi-State bodies which is already full of sick patients.  It is an extraordinary spectacle to see people welcoming this. It is going to join CIE, which is a disaster; Aer Lingus, which went bust three years ago; the ESB, Telecom Éireann, An Post and all the other State monopolies.  Perhaps that is where it belongs, but let us not be starry eyed about what we are doing.  We are putting it into the least successful area of Irish commercial life.  People who call these commercial State sponsored bodies are guilty of a misnomer because they are mostly the opposite of commercial with a non-commercial ethos.</P>
    <P>The problem with Aer Rianta is that it has a non-commercial and uncritical ethos.  It is very easy for Aer Rianta to increase its passenger numbers to 13.4 million people leaving the country; how else will they leave &mdash; by swimming? However, Members are congratulating it for exporting 13.4 million people.  Those people were queuing at Dublin Airport with no other exit.  It also increased its turnover by 7 per cent, which is not spectacular in these times.  These figures are meaningless in the context of a monopoly situation. It would be extraordinary if Aer Rianta did not make a profit or increase its turnover.  It would be extraordinary if money was not coming out of its ears because it charges what it likes and has no competitors.  Let us be realistic about this company rather than taking these figures as if they were produced in a normal competitive environment, which they were not.</P>
    <P>The Minister should come to this House to say Aer Rianta has served its purpose, is making an enormous amount of money and is ripe for privatisation. The Government could raise money in that way which could be used to pay off the national debt and to pay for more social services and some Government capital expenditure.  That is what we should be hearing, rather than it being launched into this particular sector of the State apparatus.  If this is such a successful company, it is exactly what we want for privatisation. However, we are frightened of privatising it because, due to its monopoly situation, we do not know how good it really is.  We do not know whether it is any good at all because it has never had to compete.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is a victim of a very sick psychology. When one goes to change money in Dublin Airport one encounters the Bank of Ireland.  I have no quarrel with the Bank of Ireland having foreign exchange facilities at the airport but I do have a quarrel with the fact it is the only bank with such facilities.  The reason Aer Rianta will not allow another bank to have foreign exchange facilities at the airport is that this <Col N="386" /> monopoly psychology has infiltrated the minds of all the people who run it.  As a result, the Bank of Ireland, like Aer Rianta, fleeces tourists for as much as it can get out of them because it has no competition in the airport.  If there was competition, the margins between the buying and selling prices of foreign exchange at the airport would be immediately slashed.  However, that does not happen because Aer Rianta will allow only one bank to have operations in the airport.</P>
    <P>The bogus crusade on duty free, in which all politicians in this House are guilty of participating, is part of that culture.  Aer Rianta itself is protected and it is now asking that its profits also be protected.  Most people know perfectly well &mdash; I will place a wager on it with any Member of the House &mdash; that the argument about duty free is a dead duck.</P>
    <P>The duty free battle was lost in 1991.  A large number of politicians in other countries are posing on this issue for electoral purpose, giving hope to politicians in this country that, somehow, this battle can be reversed.  It will not be reversed and any objective observer knows that.  It is a great battle to fight because one can say duty free does nobody any harm.  That is even stated in the Aer Rianta report.  However, it does much harm to off licences selling down town and to those who would be selling it if it was not available at the airport.  Like insider dealing on the stock exchange, it is difficulty to pinpoint the person who is damaged.  However, an entire industry is hurt.</P>
    <P>Duty free is one of the most bogus crusades I have seen been fought by politicians in this country for a long time, but it has been led by Aer Rianta who was warned &mdash; the Minister will correct me &mdash; in 1991 that it was coming to an end. Since then, but only belatedly, it led a crusade for the retention of duty free knowing this and has spent a fortune on a fruitless campaign to protect its profits because it does not want to enter the competitive world.  It wants to continue to make profits at the airport where it competes with nobody because it is part of its ethos that it can only make profits when it has prisoners in its duty free areas.</P>
    <P>This is utterly inconsistent with the general philosophy of all parties we belong to and are committed to the EU.  I am one of the most critical eurosceptics in this House.  Yet, apparently those most enthusiastic about Europe do not think this should apply to them.  For some reason they believe there should be exceptions.  The European market is about similar rules for all. There cannot be protection in one place and not another.  However, apparently the europhiles believe in Europe until it begins to hurt in one or two small areas when they request protection for their profits.  This is gross hypocrisy and it exposes the commitment to the European ideal as hollow.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept any Bill of this kind without commenting on the fact that the boards <Col N="387" /> of these semi-State bodies are studded with appointees from political parties and Aer Rianta is no exception.  While I will not select individuals, it is clear that RTÉ, Aer Rianta and the other semi-State bodies have people appointed to them because of their loyalties to political parties and not because of their abilities.  It may be, indeed it is a coincidence, that some people loyal to political parties have ability.</P>

      <P>It is the only concession I am prepared to make.  When the Minister retires I hope she is nominated to the board of a semi-State body.  She deserves to be.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is an exceptionally political semi-State body.  It is very difficult to judge the performance of a body of this kind without looking at the board membership and how it is appointed. By no stretch of the imagination could anybody maintain that the board of Aer Rianta is an independent body; it is not.  At present it is full of Fianna Fáil Party members and of people who are loyal to Fianna Fáil.  In the past it has been different.</P>

      <P>The role of Aer Rianta, praised by everybody here for being so constructive, has been utterly obstructive in certain areas.  It has a monopolistic empire which it is building all the time.  It has objected to planning permission at Dublin Airport to people seeking to build a second terminal, to efforts to build a terminal at Baldonnel and to all competition, whether on planning or other grounds.  Given this, it will be unable to prove its own worth as a commercial body.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta says it has spent so much on pier three, the car parks and new terminals.  When driving through the car park at Dublin Airport I wonder at the kind of efficiency tests it has been put to.  I am sure Aer Rianta does not compare its operations with those overseas because it does not need to.  Throughout its history and in this legislation it appears to be guaranteed some kind of eternal monopoly in Ireland which will ensure the figures it provides are meaningless because there is nothing to compare them with.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross made a worthwhile contribution.  However, it is readily apparent he does not know how business operates and survives. Heathrow Terminal One has in excess of 20 million passengers per annum.  Dublin Airport does not have such numbers but it hopes to achieve them within the next five years.  It is bad business to consider building airports elsewhere when the targets necessary to make them viable have not been met.</P>
      <P>I am a concessionaire and I worked closely with Aer Rianta since 1983.  Apart from another gentleman, I was the first concessionaire at the airport to start the growth of the company before the aviation business took off in the past few years.  A large investment had to be made, including long hours of trading.  Work would begin at 6 a.m. and not conclude until 3 a.m. the following morning.  Anybody running a business knows &mdash; I am sure Senator Quinn will agree &mdash; that when account is taken of the rota basis, the regulations and principles, including trade unions, four and not three shifts per week are required.  It is not easy to make money running a business at an airport. It may be a monopoly but if only one business can survive and succeed it makes sense that there should be only one.  Coming from the midlands, I have the alternative of flying out of Belfast but Dublin Airport offers cheaper flights and that is why I use it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Aer Rianta on being one of the best semi-State organisations.  A previous Minister who also represented the constituency of Longford-Roscommon, the late Erskine Childers, when setting up the company 30 years ago hoped to introduce this legislation.  It is nice to see Minister O'Rourke bringing it before the House today.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross is a good journalist, you can debate an issue with him and he will concede when he is wrong.  He is wrong to compare Aer Rianta to CIE.  That is an exaggeration.  Aer Rianta is one of the top performers in the State and should not be brought down to the level CIE has found itself in recent years.  I disagree with the Senator's statement that Aer Rianta has detracted from trade in Ireland.  I travel at least 20,000 miles per year and I know that a sale at an airport is an added sale.  It is made with whatever money the customer has left as he leaves.  Furthermore, the duty free shop is a convenient place of sale for the A and B classes who are not accustomed to shopping because they do not have the time to do it.</P>

      <P>Research carried out at the airports indicates that 80 per cent of sales are added sales.  Manufacturers know the value of this.  Few people are aware that many Irish brand names were created by the guaranteed sales.  The chief executive of Bailey's told me that if the company had not secured agreement from Aer Rianta to <Col N="389" /> promote its products it would have been unable to survive to become the world renowned brand name it is today.  Bailey's is a great source of employment and an ambassador for Irish industry.</P>
      <P>An enormous number of jobs in the private sector and in small business exist because of Dublin Airport &mdash; companies such as Wright's of Howth and Lir Chocolates.  I want it put on the record that when you arrive at Dublin Airport you realise you are in Ireland, you see the goods on sale are Irish made.  If you walk down Grafton Street, you could be in Birmingham, Manchester or London.  When I arrive in Nashville there is a sign which reads &ldquo;Welcome to Nashville &mdash; the Home of Country Music&rdquo;.  When I arrive in Dublin I know I am in Dublin Airport because of all the Irish products on sale there.  You are proud to be Irish when you are shopping at the duty free shop in Dublin Airport and the purchasers realise that the products on sale are good value for money.</P>
      <P>In 1991 when it was agreed to end duty free, taxation was to be harmonised throughout Europe.  This has not happened, taxation has become more disparate.  I congratulate Minister O'Rourke for bringing Ireland's case before her European counterparts.  I hope that everyone else in the present Government works as hard as the Minister to bring this issue to a successful conclusion. I congratulate the Taoiseach on his stance and I know the Minister for Finance is doing all he can, but the manner in which Minister O'Rourke fought the case for duty free was an example to the rest of Europe.  Other EU member states are now taking a serious interest in what will happen to duty free.</P>
      <P>I was in Kuala Lumpur airport on my way to Australia a week ago.  There is a duty free shop in that airport through which it would take ten minutes to walk.  All international airports have massive duty free shops.  There are flights to 63 destinations from Dublin Airport.  That is a greater number than Heathrow Airport, with its four terminals, offers.  We can read about this in a Sunday newspaper but what is really happening will be broadcast on television tonight.</P>
      <P>The opening of Pier C and the future opening of Pier D offer a fantastic opportunity for Aer Rianta to develop and expand over the next seven years.  It will be more profitable, create more jobs and give a greater service, but according to Senator Ross that is not in line with the Ireland of the future.  Someone once told me that a good socialist was a person who wanted to share everything with everyone when he had nothing.  I know Senator Ross is a man of substantial means but that is the philosophy for which he is arguing.</P>
      <P>When we examine the reports which come before us as Members of the Oireachtas the bottom line is profitability.  This company is profitable, it is investing and reinvesting and should be supported.  I welcome the legislation before us today.</P>

      <P>This Bill travels in the right direction and I am delighted with it.  I hope the next step will be to see if Aer Rianta can compete in the commercial world.  Airport management requires a huge amount of money but that funding should not come from the State.  It should come from investors who are willing to put money into it and for that reason the State should not be involved in running the company.  Aer Rianta is the perfect body for privatisation because it can compete and succeed.  I disagree with Senator Ross.  My experience is that not only can it succeed in running duty free shops but also in airport management outside Ireland.  That is why I welcome the Bill which does not restrict it to this country only.  I am not sure how one can regulate a monopoly.</P>
      <P>Money is a huge issue.  A report in today's <i>Financial Times</i> refers to the difficulties involved in privatising the United Kingdom's air traffic service. It seems that will not happen for three or four years because of computer problems, although Mr. Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke last week about the ability to privatise it.  That is an issue for the Irish Aviation Authority but it is the correct direction to go.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the chief executive will <i>ex officio</i> be on the board.  I do not understand why the Food Safety Authority debarred the chief executive from the board, although that is not the Minister's remit.  I am concerned, however, that we have not put an onus on the Minister to publish the accounts within a reasonable period of time after receiving them.  When I was in An Post many years ago I remember the accounts being given to the Minister who had to be urged to publish them.  When we looked last November for RTÉ's accounts for the previous year, we discovered they had not been published.  They were then published within the following week.  The onus is on the Minister to publish these accounts. I have asked for this to be included for every State board since I came into this House.  I gather that in recent years a provision has been included in almost every Bill to ensure that details of accounts are published within three or six months of the end of the financial year.  I ask the Minister to consider that on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak about the challenge facing airports. Senator Cassidy referred to Kuala Lumpur. I was in Singapore some years ago and I remember being impressed with its airport.  As we came in on the jumbo jet, two more landed beside us and I thought it would take all day to get out of <Col N="391" /> the airport.  However, we were impressed with the service at the immigration desk, baggage desk and customs control.</P>
    <P>When the young man who came to collect us went to get his car in a car park, I noticed there were no cars parked outside the airport.  When he returned within two minutes he said that Singapore was anxious to win the airport of the year award because it came second the previous year to Schipol Airport in Amsterdam.  He wanted to know if the immigration service was good.  I told him it was, that the man in charge wanted to know the purpose of our visit and then he wished us well and called me by my name.  He then wanted to know if the bags had arrived before we had.  I said they had, although three jumbo jets had come in at the same time.  He was delighted because they had lost points in the best airport of the year award the previous year on both those counts.  When he asked about customs control, I told him that the lady was efficient and strict.  She asked me if I was aware that the death penalty existed for the importation of drugs and if I had any with me.  The answer to the first question was yes and no to the second one.  One better not get those two questions wrong.</P>
    <P>The young man who came to collect us said they had lost marks the previous year because of the difficulty in getting out of the airport.  Everyone in Singapore used to double and treble park outside the airport, as they do in Dublin.  He said that when they decided they wanted to win the competition, the mindset of the nation changed and that was why there were no cars parked outside the airport.  The airport had provided facilities so that people could drive to the airport, park their cars, pick up their guests and then drive them away.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport needs to lift the pride of the nation, the city, those who work there and those who use it to make it the best airport in the world. That means people's attitudes must change.  We are not just talking about money.  Elderly American friends of mine are frustrated when they travel here because they always have difficulty finding a green cap in Dublin Airport.  A sign states that green caps are available but they have told me that no one wears a green cap and they are unable to find anyone to carry their luggage, which does not happen at other airports.  Little touches such as these make an airport a success.</P>
    <P>The people running Aer Rianta have the skills and enthusiasm to make Dublin Airport a success. They could run the best airports in the world.  I would welcome its privatisation and competition from other countries, which would prove Senator Ross wrong.  I would like to believe that Aer Rianta is capable of flying the flag for Ireland and achieving success not only in duty free shops but also in airport management.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider my suggestion that the Minister should publish the accounts within three months of the end of the financial year. <Col N="392" /></P>

      <P>While most aspects have been covered, nobody mentioned employing people at Dublin Airport who speak foreign languages. This would be particularly useful at the lost baggage desk.

Perhaps the Minister could consider this in her reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  Senator O'Dowd asked about the report commissioned by the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, on the enterprise development task force for Dublin Airport and surrounding areas.  It was set up to examine what could be done about jobs within the airport's remit.  The economic upturn meant it was no longer necessary. The Senator also wanted to know what happened to the report.  It seems to have concentrated on job training, advice to small firms and other related activities.  Employment levels at the airport are high.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd also mentioned Ryanair and the frosty relations between it and Aer Rianta, which is not desirable.  Combat is no harm for politicians or for people in general.  One of the protagonists has a strong combative nature and that is the reason air fares are at their current level.  I am glad to note there is combat on the other side as well.  I thank the Senator for his contribution which was interesting.</P>
      <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald made a strong speech on the duty free issue and on various other aspects of Aer Rianta.  Senator Ross showed his combative nature during his contribution.  We went head to head.  I welcome that approach because there is a need for a catalyst or someone who stirs the pot from time to time.  Lest Senator Ross should be aghast that I am taking such a feminine line, I think he did stir the pot in a real way.</P>
      <P>I must correct the Senator, however; Telecom Éireann is no longer a monopoly.</P>

    <P>I will inquire into the Bank of Ireland monopoly at Dublin Airport because I am unaware of it.  I know the bank advertises on the radio where a woman berates her partner at the airport because he forgot to change their money and he <Col N="393" /> says that there is no need to worry because they can use the Bank of Ireland.  I did not realise the bank was in a monopoly position there but I will make inquires about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross said that duty free was a bogus debate and a bogus crusade.  He said it was a dead duck.  It is not a dead duck because we will not allow the debate to become a dead duck.  We will bring it to the wire.  I have noticed since the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, brought France, Germany and Spain with him at ECOFIN that it is now becoming fashionable to deride those who are in favour of retaining duty free. Journalists, members of the media and ordinary folk are saying that duty free is not important because it is only for the elite.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Monti told me through somebody that it was only for the elite who travel. Thankfully, in this enlightened age my constituents travel to see a daughter in America or a nephew in Australia get married, etc., because there are lower fares and people are more geared towards travel.  Therefore, the idea that it is only the elite who avail of duty free is a nonsense.  In addition, the regional airports rely totally on duty free.  That can be a bad thing too because if it is abolished, their support is gone.  Duty free is an issue of ordinary folk.</P>
    <P>I referred to the debates of Mme.  Scrivener when she was the Commissioner responsible.  The abolition of duty free was proposed against a background of tax and fiscal harmonisation which has not been implemented.  It was one element of that, the only one, which they have pursued wholeheartedly.  I think Commissioner Monti is behaving in an opinionated and determined way. It is becoming an issue of the will of the bureaucrat versus the will of the politician.  In the end I would prefer to be ruled by politicians than bureaucrats.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what Senator Ross said in that regard, but I do not want any acrimony about it.  I still found his speech to be a good one because it was interesting and different.  I found Senator Cassidy's contribution equally good and different.  He gave examples of how he became familiar with the duty free issue and the work of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn may not have been here when I addressed the privatisation issue.  I spoke about it in a general sense, not particularly with Aer Rianta in mind.  The guidelines state that one must comply with the timeframe, but I take the Senator's point.  We publish accounts as soon as we receive them; what is the point of hanging on to them?  I do not know how we will go about it, but I see the point of bringing the accounts before Cabinet and making them public as soon as possible. I hope to return to Senator Quinn on the matter.  I do not deal with RTÉ but I am aware of the delay to which he referred, although I do not know its cause.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about simple visual matters at Dublin Airport which made sense, such as the provision of people wearing green caps to help with luggage so that one would know who to <Col N="394" /> approach.  Those are everyday ordinary matters. Often in the running of a big business the smaller issues are not looked at and these are the ones which make a difference.  There are Aer Rianta staff present and I am sure they will take that into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry made a fine sensible remark. Most young people remain in school until they are 17 or 18 and they are learning not just French but German and Spanish too.  It is desirable that one would have the use of another language to converse with visitors who cannot speak English, even if it were just to give directions.  The facility of a foreign language, in a conversational rather than an academic sense, is something which should be sought when applicants for those jobs are interviewed.  It is an excellent idea and I hope it will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest regard for Aer Rianta under Mr. John Burke, Ms Margaret Sweeney, the company secretary, and the excellent chairman, who was appointed by Fianna Fáil.  I have found the chairpersons and members of boards, no matter from where they came or from what political party, to be men and women of decency and circumspection. I have no brief with the reign of a previous Minister who thought that in every semi-State body lurked pools of corruption and people of disrepute.  I do not hold with that view whatsoever. These men and women are doing a job to the best of their ability within the confines laid down by the State.  They are paid a modest salary. They work to an agenda which we lay down.  In my dealings with the members of the boards and those who work in semi-State bodies, I have found them agreeable, productive and harmonious people.  I hold no brief for running them down and I am aware that nobody in this House did so either.  The points made here were of a general rather than a specific nature.</P>
    <P>The semi-State sector is changing but it will not happen overnight.  We must look to the company, the customer, the workforce and their needs.  I agree with Senator Ross on one matter and I wish we could bring that a little further.  For instance, next year a percentage of Telecom Éireann will be sold to IPO.  We hope it will reap a handsome return to the State.  It is my belief that that kind of return should be divided between reducing the State debt and paying for public infrastructural works which still need to be done since Europe is fast receding as the provider of money for such purposes.  I believe that debate will begin.  I thank all who contributed to this debate.  I welcome and congratulate Senator John Cregan.  He won the by-election handsomely and I know he will be a fine contributor to the proceedings of the House for many years.</P>

      <P>I call on the Minister for Defence to provide suitable accommodation for the FCA unit in Granard, County Longford.  I brought this matter to the House because of a letter sent to me by the Granard Town Commissioners concerning the condition of the building which houses the FCA unit in the town.  The building was erected in 1959 but has deteriorated substantially to the extent that it is now not suitable for use by the FCA.  I would like the Minister to say if suitable accommodation can be provided.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Defence, has asked me to speak on the matter before the House.  I welcome this opportunity to outline the position with regard to the study of the Reserve Defence Forces which is being undertaken at present.  It enables me to deal with a number of issues which have given rise to some misconceptions and perhaps some unease surrounding the process.</P>
      <P>In October 1997 the Chief of Staff established a military review board to conduct a special study of the Reserve Defence Force.  This board is required to work in collaboration with a consultative group made up of members of the Reserve Defence Force.  The members of this group comprise commissioned and non-commissioned officers from the four Commands and from the Slua Muirí.  The Minister has also recently set up a joint military-civilian steering group to oversee the study of the Reserve Defence Force.  The membership of this group comprises an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from the Department of Defence and a serving FCA officer.</P>
      <P>The study of the Reserve Defence Force will be wide ranging and will examine such matters as the appropriate strengths of the various elements, equipment, accommodation, training, etc., and although no deadlines have been specified the Minister is confident that the group will conduct its work as quickly as possible and will submit its recommendations at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second half of this year, a review of the Defence Force's accommodation requirements will be initiated in line with the commitment given in the Defence Forces review implementation plan.  The Minister for Defence has stated on many occasions that no definitive decisions on <Col N="396" /> accommodation requirements will be made until that review is completed.  In this regard, I emphasise that it would be premature to speculate as to the outcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to FCA accommodation, a large number of properties are used throughout the country for training and administration.  These include 29 Army barracks, 44 other State owned properties, 22 privately owned properties rented on a full-time basis by the Department and more than 200 local halls and premises rented on a part-time basis.  The Department also owns a number of sites on which prefabricated huts erected in the 1950s are situated.</P>
    <P>Concerning the specific post at Granard which belongs to this last category of premises, it has been represented by the military authorities that it is now unsuitable for the needs of the FCA unit in question.  The provision of suitable alternative accommodation is under active consideration.  A number of alternative premises have been proposed and found, for one reason or another, to be inappropriate for FCA use.  Currently, one premises in particular is being examined.  I can assure Senator Finneran that every effort is being made to find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the significance of an FCA unit to a town such as Granard and to the surrounding area.  I used to represent Longford-Westmeath and I am delighted to see Granard making its case.  I appreciate the part an FCA unit plays in the lives of the local community.  The Government recognises that membership of the FCA and access to the training it provides helps to create discipline and camaraderie among young people at an important stage of their social and personal development.  It also gives them a taste of army life and some of them go on to join the Permanent Defence Force where they have an opportunity to serve their country and the cause of peace in troubled areas of the world.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising the matter. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, has spoken to me about it.  The Minister is very conscious of the role of the FCA and of the case put forward by Senator Finneran.  When the Minister asked me to reply on his behalf I told him I would be glad to do so.  He is very conscious of the role of the FCA and is aware of the case made by Senator Finneran.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach also has an interest in the matter.  I understand that the maintenance of the FCA in a town such as Granard is important.  The Minister shares that understanding and is progressive in his views on the Defence Forces.  He will take a close interest in the case the Senator has made.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 26 June 1998.</P>
