      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is items 1, 2 and 13, motion 15.  Item 1 is Report and Final Stages of the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997.  Item 2, Committee and Final Stages of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Bill, 1998, will be taken at the conclusion of item 1.  Item 13, motion 15, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The proceedings on items 1 and 2, if not previously concluded, will be resumed at 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Last week I drew the attention of the Leader to the report of the Irish Pensions Board on the future of pensions in Ireland.  I made the point that it is probably one of the most important reports to have appeared in a long time.  Will the Leader make time available over the next month for a full debate on it as I am sure it is something to which all sides of the House would like to contribute?</P>
      <P>Will the House condemn the action of the Government of India in initiating a series of nuclear tests?  Our Government has for many years been active in seeking to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  What is happening in India has enormous consequences for that part of the world and for the future in terms of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  It is important Ireland be seen to be taking a strong stance on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise again the Shannon River Council Bill.  I am attempting to be helpful and am following on a point made by Senator Manning last week on how the matter might be progressed.  Under Standing Order 104, it is possible, following a Seanad general election, to restore to the Order Paper Bills which did not complete their passage before the election.  Will the Leader indicate whether, in the event of the restoration of the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, to the Order Paper, his party and the other party in Government would support it?  The Bill <Col N="694" /> was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Is this a matter for the Cathaoirleach or for the Leader?  I understand it is a function of the House to bring it forward and I assume that, were that to be done, the Government parties would agree to it.  It should be done by agreement rather than conflict.  I presume that, having supported the Bill in the last Seanad, it will do so again.  Would the Leader accept a procedural motion under Standing Order 104 to have the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, restored to the Order Paper on Committee Stage?  The understanding is that it is now a Bill of the House rather than a Fianna Fáil Bill or otherwise.  Can we be assured of the support of the Government parties for this good legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Irish under-16 soccer team and its manager, Brian Kerr, on being the first Irish champions in an international soccer tournament.  I wish the under-18 team well in its last match for World Cup qualification tomorrow night.  It is a great honour for Ireland to have finally made it to the top in international soccer.</P>
      <P>I want to support what Senator Manning said about India's nuclear testing.  The Leader of the House should raise this matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We should condemn India for breaching the ban on nuclear testing.  This is the first time in 24 years that India has carried out any nuclear tests; not just one, but a number of tests have taken place.  We should also raise the matter at the United Nations with a view to having sanctions imposed on India for breaching this ban.</P>
      <P>I request a debate on industrial relations.  I need not go through the arguments again because we have been calling for such a debate for a number of months.  The Leader should facilitate this debate urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Government of India to test nuclear weapons is very disturbing and distasteful.  The House has put on record its view on these matters and, at the time, through a series of statements, it strongly condemned the French nuclear tests in the Pacific.  Perhaps the Leader would consider granting us time within the next few days when the main groups could make statements on the matter for a few minutes each.  The Indian Government should be made aware of the views of the House, the Government and successive Governments in their opposition to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to world peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning and others who spoke about condemning India for the nuclear tests that have taken place in the last few days.  It has been suggested that the World Bank should impose sanctions on India because of this but sanctions will not achieve anything against the Government of India who created the problem. <Col N="695" /> The starving people of that country must be considered if we are going to discuss sanctions. Having listened to President Clinton this morning, it appeared he was more worried that his intelligence agents did not tell him the tests were going to take place than by what actually occurred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should send a congratulatory message to the under-16 international football team.  We should also have an urgent debate on what is euphemistically called professional sport. We read this morning that the English Football Association has decided that Paul Gascoigne can smoke during the World Cup campaign.  He can beat his wife and can play football for England. That is &ldquo;professional sport&rdquo;.  Twenty five million people saw the captain of the England football team, Alan Shearer, kicking Neil Lennon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he is captain of England he was not found guilty of an offence.  The English Rugby Football Union has decided that a man who was seen biting somebody's else head is not to be censured because the player in question said he did not remember being bitten on the head but did remember his finger being bitten.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Tyrone footballers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters are not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will cite two other instances. Elite athletes in Ireland are now being paid extra money by the Government to continue their elite athleticism.  However, none of their agents comes from Ireland so the taxpayer and the national lottery is paying 20 per cent of the money these elite athletes earn, straight into the hands of their agents.  Should this be so?</P>
      <P>In the case of Michelle Smith, a totally unethical and immoral test was carried out during her menstrual cycle at the Olympics in Atlanta.  She has now been tested again.  How can sport be associated with people standing by to take a test while others urinate?  Is this sport?  The Leader should organise a debate urgently on what is euphemistically called sport.  The effect of all these instances will impact on young people here and elsewhere.  We should decide whether we want professional sport to continue as it is or to eliminate professionalism and have sport that is truly sport.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader to hold an urgent debate on the Middle East.  In view of Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions in the meantime, I urge the Leader to hold at least an hour long debate on the problems in the Middle East within the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators are aware that I am reluctant to interrupt them while they are speaking.  However, I have appealed to them on many occasions in the past to raise only matters that are relevant to the Order of Business.  Long contributions are not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Many matters which are raised on the Order of Business are more appropriate to the Adjournment debate.  This evening, for the third sitting day in succession, no matters are due to be raised on the Adjournment yet Members insist on raising matters on the Order of Business which are more appropriate to that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is not an Adjournment matter.  A few weeks ago every Member of this House welcomed the treaty which was signed by the British and Irish Governments. My support for that treaty remains but I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach if he will consider coming to the Seanad to apologise for the hurt caused to the families of the victims of the Balcombe Street gang by the scenes at the Árd Fheis at the weekend.  The Secretary of State, Dr. Mowlam, has already apologised to those victims.</P>
      <P>While permission for the release of these prisoners might have been granted in good faith, it would be appropriate, because of the immense damage being done to the agreement in Northern Ireland, if the Taoiseach were to make more than a gesture to show his sorrow and regret for what happened at the weekend.  It might be difficult for people in the South to imagine what is happening in Northern Ireland but, as a result of the scenes at the RDS, moderate opinion on the Unionist side is swinging to the no campaign.  Perhaps the Leader would convey my feelings about the effect of these scenes to the Taoiseach and ask him to redress the balance as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Leader and the House to the serious deterioration of the fabric of society on the Blasket Island.  I seek an immediate and urgent debate on the matter.  The policies pursued by the State on the island for the past ten years have resulted only in the dilapidation of its properties, legal costs exceeding £1 million and the loss of millions of pounds in EU funding which were designated for the island.  Senator Manning, on 10 May 1989, pointed out to the Seanad, as did Deputy Begley to the Dáil on 24 May 1989, the constitutional infringement inherent in portions of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Ross.  All Members must have been horrified by the triumphalist scenes that greeted the appearance of the prisoners at the RDS at the weekend.  I regret those scenes immensely and I agree they were most hurtful to the victims of violence in both Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Health and Children our grave concern at the shortage of blood supplies which has led some major hospitals to carry out emergency operations only?  Will the Leader bring these concerns to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children as a matter of urgency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bacon report is being discussed in the other House at the moment.  Problems exist in regard to draft agreements which are issued by builders in relation to the purchase of new property, particularly in the Dublin area. Judges have ruled that such draft agreements are not legally binding; that is very serious.  For example, a particular draft agreement quoting a price of £123,000 for a house was changed to quote a price of £165,000 as the house was not to be finished for a further five months.  The judge in that particular case ruled in favour of the builder.  I am very concerned about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will arise in regard to a Bill which is due in the House later this week.  It would be far more appropriate for the Senator to discuss the matter at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader assure the House that the Bacon report will come before the House this week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resist the temptation to send congratulations to Dana International on her victory in the Eurovision Song Contest and to issue a rebuke to Pat Kenny for saying that the definition of a real woman was one who was capable of having children.  That was a rather remarkable comment to make in view of the fact that some Irish women are infertile.</P>
      <P>The directive on patenting, passed by the European Parliament in recent days, seeks to allow the patenting of life forms.  This matter was discussed in the House previously.  Will the Leader inform the House when this directive becomes applicable in Ireland?  We should have a full debate on this issue as it is one of extraordinary moral significance, particularly where it purports to patent seeds and plant material belonging to indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a discussion on the use of child labour as children protesting against this issue on a global scale passed by this building on a march in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all horrified that the Balcombe Street gang admitted to the Guilford bombings for which other people were imprisoned.  However, although the scenes at the Sinn Féin Árd Fheis were shocking and uncomfortable, they were inevitable as the release of such prisoners is an emotive issue.  Although I do not often disagree with my colleague, I believe that focusing on the issue will only serve to exacerbate it.  We must proceed with the implementation of the Agreement. The scenes at the Árd Fheis were hurtful, <Col N="698" /> hateful and reprehensible but I doubt they were planned by Sinn Féin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate in the near future on the rural renewal scheme which will be implemented on 1 June?  I do not know who is responsible for selecting the areas included in the scheme but many counties such as Donegal and Monaghan have been excluded and I would like to know on what basis this has happened.  It is difficult to believe that a Bill drawn up to implement financial advantages is excluding such counties.  I ask the Minister urgently to come to the House to allay the fears of those who feel they are discriminated against. We have had the worst of all deals.  The southern Border counties are not wanted by our own Government.  Why does the Government not put us into the North?  That might at least balance things up.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am justified in asking for a debate on a matter dealt with in the document I hold in my hand.  Counties are being indemnified for rural renewal that are no more disadvantaged than my own.  I have an obligation to stand and plead with the Leader to hold a debate on this subject.  I hope other people in the west and in County Monaghan who have a similar problem will argue their case just as strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been here quite a while and I realise that, because of the number of matters referred to the Leader it is impossible to deal with all of them.  I know that everyone regards his or her matter as urgent.  I make a special request to the Leader to have this matter raised in the House and to ask the Minister for Finance to explain the criteria by which the areas for rural renewal were selected and what sort of committee recommended certain areas at a cost to other areas, one of which I represent.  I am entitled to stand and speak, I hope.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science the great concern of students, parents and teachers at the fact that the scheme for third level students has not yet issued.  This <Col N="699" /> scheme is normally available at the beginning of May and may not now issue until students have left second level schools and colleges.  This is disgraceful. The Government ought to specify a date, perhaps around 1 April, when these schemes would be issued so that parents students and teachers could make proper and wise decisions for the coming academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is germane to the issue raised by Senator Ross.  I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Taoiseach our appreciation of the humanity, sensitivity and dignity of his statement about victims in response to a report issued today by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield. This gives us an opportunity of recognising, as Senator Ross has done, the very real hurt of many people which they are being asked to offer up in the interest of the peace process.  They are, on both sides, being asked to accept the release of people who have done very terrible things to their friends and relations.  It is proper that all of us should recognise the extent of that price.  I am glad the Taoiseach, in his statement, has recognised the plight of victims in this jurisdiction too and I hope that whatever practical methods are developed in Northern Ireland for helping victims are replicated, to the extent that they may be needed, in this part of the island as well.  When the political dust has settled, will the Leader arrange a debate which will enable us to consider these matters of reconciliation and recompense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader if the proposed visit by Senators to St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane is to take place.  When the matter was debated I understood the visit was to take place relatively soon.  Has the Leader further information on it?</P>
      <P>Can the Leader confirm, or ask the relevant Minister to confirm, the exact details of the 11 year old gypsy girl who reportedly entered a forced marriage with another member of that refugee community?  What safeguards can society have to ensure such marriages in that community, a number of whose members are currently resident in Ireland, are stopped?  Being wed against one's will at 11 years of age is totally unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we debated road accidents and deaths.  I congratulate RTÉ on its magnificent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night which highlighted the problems on the roads.  Will the Leader ask RTÉ to make that film available to secondary schools?  Doing so would be a very good exercise as pupils would see the dangers of drunk, careless and bad driving.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on alcohol policy as we face the new millennium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks made on nuclear testing by India.  There was a tremendous international furore when <Col N="700" /> France conducted nuclear tests some years ago. The tests conducted by India are particularly insidious because of their effect on the region. We have heard the belligerent statements made by Pakistan and what it might do to other powers in that region.  The tests should be absolutely condemned.</P>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the remarks initially made by Senator Ross in relation to what took place at the Sinn Féin Árd Fheis last Sunday.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by Pádraig Flynn, the EU Commissioner, on banning tobacco sponsorship and advertising at sports events with effect from 2006.  Tomorrow the Joint Committee on Health and Children will meet people who have been affected by tobacco abuse.  A number of citizens, such as those in the USA, are setting about suing the tobacco industry and I support them in that endeavour.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter at an early date with the Minister for Health and Children? The Department of Health and Children informs us that tobacco kills 6,000 people per year in Ireland.  The issue requires urgent attention and discussion in the House, particularly in the light of recent events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up the theme raised by Senator Hayes and others and ask the Leader to convey to the Taoiseach that he has the good will of the House and the vast majority of people on the island in what are difficult times.  It was a timely opportunity in advance of next week's referendum.  There is a price to be paid for peace. All of us felt somewhat uncomfortable at the scenes on television last Sunday.  I do not believe Sinn Féin deliberately orchestrated the response &mdash; the party issued a statement to that effect.  At every stage in our history this century, prisoners have been central when there has been a need for healing, peace and reconciliation.  It is an uncomfortable truth &mdash; I do not wish to diminish the awful hurt of victims of violence &mdash; that violence has affected everybody on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland and in the Republic in the context of the Detective Gerry McCabe incident.  It is important that the House has the opportunity on the Order of Business to convey to the Taoiseach its full support for his brave initiative.  He obviously has more difficult decisions to make in this jurisdiction which may be somewhat unpalatable but must be taken in the long-term interests of the peace and prosperity of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the comments by Senator Lanigan and others, perhaps the Leader would consider asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come into this House to make a presentation not only on underground nuclear testing in India but also on the dangerous and burgeoning military situation in Kosovo and Serbia's aggression in that area.  As part of the European Union, we have an input to make.  Notwithstanding the comments about the Middle East peace process, we should <Col N="701" /> welcome an opportunity to hear what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has to say in this regard. It could be a difficult summer if Serbia does not stop its aggressive behaviour towards the vast majority of Albanians who constitute 95 per cent of the population of Kosovo.  It would be timely if the Minister came here to discuss this situation and other relevant issues.</P>

      <P>As regards Senator Costello's point, I have given my word to the House that we will have a debate on industrial relations at the earliest opportunity.  I agree with Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on professional sport in Ireland and our neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>Many Senators requested as a matter of urgency a debate on the banking sector in Ireland.  They had prepared scripts and were waiting for time to be allocated for this urgent topic. I have arranged time tomorrow afternoon for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Ross, Keogh, Norris, Maurice Hayes and Mooney expressed their concern about the triumphalism displayed on our television screens last Sunday evening.  I welcome Sinn Féin's decision to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum. Although such triumphalist displays were probably not planned, it was inevitable that there would be an instant response from some sections of that organisation at its Ard-Fheis.  I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that not alone was the <Col N="702" /> Taoiseach disappointed, but he also gave an assurance that victims would be given support in the North as well as the South of Ireland.  I remember particularly the people who died in Dublin and Monaghan.  I welcome his comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Coghlan's various views on the Blasket Islands to the relevant Minister. Senator Keogh mentioned the dilemma in which the Department of Health and Children found itself in terms of blood shortages.  I encourage those who have been so generous over the years in donating blood to come forward and be as generous again.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan can raise the matters of interest to him on Friday morning or afternoon when the Bill will come before the House, as the Cathaoirleach pointed out.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris called for an urgent debate on patenting.  I will have time left aside for this and also for a debate on child labour.  Everyone in the House would want to participate in such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan requested a debate on rural renewal schemes.  I spoke to Minister of State Davern this morning about this and it will be discussed the week after the referendum.  I will allocate as much time as the Seanad needs to discuss rural development.  I also point out to the Senator that many parts of Ireland were disappointed that they were not part of the Shannon Pilot Scheme as outlined in the Finance Bill.  Those hard pressed areas such as Longford, Leitrim and parts of Sligo and Cavan deserve a pilot scheme to help them.  Economic success does not seem to have caught on in these areas in the manner in which it has in the cities and larger towns.  The Senator may be disappointed now but I hope that with an overwhelming yes vote, North and South, on May 22, the counties which he represents so ably in this House will not be left out and counties such as Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will receive cross-Border and other funding.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) At least once per year, the Minister shall by regulations made under this section amend subsection (1)(b) of this section by altering the sum mentioned therein having regard to changes in the value of money.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  We are seeking to require the Minister to increase the £10,000 threshold for ten year sentences, which was the subject of much debate on Committee Stage, in line with inflation each year.  It is a reasonable proposal.  Despite the fact that we are going through a period of low inflation which we expect will continue given Ireland's membership of EMU, etc., it makes a great deal of sense to insert this into the Bill.  In that regard, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  I tabled a similar amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I was critical of the £10,000 figure for another reason and I might, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh, rake up some of those criticisms again.  With the way the market changes and the efforts of the Governments &mdash;<Col N="704" /> more the efforts of the previous Government than of this Government &mdash; against the drug barons, the availability of drugs will be reduced. Like everything else the drugs situation responds to the law of supply and demand.  If one goes by classical economics, it would appear that the price of drugs should increase significantly if the supply is curtailed, as it ought to be, as a result of the impressive measures for which one must congratulate this Government and the previous Government.  One hopes these measures will have the necessary effect; I feel sure they will.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister at the minimum to adjust this figure to take account of the cost of living.  I could go further, although it is not mentioned in my amendment, and state that if there is proof that there is a lesser supply of drugs, increasing their value enormously, that should be taken into account.  If the advice to the Minister on the so called market for drugs &mdash; which I believe will be fictitious &mdash; is that there has been a significant increase of 25 or 50 per cent in the price of addictive drugs on the streets while the rate of inflation is only 2 or 3 per cent, the Minister should take that into account and he should have the discretion to raise this figure by that amount.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this.  I do not want to question the good intention of the Minister or his advisers, but the Bill should contain something more specific than drugs to the value of £10,000 or more; a reference to weight, quantity or some other description would be more tangible. As I stated on Second Stage, the problem will be that people will find themselves charged with having drugs worth more than £10,000 and good lawyers will have a field day arguing about how one determines the price of the quantity of drugs found.  The quantity in question might be worth more, but the burden of proof in the courts will rest with the prosecution, that is the State. For that reason, this matter must be reconsidered. We must specify by quantity, type or weight rather than by value.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister's intentions are good but I am appalled that this legislation will soon be enacted.  There is no social or scientific evidence to show that mandatory sentencing in respect of possession of drugs of a set value does any good.  I would be glad if the Minister had access to scientific proof to show that this is a worthwhile measure, but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been unable to supply me with such proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill places enormous power into the hands of those responsible for framing charges.  These people will be in a position to decide on the sentence to be handed down in cases where individuals have been apprehended with a certain quantity of drugs in their possession.  The Minister is aware that if charges are framed to state that the quantity of drugs was valued at over £10,000, a person will be given a certain sentence; but if they are framed to state that the value of the drugs <Col N="705" /> was less than £10,000, the person involved will receive a different sentence.</P>
    <P>The legislation will not lead to the apprehension of drugs barons, who are squeaky clean, it is the mules who will be caught.  I visited the women's prison in Amsterdam &mdash; which is a major point of entry for drugs being shipped from the Far East and South and Central America &mdash; and, having seen the pathetic, middle aged, ill-educated women jailed there for importing drugs, I know we will only apprehend the mules because they, not the drug barons, carry large amount of drugs.  The drug barons caught to date were not found with vast quantities of drugs in their possession, they were apprehended by means of tax related offences or other criminal offences.  For that reason, I regret the introduction of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The idea of comparing the cost of drugs with the cost of living index is too much to bear.  It is incredible that we have decided to put in place a &ldquo;market&rdquo; price for illegal drugs in Ireland when everyone is aware that the cost of these substances in Fermoy differs from that in Dublin and their price depends on the date a shipment is received.  Will dilution be taken into account? Will the number of pollutants contained in drugs be taken into account?  Will we withhold decisions on the value of shipments of heroin, cannabis or Ecstasy until their purity has been established?  If a drug's purity is only 10 per cent, surely its value should be estimated at 10 per cent of the street price.  Addicts do not know the purity of drugs they purchase on the street.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the introduction of this legislation.  Having dealt with drugs on a professional basis, I would do everything in my power to help these unfortunate people escape the drug barons who are destroying their lives.  If there is one Bill which has been introduced which will have no effect, it is this one.  All the legislation will do is put mules in prison.  It will not help us catch the drug barons.  If we concentrated our efforts on trying to pursue the drug barons by means of the Criminal Assets Bureau, which has been very successful, we would be far better off because this legislation is only an emollient and has no value.  We can spend our time trying to decide what the price of drugs was in north Cork or south Kerry on a particular day.  I assure the Minister that this will vary from place to place.</P>
    <P>My main regret is that people believe there is a need for the Bill.  I am aware that those Senators who tabled amendments hope the situation will be alleviated by their action.  However, if the Minister has access to scientific evidence or social surveys which show that the legislation will be of value, there might be some point to enacting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was debated at length on previous Stages of the Bill.  In my opinion, the figure of £10,000 is a sensible and practical yardstick because we must start somewhere. <Col N="706" /> I became lost while trying to follow Senator Connor's argument because if drugs become scarce a lesser quantity of them will be valued at £10,000, which will take account of inflation.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Henry that the legislation is not necessary.  The Bill came about as a result of ongoing public demand for stern action in respect of the drug fraternity.  In recent years, immense progress has been made by the Garda Síochána in this area.  Each week we hear reports about the discovery of drugs in Dublin, Cork and other areas due to vigilance on the part of the Garda.  This legislation will strengthen their powers.</P>
      <P>Everyone recognises the devastation caused in this country by drugs.  For too long, successive Governments have stood back and taken too easy a line.  The current Government has stated that enough is enough and that we must get tough.  I fully condone and approve of the action of the Minister and the Government.  In that context, the provision of a figure of £10,000 is a useful yardstick.  Perhaps it can be changed in ten to 15 years time.  When legislation was introduced to combat drunk driving, a certain limit was put in place which has since been reduced to 80 millilitres. For the foreseeable future, the figure of £10,000 is sensible and practical.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn because the Minister has made a strong and clear case.  We must make a start somewhere and, when it becomes law, the legislation will send out a clear message that those caught dealing drugs worth a significant amount &mdash; £10,000 or more &mdash; will be dealt with harshly.</P>

      <P>To support the amendment would defeat the intention of Senator Connor's argument. If the amendment were passed, it would mean that the value would increase.  In other words, if inflation rose by 5 per cent the value of drugs or the threshold would in turn increase by the amount.  If we want to ensure that more people are drawn into the net, the figure should remain the same.  Inflation over a period will mean that smaller quantities of drugs will come within the threshold.</P>

      <P>The Senator has anticipated me because I was about to enter that domain. Senator Connor dwelt on the supply side but the demand side must also be taken into account. One of the intentions of the Government and the law enforcement authorities is to control supply <Col N="707" /> and reduce demand, which will hopefully have a positive effect.</P>
      <P>There are arguments regarding where the line should be drawn in this area.  However, such lines are continuously drawn in legislation &mdash; for example, that which controls drink driving.  A specified limit has been set in law and people found to be above that limit while in charge of a vehicle are liable for prosecution while those below it are exempt.</P>

      <P>I do not agree, in my view I have drawn a legitimate analogy.  It would be naive to expect that legislation, no matter how draconian, will solve the problem of drugs because that problem is multifaceted.  Nevertheless, it deals with this and imposes penalties.  It achieves what the Legislature is trying to do to restrict the supply of drugs and ensure that those who engage in this trade in death are penalised.  There is other legislation, such as the criminal assets legislation, being used to ensure that those who acquire ill-gotten gains through this type of activity are dealt with.  I do not see the consistency between the arguments which I subscribe to and the intention of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I endorse the comments made by Senator Dardis.  The Minister must send out a powerful signal.  That signal would be diluted in the absence of a specific value in the Bill.  If one was to take into account all the qualifications which Opposition Senators have introduced, one would end up with a Bill containing provisions which no one understood.  Clarity is of the essence.  Giving a specific figure of £10,000 is clarity.  If one does not start from there one loses the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry stated that mandatory sentences would not work and that she was saddened that the Bill included such sentences for certain crimes.  I disagree with the Senator.  Mandatory sentencing should be a central element in a wider programme to combat the drugs problem.  The Senator stated that such sentences focused on the mules and ignored the godfathers.  However, the godfathers are not being ignored.  They are being taken on in a variety of ways, some of which were referred to by Senator Dardis.  Let us not forget that the mules make the godfathers.  Without them there would be no godfathers.  Senator Henry rightly stated that the godfathers walk around with squeaky clean hands while the mules get their hands dirty.  One is equally guilty if one does the dirty deed for someone else.  I make no apologies for the Minister taking on the mules as well as the godfathers.  I commend him for doing so.  This is a fundamental facet of the multifaceted approach to tackling this abominable activity which has a potential for and often realises mass murder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the thinking behind these amendments.  However, for reasons which I will explain, I do not believe that they are necessary or desirable.  While the two amendments stem from similar considerations they are not compatible.  First, the Labour Party amendment would require me to make regulations changing the value of the £10,000 threshold at least once per year.  The Fine Gael amendment would confine such changes to once a year or on an annual basis.  Second, the Labour Party amendment would seem to relate any such changes to changes in the value of money.  The Fine Gael amendment refers to changes in the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>I accept that from time to time the £10,000 threshold will have to be reviewed.  Leaving aside the substantial difficulties I have with the drafting of both amendments, there might be some merit to them if we were living in a climate where substantial inflation was likely to occur over a short period of time.  Thankfully, that is far from the case, not least because of the successful economic policies the Government is pursuing.  The reality is that for the foreseeable future £10,000 will represent a considerable sum of money.  In those circumstances it is both unwieldy and unnecessary to provide for an upgrading of the amount on an annual basis or more frequently.</P>
      <P>When this legislation is passed it will be important for a clear message to go out to those tempted to indulge in drug trafficking that mandatory sentences will apply where the value of the drugs is £10,000 or more.  It is essential that this information is widely known within and outside this jurisdiction and I will do everything possible to ensure that this is the case.  If the amount changed every year, or more frequently, it could only serve to dilute that message.  If we succeed in getting across the message about the £10,000 threshold, what conceivable advantage could there be in changing the message the next year to state that the threshold is now £10,272 or £10,273, etc.?</P>
      <P>The figure of £10,000 should not be set in stone.  When it becomes clear that there is a case for changing it, that can be done by way of primary legislation after a full debate in the Oireachtas.  In this context, as well as substantive criminal law reform measures which I will be introducing, it is intended that there will be quite frequent Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills.  In those circumstances there will be no shortage of legislative vehicles to change the £10,000 threshold when appropriate. This seems a more sensible approach than placing an inflexible obligation on the Minister to make what in reality could be very significant changes in the amount by way of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that I oppose the amendments as a matter of policy, I do not propose to dwell on some of the more technical aspects.  However, the terms of changes in the value of money or the rate of inflation might and in probability would require <Col N="709" /> further definition.  The Fine Gael amendment, when it refers to changes in the rate of inflation at the minimum, would seem to purport to give discretion to the Minister to increase the £10,000 threshold by any amount.  I doubt that such a power could be left to secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>Government Senators are correct to state that the intention is that the £10,000 figure will send a message to those at home and abroad who would consider becoming involved in the pernicious trade of drug dealing that if they do so, are apprehended and convicted by our courts, they will receive a severe sentence.  That is the message. While some people, such as Senator Henry, may be appalled by mandatory sentencing, I believe that society is entitled to express its abhorrence of a given crime in legislation duly passed democratically by its representatives.  It is not as if this is the first time this has occurred.  In the case of capital murder, such as the murder of a member of the Garda Siochána, the mandatory sentence is 40 years imprisonment.  Therefore, it can be taken as read that the introduction of mandatory sentencing in this legislation is not the first time that such legislation came before the House.  I am satisfied that society is sufficiently appalled by the drugs trade that it wishes its representatives to democratically pass the legislation which is proposed.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry has argued that allowing for mandatory sentencing of ten years places the power to determine sentences in the hands of the person framing the charge.  That cannot be right. The case has to go before a court and be proved if there is no admission of guilt.  Only then, after due process, can the sentence be imposed by a judge.  It is incorrect to say that the person who frames the charge is in a position to determine the sentence because, <i>ab initio,</i> the Director of Public Prosecutions has to bring the charge and only he can decide whether there is a case to be answered before the charge is made.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Liam Fitzgerald's point about carriers.  The message is simple.  They will not be subject to a ten year prison sentence if they do not carry drugs to a value of £10,000 or more with intent to supply.  They should not become involved in the trade because, if they do and they are apprehended, charged and convicted, they will be subject to a ten year prison sentence without temporary release.  That is a serious situation for any person in which to find themselves.  The message is not to become involved.</P>
    <P>Regarding complementary legislation, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced when in Opposition, provides for the freezing and disposal of the assets of drug traffickers and other criminals.  Twin messages are now been given: if a person is caught drug trafficking or dealing and they are convicted, they will lose their liberty for a considerable period and they will lose their ill-gotten gains.  This is tough legislation but there is a serious problem with which we must grapple.  It would be wrong to pretend it will go away by taking <Col N="710" /> easy options.  There are none left nor are there any choices left.  This legislation is designed in so far as it is legislatively possible to protect the populace from the activities of dealers in death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's abhorrence of the activities of drug dealers and his intention to deal with them is shared by every Member.  We are attempting to ensure that any legislation introduced to deal with the issue and reflect our abhorrence is effective but we do not believe the provisions of this Bill will be effective in that regard.  The Minister spoke of couriers and those who carry drugs.  It has been our contention that the provisions of the Bill will largely end up jailing the wrong people and not those against whom it is directed.  The point made by Senator Liam Fitzgerald and the Minister's comments about carriers reflect a simplistic attitude consistent with the Bill.  It is known that carriers are largely drug addicts.  It is easy to say they have a choice and that, if they do not carry drugs, they will not be jailed but the matter is more complex. Drug carriers are largely victims so our intention at all stages must be to target the suppliers and the dealers in death.  Unfortunately, this legislation will not achieve this objective because of its provisions, especially those relating to mandatory sentencing and the figure of £10,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to accept the principle of the amendment we have tabled which is that the £10,000 figure should be subject to variance and that the Minister should have some discretion, especially having regard to inflation.  If he accepts the principle, it is a pity he did not take the opportunity to table his own amendment because we would have been happy to carefully examine it and accept it if it contained the principle of our amendment.  The Minister accepts the principle but states that he would have to initiate further legislation to deal with it.  This was an opportunity to do so and it is a pity it was not taken.</P>
      <P>Regarding the points about inflation and proper economic management, while there is low inflation there are massive increases in the price of houses because of supply and demand.  If the international police forces were successful in stopping a large consignment of drugs coming into the country, that would increase street prices either overnight or from one week to the next; the following week they might fall.  As with the price of housing and its relationship with supply and demand, I envisage a similar situation with drugs.</P>
      <P>Our amendment would have given the Minister flexibility to meet what I assume to be his objective to come down hard and heavy on drug suppliers. It is a pity he did not take this into account. It is also a pity that, considering he appears to accept the principle of the amendment, he did not table a similar one.  Senator Connor mentioned the level of adulteration of imported drugs and their treatment by drug dealers.  That cannot be taken into account although it would affect the price on the streets.  We have made a strong case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> We have given the Minister flexibility, although we do not accept the potential effectiveness of what he is trying to achieve.  We are trying to be helpful and constructive in putting forward ways in which the legislation can be improved to ensure that, even in its limited fashion, it will be effective.  I am sorry to hear the Minister's response, despite all the arguments he has heard today and on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3C) Subsection (3B) of this section shall apply only to such categories of controlled drug, not being categories in respect of which a lesser penalty is provided by the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, as amended, for possession or another offence, in connection therewith, as are prescribed for the purposes of that subsection by regulations made by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which was also discussed at length on Committee Stage, seeks to make a distinction between what are commonly called &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs, and it is a distinction made in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The argument went on at great length on Committee Stage and my colleague, Senator Costello, spoke at length.  As he represents an inner city constituency which has been ravaged by drugs, it is a subject about which he knows a great deal.  I have examined his arguments and they are extremely important and were supported by other Members.  It is ludicrous not to make a distinction between heroin and cannabis, for example.  Heroin is responsible for ravaging inner city communities to which I have already referred.  Cannabis does not have the same effect.  I do not accept the argument, which is regularly put forward, that smoking cannabis inevitably leads to heroin misuse.  There may be incidences where it does but, in general, we know that it does not. Cannabis is treated as an entirely different kind of drug by those who use it.  As Senator Costello pointed out, we need only look at those who are currently occupying our prisons to see that heroin has largely been the cause.  This legislation does not address the major problem of heroin addiction <Col N="712" /> and all the problems associated with it.  That is one of the main reasons the Bill is flawed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take on board the views that have already been expressed on this issue and which he has heard on more than one occasion.  Even at this late stage he should introduce a note of realism into the legislation to make it a measure that could in some way be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and I support what Senator O'Meara has said.  We all know that cannabis is in an entirely different field to heroin and other addictive narcotics on the market.  Many people, including medical experts, argue that nicotine is far more damaging and addictive than cannabis, yet tobacco is socially acceptable.  The same can be said of alcohol which, though abused by some, is socially accepted while cannabis is not.</P>
      <P>With legislation of this kind we are introducing a draconian measure whereby persons found in possession of illegal drugs to the value of £10,000 can receive a mandatory sentence of ten years' imprisonment without remission.  This issue should be thought through in depth and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell me how many grammes of heroin, at current street values, would be worth £10,000?  Is the street value for x grammes of heroin consistent in Galway, Cork and Dublin?  Will the Minister also tell us what amount of cannabis would currently realise the sum of £10,000 on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Cahirciveen or Killarney? I would like to know the answers because they are fundamental to the argument.</P>

      <P>Once a drug is illegal then £10,000 worth of it is just that, whether it is cannabis or heroin.  While I listened with interest on previous occasions during this debate to distinctions being drawn by Senators and the reasons being put forward that the Minister should make such a distinction in law, I remain unconvinced. Cannabis is an illegal drug just as heroin is.  Ten thousand pounds worth of an illegal drug is a substantial amount.  Despite having listened carefully to the arguments which have been well and forcefully put by Opposition Senators, I do not see any necessity for the Minister to draw such a distinction. Therefore, I cannot see the logic behind such a distinction being inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would not presume to be an expert on illegal drugs, it is well known and I have often heard it said that there is a progression factor on the streets.  Young people who start off on illegal drugs do not, by an large, begin with heroin.  That <Col N="713" /> is my information but perhaps I am being misinformed. The Minister must taken the progression factor into account.</P>
    <P>I am also told that cannabis can have severe psychological side effects, including depression. There are well grounded reasons it is still regarded as an illegal drug.  If there was an irrefutable case for seriously considering the legalisation of cannabis I would have misgivings about what the Minister is proposing.  However, in the absence of such evidence I will fully support the retention of the £10,000 limit and the Minister's position that no distinction should be drawn in the Bill between various drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still waiting for the scientific evidence that this will do a lot of good.  We are all behind the Minister in wanting to do something about the dreadful drugs problem.  I applaud what the Government has done in announcing over the last few days that it will give millions of pounds to deprived areas where there is a serious problem of drug addiction.  This will be very useful in the same way as we now see the legislation concerning the Criminal Assets Bureau coming to fruition.  At last, real progress is being made in dealing with the drug barons. What the Government is trying to do in giving money to deprived areas will be important.</P>
      <P>I hope that some of the areas I have written to Ministers about will receive money.  I do not wish to name them because it is always a difficulty for people from these areas who are not involved in drugs.  I have written in particular to the Minister for Health and Children about such areas and I hope they will receive some money to improve facilities.  It is interesting to note that middle class areas have far less trouble with hard drugs than some of our more deprived areas.  I am encouraged by the fact that the Government is taking this action.</P>
      <P>The points Senator Connor made are the same as those I tried to make concerning previous amendments, when I inquired as to what we would do if those charged asked that the level of adulteration of the drug should be taken into account.  I have come across people who became seriously ill having injected themselves with heroin which was adulterated with Bob Martin's worming powder for dogs.  It is very inadvisable for a human to take that powder intravenously because it does terrible damage to the liver.  Suppose a criminal insists that the value of adulterants, which are very cheap, are taken out of the equation?  Where will we be then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cannabis is smoked with tobacco, but smoking tobacco is the worst thing one can do.  It is causing us a great deal of trouble and expense.  Suppose those charged insist that the value of the tobacco is taken out and that the value of the drug is assessed only on the amount of cannabis in the reefer?  There would be a variation.  I do not see how it is proposed to work this measure.  I can see how attractive it looks as something one can threaten people with by saying that if they do this <Col N="714" /> they will get into trouble.  I do not think, however, that the example of mandatory sentencing for the capital murder of a member of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces is quite the same as this case.</P>
    <P>When I said we were putting huge power into the hands of those who framed the charges, I did not mean there would be any corruption by anyone there, but that whoever decided on the value of the drug would have the power over whether a person would be liable to receive a mandatory ten year sentence.  It is a huge power to give somebody especially when we know the price of drugs fluctuates not just on a daily basis but also according to demand, how they are adulterated and the part of the country in which the transaction takes place.  The measure is fraught with difficulties and many areas where challenges can be made.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say if the various diluting agents, be they tobacco, Bob Martin's worming powders, sugar and so forth, will be taken into account when assessing the value of the drugs? After all, it is common for clients to be abusive of the dealers who sell them their drugs because the purity of the drugs is not established in many cases.  Ecstasy is the only drug of which I am aware whose purity is fairly standard.  That is because it is chemically manufactured.  Drugs are generally imported in the purest form possible and are then diluted by the importers.  Will that be taken into account when charges are proffered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put to bed the notion that cannabis is either not harmful or less harmful than other drugs.  Some members of society advocate that it be legalised.  I believe we should take a strong line on any drug, regardless of its quality. Earlier the House called for a debate on the tobacco industry and the banning of tobacco advertising. One can imagine the impact of legalising cannabis, the festivals, race meetings and so forth carrying advertisements for different brands of cannabis.</P>
      <P>With regard to purity, I am not a scientist and do not know much about such matters.  However, I have practical experience of the courts and I am aware that when somebody is arrested in possession of cannabis or other drugs, the drugs are sent to a laboratory to be scientifically analysed. When the result of the analysis is available, due process takes its course.  The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the substance is a drug and that it is a banned drug.  The laboratory analysis indicates whether the drug is mixed or diluted with other substances.  The laboratory procedure will continue under this legislation. It would be wrong to confuse the objective of the Bill by using the purity argument, although I understand Senator Henry's reasons for mentioning it.  It neither adds to nor detracts from the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our society has a problem with all drugs.  At present, we are trying to reduce the use of tobacco <Col N="715" /> and we encourage our children not to smoke.  It is now anti-social to smoke and people can no longer smoke in many public places.  On the other hand there appears to be an opinion, with which I do not agree, that society should take a less harsh approach to drugs such as cannabis.</P>
    <P>The treatment meted out to somebody who is caught with a small joint of cannabis has, in my experience, seldom included a custodial sentence. This Bill is directed at people who bring large quantities of cannabis or Ecstasy onto the streets or into discos or nightclubs to sell them to what are called &ldquo;mules&rdquo; or users.  These are the people we must tackle.  If a significant number of them are prevented from carrying on their nasty trade, the overlords who have clean hands, drive £70,000 cars and live in million pound mansions will eventually be affected.</P>
    <P>This Bill, even though its objective is appropriate and society driven, is only one measure in dealing with the drugs problem.  Education is also necessary as are other measures in different areas.  However, in the legal context, this Bill is appropriate.  While I acknowledge the arguments of the Opposition Senators, they do not warrant the Minister's acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is substantially the same as the amendment proposed by the Senator on Committee Stage.  As I said on that occasion, the intention appeared to be that a Minister would be able to specify by regulation the controlled substances to which the mandatory ten year sentence would apply.  This envisaged that it would be open to a Minister to prescribe by regulation that the mandatory penalty would apply to what are referred to as &ldquo;hard&rdquo; drugs and not to &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs.</P>
      <P>While there is no reference in the amendment to particular categories of drugs referred to in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, the net issue remains the same, as does my position on it.  If the distinction between &ldquo;hard&rdquo; drugs and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs should apply, its implications are so farreaching that it is a decision which should be made by the Legislature in primary legislation rather than be left to a Minister of the day to deal with by regulation. Indeed, I still have doubts as to whether this purported derogation of legislative powers to a Minister would be constitutional.  The Minister for Health and Children, under the Misuse of Drugs Act, has the power to specify controlled drugs by regulation.  However, what is at issue in this amendment is somewhat different.  In any event, the mandatory provisions should apply to all controlled drugs and, in those circumstances, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed some sympathy, on Committee Stage, with the thinking behind the Labour Party's amendment to the extent that there is no doubt that the availability of heroin and the activities that surround it represent the worst aspect of our drugs problem.  In bringing forward <Col N="716" /> this legislation I gave a great deal of thought to whether some distinction might be made among different types of drugs.  However, I came to the firm conclusion that such a distinction would not be appropriate for a number of reasons which I will outline.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to mandatory sentences is primarily geared towards those who are trading in illegal drugs as part of an organised criminal enterprise.  It does not relate to a person who purchases enough cannabis for himself or herself and a friend and then sells it on to a friend.  It relates to somebody involved in possession or supply of illegal drugs to the value of £10,000 or more.  In other words, by definition it relates to somebody who is playing a substantial part in the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>The nature of the organised drugs trade with which we are dealing is that many of the people involved trade in both &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs as part of a ruthless criminal conspiracy which has wreaked havoc in many communities.  The activities of these gangs are not confined to supplying drugs.  They have involved murder and intimidation. In those circumstances it appears right that a person whose activities are a mainstay of that criminal enterprise should face a mandatory sentence in relation to the possession for supply of £10,000 or more worth of illegal drugs, irrespective of the type of drug involved.</P>
    <P>Another point which should be borne in mind is that the provisions of this legislation will not apply retrospectively.  When the legislation is enacted it will be clear to anybody in advance of deciding to traffic in drugs to the value of £10,000 or more that a mandatory penalty will apply.  If people go ahead with this activity, that is their problem.</P>
    <P>It was in the light of these considerations that it was decided that the best approach to take to the question of mandatory penalties was to define the offence by reference to the value of the drugs involved.  I should re-emphasise the point that nobody involved in the supply of drugs to the value of £10,000 or more is anything other than a substantial player in the organised trade of illegal drugs.  However, I accept that a distinction must be made between a person involved in the supply of £10,000 worth of cannabis and a person involved in the supply of £1 million worth of heroin. In my view, the best way to make that distinction is not through not applying the mandatory ten year penalty to the former but to allow even heavier penalties to be imposed on the latter. That will now be the position.</P>
    <P>At present a person convicted of drug trafficking can be imprisoned for a sentence up to life and that will remain the case under the new legislation. In that way a court will be able to mark the gravity of an offence subject to the specification of a minimum period of imprisonment of ten years.  In all circumstances, I believe it would be counter productive to the fight against the drugs menace to accept this amendment.  This matter was discussed extensively on Committee <Col N="717" /> Stage and I regret that, as far as I and Opposition Senators are concerned, never the twain shall meet.  Senator Connor came close to arguing for the legalisation of cannabis.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record the fact that I would be resolutely opposed to the legalisation of cannabis.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made of the whole position in regard to the value of drugs.  I refer Members of the House to section 4 of the Bill where a new section 15 is to be inserted into the 1977 Act.  The new section states that a person will be guilty of an offence under the section at any time while the aggregate value of a drug, or drugs, in his or her possession amounts to £10,000 or more.  If a person is in possession of drugs for the purposes of selling or supplying them and if the value of the drugs exceeds £10,000 at any time during the period of possession, an offence will be deemed to have been committed under the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 15(a)(iii) makes the position in regard to the value of drugs very clear.  On the question of the weight of drugs valued at £10,000 or more, the Bill states that a court may hear evidence from a garda whom the court is satisfied has knowledge of the unlawful sale or supply of controlled drugs.  The courts will defer to expert witnesses who are aware of the value of the drugs involved.  Market value is defined in 15(a)(v) as the price the drug could be expected to fetch on the market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I am not entirely sure what Senator Henry means by &ldquo;scientific evidence&rdquo; in regard to mandatory penalties.  In all legislation where offences are created, it is a matter for the House to determine what the appropriate penalties should be in a particular case.  It may not be a scientific exercise but it is entirely appropriate for this House to mark society's disapproval of particular offences.  For example, the mandatory life sentence for murder which currently applies may not be scientifically determined but I would respectfully submit it is perfectly valid to take the view that such a sentence is appropriate.  I also believe it is entirely reasonable for the House to take the view that a ten year mandatory sentence is appropriate for the purposes of the offences described in the Bill.  Senator Henry also asked whether a valuation would take into account the dilution of a drug with another substance.  Inasmuch as this would reduce the street value of the drug, such factors could be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I believe the approach I have taken is a reasonable, pragmatic and efficacious one.  This issue was discussed in great detail on Committee Stage and I do not intend to draw the matter out any further.  The proposed new section 15 (a) will make it clear that all controlled drugs come under the meaning of the legislation.  I respectfully request that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to withdraw the amendment and it is a pity the Minister is not prepared to take it on board.  The debate seems to have focused on making a distinction between heroin and cannabis.  Such a distinction could undermine the abhorrence we all wish to express about the sale and peddling of heroin, the effects of which are entirely different to those of cannabis. I do not agree with the legalisation of cannabis. I recently read of studies done in the United States into the effects on children born to long-term regular users of cannabis as a recreational drug.  These studies show a level of brain damage and personality disorder in these children.  I take a very dim view of calls for the legalisation of cannabis.  I would, in fact, favour the banning of tobacco.  As an ex-smoker, I am one of the most zealous in that regard.</P>

      <P>These amendments relate to section 28, which for the first time sets out on a statutory basis how guilty verdicts are to be dealt with by the courts.  Section 28(1), provides that in determining what sentence to pass on a person who has pleaded guilty to an offence a court, if it considers it appropriate to do so, shall take into account the stage of the proceedings at which the person indicated his intention to plead guilty and the circumstances in which this indication was given.  The effect of amendment No. 4 would be to remove the words &ldquo;, if it considers it appropriate to do so,&rdquo;.  In other words, a court, in all circumstances, would have to have regard to the factors to which I have referred.  The inclusion of the words &ldquo;, if it considers it appropriate to do so,&rdquo; is considered desirable so as not to make it an absolute requirement on all courts to take such matters into account in relation to all offences. This is for the very practical reason that the provision relates to all offences.  For example, it would hardly be necessary or desirable for a court to look into these matters in relation to routine road traffic offences.</P>
      <P>There is in existence already, case law in relation to when it is appropriate for the courts to take guilty pleas into account.  While the proposed section places aspects of that law on a statutory basis I do not believe that it will supplant that case law to the extent that that law already deals with when it is appropriate to take into account guilty pleas.  In that sense the point of the amendment is already met by our law and, as I have explained, the amendment would require a court to take into account guilty pleas, and in particular the circumstances in which they were made, in the most routine of cases and there would clearly be no benefit to be gained from that.  On the contrary, it might needlessly clog up the operation of the courts.  I have looked at the matter again since Committee Stage and, in the circumstances, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> Amendment No. 5 is a Government amendment. This arises out of a commitment given on Committee Stage to consider further an amendment proposed by Senator Costello and others and which is again tabled as amendment No. 6. In the interval since then I have had the matter discussed with the Attorney General's office. Section 28(2), provides that courts shall not be precluded from passing the maximum sentence prescribed by law for an offence if, notwithstanding the plea of guilty, the court is satisfied that the circumstances of the offence warrant the maximum sentence.  The Labour Party amendment would add the word &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; before &ldquo;circumstances of the offence&rdquo;.  Given that this essentially represents existing case law, I have no difficulty, in principle, with the amendment. However, the official amendment is preferred, in the sense that Senator O'Meara's amendment might be taken to assume that exceptional circumstances which would have to be examined arise in relation to every offence.  The effect of the official amendment will be to provide that where there is a guilty plea, the maximum penalty would only be applied where there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offence which warrant the maximum sentence.</P>
    <P>I hope Senator O'Meara will accept that this effects the change which she sought to bring about and that she will withdraw her amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment which remedies an omission in the Bill.

      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion in section 6 of a reference to the explanatory report on the 1996 Accession Convention when published in the Official Journal. Section 6 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the various explanatory reports on both the 1968 Convention and Accession Conventions which are specified in subsection (2).  The reason there is no reference to the explanatory report <Col N="722" /> on the 1996 Accession Convention in the Bill as published is that the report is yet to be made available by the designated rapporteur.  In the event of it becoming available before the Bill is passed by both Houses, an amendment will be drafted to take it into account.  It would not be appropriate for me to make reference to a report which is not yet in being in the way suggested in the Senator's amendment.  Also, the amendment does not quite fit in with the existing wording in subsection (2).</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the fact that in 1996 the Government decided to ratify conventions on legalisation of documents, also called the &ldquo;Apostille&rdquo;. However, there have been delays in making the secondary instruments required arising from this.  In the context of this Convention we propose that primary legislation, that is, this amendment, could and should be used to enable ratification.  Otherwise, the delay will continue. Failure to ratify these conventions is leading to costs for businesses.  It is time the Government carried out its duty and this amendment provides it with an opportunity to so do.</P>

      <P>This is a curious amendment. The three conventions which are the subject of the amendment are concerned with the legalisation of documents and have already been signed by the State.  Ratification of these conventions is dependent upon certain administrative and other changes being put in place.  In particular, it will be necessary to have certain adjustments made to the Rules of the Superior Courts. Amendments would also have to be made to the Companies Forms Order, 1964.  The latter issue is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I understand that progress on the preparation of the necessary statutory instrument to amend the order is well advanced.  Regarding the rules of court, my Department has been actively pursuing the matter and I am hopeful that appropriate rules will soon be finalised.  Once the appropriate framework is in place we will proceed with ratification as expeditiously as possible.  In the circumstances, therefore, I think Senators will understand why I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with alarm the delay in the publication of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals Report for 1996; calls on the Minister for Health and Children to publish it immediately; and asks that the Leader of the House initiate a debate on the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children to the House.  I am delighted this motion is being debated this evening as it has been on the Order Paper for some time.</P>
      <P>Mental hospitals and the treatment of patients with mental illness are governed by the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Since 1945 attitudes to psychiatric illness and its treatment have changed dramatically.  In the Department of Health's four year action plan for 1994-7 the following was listed as a priority: &ldquo;To introduce a new Mental Health Act to give greater protection to the civil rights of the small number of people with mental illness who have to be detained for treatment and to bring our legislation into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights&rdquo;.  We have signed the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms but we have yet to bring forward the legislation necessary to implement those rights in our law. That we are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights was acknowledged in the 1995 White Paper, &ldquo;A New Mental Health Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations on Good Friday in Belfast states in the section on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, under subsection (9), that the Irish Government will take steps to further strengthen <Col N="725" /> the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction. It also states that the Irish Government will establish a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland.  The Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order, 1986, is fully in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Our concern for the civil rights of psychiatric patients and the responsibilities of those who deal with them is 12 years behind Northern Ireland.  As one of those who hopes for the safe passage of both referenda, I hope the Minister recognises the urgency of dealing with this legislation.</P>
    <P>At present, under the 1945 legislation, mental hospitals are inspected by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  He produces excellent reports which are part of the social history of our time.  He visits all the mental institutions at least once every two years, but many more frequently.  For a long time he has held the fort on behalf of psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>There are consistent delays in the publication of his yearly report which, under section 247(2) of the Mental Health Act, is required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a copy sent to the President of the High Court.  I have been unable to find any reference to a debate on his report in either House, so we are making history tonight.  The 1996 report has still to be published so I had to use the 1995 report for this debate.</P>
    <P>The inspector's report focuses on major problems but also gives praise.  The decline in the number of patients in large institutions is welcomed but the fact that the number of community based residences and day care facilities are not being set up fast enough is noted.  He points out that by virtue of the perceived increased level of violence in our society, the rise in the number of homeless, the increasing problem of marriage breakdown and the undoubted increase in suicide rates in recent years, it becomes extremely important that alternatives to in-patient care are quantitatively and qualitatively adequate so that patients do not become homeless and do not suffer social or economic deprivation and are adequately housed and fed.  In report after report he highlights the difficulties and lack of staff and the fact that multi-disciplinary teams have not been formed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that purpose built units attached to general and private hospitals come in for far less criticism than the old mental hospitals, so we must be getting somewhere.  The inspector recommends in the 1995 report one day place per 1,000 of population and 1.5 residential places. That was the first time he made specific recommendations on the number of places needed in both categories.</P>
    <P>Child and old age psychiatry and suicide prevention are covered in the report.  There is much comment on the management of the disturbed patient and the need for strict guidelines regarding the use of seclusion, the ultimate sanction on the disturbed patient, and the need to assess its <Col N="726" /> effect on them.  A special report on dealing with the disturbed or regressive patient was commissioned in 1995 and was to report in 1996 but I cannot find any evidence of it, although I may not have looked in the right places.  I am glad the task force on suicide has reported.  The number of adolescents in adult wards is noted.  However, I do not see any comment on the lack of facilities for dealing with new mothers with post-natal depression and their babies, despite the fact that we know rapid treatment gives better results.</P>
    <P>The inspector's reports are not all complaints. He frequently praises his staff for the work they do in difficult conditions, pointing out the difficulties of keeping old buildings clean and trying to function in acute units with inadequate facilities and staff.  There has been little complaint in recent years about treatment, with the possible exceptions of seeking more explanations, privacy for patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy and the need for strict guidelines on the use of seclusion.</P>
    <P>I cannot expect the Minister to give me hope that the system will be improved but there are a few things he could do which would show that we are establishing patients' human rights as a priority.  Section 247 of the Mental Health Act requires the inspector to furnish a general report each year to the Minister on the administration of the law and the care, welfare and treatment of persons of unsound mind.  This is one area where there are complaints year after year and where, with better management, the civil and human rights of patients could be improved.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago when I was on the board of the Eastern Health Board I was involved in inspecting the mental hospitals in its area.  I thought huge improvements had been made in terms of a personal clothing policy for patients. However, I regret that policy is not universal. One of the greatest humiliations for long stay patients, that is, patients who have been in hospital continuously for over a year, is the lack of a personal clothing policy.  The 1995 report states:</P>
    <P>Newcastle Hospital:</P>
    <P>Efforts were being made to rectify the unsatisfactory situation resulting from the closure of the laundry service in the previous year.  A small laundry was under construction and when this became operational the personal clothing system would be fully restored.</P>
    <P>St. Ita's Hospital:</P>
    <P>Only some of the patients within St. Ita's Hospital had personal clothing and toilet requisites and greater efforts should be made to ensure that these were provided, especially for long stay patients.</P>
    <P>When one considers the difficulty of preventing infection in mental hospitals it is dreadful to think of people sharing toilet requisites.  The report mentions it again in relation to St. Brendan's Hospital.  It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> A personal clothing policy to be introduced in all wards of St. Brendan's Hospital.  All patients should have personal clothing, night attire, toilet requisites and individual lockers.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>The Central Mental Hospital:</P>
    <P>Personal clothing and toilet requisites to be introduced for all patients.</P>
    <P>St. Bridgid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth:</P>
    <P>Personal clothing should be introduced in all wards.</P>
    <P>It is good that St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea has closed because the following was the situation in 1995:</P>
    <P>The lavatories were dirty, underclothing and night clothing not personalised.  The male geriatric sleeping areas were dirty and untidy.  Full bottles of urine in a locker and on a window ledge were observed.</P>
    <P>The following was the report's analysis of the situation in St. Mary's Hospital in Castlebar:</P>
    <P>Concern over the unsatisfactory laundry facilities continued.  Overall, the physical facilities of the hospital were most unsatisfactory. The quality of food provided for the evening meal in one ward was noted and was not impressive.</P>
    <P>Many of the long stay patients in these hospitals are over 65 years of age and many have few visitors; in fact, approximately one third have no visitors at all.  The only hope of their physical conditions being improved is if some attention is paid by the Minister to the inspector's reports.</P>
    <P>Another simple recommendation which would help patients, family and friends is identification badges.  Lack of these were noted in St. Loman's Hospital in Lucan, St. Ita's Hospital, St. Brendan's Hospital and St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar, where facilities appear to be bad and staff are working with facilities which the inspector deems to be unacceptable and inadequate for the treatment of patients with acute psychiatric illness. Identification badges are not worn in some wards in Our Lady's Hospital in Ennis, Limerick Mental Hospital, St. Davnet's Hospital in Cavan, St. Senan's Hospital in Enniscorthy, St. Finian's Hospital in Killarney and St. Conal's Hospital in Letterkenny.  Identification badges are worn in all hospitals where patients with physical illness are treated.  Why does this not happen in mental hospitals?  The strategic management initiative recommends that all civil servants should wear identification badges.  I have to wear an identification badge when I go into a hospital.</P>
    <P>Basic human rights allowing the patient some dignity are being ignored.  Again regarding privacy, large wards are still in use in many hospitals and the inspector suggests a correlation between them and behavioural problems with patients.  In some hospitals patients sleep, eat and live in the <Col N="728" /> same wards day and night.  There are no policies on smoking, meaning non-smokers have to sit and eat with patients who are smoking.  This is not allowed in hospitals for physical disorders. Why in mental hospitals?  Our European Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, with his strong views on smoking, I know would support me.</P>
    <P>Integration of male and female patients has not been initiated in many hospitals, another sign of the way mental patients are discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Senators and members of the general public were very alarmed regarding reports of conditions in St. Ita's Psychiatric Hospital last February. Lack of information on what research was carried out in the hospital, and how and when the ethics committee functions also caused concern. While I can understand Senators wanting to visit there, a quick read of the Inspector's report on St. Ita's gives more than enough food for thought. I described the Minister's reply to my Adjournment debate on St. Ita's as a platitude.  The patients in St. Ita's deserve better than that.</P>
    <P>On page 211 of the report and on subsequent pages, Dr. Walsh has produced a check list for those who inspect mental hospitals.  I wonder how many delegations from health boards use such a list?</P>
    <P>Last year when I had Private Members' time I asked that we should debate the Mountjoy Visiting Committee's report.  There has been so little action on that report that this year the visiting committee resubmitted it with comments because nothing had changed.  One of their main worries is that at least 10 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy have serious psychiatric illness.  It was suggested that a barter system was in operation between Mountjoy and the Central Mental Hospital &mdash; when one prisoner goes up there one comes down.</P>
    <P>Attempts to repatriate patients deemed suitable for return from the Central Mental Hospital to their present psychiatric services appear to be resisted, holding up places which could be used by prisoners.  There is no supported residential accommodation so that suitable patients could be discharged back into the community.  It was suggested that the governor's house was available in the grounds and could be made into a rehabilitation residence.  If even a small number of places were &ldquo;freed up&rdquo; we could avoid episodes such as happened in Mountjoy recently when a seriously ill woman was kept in a padded cell for 25 days before accommodation was found for her in Dundrum.</P>
    <P>Another small improvement would be if nurses were re-enabled to give patients their medication to take with them when they are going out for a day or two.  Recently nurses have been informed that they must get doctors to write a prescription for dispensing in the pharmacy which can cause difficulties if patients are asked out at short notice.</P>
    <P>We have not got a comprehensive mental health service nor is there one which is integrated with the rest of the health service.  Hostels are not <Col N="729" /> integrated into the community; who has responsibility for them?  There is much to be done but if the Minister would see his way to help dignify the patients' lives I would be extremely happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I believe the Minister has the good will to address this problem, he seems to be a humane, intelligent person who doubtless is aware of its scope and nature.  I compliment Senator Henry for raising this important matter in the Seanad where it can be appropriately discussed and information exchanged.  It shows her courage, humanity and professional dedication.</P>
      <P>It would be unfortunate if this matter was put to a vote.  I do not think psychiatric patients in these institutions should be seen to be made a political football.  I understand the feeling of the Government side.  Perhaps it could be addressed. I appeal to the Acting Leader to consider withdrawing the amendment so that we can do something positive on behalf of the patients.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment would open it up to a certain element of ridicule because I do not see how it can welcome a publication which was targeted for 1996 and is still only forthcoming. There is nothing to welcome.  Occam's razor, that wonderful philosophical principle that you cannot legitimately discuss the hypothetical use of the non-existent, comes into play.  We cannot discuss the report.</P>
      <P>In light of that, the amendment could be withdrawn if my colleague could see her way slightly to alter the terms of her original resolution to remove any tendentious suggestions in it &mdash;&ldquo;notes with alarm&rdquo; and &ldquo;calls on the Minister&rdquo; perhaps would raise a hackle.  If Senator Henry was prepared to accept an amendment to say that Seanad Éireann &ldquo;notes the delay&rdquo; and &ldquo;asks the Minister&rdquo;, that would be sufficiently mild and drained of any suggestion of rebuke and the Minister and acting Leader could take it on board.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficulties this country has a proud record.  Until Jonathan Swift set up St. Patrick's Hospital, throughout Europe the mentally ill were regarded as items for sport and recreation or possessed of devils.  Swift was the first person to establish, in Dublin, a hospital where mental illness was properly regarded as a counterpart to physical illness and not some form of evil or destructive tendency on the part of the unfortunate patient.</P>
      <P>If this debate creates a situation where we assist the Minister and the Department by putting sufficient pressure on them so that these reports come out with greater regularity and in a shorter time space, then it will have done something useful. My colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, will no doubt talk about this.  In many items of legislation where reports were to be produced, he made the point as a businessman that if a report cannot be produced within six months, the idea should be scrapped.  I may have misquoted him but he is well able to correct me if I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> The reports of the inspectorate are extremely important in terms of getting information to the general public so there is a standard against which we can measure progress.  At the back of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals Report for 1994 there is a checklist which shows his humanity.  We do not know, however, how many of the questions on this checklist have been answered.  At the end of every hospital examination he produces a list dealing with areas such as toilet facilities, clothing, the general state of repair of the physical apparatus, etc, and we simply do not know from year to year whether these concerns have been appropriately addressed.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter in concert with Senator Henry some time ago in relation to St. Ita's.  I noted that it was said this morning that the issue was raised in the context of a by-election.  Neither Senator Henry nor myself was standing in the by-election. We raised it because we were concerned, having read reports &mdash; two years after the last report of the inspector &mdash; that these conditions still existed.  Almost immediately Maureen Browne of the Eastern Health Board contacted me with some useful information about St. Joseph's Hospital: the amount of money being spent, the conditions, the number of patients and so on.  I have eight pages of a detailed fax here but I should not have to rely on this type of source for information.  It should be in the report of the inspectorate and available to every Member of the House as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The concerns expressed by Senator Henry are clear and appropriate and some of them have been mentioned time and time again.  She has taken them from the 1995 report.  I noted them in the 1994 report.  Obviously, such simple things as identification badges, which simply humanise the service, had not been addressed.</P>
    <P>In the 1994 report a couple of things strike one immediately.  One of these is the enormous reduction in the number of patients in hospital &mdash; from 21,000 in 1958 down to 5,581 in 1994.  Some of the concerns in that report relate to medical case note reporting.  The report states that there were instances in several services where documentary procedures in relation to mental case notes were unsatisfactory; that mental case entries were often insubstantial, conveying little information as to the circumstances under which patients were admitted and quite often giving no information as to when they were discharged; and that occasionally entries on newly admitted patients were infrequent and did not form a substantial record of the clinical condition in progress. I would think that is extremely worrying, although the Inspector later paid tribute to the work of the medical staff.</P>
    <P>Obviously I will not have time to deal in any great detail with the contents of this report, but, for example, on the number of locked wards involved, how can people sustain humanity inside a locked ward?  It would seem to me to be difficult and challenging for the staff as well as for the patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Another matter which I would like to raise is the contribution traditionally of religious orders. I know the Minister has visited these places.  I have had occasion to visit places like St. Loman's Hospital and see what is conveniently tidied away from our eyesight.  These are not people with nice, Hollywood-style, photogenic mental difficulties. Some of these are people who have physical deformities also and they are disturbing.  The sounds they make and the level of their intelligence is distressing to witness, as is their distress. Traditionally, there have been wonderful people, many of whom belong to religious orders, who have looked after these people.</P>
    <P>Page 6 of the 1994 report refers to St. Brendan's Hospital and St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  It states that the conditions were of concern; that some upgrading and refurbishment had taken place at St. Brendan's Hospital and that considerable similar work had taken place at St. Ita's Hospital, and was ongoing on the day of inspection. The report further stated that it would go some way to improving the overall internal appearance of the hospital but that much remained to be done.  This House knows &mdash; and, thanks to Senator Henry, has had it brought again to its attention &mdash; that as we speak there are serious problems at St. Ita's Hospital.  The argument is made that because they may be closing down some of the units, the work is not economically worthwhile.  It tugs at people's humanity. Even if after a year or 18 months they are closed down, the mental horizons of these people will be brightened by having some degree of amelioration.</P>
    <P>I join the appeal to the Minister, who I know is sympathetic.  This is by no means a partisan motion.  Unfortunately, I will not be here for the vote if there is one, for which I apologise to the Minister and you, a Chathaoirligh.  If the Minister can find a form of words which would avoid a vote &mdash; not just because I do not want to be recorded as not being here &mdash; it would be in the interests of the humane motion of Senator Henry to let it go through in some form which allows us all to support the needs of these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion.  I am a new Member of this House and I was amazed to hear that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has never been debated in either House since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The inspectorate of mental hospitals is one of the jewels in the medical crown of Ireland &mdash; it predates the foundation of the State &mdash; because it is the only independent review of mental hospitals.  As the previous speaker stated, mental problems and disease tended to be swept under the carpet in Ireland in the last century and right up to the 1960s and those suffering from it were confined to the large bins, the county homes or hospitals, where the &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; view operated.  This is not to say that, by the standards of the day, they were treated badly by the staff.  We are extremely lucky in Ireland.  We have highly-skilled, highly-motivated and highly-trained psychiatric staff, both medical and nursing.</P>
      <P>The problem with psychiatry is that it is not a glamorous branch of medicine.  It does not have the same kudos or televisual intensity as cardiac surgery or accident and emergency, but the skills required to practice psychiatry, while understated and not always obvious to the untrained eye, are quite remarkable.  The fact that people who practice psychiatry can deal with patients, who are often disturbed, in difficult circumstances and with little technical backup is not often understood by people.</P>
      <P>I said that psychiatry was not the most fashionable branch of medicine but sometimes it is prey to whims of fashion.  I am nearly 30 years in general practice.  I have seen the huge changes in the treatment of psychiatric patients, 90 per cent of whom have been the better for it.  The standards of treatment, the medication and the conditions in which patients are treated have improved in my lifetime beyond all recognition.  However, in the 1960s a fashion called &ldquo;community psychiatry&rdquo; was introduced and I think we went overboard on it.  The theory was that everybody with a mental illness could be treated in the community. As I said, that is the case for 90 per cent of them, but there is a percentage which needs care in structured circumstances.  We nearly threw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced it is no accident that today we are building prisons while closing down psychiatric institutions.  Many of the people who are consigned to prison by the courts would be better <Col N="733" /> off in a caring psychiatrically run institution.  It is also no accident that prison officers are being given necessary basic psychiatric training. However, we have moved on and I would not like to turn the clock back; but when we make great moves in medicine, we should take a view of the wider picture also.</P>
    <P>Earlier I welcomed the idea of an inspectorate of mental hospitals.  In his time in the Department of Health and Children, the Minister might take a look at that inspectorate and see if it can be applied across the spectrum of medical care and treatment.  There are the general, specialist and private hospitals which could come under a medical inspectorate to see that they reach a certain standard of care in their dealings with patients and the community.</P>
    <P>In his report the Inspector of Mental Hospitals comments on the public areas in psychiatric hospitals, the corridors, toilets, general areas and even sleeping accommodation.  Senator Henry mentioned items like soap, bed linen, night attire, etc.  An inspector should not have to mention these basic items in his report.  I do not know why public areas cannot have the same hygiene standards as hotels.  In general hospitals are well staffed but the standard of general upkeep of the communal areas falls below a level that is expected and is tolerable in modern society.  I am talking about general maintenance such as a coat of paint and a standard of cleanliness for walls, halls and floors that should be adhered to and reported on daily.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have already mentioned points I wanted to raise and I will not repeat them.  I am glad this motion, as amended, will be passed through the House without opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for providing the opportunity to debate the important work which is undertaken by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  I understand that my Department received a recent inquiry from the office of one of the Senators who raised this matter and the inquirer was assured that it was intended that the 1996 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals would be published within two weeks.  That remains the position and I am pleased to inform the House that it is my intention to lay the Annual Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1996 before both Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday next, 18 May 1998.</P>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge the influence of the inspector in the improvement in standards of care in our mental health services.  This improvement is again documented in this latest report which is most encouraging.  I also recognise the importance and benefit of publishing the Inspector of Mental Hospitals report within the year following inspection and I would like to assure all Senators that I am committed to its publication as soon as possible after the inspections of individual facilities are completed and reports are compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> I acknowledge that delays have occurred in the production and publication of the annual reports and I am taking steps to improve the situation. For example, in 1997 the timescale between the issue of the draft report to the service providers and the final report being drawn up has been reduced under my tenure from four months to two months.  That should speed up the final publication of the 1997 report some time later this year.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the 1996 report has been ready in draft form for some time but because of the workload at the printers, the final printing of the report has taken longer than expected.  Referendum and other issues have taken precedence. The annual report of the inspector for 1997 is at present being collated and I intend to have it published as soon as possible within the current year.</P>
    <P>The role of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in relation to standards in our mental health services is of great importance.  The inspector is required under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, to carry out in-depth inspections of all public and private hospitals and units in the country, including the Central Mental Hospital.  Public psychiatric hospitals and units are inspected annually while private hospitals and the Central Mental Hospital are inspected twice yearly.</P>
    <P>A detailed report of each inspection, with general comments and recommendations for improvements in services, are prepared by the Inspector.  These reports are forwarded to the chief executive officer of the responsible health board or voluntary hospital in respect of public psychiatric facilities and to the persons in charge of private facilities.  In each case a response to the comments made by the inspector and his recommendations for improvements in services is requested.  In some cases, meetings are held between my Department, the inspectorate and the health board to discuss improvements in the hospital and associated services.  The reports of individual inspections are then summarised to form the inspector's report.  It will be clear, therefore, that issues raised by the inspector during inspections are followed up following preparation of individual reports and do not await publication of the annual report.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Senators will appreciate that the whole process of compiling annual reports takes time to complete but, as I indicated earlier, I am taking steps to speed up the process.  The thoroughness and high standards of the present inspectorate have had a major impact in bringing about change in how we care for people with mental illness.  The reports encourage greater co-operation between medical, nursing, paramedical and administrative staff in the interests of improving patient care.</P>
    <P>In his report for 1996, the inspector highlights and is complimentary of the further improvements which have taken place in the mental health services.  The inspector notes the continued development in 1996 of a comprehensive and integrated community based mental health service. <Col N="735" /> This was characterised by the ongoing reduction in the number of patients resident in psychiatric hospitals through rehabilitation of long-stay patients, the transfer of acute psychiatric hospital care to acute units in general hospitals and the further extension of community based services.  The number of patients in psychiatric hospitals has fallen from 6,879 in 1991 to 5,047 in 1996.</P>
    <P>The inspector welcomes, in particular, the opening of a further two new psychiatric units at Bantry and Navan General Hospitals during 1996 and while recognising that progress has been made in developing acute psychiatric in-patient facilities, he indicates that much remains to be done.  While the inspector is pleased to note the opening of ten additional beds in a new unit in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin, he is concerned about the reluctance of some mental health services to accept the transfer of patients from the Central Mental Hospital to their local service when they no longer require the specialist services provided at that hospital. This is an issue which my Department is pursuing with health board management.</P>
    <P>He comments favourably on the continued extension of the registration diploma programme in psychiatric nursing and the establishment of a central nursing application centre.  The inspector welcomes this challenging period in psychiatric nurse education and training.  He acknowledges in his report for 1996 the continued development of community based mental health services.  He is however, critical of physical conditions which still pertain in certain areas of psychiatric hospitals, particularly St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar, and St. Brendan's and St. Ita's Hospitals, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to say that considerable progress has been made by the health boards concerned in the intervening period to upgrade both the accommodation and facilities at each of these hospitals.  The no fixed abode unit at St. Brendan's Hospital has been refurbished and the day programmes and outreach services for homeless mentally ill have been transferred from St. Brendan's Hospital to a much enhanced community facility at Usher's Island.  Units 1A, 2A and 10B at the hospital have closed and patients have been relocated to more suitable accommodation. Special care units for the assessment of the disturbed mentally ill were also commissioned in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>Substantial refurbishment and upgrading of accommodation was undertaken in St. Ita's Hospital.  Community based services were further developed with the acquisition of several community residences, a new day hospital opened in Swords and similar facilities were commissioned for Balbriggan and Coolock.</P>
    <P>I note what the Senator has to say about the last time we discussed this issue here.  In October last I was the first Minister to visit St. Ita's Hospital in over 20 years &mdash; with no reference to by-elections or anything else.  Following that visit <Col N="736" /> where I saw the facilities on the campus at first hand, I recently provided capital funding of £550,000 to enable improvements to be carried out to the admission and assessment facilities which was identified as the area in most need of assistance on the day I visited the hospital.  I hope this measure will not be regarded as a pious platitude.</P>
    <P>I have also initiated discussions for the provision of a modern acute psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital to replace acute in-patient facilities which are at present provided at St. Ita's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to my visit to St. Ita's, I met all the staff and patients, talked to them and discussed issues with them.  I encouraged the staff not to have their morale further sapped by slanted and unrepresentative comments in the media at that time.  These media reports were sensationalist and unfair.  I do not regard St. Ita's as being bereft of problems.  Of course it has problems but the staff are entitled to recognition of their professionalism, the fact that it is an old institution for a different time, that it is an institution in transition and that the Eastern Health Board has medium to long-term plans which are in progress in relation to developing further residences on that site.  I met with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals back in September and October, long before St. Ita's became a fashionable topic of discussion in some quarters; I do not include Senator Henry in that.  I have arranged for progress to be made and, on foot of my visit there, real improvements will continue to be made at St. Ita's.</P>
    <P>As far as mental handicap services at St Ita's Hospital are concerned, plans are in place to provide for the transfer of between 120 and 150 clients from the hospital to new residential services off-site and the provision of both new and upgraded residential services and day services for between 150 and 180 clients remaining on the St Ita's campus.  Senator Fitzpatrick correctly referred to the need to carry out small capital works which will upgrade basic facilities to what we regard as normal and a special maintenance programme has been established for the mental handicap services in the hospital.  I have made £250,000 available for this programme in the current year.  I hope there will be some recognition that we are doing something about the problem.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board has carried out general upgrading of the admission unit at St Loman's Hospital to include re-roofing and replacement of windows and further improvements are planned in respect of admission facilities and in a number of other ward areas.</P>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has a crucial role in improving the quality of life for each individual through the provision of a high quality, patient-centred mental health service.  Since becoming Minister for Health and Children, I have taken the opportunity to visit a number of psychiatric hospitals and have seen the commitment <Col N="737" /> of professional staff to the provision of a high quality service.  As I acknowledged at the PNA and the SIPTU conferences, I accept that further investment needs to be made in upgrading or replacing some of the physical facilities and that greater capital investment is required to provide the community based infrastructure required to deliver a modern mental health service.  I have already this year committed additional revenue resources to further develop the mental health services in a number of specific areas.</P>
    <P>The increasing number of people living to advanced old age will require the development of specialist mental health services which will meet the specific needs of older people.  Psychiatry of old age is, therefore, a key area for development and I have committed an additional £1 million this year to enable a start to be made on the establishment of specialist services in health boards where no such service had heretofore existed.  As people live longer, there will inevitably be an increasing level of functional mental illness and dementia and I intend to give priority to the development of appropriate services to deal with this problem in the allocation of resources in the coming years.</P>
    <P>A significant increase in the number of specialists in the psychiatry of old age with associated multi-disciplinary professional teams, together with appropriate facilities, will be required on a phased basis over the next few years to meet service needs.  I intend to begin that work in the near future.</P>
    <P>With the increasing pressures on young people, I also accept the need to improve our responses to their mental health needs.  In this connection, my Department is in the process of preparing a development plan for child and adolescent psychiatry which we hope to make a start on next year.  Priority will be given in the plan to the provision of services for adolescents.  In the interim, I have provided some development funding this year to meet urgent requirements in a number of health boards.</P>
    <P>The report <i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; on which the development of the mental health services is based &mdash; recommended a community oriented mental health service as an alternative to institutional care for persons with mental illness. Senator Fitzpatrick's point that there will always be a requirement for acute mental services for the most mentally disturbed people is well made. Although progress continues to be made in the provision of a community-based service as envisaged the report, we must make further progress before a comprehensive community-based service is available in all health board areas.  To that end, I have committed an additional £3 million in revenue funding this year for the enhancement and development of community based mental health services.  This is being used in the main to provide additional medical, paramedical and nursing support staff.</P>
    <P>The type of service espoused in <i>Planning for the Future</i> will require the provision of additional <Col N="738" /> facilities such as acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation.  I am in the process of finalising my Department's capital programme and I hope to be able to announce in the near future the provision of capital funding, greater than that provided by any previous Administration, to enable a range of such facilities to be put in place.  I trust Senators will accept that the Government is committed to the objectives of <i>Planning for the Future</i> to provide a comprehensive, community oriented, integrated mental health service which is caring, effective and ready to meet the needs of modern society.</P>
    <P>The principles of equity and accountability are also essential to the provision of an effective health service.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has played a crucial role in monitoring and reporting on the quality of care in our mental health service each year.  In pursuance of excellence in care delivery and to assist service providers in attaining this objective, the inspectorate has in recent years formulated guidelines on good clinical practice and quality assurance in mental health services.  The inspector now believes that it is appropriate to formalise this checklist in the form of a guide towards good practice and quality assurance.  Senator Norris made an associated point in this regard.  Accordingly, I hope in the near future to launch these guidelines and have them circulated to all mental health service providers in the country.  At the conferences of the various psychiatric nursing unions I indicated my interest in obtaining members' observations in respect of the final draft, which has come about as a result of a long period of consultation with the service providers.</P>
    <P>The 1996 report refers to the plan for a new Mental Health Act and I would like to inform Senators of the Government's intentions in this regard.  It is proposed to introduce new mental health legislation which will set out a modern framework for the care and treatment of those suffering from psychiatric illnesses.  The legislation will narrow the criteria for detaining mentally ill patient because, as Senator Henry pointed out, the criteria currently applying are considered to be too wide in scope.  The proposed legislation will also bring Irish legislation in respect of the detention of mentally disordered patients into conformity with international conventions on human rights.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the White Paper, a draft general scheme and heads of a new mental health Bill were approved by Government.  The new Bill is currently being drafted in the Attorney General's Office and it is my intention to have this Bill introduced in the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  As far as I am concerned, the Bill will be given priority by the legislation committee chaired by the Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>The inspector's report also refers to the work of the Task Force on Suicide, the final report of which I published earlier this year.  The publication of this report marks the completion of <Col N="739" /> detailed examination of the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide and outlines a comprehensive strategy to reduce the incidence of these in Ireland.  All statutory agencies with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies have been contacted to encourage them to implement the recommendations in their respective areas as a matter of urgency.  The chief executive officers of the health boards have, at my request, established a National Suicide Research Committee which will review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, co-ordinate research into suicide and make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of the health boards.  It is clear from the task force report that our mental health services will have to be made more accessible to address the needs of vulnerable people at times of crises.</P>
    <P>I hope that a co-ordinated response to the recommendations of the task force will help to deal with this significant public health problem. My Department will be following up on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force with the relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to St. Loman's, I share people's concern to improve facilities for long stay patients at that hospital.  Members will be aware that a proposal was submitted by the board in respect of the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, regarding the possible deferral of the transfer of patients from St. Loman's to that excellent facility I visited earlier in the week.  I assure the House that what was built for the patients of St. Loman's will be given to them.  If there are other problems which must be dealt with in Tallaght, they will not be resolved at the expense of the voiceless patients of St. Loman's who are entitled, as a matter of priority, to be transferred into that hospital. The board has indicated, as a result of consultations with my Department, that their transfer will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to problems in Mountjoy Prison.  These problems have arisen as a result of the lack of consultant psychiatric input into the prison.  We are engaged in discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Eastern Health Board regarding the development of a proper forensic psychiatric input into Mountjoy and other prisons.  We hope to take positive steps in that regard in the near future and we would like to appoint a consultant psychiatrist with a sessional commitment to Mountjoy Prison as a means of dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised a number of issues in respect of personal clothing and identification badges.  As already stated, we shall shortly be issuing guidelines on good practice which will cover these issues based on the checklist to which Senator Norris referred.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that there is a need to disperse services currently provided at St. Brendan's Hospital.  These plans involve switching acute services <Col N="740" /> currently provided at St. Brendan's to a new psychiatric unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  It gives Senators an opportunity to comment generally on mental health services.  I do not like delays in the publication of reports in any Department, particularly when there are statutory obligations to do so and I have taken steps to reduce the delay by 50 per cent.  The 1997 report will come on stream.  I will take responsibility for those reports which arise during my tenure while doing my best to make up for my predecessor's laxity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's statement before I made my contribution.  I was the Senator who rang his office to find out what had happened to the report and the reason for the delay.  I am glad Senator Henry raised this issue.  This debate does not give us an opportunity to debate this matter in the detail we would like. I read the inspector's 1995 report in the last few days and the White Paper on a new mental health Bill.  It is imperative that those of us with an interest in health and children are <i>au fait</i> with these issues.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that there will not be a vote on this motion.  This proactive decision by Senators Norris and Henry and those on the Government side ensures that we will not vote on such a sensitive issue.  This is indicative of the interest in this debate and Senator Henry's objective of debating psychiatric services in a caring, compassionate manner.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's comments on the demands arising from other publications concerning the two referenda.  However, the 1995 report by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals was not published until 1997.  There always seems to be a two year delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister stated that the health boards do not have to await the publication of the report to get involved proactively in implementing the findings.  There may be all the good will in the world on the part of the health boards but many of the recommendations require a great deal of financial input.  I hope the Minister prioritises mental health for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction to the 1995 report by Dr. Dermot Walsh indicates that he is an extremely caring individual.  He must have a huge workload as he is doing this alone.  He states that the 1996 report to be published on Monday &mdash; and I accept the Minister's word on that &mdash; will be his eighth <Col N="741" /> report.  Obviously Dr. Walsh has a chronological, coherent assessment of what needs to be done.  I do not know him but he must have a tremendous commitment to spend his time visiting health boards and drafting detailed recommendations. The Mid-Western Health Board indicated that health boards have six to eight weeks to respond to these recommendations before they are collated into a report.  This involves a tremendous amount of work.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states that more duties will be assigned to the inspector.  The legislation has been in place since 1945 and I agree that it is time the inspector was afforded the new title of Commissioner of Mental Health Services.  The White Paper also indicates that quality assurance will be central to his role and that the position will be given statutory basis in new legislation.  This may have been done already as the Minister referred to the fact that he had a statutory role in ensuring the publication of the report.  The White Paper also indicates that the commissioner will be a consultant psychiatrist with a distinguished reputation. I hope Dermot Walsh continues in the post for some years.  I do not know his age but I would like to meet him as he is making tremendous recommendations on psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also refers to the quality of care for all detained patients.  These are the people I am most concerned about.  There are still 200 patients in St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick, but we had hoped that there would have been fewer.  I know that 36 of these patients are going to Lisnagry.  They may already be there as the previous Minister allocated the resources, funding and staff to ensure that mentally handicapped patients would be catered for in Lisnagry and that this policy would be continued.</P>
    <P>A second recommendation by Dr. Walsh concerns acute, in-patient admission facilities in general hospitals.  Some work has been done on this in the Regional Hospital and in Ennis.  The third point concerns Unit 5B for short-stay patients &mdash; two months or perhaps more &mdash; where patients are based in the community.  Work has been done in the three areas referred to.  We have seven or eight patients in the community based service in Ferndale, Limerick.  This is working extremely well and the Mid-Western Health Board hopes more patients will avail of such services.  Peter Kirwan, the psychiatrist in St. Joseph's, has worked extremely hard over the past few years. He hoped that progress would have been quicker but it all comes down to resources.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat Senator Henry's quotation from the 1995 report as it is very important. Dermot Walsh states:</P>
    <P>. there is always apprehension that the rate of provision may not keep pace with the decline in in-patient facilities, particularly with the phasing out of the former large mental hospitals and their replacement with short-stay acute psychiatric units of smaller size.  [This is an extremely important sentence.  ] By virtue of the perceived increased level of violence in <Col N="742" /> society, the rise in the number of homeless, the increasing problem of marriage breakdown and the undoubted increase in suicide rates in recent years, [the Minister referred to this] it becomes extremely important that alternatives to in-patient care are quantitatively and qualitatively adequate so that patients do not become homeless, [There are a number of patients who may have been in, or may need, psychiatric institutional care wandering the streets.  ] do not suffer social or economic deprivation and that they are adequately housed and fed.</P>
    <P>This is stark language and I am glad Dr. Walsh stated this in his opening chapter.  These are the issues with which we must deal.</P>
    <P>There is one other harrowing fact to which I would like to refer.  Dr. Walsh states that he his concerned at the lack of multi-disciplinary teams in many of our mental health services.  In the 1995 report he highlights a health board with responsiblity for four services for which there is no social worker.  I hope this matter is addressed in the 1996 report.  Dr. Walsh states that this problem has been repeatedly pointed out in successive reports and it is important that it is addressed.  I hope that it will not be long before the Minister returns to the House to respond to the recommendations made by Dermot Walsh in the report which the Minister has indicated will be available next Monday.</P>

No Minister for Health and Children will ever have enough money for all the things they will want to do with the health service.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with the health service for over 20 years and have seen huge improvement and change.  I remember when mental hospitals were the only institutions for mentally and physically handicapped children.  In fact, all people with such handicaps were admitted to a mental institution, which is shocking.  They were terrible places with big, long wards with rows of beds.  I am glad they are no more.</P>

    <P>The problem with the mental health service seems to be confined to the Eastern Health Board area.  I pay tribute to the board and its staff for their work.  Dublin is a huge city with many problems with which they dealing.  They are doing their best to integrate mental patients into the community.  While community care is good, it must be asked whether the community cares. When there is an attempt to open a high support hostel in an area, people object stating they do not want mental patients in their area because their children would be put in danger.  The North-Western Health Board was one of the first to introduce the hostel system and we experienced problems for a number of years.  In the past four or five years patients have been welcomed with <Col N="743" /> open arms because it is now realised there is no problem.</P>
    <P>High support hostels are a great service for mentally handicapped and mentally ill people but they are expensive.  Unless they are set up properly, as they are in the north-west, with a good support service, they will not work.  The patients need constant supervision and for someone to cook their meals, clean their houses and ensure they take their medication.  There are two or three such hostels in my local village of Grange. It is great to see these people going to the local pub for a drink and being part of the community. This is as it should be.  It is unfair to tag mental patients as being unsafe.  They are ordinary people except that they must be cared for and that is being done.  Mental hospital staff deserve congratulations for the high standard of care they give to patients.</P>
    <P>One noticeable development is that not as many of those who are admitted suffer from what I call real mental illness.  I am told that up to 40 per cent of patients are admitted to mental hospitals because of alcohol abuse.  Alcohol and drug abuse are costing this country millions in terms of health services.  A good education programme must be set up to bring home the dangers of such abuse to children and young people. Young people are drinking more than ever and a brake must be put on it by making them understand that they will end up in mental hospitals or rehabilitation units if they do not give up drinking or learn to respect it.  Alcohol is a dangerous substance if it is abused and such abuse is a placing a strain on the Minister's resources.</P>
    <P>The problem can be remedied because it is a self-imposed disease.  People who abuse substances know they are doing so.  They should not abuse substances and that must be put across to young people.  Anyone who watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night will have seen that five people were killed in one accident because three were out of their minds on drink.  Alcohol abuse is a serious problem, and if we want to solve our health problems, remedial action will have to be taken to try to educate people to watch their health and not to be a burden on others.  If that was done and the abuse problem solved, there would be more money to spend on people who are genuine patients in that their illness is not of their own making.  Money for that should not be spent on detoxification programmes and drying out people who drink too much and getting them back on the rails.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to embark on a comprehensive education programme to come to grips with the abuse of substances.  Drugs is another problem and much is being done about it.  I pay tribute to the Garda and the work it is doing.  However, if the problems are not stopped, all available money will be spent dealing with self-imposed problems.  There must be a good education programme to teach young people to <Col N="744" /> know when they have had enough to drink and to stop abusing alcohol.</P>
    <P>I believe we are streets ahead of any other country in terms of the community care area of patient services.  We have a great health service and I pay tribute to the Minister's predecessors. All whom I have known since I first became involved in the health service have done their best and have provided a great deal of funding. Some 20 years ago we took over buildings which were badly neglected and a mental health service in which patients had to sow and harvest crops to feed themselves.  Mental hospitals were self-financing and self-sufficient; they could not have existed otherwise.  They were like the small farmer; they had to be self-reliant.  There is a huge difference between that situation 20 to 25 years ago and the health service we have today.  I ask people to look back on the past years and see the wonderful work done in the health service.  I pay tribute to everyone involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad there was no criticism of the care of mental patients in the North-Western Health Board region in 1995.  It has improved a great deal since and we look forward to the new report which will be issued next week because I believe the board sets a good example of how the health service should be run.  We have run it well over the years and I have no doubt our service will keep ahead of the times.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done and I hope he keeps it up.  If the best use is to be made of the resource, I appeal for greater sense and a greater realisation on the part of people so that they will stop abusing substances and, consequently, the health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has been one of the more dynamic Ministers and has already left his mark on the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few short points in the time available.  The Minister stated that public psychiatric hospitals are inspected annually while private hospitals and the Central Mental Hospital are inspected twice yearly.  Why is that the case and why are not all places inspected twice yearly? We cannot shy away from inspections and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals generally does a good job.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has given a commitment that reports will be provided more speedily in future and that, irrespective of whose fault it was in the past, they will be available within the year in which the inspection takes place.  If the inspections are to mean anything, and inspections indicate that changes might be necessary, it is no good implementing the recommended changes in ten years' time but just after the inspection is made.  I am glad to see the Minister's commitment in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have spoken about various aspects of psychiatry and psychiatric practice.  I have worked in that area for the past 25 years, both in public and private practice, dealing with <Col N="745" /> children, adolescents, adults and in the psychogeriatric area.  Although I am not an expert I have some considerable experience and a good deal of expertise.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his speech, the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals has been falling and that is to be welcomed.  There will, however, always be a need for an acute psychiatric hospital.  If one examines the figures one finds that there are many admissions but for much shorter periods of time as treatment has become more effective.  Rather than having long stay patients rot in a back ward in a large institution, they can now be looked after in an acute sense in hospital and then in a community based way.  The community based service will be expensive and there is no shying away from that if it is to be effective.  When they closed all the large hospitals in England they found that a number of people who had become accustomed to life in an institution wandered the streets and roads.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear what the Minister said concerning the Central Mental Hospital as regards insisting that health boards or other services should take some of the patients from that hospital when they no longer require the special services provided there.  I will talk to the Minster privately about a case involving a patient who is there because he was declared insane.  He has not been insane for about eight or nine years and has been so diagnosed by a number of psychologists, psychiatrists and specialists including the consultant psychiatrist in the hospital.  If this man was detained in Great Britain we would all be up in arms about it.  However, because he is detained in the Central Mental Hospital there is not a word about it.  I am not blaming anyone in particular but that is the way the service was set up and we should try to change it to some degree, if we can.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the commitment the Minister has made to old age psychiatry.  We have a huge burgeoning elderly population and an additional £1 million a year will help them.  We must look at some way of financing acute nursing home care by some sort of insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>With his colleagues in the Department of Finance, the Minister might examine the situation whereby people who pay insurance for years do not get the capital back, just the interest.  At the moment insurance companies keep the capital but if that was changed it might be a way of funding some things.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, might smile on that proposal.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see the Minister's commitment to child and adolescent psychiatric services. Many years ago I was privileged to be the first psychologist from Ireland to attend a Council of Europe medical fellowship to study in-patient treatment for disturbed adolescents.  I am glad to say that we now have a number of adolescent units here.  There is a very good one in St. John of God Hospital which caters both for private and <Col N="746" /> public patients.  It is a highly expensive service which is highly intensive staffwise, but it is a job that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the issue of prevention.  In planning for the future, the Minister said that a community oriented mental health service is probably the best one.  It probably is, but there is always a need for acute care.</P>
    <P>One thing I do not agree with, which was mentioned in <i>Planning for the Future,</i> is the provision of additional facilities such as acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals.  I personally think this is a waste of money because one needs a psychiatric team &mdash; including a consultant psychiatrist, a psychologist and a social worker &mdash; attached to a general hospital, which already exists in a psychiatric hospital.  These acute psychiatric units should not be based in general hospitals but should be attached to existing psychiatric hospitals where the expertise already exists, including follow up, planning, social work, psychological and outpatient services.  In south County Dublin, for example, why would one attach such a unit to St. Vincent's Hospital when one already exists in the St. John of God Hospital?  The same could be said for other areas of Dublin.  It is not necessary to duplicate the services that are already there.  That would amount to pouring money down the drain.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance is an interesting concept and is one we have been tackling within our own services, some of which have an ISO 1000 quality mark.  It raises the question of accountability.  The day is long gone when health providers cannot be held accountable.  They must be accountable for the therapy they provide, whatever that therapy is.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the new mental health legislation arriving but the Minister should consider tackling one or two problems including computerisation. In St. John of God Hospital we have developed probably the most modern computerised system in the world.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  However, it has brought many legal problems for us concerning the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act.  The Minister should examine this legal minefield if the Act has not been prepared already.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also examine the registration of psychotherapists, whether they are clinical psychologists, social workers or trained therapists.  There are so many therapists wandering around.  People are referred to us who have been to them and they have not been provided with proper care.  They have regressed or have been told they were abused when they were children. This might not happen if there was a register of psychotherapists.</P>
    <P>Many trained therapists are of very good quality; I am thinking of people in the marriage and family guidance institute and other places. However, there are many people who are not trained.  The fact that they have a degree or a particular profession does not mean they are trained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> I would like the Minister to look at the prevention area where more could be done.  If one looks at the number of people currently providing stress counselling it shows there is a need for a preventative aspect.  That could be done though educational schools and I am glad to see that some of that is happening.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the question of locked wards.  Unfortunately, these are necessary for the patients' own safety.  Frequently when patients are admitted to hospital they are extremely disturbed, otherwise they would not be admitted, and most of them are either frightened or lonely. They are not violent but the locked wards are to protect them from themselves rather than to protect anybody else.  Generally, they are moved on, as soon as is practically possible, to a ward that is not locked.</P>
    <P>I compliment the work of the religious orders with what used to be called the mentally or physically handicapped.  They are now more properly referred to as being educationally disadvantaged. I wish to refer particularly to the work of the Brothers of Charity in St. John of God Hospital and also the work done by St. Michael's House, Stewart's Hospital and many other providers of care for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think there will be any need for the provision of that kind of care in future, given the proposals made recently by the Adelaide Hospital to provide abortion in the new Tallaght Hospital, because we will be able to get rid of these people before they arrive in the world.  They are planning to redefine the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and call it something else.  Before eight weeks it will be a foetus, after which it will be an unborn child.</P>
    <P>The new legislation the Minister is planning is to be welcomed.  The fact that he is hurrying up these reports is to be welcomed also.  I would like him to examine some of the matters I raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution and also wish to thank Senators for their interest in this topic.  I was certainly not getting at the Minister about the delay in publishing the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. They are not published much later than any other reports.  I was concerned, however, that they should not become historical documents, which is what happens if one does not receive them while there is some perspective and reason for dealing with them.  In the early 1980s, despite the Act, the reports were not published at all.</P>
      <P>The attitude taken towards some reports in the Houses of the Oireachtas is very serious.  If the Minister said he wanted the delay cut by two months this year and four months next year, the report would appear well within the year and we would be talking about relevant topics.  In that case people from health boards would not be telling the Minister that it is all right because they have fixed the problem.  How do we know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> I like the Minister's idea of publishing a check list and asking people to go through it.  I was part of a group that visited mental hospitals and I am not sure we asked the right questions or looked for the right sort of things.  I support the Minister's idea of publishing a checklist and encouraging people to go through it.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick and Senator Lydon, who work within the system, talked about community psychiatry which is an important part of planning for the future.  Acute units are, of course, necessary in psychiatric hospitals and/or general hospitals.  However, one issue worries me.  People appeared to have the idea that community psychiatry would be cheap.  That is not true and I am delighted to see both Senators nod their heads in agreement.  Community psychiatry is expensive and unless there are multidisciplinary teams, perhaps on a central basis as well, patients are badly shortchanged.  Senator Jackman pointed out that there are no social workers on some of the teams. I have a hard suspicion that somebody had a notion that it might be cheaper but it is not.  It is much more expensive.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Farrell say there was no trouble setting up hostels in his area. Sadly, this has not been the case everywhere. Objections have been made by the most unexpected people to the establishment of day centres or hostels in their areas.  It is a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I did not get to discuss the problem of having patients with mental handicap, patients with mental illness and elderly patients in the same institution. These groups have different needs and it is extraordinarily difficult for staff to deal with all of them.  The inspector frequently says in his report that elderly patients could be located in community homes and dealt with by general practitioners as they are not in need of psychiatric services. Issues such as this are terribly important.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people who are very isolated to deal with problems within large mental hospitals.  I acknowledge Senator Lydon's belief that there is no need for acute units attached to general hospitals.  However, his institution is the <i>crème de la crème</i> and there is no criticism of that institution in any of the inspector's reports I have seen.  I am glad the Minister did not back down with regard to St. Loman's and insisted that the patients go to the Tallaght Hospital with the first wave.  If they did not go then, they would not be there in ten years' time.  The Minister was right to insist that it happen.</P>
    <P>While I accept that some of the psychiatric hospitals do excellent work in their acute units, the units attached to general hospitals are most important.  I wish the Minister luck with the Central Mental Hospital and in trying to get the parent psychiatric units to take home patients who do not need to be in that insitution.  I also accept Senator Lydon's point about the fact that &ldquo;therapists&rdquo; are not regulated at present.  However, that is another issue which is not within the remit of the inspector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> It is also important to note that the inspector does not appear to have much control or influence over the hostels.  I am not sure who is in charge of them.  I am delighted that the Mental Health Bill is in the Office of the Attorney General. This is real progress and if the Minister can bring it before the Seanad, even if it does not leave the Chamber, we can at least debate it.  If the worst comes to the worst he could threaten to use all-island legislation, get hold of the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order, 1986, fiddle around with it and say it is part of the peace agreement and must go through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his interest.  If he can put through the personal clothes policy and the identification badges, I will be most grateful.  He can warn the staff in his Department that he does not wish to hear this woman mention these topics again.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear the views of Senators on these and other matters at any time. Members are free to call me to the House on a more regular basis if they wish.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.  It is a timely discussion, albeit a short one.  Much has been said and that is more important than spending a huge amount of time saying nothing.</P>
      <P>It is true that, in the context of the <i>Planning for the Future</i> document, there was a great deal of resistance in the community to community based psychiatry.  The resistance was based on unfounded misapprehensions about the type of patient who would be reintegrated into society. Thankfully, the number of occasions on which there are objections to health boards buying residences in various parts of the country is decreasing. People can see the policy is a success and that good, high support environments are being created for people who leave institutions for community residences.  It is quite proper to remove these patients from institutionalised settings and allow them back into mainstream society.  Many of these settings were inappropriate placements in the first place but outdated social realities brought that about initially.</P>
      <P>With regard to different groups of people being held in the same institution, whether they are mentally handicapped, elderly, young, male or female, a great deal of progress is being made in organising specific programmes for these groups and providing for interaction where appropriate. We are aware of the need to address that issue. Senator Jackman asked about the future role of the inspector.  The new mental health legislation will copperfasten the role of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  It will continue to be a feature of how we monitor the progress, if any, that is made in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> A question was asked about the homeless, people who are inappropriately discharged or people who are appropriately discharged and subsequently fall through the net.  An active outreach programme is run by the Eastern Health Board which actively follows up all discharged patients who are in danger of becoming homeless. The programme is specifically geared towards people who could become homeless.  I have had reason, by way of Parliamentary Questions, to check this matter in some detail and it is working extremely well.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Lydon with regard to acute units.  He spoke about the duplication of services.  The current thinking is that psychiatric patients should be integrated in the hospital setting, in the acute sense, in the same way as they would be integrated in the community setting where that is appropriate.  It must be borne in mind that many psychogeriatric patients need hospital or acute nursing care to a factor that is three or four times that of people of middle age or younger.  Elderly people are more prone to sickness which requires medical intervention.  It is, therefore, more efficient to gradually integrate these acute units into general hospitals so people who might require medical care and who happen to be psychiatric patients will have such care as freely available to them as to those who are more mobile and can visit the hospital themselves or call an ambulance.</P>
    <P>When one considers Tallaght Hospital and other units which have integrated into general hospitals one can see it is the way to proceed. That does not demean the role of exclusively psychiatric institutions which are providing modern medical care and are constantly refurbishing their capital bases in order to provide the best possible care.  Sixteen acute units are now in place, a further ten are planned and, through the new capital programme, I expect to accelerate the rate at which units are coming on stream.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to nursing homes.  Sometimes psychogeriatric cases are resident in private nursing homes and we have invested almost £7 million in such homes this year to help more older people avail of nursing home care where that is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Prevention will be dealt with in terms of the implementation of the suicide task force report which is a long awaited and valuable report.  It is also disturbing in that it shows that young males are seven times more likely to commit suicide than young females.  The increase in suicides and attempted suicides is clearly a matter of serious concern.  The health promotion unit of the Department will be taking an active role in that area.  I thank the Senators who participated so constructively in this timely debate and I thank Senator Henry for tabling the motion.</P>
