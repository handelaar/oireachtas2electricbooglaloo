      <P>I have notice from Senator Gallagher that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to take all possible measures to ensure that the threatened closure of Ferbane power station in County Offaly is averted and the promised £16 million investment in the plant proceeds.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to carry out an immediate prevalence of ADHD in Ireland so that the serious situation of ADHD sufferers can be addressed.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the concerns of members of the Milk Rights Group in getting full compensation for losses arising from the failure of the Minister to recognise their quota rights in line with their farm modernisation plans.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the reasons the Government has failed to seek Objective One status EU Structural Funding for blighted communities in Dublin and other urban areas for the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the reasons the Auto Turning Centre in Ballina, which was announced six months ago, does not now appear to be going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected <Col N="986" /> Senators Gallagher and Jackman's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Doyle, Costello and Caffrey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>Before I call the Leader of the House on the Order of Business, I understand he wishes to pay tribute to former Members of the House who died recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with deep regret that we learned of the sudden death of a very esteemed former Member of this House, Senator James Larkin.  Nominated to the Seanad in 1982 by the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, he served as a Member of the House for only one year.  To those of us who had the pleasure and honour of serving with him, he commanded the respect of all for hard work, dedication and commitment to public life.</P>
      <P>James was first elected a member of the Letterkenny local urban district council in 1967.  He was chairman of that council on five different occasions, including a term of three years in the early nineties.  He was a highly respected member of Donegal Vocational Education Committee and a member of the National Library Board at a time when the new library at Oliver Plunkett Road was developed.  He was also a member of the national executive of the Municipal Authorities of Ireland and a founder member of Independent Fianna Fáil.  He was a life long friend of the late Neil Blaney, TD, and directed every election on his behalf since the early seventies.  He had a record of never losing an election which he directed.  He gave his wholehearted support to the development of Letterkenny.  When he spoke at council meetings, we are told, everyone listened. He was not a man to seek the limelight but in his own quiet way he got the work done.  Regardless of political or religious persuasions, he was supported by people from all walks of life.</P>
      <P>A fine sportsman, he was highly thought of in the sporting world.  He was a prominent member of St. Eunan's GAA club where he played senior football from the age of 15 years.  He won his first senior county championship medal in 1956 and went on to win three more titles, captaining the team in 1969 &mdash; the same year as he and his team mates took the cup to the United States of America. A former chairman, manager and secretary of St. Eunan's Club, he was proud to be manager when the club won the 1972 county championship. Such was his involvement and commitment to his county that his sudden death has shocked and saddened the people of Donegal who mourn his passing.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Eileen, his sons, Dessie and Kieran, daughters, Carla and Alison and his brother and sisters.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> It was with deep regret that we learned some time ago of the death of a respected former Member of this House, Bobby Burke.  Senator Burke was a member of the Labour Party and a candidate in the Dáil elections in County Galway from 1933 to 1948.  He was a member of Galway County Council for many years and was elected to Seanad Éireann on the Agricultural Panel in 1948 where he served until 1950 at which time both he and his wife, Anne, went as lay missionaries to Nigeria.</P>
    <P>Bobby was also actively involved in voluntary housing activities in the 1930s to provide badly needed accommodation in the Tuam area in particular. In keeping with his compassion for his fellow man, Bobby donated Toghermore House to the Government, originally as a rehabilitation centre for former TB patients and today it remains in operation as part of the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Bobby and his wife, Anne, spent most of their lives working on behalf of those less well off than themselves, particularly in West Africa.  I know their efforts have been greatly appreciated by those who have benefited.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to convey my deepest sympathy to Bobby's wife, Anne, his daughter, Patricia, and family and to those in the Labour Party who have lost a very esteemed member.  Go ndeanaí Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with these votes of sympathy.  I did not serve in this House with the late Senator James Larkin but I knew him socially.  I always found him to be a very direct, straightforward person who was very committed to County Donegal and was very loyal to the ideals which were best expressed by the late Neil Blaney.  His loyalty to Neil Blaney was total and he was a very effective member of his electoral team over a long period.  I extend my sympathy and that of my party to his family.</P>
      <P>I did not know the late Senator Robert Burke but I wish I had, having listened to the description we have heard of his life.  He was clearly a quite extraordinary person who fought the Labour cause in Galway over many barren years with little chance of success.  He was finally elected to the Seanad in 1948 but he left after just two years to serve as a lay missionary in West Africa.  His generosity in giving his house to the Government for the treatment of TB patients was a singular act of public spirited generosity.</P>
      <P>There was a vein of public service throughout his entire life.  He was a generous man who was prepared to put the public good above his own interest.  He deserves to be better known because he led a remarkable life of public service.  I extend my deepest sympathy and that of my party to his surviving family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my sympathy to the relatives of the late Senator Larkin.  I remember <Col N="988" /> when he was a Senator for a short period in the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>He was a Member with great courage and conviction and he was not frightened to walk out of the mainstream of political life for the principles in which he believed, but in which many others did not believe.  He had the courage to take that stand and to follow the late Deputy Blaney into the political wilderness.  Even if we did not agree with him, we can respect him for that.  I remember him very well as someone whom every Member of the House respected for his views, although they were in disagreement with them.  I pay tribute to that and those views today.</P>
      <P>Like many Members, I was not born when the late Senator Burke was first elected to this House.  However, I want to be associated with the remarks made by Senators Cassidy and Manning about his obvious dedication.  It would do many of us no harm to take the same road as he did and become missionaries when we leave this House, but it is not a road we are likely to take. On a more serious note, although we did not know him, we respect what we know of him and we would like to be associated with the votes of sympathy to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Senator James Larkin.  I did not know him personally but, in the words of the Leader, he was a man of wide ranging interests and gave public service to Donegal County Council, the vocational education committee and many sporting activities.  He departed with Neil Blaney to establish Independent Fianna Fáil and was clearly a man of ability, public service and integrity.  I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his family.</P>
      <P>The late Senator Robert Malachy Burke died on Sunday, 20 September 1998 in Belfast, where he lived in retirement with his wife.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer my sympathies and condolences to his wife Anne, his daughter Patricia and her family.</P>
      <P>Robert, who was better known as Bobby, was born in Ballyduggan, Loughrea, County Galway, in 1907 and became a lifelong member of the Labour Party contesting elections in County Galway between 1933 and 1948.  He was unsuccessful but came close to getting elected on a number of occasions and polled over 5,000 in the 1943 election in East Galway.</P>
      <P>He was, however, elected to Galway County Council in 1942 and was elected to the Seanad on the Agricultural Panel in 1948 and resigned his seat in 1950 when he and his wife went as lay missionaries to Nigeria.  They were the last missionaries to be evacuated on the outbreak of the Biafran War.  Subsequently, they went back to Africa working with Concern in a number of African countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bobby Burke was a member of the Church of Ireland and was a philanthropist, an idealist and a Christian socialist.  He was an honorary secretary <Col N="989" /> to branches of such diverse organisations as the Royal Lifeboat Institution, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the League of Nations Society of Ireland.  He was also active in Muintir na Tíre and in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  He inherited 500 acres of land from his uncle which he gave to the Land Commission for division among local farmers.  He set up a co-operative farm on the family estate, the Toghermore Co-operative, with the members, who were agricultural labourers, democratically running the farm.  They supplied the produce of the farm to the poor of the area at greatly reduced prices.</P>
    <P>He was deeply concerned about the living conditions of the urban and rural poor and became an enthusiastic supporter of the war on slums campaign in the 1930s.  He was instrumental in establishing the Tuam Public Utilities Society which built 320 houses in the Tuam area between 1932 and 1942 for those living in slum dwellings. They also built caravans for the large travelling community in the Tuam area.</P>
    <P>An admirer of Dr. Noel Browne when he and his wife Anne departed for Africa in 1950, he donated the family home, Toghermore House, to the Government as a rehabilitation centre for recovering TB patients and it remains with the Western Health Board.  He lived a long and active life based on true Christian and socialist principles and we in the Labour Party are proud of him.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to be associated with the votes of sympathy to the families of the late Jim Larkin and Bobby Burke.  It is obvious that James Larkin was deeply committed to his native county of Donegal both in the sporting and political arenas and served the people of the area effectively and well.  It has been remarked that he displayed considerable political courage in the political path he took and it is a mark of his success that he was instrumental in the successful elections of Neil Blaney to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>In respect of Bobby Burke, it must be said that he had a remarkable degree of commitment to the underprivileged at home and abroad.  I can think of few others who would have donated their home to the disadvantaged suffering from tuberculosis or, indeed, who would have served in a missionary capacity overseas.  That is testimony to the quality of the person we mourn today.  To the wife and family of the late James Larkin and to the family of Robert Burke, we extend our sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to pay tribute to a fellow countyman, James Larkin, who also served in this House.  He came from an esteemed family in Letterkenny and was first elected to the urban council in 1967 and was entering into his thirty second consecutive year of serving the local community in Letterkenny.  He was chairman of that council on five occasions <Col N="990" /> and was nominated to the Seanad in 1982 by Mr. Charles Haughey.  It was a unique achievement because a fellow urban district councillor in Letterkenny, former Senator Bernard McGlinchey, a colleague of former Senator Larkin, was nominated on the same day.  It was a great achievement for the town of Letterkenny to have two Senators nominated on the same day.</P>
      <P>While former Senator Larkin was initially elected to the urban council as a Fianna Fáil member, as Senator Ross said he left the party and went out on a political limb with the late Deputy Neil Blaney.  What I remember most about him is his loyalty until the end to the late Deputy Blaney and to his brother, Deputy Harry Blaney.  Former Senator Larkin was an astute politician and a great man with words.  He was very witty and his great sense of humour deflated and cooled political arguments on many occasions.  He was a true son of the town of Letterkenny and served it extremely well.</P>
      <P>He showed the same dedication in his membership of the GAA and his service to the local club, St. Eunan's.  He won four championship medals with St. Eunan's and, as Senator Cassidy said, he was the team's captain in 1969.  My first memory of the late former Senator Larkin is watching him on the football field.  Although he was what we call a wee man, he had a great tactical brain and was a great fielder of a ball.  After his playing days he continued to serve the local club as manager, secretary and chairman.  He will be a great loss to the town of Letterkenny, both politically and in the area of sport.  Above all, he will be a great loss to his family, particularly his wife, Eileen, his sons, Dessie and Kiaran, and his daughters, Carla and Alison.  I also remember his brothers, Frank and particularly Gabriel who is ill at present, and his eight sisters.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dilis.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader indicate what legislation he intends to bring before the House this session?  Will he also undertake to supply the Opposition groups with a preview of the dates on which legislation is likely to come before the House?  It is helpful if Members know a couple <Col N="991" /> of weeks in advance the broad outline of what legislation is to be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the previous session I asked the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on education at an early date.  I expected that the Education (No. 2) Bill would be taken this week as that was the original plan, but it is still before the other House.  However, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this area at an early date.  I recognise that the Minister for Education and Science is the director of elections for his party in Cork and I do not suggest that the debate should take place before the by-election. However, I ask the Leader for a commitment that a debate will take place the week after the by-election if that is the earliest date on which it can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Another issue which is being discussed everywhere else should be debated in the House. There are some empty seats in the Seanad this afternoon; perhaps Members are stuck in traffic. The change that has taken place since the last session is that if one sees small groups of people huddled together in Dublin asking each other how it was for them this morning and how long did it last, they are talking about the traffic and not Viagra.  It has become an extraordinarily difficult issue and the House should discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That item 12, motion 23, be taken as the first item.</P>
      <P>I propose this because, throughout the country, people are discussing the question of bogus nonresident accounts and how a national bank could have facilitated the defrauding of the State of tens of millions of pounds, not that it was limited to just one financial institution.  This is a matter of national importance and affects every citizen in the State.  It has been the main matter exercising the minds of Members of the other House over the past two days.  They have discussed it at length at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>We should have an input.  We are the second House and such a matter of national importance should be our concern.  We do not know if legislation is required at this point or how the matter is to be dealt with.  The views of Members of the Seanad should be expressed on the record and should be available as decisions are made.  The Minister for Finance should come to the House and hear what we have to say.  This would give us an opportunity to express our views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make time for a debate on a report published during the summer recess by the National Roads Authority? Senators who are also members of local authorities will be familiar with a list of priorities which has been circulated relating to the development <Col N="992" /> of national primary roads between now and 2020.  If this aim is to be achieved, it could well be the middle of the next century before we have a road network comparable with our European partners.  Given the statement last week of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that it would cost upwards of £2 billion to upgrade our national road network, it is incumbent on the House to maintain the pressure to keep this important issue on the political agenda.</P>
      <P>We should have a proper road network and we should examine the priorities outlined by the National Roads Authority because we would have severe reservations about many of them. The N15, which I travel through several counties in the west, is one of many roads which have been downgraded for 20 years.  There must be an injection of realism and that is why I ask the Leader to arrange time for a debate.</P>

There is widespread concern and anger in south Kerry and in the county as a whole at what appears to be the Government's discriminatory intention to exclude and abandon us and remove us from the remainder of the western seaboard, and we in the most peripheral area of all.

A study group is being set up under the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  However, before we receive the final results of that study, we should have statements in the House during which additional ideas might be aired as to how to address this problem.

      <P>One of the most remarkable and harrowing features of the summer was the number of people, young and old, killed on our roads. This has led to grief, loss and sadness for families, villages and communities.  Additional measures were introduced during the summer and additional resources have been given to the Garda who have introduced new measures. However, these measures have not made a significant impact on the loss of life.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue as soon as possible so that we can put our heads together to see we can come up with new ideas and approaches which might help to tackle this appalling situation?</P>

      <P>I second Senator Farrell's call for a debate on the litigation culture which is developing in Ireland.  This is a matter of grave public concern; the wisdom of the House might throw some light on it.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader condemn the unprovoked attack on our Defence Forces, which have served this State with loyalty and dedication, by the presenter of a morning radio chat show?  The call to abolish the Defence Forces is unwarranted and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House to address urban renewal? Earlier this year, local authorities underwent a very difficult screening process and presented reports to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  They were assured they would be informed by July which towns and areas would be given urban renewal status.  The matter was then postponed until August and subsequently until September.  Local authorities have still not been notified and there is a great deal of concern about the matter, both in local authorities and among people prepared to invest in certain towns throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Prior to the summer recess, I requested an early debate on foreign affairs. There is an urgent need for such a debate given the situation in Kosovo and other places.  We must seek to have an input into the resolution of the problem.  The situation in the Middle East will possibly blow up in our faces again with Turkey threatening to invade Syria and with the formation of a military alliance between Turkey and Israel.  I welcome the fact that we are dealing with the International War Crimes Tribunals Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with the call for a debate on the important report published by the National Roads Authority.  Many people think the report's findings will be implemented in the next few years.  However, this is not a plan; it is merely an aspirational report.  The need for millions of pounds to be spent on roads infrastructure is being highlighted each day, not least by the number <Col N="995" /> of accidents which are occurring on roads which are incapable of carrying the number of cars travelling on them or of withstanding the speed at which the cars are travelling.  A figure of £673.8 million is required to keep up to date with the existing backlog, even if we do not carry out any improvements.</P>
    <P>We should also have an early debate on the changes which will take place in the next few years in regard to the amount of funding we will get from Europe and whether Ireland should stay as a single unit or be split into regions.  The Government has not made any decision on this matter yet.</P>

      <P>In response to the issue raised by Senator Manning I intend outlining to the House the proposed legislation we hope to have published and partly or mostly taken during this session.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Ormonde called for a debate on education.  As Members are aware, we expect the Education (No. 2) Bill to come before the House within the next two weeks and it is only fair that all matters be debated at that time. It is a very substantial Bill and this is the fourth week it has been debated in the Dáil.  I look forward to the important contributions of all Senators when it comes before the House in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Norris and Henry proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  The item being proposed &mdash; namely, that motion 23 be taken today &mdash; is currently being dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have no objection to having the matter debated in the House at an early date in the future.  I will make the required time available through the Whips.  I ask the Senators, in light of our very busy schedule for today, to leave this matter to see how their request can be facilitated through discussion with the Whips once the Order of Business is agreed.</P>
      <P>Senators Mooney and Lanigan called for a debate on the proposed plan of the National Roads Authority for the period 1998 to 2020. Members will recall discussing, debating and expressing various views on what was important in the context of our own areas and nationally during a motion which came before the House in the first month of the 21st Seanad.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government came before the House and gave a very full outline of his wishes.  I will certainly make time available within the next four weeks to have the issue debated in the House.  I will see when the Minister is available to come to the House to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with Senator Coghlan's request for a debate on Objective One status. Senators Farrell and Finneran called for a debate on the claims culture and the insurance industry in general.  I will allow a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> Senator Connor expressed concern regarding the Western Development Commission Bill, 1998.  It is currently at Second Stage in the Dáil and we will take it when the debate on all Stages concludes.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate in support of the Defence Forces.  I will make time available for such a debate; I note his comments regarding his annoyance with the broadcaster concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes called for a debate on urban renewal.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator.  I know many large towns, and others which are not so large, are awaiting word from the Government in this regard.  I understand there is a requirement which involves the EU and I think this is holding things up.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan called for a debate on foreign affairs.  I thought this would be one of the most requested debates on the Order of Business.  Of course I will make time available at the earliest opportunity for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill called for a debate on road safety.  Private Members' time next week is being given to the Progressive Democrats Party and I would welcome a motion concerning this matter. It is a very worthy request and I agree with Senator Quill's call for a debate on the issue.  She has my full support in bringing the matter before the House next week during Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>The Bills currently before the Dáil are the Western Development Commission Bill, 1998, the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Bill, 1998, the State Property Bill, 1998, and the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1998.  We are awaiting these Bills in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The following is a list of Bills we expect to be published from the start of the Dáil and Seanad sessions up to 31 December 1998: the National Inventory of Archaeological Heritage Bill, the Broadcasting Bill, the Companies (Amendment) Bill, the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, the Local Government Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, the Appropriations Bill, the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, the Eastern Regional Health Authority Bill, the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking and Employment Bill, the Family Law International Protection of Children Bill, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, the National Disabilities Authority Bill, the Criminal Law United Nations Convention Against Torture Bill, the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Bill, the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, the Electricity Supply Regulations Bill and the Irish Sports Culture Bill. There are 22 Bills in all.  As one can see, the Seanad has a very busy schedule, and contrary to what Lord Henry Mountcharles &mdash; a distinguished gentleman and a good colleague and friend of mine &mdash; might say, this has been the hardest working Seanad in the history of this House.  It sat the same number of days as the Dáil this year so far and I believe this will continue <Col N="997" /> into the future.  As a legislative body, the Seanad will play an important role in running the affairs of the country for many years to come in the interest of those who elect us.</P>

      <P>We have all been appalled by the reports of the atrocities committed in the territories of former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The depth and scale of the savagery visited on countless innocent men, women and children which these reports revealed almost passes human comprehension.  I know Senators will fully agree that vigorous action by the international community was needed.</P>
      <P>The UN did act and this Bill will implement United Nations Resolutions setting up War Crimes Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  As you will know, the function of the tribunals is to put on trial and punish, as appropriate, persons who were guilty of war crimes. The Government fully supports the efforts to bring to justice those guilty of war crimes.  This Bill will equip the appropriate authorities here with the legal means to arrest, detain and surrender persons found in the State who are wanted by the tribunals.  I have no doubt that Senators will welcome this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the Bill is as follows.  In 1992 the UN Security Council became alarmed at <Col N="998" /> continuing reports of violations of international humanitarian law in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A commission of experts, established at that time to investigate the reports, came to the conclusion that grave breaches and other violations of international humanitarian law had been committed, including mass killings, ethnic cleansing, torture, rape, pillage and arbitrary arrests.</P>
    <P>The Security Council decided that the situation constituted a threat to international peace and security, expressed its determination to put an end to such crimes and to take effective measures to bring to justice those responsible for them.  In 1993, the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was established by Security Council resolutions for the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes against humanity committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The tribunal sits in the Hague.  It has three trial chambers and one appeal chamber.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Security Council, by resolution of 13 May 1998, provided the third trial chamber to expedite the conduct of its business and for the election of three additional judges to bring the number of judges to 14.  It is expected that the three additional judges will take their oath before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Under the resolutions establishing the tribunal all member states of the UN are obliged to comply with the resolutions and take whatever action is required to give effect to that obligation.  This binding obligation is further specified in Article 29 of the statute of the tribunal, contained in the Third Schedule to the Bill, which provides that all states shall co-operate with the tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of persons accused of crimes within the jurisdiction of the tribunal and comply without undue delay with any request for assistance issued by the tribunal, including the surrender of the accused at the request of the tribunal.  A similar obligation is imposed by Article 28 of the statute of the Rwanda tribunal, contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The most recent statistics show that in the legal proceedings to date 20 public indictments against 58 individuals together with a number of sealed indictments have issued.  Initial arrest warrants have issued against all the accused, including eight international arrest warrants.  A total of 26 of the accused are currently in custody.  One person was sentenced to five years' imprisonment last March; an appeal has been lodged in another case and five other trials involving 14 individuals are ongoing.  The tribunal expects to use 340 witnesses this year &mdash; up from 200 in 1997 &mdash; and operates a witness protection and relocation programme. The UN bears the expenses of the tribunal and levies contributions from member states.  This year's budget is almost $65 million. Ireland's assessed contribution this year was just over $104,000.  In addition Ireland has made a contribution of $120,000 to a voluntary fund to which states may subscribe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established under a resolution of the Security Council in 1994 for the purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for acts of genocide or other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda and, also, Rwandan citizens responsible for such violations committed in the territory of neighbouring states between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994.</P>
    <P>The seat of the tribunal is in Arusha, Tanzania, where it conducts trials and holds suspects.  It has three trial chambers and an appeals chamber &mdash; the UN Security Council by resolution of 30 April 1998 provided for the third trial chamber comprising three additional judges.  Elections to this chamber will take place as soon as possible and the elected judges are expected to assume duty early next year.  Both tribunals share the same prosecutor.  The statutes and rules of procedure of the tribunals are similar.  They are both subsidiary organs of the Security Council but are not subject to its authority or control in the performance of their judicial functions and they are independent of any state or group of states.</P>
    <P>The investigations of the Rwanda tribunal have focused mainly on the 400 identified suspects and are being conducted both inside and outside Rwanda, notably in other African countries, Europe and America where the principal planners of the genocide are thought to be located. The most recent statistics show that 28 indictments have been issued against 45 individuals.  A total of 32 indicted individuals are in custody &mdash; 31 of them in the detention facility in Arusha and one in the United States.  Two trials are under way involving three individuals.  The Rwanda tribunal delivered its first verdict on 1 May 1998, finding the former Rwandan Prime Minister, Mr. Jean Kambanda guilty on all six counts of genocide and crimes against humanity.  Mr. Kambanda was given a life sentence by the Rwandan tribunal in early September.  In a statement following the imposition of sentence, Justice Louise Arbour, prosecutor of the Rwanda tribunal stated:</P>
    <P>This completed process will serve to keep alive the memory of the thousands who died, for the whole of the international community to remember.  One can only hope that it will also offer a measure of peace and serenity to those who survived.  An unequivocal message has been sent, not only in Rwanda, and in the neighbouring countries, but also in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere in the world, that once-influential politicians are not immune from the reach of international criminal justice.</P>
    <P>In another development the Rwanda tribunal on 2 September 1998 gave a precedent setting judgment in which genocide, as defined in the Geneva Convention of 1948, was interpreted for the first time by an international court.  The judgment was welcomed by the Secretary General <Col N="1000" /> of the United Nations.  Mr. Kofi Annan.  He commented:</P>
    <P>This is a landmark decision in the history of international criminal law.  This judgment is a testament to our collective determination to confront the heinous crime of genocide in a way we never have before.  It is a defining example of the ability of the United Nations to establish an effective international legal order and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>In the course of delivering its judgment in this case the trial chamber concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that:</P>
    <P>The rape of Tutsi women was systematic and was perpetrated against all Tutsi women and solely against them.  Furthermore, these rapes were accompanied by a proven intent to kill their victims.  At least 2,000 Tutsi were killed in Taba between 7 April and the end of June 1994 while the accused was in a position of authority at the Taba commune.</P>
    <P>That extract from the judgment sets out in chilling terms the scale of the misery inflicted on innocent victims.</P>
    <P>A Tribunal Victims' and Witnesses Protection Unit has operated since November 1996.  This year the tribunal expects to use 330 witnesses, almost three times the number used in 1997. There was some dissatisfaction last year with the working of this tribunal but steps taken by the UN, including the appointment of a new registrar, a new deputy prosecutor and, as I have mentioned already, the establishment of a third trial chamber, have helped to restore confidence in the tribunal.  Sadly, genocidal violence has not yet ceased in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>As with the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia the UN bears the expenses of this tribunal &mdash; this year the budget is almost $57 million.  Ireland's assessed contribution to the cost of the Rwanda tribunal for this year was in the region of $107,000.  We also provided £150,000 in start-up assistance to this tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that these tribunals are the first international fora established to try war crimes in the 50 years since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of the Second World War.</P>
    <P>While the Bill deals specifically with the two tribunals I have mentioned it contains provision in section 37 to enable regulations to be made to apply the provisions of the Bill to any other war crimes tribunal or court that may be established by the United Nations in the future.</P>
    <P>During the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, it was suggested that the absence of a permanent international criminal court made it impossible to try Pol Pot for his part in the genocidal campaign in Cambodia in the 1970s.  Indeed, several speakers expressed strong support for the establishment of a permanent court to deal with such situations. The establishment of a further <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to deal with the perpetrators of the atrocities in Cambodia was raised at the UN earlier this year but was left aside on the basis that the <Col N="1001" /> international criminal court, due to be established following the successful negotiation earlier this year of a statute to establish such a court, would be in a position to bring to justice the perpetrators of the atrocities that have taken place in various parts of the world.  I will refer later to the negotiations to establish a permanent court and to Ireland's strong support over many years for the establishment of such a court.</P>
    <P>I visited Bosnia and Croatia in the last few weeks.  The purpose of my visit was to meet the Garda contingents working with the United Nations.  While there I received detailed briefings from people on the ground and saw at first hand the devastation that had been inflicted on Sarajevo, the evidence of ethnic cleansing in the surrounding countryside and the proliferation of mines in the area.  It forcefully brought home the futility of war and the absolute necessity to deal with war criminals.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, fighting there has stopped and we are now at what might be called a &ldquo;constructive stage&rdquo;.  In particular, we are trying to restore ethnic balance in the local police forces, improve their training and, most importantly, inculcate them with respect for human rights.  Faith in the justice system and respect for law and order cannot be fully restored until people see that war criminals have to account for their crimes and that no distinction is made on the basis of their ethnic background.</P>
    <P>The two tribunals have jurisdiction over the very serious crimes against humanity which are listed in Articles 2 to 5 of the Statute of the former Yugoslavia Tribunal, set out in the Third Schedule to the Bill, and in Articles 2 to 4 of the Statute of the Rwanda Tribunal, set out in the Fourth Schedule.  In this Bill these crimes are referred to as international tribunal crimes. Section 4 of the Bill provides that none of these crimes can be regarded as a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  The penalties which the tribunals may impose are limited to imprisonment and to orders for the return to their rightful owners of any property and proceeds acquired by criminal conduct.  Capital punishment is not an option.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the persons whose surrender may be sought are persons who have been accused or convicted of international tribunal crimes and in respect of whom a warrant of arrest has been issued by the relevant tribunal.  The purpose of surrender will be either to have the person brought before the tribunal for trial or brought to a place where he or she is to undergo imprisonment under a sentence imposed by the tribunal.  That place may be in any one of the countries which have indicated to the Security Council of the United Nations their willingness to accept and imprison persons sentenced by the tribunals.</P>
    <P>The arrangements which the Bill proposes to put in place for the surrender of war criminals or alleged war criminals found in the State are based on and are similar to the arrangements for the <Col N="1002" /> extradition of persons under our general extradition law and contain similar safeguards for constitutional rights.  There are, however, some differences. For example, the arrangements in the Bill are limited to international tribunal crimes. In addition, while applications for extradition are made to the District Court, it was considered, given the novel nature and the scope of the tribunals, that applications for surrender under the Bill should go to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the arrest and detention of suspects for a maximum of 18 days.  This is not a feature of general extradition law. However, while a suspect may be detained, the Bill does not permit surrender until an arrest warrant, showing that the person is wanted for trial, has been received from the tribunal.  There are a number of provisions in the Bill to ensure that applications by the tribunals for surrender are given priority and precedence over other matters. This reflects articles in the statutes of the tribunals and represents the seriousness which states attach to the pursuit and punishment of persons who commit the heinous crimes with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 5 of the Bill a request by an international tribunal for the surrender of a person will be made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The person must have been accused or convicted by the tribunal of an international tribunal crime and there must be in existence a warrant of arrest for the purpose of bringing him or her before the tribunal or to a place where he or she is to undergo imprisonment under a sentence imposed by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The request will be in writing and will contain an accurate description of the person wanted and information helping to establish his or her identity. It will include a statement of each international tribunal crime with which he or she is charged specifying the date and place of commission of each crime, the legal description of the crime and the provision of the tribunal's statute which applies.  It will also be accompanied by the original or certified copy of the warrant of arrest issued by the tribunal with an indication of the purpose of the arrest.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is satisfied that the request complies with the requirements of section 5 &mdash; if necessary by seeking further information from the tribunal under section 8 &mdash; the Minister will certify that a request for the surrender of the person has been made by the tribunal.  When that certificate is produced to the High Court, the court is required by section 9 to issue a warrant for the arrest of the person, unless the person is already under arrest under the provisions dealing with provisional arrest.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our general extradition law, provisions are included for the provisional arrest on grounds of urgency of persons wanted by an international tribunal.  In this case sections 10, 11 and 13 of the Bill are relevant.  An international tribunal may make a request for the provisional <Col N="1003" /> arrest of a person who has been accused by the tribunal of having committed an international tribunal crime or who has been convicted by it of such a crime or who is suspected by it of having committed such a crime.  The request will be in writing and, in addition to containing information necessary to identify the person, will also contain a statement of the international tribunal crimes in question specifying time and place of commission of each crime.</P>
    <P>Provisional arrest warrants may be issued by the High Court on the sworn information of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector that an international tribunal has made a request for the person's provisional arrest on grounds of urgency and that the person is accused of having committed an international tribunal crime, has been convicted by the tribunal of such a crime or is suspected by the tribunal of having committed such a crime.  The inspector will also indicate that the purpose of the arrest is to detain the person pending receipt by the Minister from the tribunal of a warrant of arrest issued by the tribunal in respect of the person.</P>
    <P>If at a later time it appears to the Minister that a warrant for arrest will not be received from the tribunal in respect of the person named in the provisional arrest warrant or that proceedings will not be commenced against the person by the tribunal, the Minister may cancel the provisional arrest warrant and, if the warrant has been executed, direct that the person, if in custody, be released.  If the tribunal's warrant of arrest and other necessary information is not received in time to enable the Minister's certificate that a request for surrender has been made, to be produced to the High Court within 18 days after the date of the provisional arrest, the person arrested, if in custody, will be released.</P>
    <P>When, after receipt of a request for provisional arrest on the ground of urgency, the Minister subsequently receives from the tribunal the original or certified copy of a warrant of arrest indicating that the person has been accused or convicted by that tribunal of an international tribunal crime and the purpose of the arrest, together with other information required in connection with requests for surrender, the matter will be treated as a request for the surrender of the person and the procedures relating to such requests will then apply.</P>
    <P>When the High Court is satisfied that the person has been accused or convicted of an international tribunal crime, that a request for the surrender of the person has been duly made and that a warrant that complies with the requirements of section 5 has been produced, the court under section 14 will commit the person to prison to await the order of the Minister for his or her surrender. Before committing the person, the court will inform him or her that he or she will not be surrendered except with his or her consent before 15 days have elapsed and also inform him or her of the provisions of Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution <Col N="1004" /> relating to the making of a complaint to the High Court that a person is unlawfully detained.</P>
    <P>A person committed to await surrender may be released as a result of a successful application under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution or as a result of an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court or if the surrender and conveyance out of the State of the person is unduly delayed, as indicated in section 21 &mdash; this is usual in extradition law &mdash; or if subsequent information satisfies the Minister that the person's surrender is prohibited by the Act.  If the person is not released he or she will, under section 14, be surrendered to a person authorised to receive him or her by the international tribunal that requested his or her surrender or by the state in which the person is to undergo imprisonment for an international tribunal crime.</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisions to accord precedence for requests from an international tribunal. A request from an international tribunal for the surrender of a person will have primacy over requests for the extradition or arrest and delivery of the person under the Extradition Act of 1965 whether the offence in question in the extradition request constitutes an international tribunal crime, as section 7 of the Bill provides. Section 4 provides that an application for asylum in the State by a person being sought by a tribunal will not prevent or postpone the surrender of the person.</P>
    <P>In the event of a request being received for the surrender of a person who is serving a sentence imposed by a court in this jurisdiction, he or she may be surrendered on the Minister receiving adequate undertakings that the person will be returned here in due course to serve or complete the sentence imposed by the Irish court.  Section 25 also makes provision that such a person will continue to be liable to complete any term of imprisonment here when he or she has been returned.</P>
    <P>Section 27 requires the Director of Public Prosecutions, before deciding to commence any proceedings under the State's extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of conduct constituting an international tribunal crime, to take into account the jurisdiction of any international tribunal. Where an international tribunal makes a request to the Minister that a court or military tribunal here defer to the jurisdiction of the tribunal by discontinuing proceedings here, section 28 provides that the Minister shall transmit that request to the High Court and if the proceedings are being taken under the State's extra-territorial jurisdiction in relation to conduct which constitutes an international tribunal crime, the High Court may order the proceedings to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>It may be that a person who is in the State and is the subject of a request for his or her surrender made by an international tribunal has committed crimes in the State that do not amount to crimes within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  If that is <Col N="1005" /> the case, the Minister may postpone under section 20 the period for the making of a surrender order to enable criminal proceedings in the State to be instituted against the person.  In deciding whether to postpone surrender in these circumstances the Minister will take into account the seriousness of the crimes committed here.  If such a person is tried here, found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, it would, of course, be open to the Minister to order his or her surrender under the Bill on an undertaking that he or she would be returned here in due course to serve the sentence imposed by the Irish court.</P>
    <P>Section 26 contains the usual provision, found in general extradition law, forbidding surrender where final judgment in respect of an offence has been passed here or in another state on the person sought by a tribunal and the conduct constituting the offence also constitutes the international tribunal crime for which his or her surrender is sought.  However, unlike our general extradition law, this prohibition will not apply where the tribunal satisfies the Minister that the proceedings in the other State were, in effect, a sham, designed to shield the person from international criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>Various forms of assistance in aid of a tribunal's investigation and prosecution of war crimes are provided for in Part IV of the Bill. Section 29 provides that section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, shall have effect as if references in that section to drug trafficking included references to conduct constituting an international tribunal crime.  Thus a member of the Garda Síochána may apply to the District Court for an order for the production to a member of the Garda Síochána of material by the person who appears to the judge to be in possession of the material.  Broadly, the application may be made where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a specified person has been guilty of an international tribunal crime and that the material is likely to be of substantial value to the investigation of the crime and that it is in the public interest that the material should be produced.</P>
    <P>Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is in any place evidence in relation to the commission of the international tribunal crime, section 30 provides for the issue of search warrants by the District Court authorising entry, search and seizure.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides, following the receipt by the Minister of an order from an international tribunal, for the making by the High Court, of orders for the preservation and protection of property or for the restitution of property unlawfully taken by a person convicted of an international tribunal crime.  In effect, the section applies various provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, with necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Section 32 enables privileges, immunities, exemptions, etc., to be accorded to the personnel of a tribunal and to witnesses and counsel appearing before a tribunal, and section 33 deals with <Col N="1006" /> the transit through the State of a person who is being transported in custody from one state to another for the purposes of an international tribunal.</P>
    <P>Part V creates an offence of interfering with or intimidating an international tribunal witness and, as I have mentioned already, enables regulations to be made applying the arrangements set out in the Bill with necessary modifications to any other tribunal or court established by the United Nations for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed outside the State.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the setting up of an international criminal court.  Members may be aware that a United Nations diplomatic conference on the establishment of an international criminal court was held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July last.  That conference adopted a statute to set up an international criminal court.  I believe that the reaching of an agreement to set up such a court represents a major development in international efforts to deal with the perpetrators of the most heinous crimes of concern to the international community given that such an initiative has been mooted in the United Nations for almost 50 years.  Events in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia which led to the establishment of the two <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals on the subject of this Bill had the effect of reviving interest in the establishment of a permanent court.  Ireland has always been a strong supporter of setting up a permanent international criminal court and was represented at the Rome conference.  The statute will establish the court as an independent international organisation. It will have a relationship agreement with the United Nations and will have its seat in The Hague.  The crimes which are listed as coming within the immediate jurisdiction of the court are genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  The statute provides that the crime of aggression will also come within the jurisdiction of the court when a definition for that crime is adopted at a future review conference.  The statute will enter into force when 60 states have ratified it.  Ireland signed the statute at a ceremony organised by the Italian Government on Wednesday last, 7 October.  I understand that as of now a total of 53 states have signed the statute. We will continue to support the efforts of the international community to ensure that the court is effective and independent.</P>
    <P>This Bill honours an important international humanitarian obligation and furthermore it is a positive indication of the repugnance we feel at the genocidal atrocities that were inflicted on countless innocent men, women and children in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  It is also a demonstration of our willingness to do all we can to ensure that the perpetrators of those heinous crimes are brought to justice.  I will follow the debate carefully and will take full account of all Members' contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to participate in this debate.  The legislation was drafted by the previous Government in early 1997 and published by the current Government later that year.  It passed Second Stage in the Dáil last April and is rather late coming to this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister made many remarks &mdash; I will be repeating some of them in my contribution &mdash; in relation to the delays by the Rwanda tribunal and the tribunal governing crimes in the former Yugoslavia in getting off the ground.  If member states who are party to this agreement do not ratify it and pass the necessary legislation with speed obviously the tribunals cannot function.  It is only effective if all the countries party to the agreement carry out their obligations &mdash; to ensure no country becomes a safe haven for anybody wanted for questioning or indictment by any of the special courts.</P>
      <P>I regret that we are not dealing with legislation for the ratification of the International Criminal Court which was agreed in Rome on 17 July and to which we are party.  The Minister stated that the permanent international criminal court will deal with crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression.  It will remain always and potential perpetrators will be aware of its existence unlike the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which we are talking about now.  My regret is that after two months the Government has not drafted the legislation in order that Ireland can ratify it.  Sixty countries are required to ratify this agreement before it comes into force.  Ireland &mdash; and we have a very good record in this area &mdash; should be one of the first countries to enact the necessary legislation to ensure we are among the first to ratify the agreement. It may take up to two years before 60 national legislatures ratify it.  Let us not wait two years; let us perhaps not wait until the end of this session to put this legislation on the Statue Book. I am sure such legislation will not be controversial in either House.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council passed a resolution on 8 November 1994 establishing a tribunal for Rwanda.  The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established as a separate entity with trial judges, a registry system and administrative staff.  The chief prosecutor and appeals judges perform the same functions for the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>The Security Council decided on the jurisdiction of the international tribunal and national courts.  One issue in regard to jurisdiction is that of capital punishment.  The Government of Rwanda does and will impose the death penalty while the UN International Tribunal will not.  I am delighted about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statute of the Rwanda tribunal obliges all states to comply without delay &mdash; this has been my criticism &mdash; with any request by the tribunal for assistance in locating, detaining or transferring persons and to have the necessary legislation in place by which that can be done.  However, the rules of the tribunal made it difficult to promptly issue requests for detention or transfer of suspects. <Col N="1008" /> Orders and warrants for the arrest, detention, surrender or transfer of persons cannot be issued until the prosecutor satisfies a tribunal judge that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists and the judge confirms the indictment.  These are part of the delays within the mechanisms of the court which have led to an enormous amount of international criticism in relation to the pace with which the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has proceeded.  This greatly delays the issuing of detention orders, allowing the principal suspects to flee the refugee camps and disappear.  The co-operation of countries hosting fugitive suspects is also essential.  Critics could quote the example of Cameroon, a neighbouring West African country which held within its borders 12 prime suspects and refused in 1994 to extradite them.  It took enormous efforts and several visits to the capital of Cameroon by the court registrar before Cameroon agreed to surrender the suspects.  That is another example of the kind of problems which the tribunal has encountered.</P>
    <P>The tribunal's focus is limited to senior leaders of the former Government, the military and militia. Falling outside that focus are tens of thousands of cases up for consideration by the Rwandan Government, Judiciary and society.  The Commission of Experts decided the international tribunal should be located at The Hague to give some distance from where the worst atrocities had been perpetrated, for greater independence, objectivity and impartiality.  Most of the senior perpetrators had fled the country complicating the problem of detaining them for investigation and prosecution.  The reports of the Commission of Experts did not address the issue of locating and detaining potential defendants.  That has been a major shock to the workings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>As of January 1998, there were only 28 indictments, as the Minister mentioned in his speech. Of those defendants, almost all are in custody in Arusha, Tanzania, where the prosecutor's office is located.  Many others remain at large in neighbouring African countries; we believe quite a number are in the United States of America and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt with a recent judgment in Taba.  He did not give the name of the person sentenced but I think he was referring to the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu who was Mayor of Taba at the time of the genocide.  This man stood accused of at least ten counts of genocide and crimes against humanity which included inciting Hutus to attack their Tutsi neighbours, rape and other horrible crimes.  His trial started &mdash; and I hope it has concluded &mdash; in October 1996.  The proceedings were postponed for the remainder of 1996 after the opening of the trial and remained adjourned in 1997.  I am delighted if at long last a judgment has been delivered in that particularly atrocious case.</P>
    <P>The Rwandan Judiciary was decimated, making it difficult to deal with the huge domestic case load.  However, human rights organisations like <Col N="1009" /> Amnesty International and others argue that defendants who will be tried in national courts should receive due process and be given an early trial.  If they do not get an early trial they should be released because, given the huge backlog in the Rwandan courts, it cannot be foreseen how long it would take to deal with the hundreds of cases involved; it would take years, at the very least.  That position is absolutely unsustainable. One can sympathise with the position of human rights organisations which say that everyone has a right to an early as well as a fair trial.  If one is not guaranteed an early trial one should be promised early release.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem for the international community in assisting the Rwandan authorities to put in place a judicial system which would deal expeditiously with these cases.  Many people have argued in favour of having foreign jurists serve as observers and advisers as well as judges, lawyers and investigators within the Rwandan legal system for the period of the national trials, which will be a long time.</P>
    <P>The Rwandan case provides an argument for speed above all else.  Delays in indictments, arrests, extradition and prosecution allow those who are guilty and bent on vengeance time to regroup for further violence.  The accused have jumped borders, seeking asylum abroad &mdash; which they have been granted &mdash; and recruiting manpower in the refugee camps in Zaire.  Major General Augustin Bizimungu, the former regime's military commander, waited in Zaire openly organising former Rwandan military and militia in the refugee camps with impunity.  The where-abouts of many of the planners and leaders of the Rwandan genocide, as well as journalists responsible for the hate media, remain largely unknown, including some of the genocide's political leaders and Robert Kajuga, who was head of the Interahamwe militia.</P>
    <P>While the international community responded to the Rwandan request for an international tribunal, there has been little pressure placed on the UN to ensure that it accelerates its work.  The Minister gave us some positive indications in that regard but the progress of the international tribunal has been characterised by slowness and an inability to act.</P>
    <P>One suggestion to address the backlog in indictments and cases in the Rwandan tribunal is to establish a truth commission to operate in tandem with the tribunal.  Justice would be served with regard to the organisers of the genocide and others who participated would be named and their crimes would be exposed.  The success of the international tribunal in Rwanda will have a significant impact on any eventual peace process as the party line in the Rwandan Government remains &ldquo;no reconciliation until justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Turning to the former Yugoslavia, as long ago as 25 May 1993 the UN Security Council created the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of <Col N="1010" /> International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.  That tribunal sits, as has been stated, in the Hague and consists of 11 judges from 11 countries, divided into two trial chambers and an appellate chamber.</P>
    <P>This tribunal is novel on two counts.  It is the first time the United Nations is trying those accused of war crimes where there has not been a clear military victory, and it is also the first time in which the principal accused parties remain major participants &mdash; although behind the scenes &mdash; in the ongoing peace process.  The Dayton Accords barred anyone indicted by the tribunal from seeking or holding a public office or position in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although that has not been observed at all times.</P>
    <P>The international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has faced tenuous financial circumstances throughout its existence as funding is held hostage by the General Assembly.  Although established under the Security Council's Chapter VII peace enforcement mandate, funding for the tribunal was to come from the UN's regular budget rather than its peacekeeping budget.  The tribunal's 1994 budget was $11 million.</P>
    <P>However, there has been an ongoing debate about the funding of the tribunal for offences committed in the former Yugoslavia, in addition to the ongoing debate about the funding for the Rwanda tribunal.  The Minister provided a figure today in the region of $63 million which is to cover both tribunals.  It is estimated the Yugoslav tribunal will take almost two-thirds of that budget.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing debate between the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations about from where adequate funding for these tribunals should come.  The United Nations has very serious financial difficulties, but it is a great pity there has been such a long debate about funding for such an important matter.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House welcome this legislation, although it was late in coming to the House, and we will not be placing any obstacles in the way of its passage.  However, I appeal to the Minister to return as speedily as possible to the issue of the permanent international court for trying these offences.  That was agreed at the end of the United Nations diplomatic conference in Rome last July, at which this country was a very willing party.  Ireland has long been a promoter of the idea of a permanent court to try these offences.  I hope the Minister will be ready to bring the legislation before both Houses before the end of the year so that we can speedily enact it, enabling Ireland to be one of the first of the 60 countries which are required to bring it into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  Busy Ministers who are working on huge pieces of legislation are often not commended enough. Members may not be aware that 48 Bills have been through the Houses of the Oireachtas since <Col N="1011" /> the Government took office and 16 of them &mdash; one third &mdash; were introduced by this Minister, who is engaged in the most massive reform of the criminal and civil law in the history of the State. That must be emphasised because not enough people are aware of it or want to acknowledge it, for various reasons.  However, I commend him for it and I laud him for his huge commitment to his portfolio, which is one of the most controversial, complex and difficult areas in modern life, not only in Ireland but internationally.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it sets out to implement UN resolutions establishing war crime tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to which the Minister and Senator Connor referred.  I agree with a number of points raised by Senator Connor.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that Ireland takes every step necessary to ensure this country never becomes a haven for anyone guilty of war crimes.  It is unfortunate and regrettable, however, that the international action to which this Bill is giving legal status comes in the wake of the slaughter of more than one million people, most of whom met their deaths in unspeakably savage circumstances.  The reports we have received since the beginning of the decade, and more recent reports from Kosovo, depict scenes of unbelievable savagery visited on men, women and children of a depth and scale which challenge human comprehension.</P>
      <P>The perpetrators of these vile deeds must be brought to justice quickly.  Senator Connor rightly emphasised this.  If they are not, the moral force and authority of UN resolutions will not have the effect of safeguarding and protecting people from further breaches and atrocious violations of international humanitarian law.  That point, which I wish to emphasise and fully support, was strongly and forcefully made by Senator Connor.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that the appropriate authorities here must be equipped with the legal means to apprehend, arrest, detain and surrender persons found in the State who are wanted by the tribunals. That is the main purpose of the Bill, as the Minister articulated this afternoon.  Everybody who supports human rights will also fully support efforts internationally to bring to justice those guilty of war crimes.  While I welcome and applaud decisions to establish these two tribunals &mdash; the 1993 international tribunal for former Yugoslavia and the 1994 international criminal tribunal for Rwanda &mdash; and the UN's response to reports from commissions of experts who concluded that abominable war crimes, including arbitrary arrests, rape, pillage, torture, mass killings, ethnic cleansings and genocide were widespread in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, I am far from satisfied that the UN and the international community generally acted quickly enough or with the necessary determination, force and effectiveness to confront the depth and scale of the atrocities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there was a clear acknowledgement that the situation unfolding constituted a threat to <Col N="1012" /> international peace and security and that there was an expressed determination to bring to justice those responsible, it is blatantly obvious to any observer, even one with only the slightest regard or concern for international human rights, that the workings of the tribunals to date have been far from successful, particularly in confronting the magnitude and depth of the atrocities.</P>
    <P>One of the best known names in the most atrocious sense, Radovan Karadic, who was declared an international war crimes criminal, is still at large.  To my knowledge, the authorities in this part of Europe do not know where he is, let alone trying to apprehend and bring him to justice. Until those most powerful and obnoxious symbols of what took place are apprehended and brought before the tribunal or the international criminal court to which the Minister referred, we cannot say with any degree of conviction that these international tribunals are successful.  To me, Radovan Karadic, is one of the most potent symbols of these obnoxious and abhorrent set of regimes.</P>
    <P>It took four years for the tribunal on former Yugoslavia to convict its first suspect, although, as the Minister informed us, there have been further developments since.  I welcome the progress since then which the Minister reported in relation to the working of the tribunals.  These tribunals, however, are not even scratching at the surface of the magnitude, scale and depth of the problem.  Indeed, the workings of both tribunals appear to me to be lacking so blatantly in force and effectiveness, they are having little obvious effect in deterring ongoing human rights violations.  One example is the highly arbitrary system of justice in Rwanda where there are massive detentions on grounds of alleged genocide. I am not in a position to say whether the alleged genocide is well founded but massive detentions are the order of the day there and the international community seems content to ignore the fact that Rwanda is incapable &mdash; to which Senator Connor referred &mdash; in terms of its expertise, resources and, indeed, commitment to operate the due process in an objective, fair and expeditious manner, even taking account of the culture in that part of the world.  Reports from there of the most appallingly inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners &mdash; one rarely hears me championing the cause of prisoners in this jurisdiction &mdash; are of equal concern to all concerned about human rights as are the atrocities and genocide which preceded these developments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to trivialise the difficulties of dealing with extremely complex situations in this case, for example, Tutsi led rule of Hutus followed on ethnic cleansing by Hutus.  That is an extremely complex situation.  The vicious spiral of slaughter and counter-slaughter continues and will continue in the absence of ethnic reconciliation. There can be no prospect of ethnic reconciliation given the situation on the ground and <Col N="1013" /> until there is significant and widespread international intervention.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be long on analysis and short on solutions when it comes to conflict resolutions of intense complexity, particularly where there are ethnic differences and hostilities which have festered, in some cases, for many decades and centuries. It is an undeniable and inescapable fact that these tribunals, far from achieving the objective of bringing the many perpetrators to justice, appear to have been dogged by corruption &mdash; allegations, in certain cases &mdash; bureaucratic incompetence and lack of international political will.  It is this lack of political international will which is to be condemned and unpardonable. Invariably, it is motivated by political or, more likely, economic considerations.  We, as parliamentarians, need to articulate those concerns.</P>
    <P>Anybody who takes an interest in current affairs knows that when a powerful nation sees its economic interests seriously threatened in a country where conflict arises, that nation takes or calls for swift decisive action.  We do not have to look back any further than Kuwait where swift decisive action was taken.  Conflict resolution was engaged in and that was the end of the story. Some, including parliamentarians, are of the view that further action should have been taken and that Sadam Hussein should have been taken captive. I will not go into that argument but I am merely making the point, which stands on its own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not over-estimate human rights in Kuwait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We will let the point stand on its own.</P>
      <P>It is equally unpardonably true that these same world economic interests can invoke the paralysis of complexity or disagreement about the nature of intervention in the service of self-interest.  They may also move in another direction.  When it suits their political or economic interests not to move, they will say there is no consensus and a situation is too complex.  The world is littered with recent examples.  I could refer to subjects popularised by Senator Norris such as East Timor and Tibet and to British arms sales to Iraq and so on.  I already referred to Kuwait.</P>
      <P>Sadly, Kosovo is the current most newsworthy example of where political considerations caused paralysis, it is a further example of President Milosevic's cynical disregard for human rights and brazen contempt for international concern and outrage at his actions.  This man has strung the international community, the United Nations and even NATO along over a number of years with a litany of broken promises.  He was able to exploit political inertia because he had the devious ability to read in their numerous pronouncements the politics of fudge and the diplomacy of the politically paralysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as a country and member of the international community, must face some most unpalatable facts.  The catastrophe in Kosovo is an <Col N="1014" /> inevitable consequence of UN and international failure to take on Milosevic and his fellow travellers when the advance warning signals were flashing bright red.  Hundreds have been slaughtered and tens of thousands have been left homeless in this southern Serbian province of the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Returning to the two tribunals, they appear to be incapable of dealing with the enormity of the task which the UN resolution constituted them to undertake.  The reported breakthrough over the past 24 hours in the discussions with Milosevic is certainly welcome, but every supporter of human rights hopes desperately that it will lead to a permanent peace in Kosovo.  People with those concerns are also concerned that we have not yet passed the post and that there is still a long way to go.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that what is urgently required is an international criminal court, as promoted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and by previous Governments.  We have listened to pronouncements and witnessed posturings in this direction for many years.  It is time all nations concerned with the upholding of international humanitarian law set aside sectional self-interest and put such an independent prosecution system in place on a permanent basis and with structures which would enable it to take on and confront atrocities of the magnitude we have witnessed in recent years.  This action is an essential first step to give a profoundly new and unambiguous signal to all those who ignore human rights that the rest of the world will no longer tolerate their inhumanity, ethnic cleansing, pillaging and mass displacement and dislodgement of large numbers of peoples and groups.  That message must be clearly and unambiguously sent to the world community.  Anything which has happened recently has not sent that message.  Consequently, ethnic cleansing, genocide and massive dislodgement of people is continuing apace.</P>
    <P>However, it is a heartening and significant development that the statute to establish such an international criminal court was adopted at a conference in Rome last July.  I understand that when this is up and running, there will no longer be a need for further <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals.  I concur fully with Senator Connor's point that we need to move quickly from the idea of such tribunals which are well intentioned but lack the financial, political and legal muscle to confront the magnitude of the problem in a swift, effective and forceful way.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this important Bill.  It is a clear and unambiguous statement of the State's determination to give priority to facilitating the work of current and future international war crimes tribunals.  Section 7 is one of the many important elements of the Bill.  It gives primacy to a request from an international tribunal for the surrender of a person over requests for the extradition or arrest and delivery of the person under the Extradition Act, 1965.  Section 4 will prevent a person sought by a <Col N="1015" /> tribunal from frustrating the workings of the tribunal by invoking the device of applying for political asylum.  Section 25 is most important.  It provides for the surrendering of a person who is serving a sentence imposed by our courts once the Minister of the day receives an adequate undertaking that the person will be returned in due course to serve the remainder of their sentence.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the many reservations I and others have about the effectiveness of the tribunals to date, it is imperative that the State fulfils its international humanitarian obligations.  We must send a clear and potent message to all perpetrators and would be perpetrators of genocidal atrocities of the abhorrence and repugnance with which we regard their vile deeds.  Our actions must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate our utter determination to do everything to bring them to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  However, I am not sure how practical it is in terms of the establishment of these two tribunals and I regret that it is part of an <i>ad hoc</i> process.  In terms of its practicality, it deals principally with the surrender of war criminals, assistance in investigations, etc. Luckily, Ireland has succeeded in remaining marginal to these issues, although it is possible that a war criminal might slip into the country and would have to be arrested and sent back to stand trial.  The Bill includes much legal machinery, including an examination of the hierarchy of requests in terms of which extradition request takes precedence.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill's importance is related to the signal it sends that the international community is gearing itself up to deal in some measure with the issue of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  The principle rather than the practical effectiveness of the Bill should legitimately concern the House.  Therefore, I, in common with other speakers, intend to consider more centrally the issue of an international criminal court.</P>
      <P>I placed on the Order Paper two motions &mdash; one of which regrettably no longer appears on it &mdash; on this subject. The reason one of the motions is gone is probably that it urged a particular attitude and approach by the Government at the Rome conference in July.  I am glad the Government took that approach.  It is important that the Bill strengthens the principle of responsibility and the point that senior political figures cannot escape responsibility for their crimes.  This should also apply to senior military personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to Mr. Karadic.  I presume Mr. Mladic would also be involved.  Senator Fitzgerald suggested that people did not know where they were, but that is not the case.  The extraordinarily cynical point is that people knew where they were but, because of what they know about the Machiavellian dealings in that area, their arrest would be as embarrassing to some of their <Col N="1016" /> accusers as themselves.  That is a weakness in the international community.  There are a number of mechanisms by which interested parties can weaken such a court and tribunal and one must be concerned about that aspect.</P>
    <P>In terms of the strength of tribunals, the United Nations bears the expense of the tribunals and levies contributions on member states.  This suggests to me once more that this type of apparatus might be vulnerable to starvation of funds if sufficient major powers were interested in frustrating the activities of tribunals.  I do not know a way round it; I am only pointing to a weakness.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Rwanda tribunal delivered its verdict in the case of the former Rwandan Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda.  I note that the Minister referred to the judgment given on 2 September last in which genocide as defined in the Geneva Convention, 1948, was interpreted for the first time by an international court.  This is an extremely important point.  Perhaps the material was too lengthy but it would be useful if the significant elements of the definition were placed on the record of the House.  If the Minister has that at his disposal, perhaps he could put it on the record in his reply.  The interpretation is important because it is central to the issue.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the rape of the Tutsi women.  Tragically, mass rape appears to have become a political instrument.  I will not deal with that matter in detail because it will be more effectively dealt with by my distinguished colleague, Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the debate in the other House where it was stated that the absence of a permanent international criminal court made it impossible to try Pol Pot.  Many Members spoke passionately in favour of the establishment of such a court.  The Minister said he understood the establishment of a further <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to deal with the perpetrators of the atrocities in Kampuchea was raised at the UN earlier this year but left aside on the basis that the international criminal court due to be established following the successful negotiations earlier this year would be in a position to bring to justice the perpetrators of atrocities in various parts of the world.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister is misinformed and it is important that he is made aware of this.  Perhaps I have misinterpreted the position and I am open to correction, but I understand that under the draft statute adopted in July the principle of non-retrospectivity has been accepted.  This is a fundamental principle of the statute to which 53 nations agreed.  Therefore, it cannot apply retrospectively and, ironically, we are starting from a legal year zero.  We should not fool ourselves into thinking that the Khmer Rouge regime can be dealt with under this legislation.  Some other mechanism must be found, but the Minister may have a different view.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of points to put the tribunals and the international criminal court, which I would prefer, in context.  We always say &ldquo;never again&rdquo;.  The notion of an international <Col N="1017" /> court and such tribunals originated in this century at Nuremberg.  People said then &ldquo;never again&rdquo;, but as our former President, Mary Robinson, pointed out in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, we have been saying &ldquo;never again&rdquo; during a period when these types of atrocities have continued to repeat themselves.  This happens largely because leading figures have managed to get away with their crimes and have protected themselves from any responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>The main activity of the international community has been to impose sanctions, embargoes or, occasionally, collective military force in response the most serious atrocities against humanity.  However, as we saw in Iraq, such actions can often inflict greater harm on innocent civilians.  An example is the large number of children in Iraq who suffer because of the embargo affecting medical supplies.</P>
    <P>The idea of this kind of court dates back to the 19th century.  In 1872, Gustave Moynier, one of the founders of the International Committee of the Red Cross, proposed a permanent court in response to the Franco-Prussian war.  After the First World War, there were calls to try the Kaiser and his general staff.  A court was established in Nuremberg and Tokyo after the Holocaust. In 1947, the French representative to the UN Committee on the Progressive Development of the International Law and its Codification proposed the establishment of an international criminal court.  That was in 1947, over 50 years ago.  In 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted a Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  It called for criminals to be tried by such international penal tribunals as may have jurisdiction, which was so vague that very little was to happen for a long time.  Separately, members asked the International Law Commission to study the possibility of establishing an international criminal court.  The ILC studied this for five years between 1949 and 1954, but it was held up by the lack of definition of the kind to which the Minister referred in his speech and for which I have sought clarification.  On this occasion, it was the definition of aggression.  In 1993, the establishment of a temporary tribunal for Bosnia-Herzegovina strengthened discussions for a permanent court.  In 1994, the Security Council established a second temporary tribunal, this time for Rwanda.</P>
    <P>I sound two notes of caution.  Although we appear to be travelling in the direction of holding these people responsible, there have been significant backward steps.  In December 1997, the United Kingdom defected from the position of other Security Council members and backed the Singapore compromise proposal to limit Security Council authority over the court.  This year, on 26 March 1998, in a letter to the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, US Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Jesse Helms, declared in the United States Senate that the international criminal court would be dead on arrival unless the United States was given control of veto over the <Col N="1018" /> court.  The House should be aware that our friends, the Americans, decided they would do their best to sabotage the international court unless they had a veto over it.</P>
    <P>In what circumstances would they use it?  In last week's <i>Sunday Independent,</i> a person called George Dempsey, a diplomat who was employed by the Americans in Dublin, questioned our right to raise difficulties about the American use of landmines, a human rights issue.  He also queried and complained about the attitude of the Irish people and Government to the situation in East Timor, a classic case of genocide.  Presumably there was a degree of commercial interest on the Americans' part in this.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is the issue of cultural sensitivities of different countries.  In some countries, for example, it is regarded as perfectly permissible to treat women in a degrading and disgusting fashion, such as female circumcision and the exclusion by the Taliban of women from hospitals, education, etc.  In Iran, a country with which we have friendly diplomatic relations and to which we hope to sell a good deal of beef, there have been a number of recent significant developments.  One is the strengthening of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie by elements within Iran.  Another is an attempt to execute a German businessman on the grounds that he had consensual sexual relations with an Iranian woman and he was not a Moslem.  This may not fit into the category of war crimes but it suggests a very different cultural context in which human rights are viewed.  There will be great difficulty in getting agreement across a broad spread of countries to pursue human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of Amnesty International which has lobbied for this kind of legislation and gone further and lobbied for the kind of international criminal court about which many Members spoke this afternoon.  I note from material received from it that it has tested the proposed international court against 16 fundamental principles which it enunciated before the draft statute was produced.  I will list some of them.  One is that the court should have jurisdiction over the crime of genocide.  Obviously it will have that.  Another is that it should have jurisdiction over other crimes against humanity. It has, but Amnesty points out that the threshold which must be crossed before the court may exercise its jurisdiction is too high and that some of the definitions of the crimes are not consistent with international law.  Another is that the court should have jurisdiction over serious violations of humanitarian law in international and non-international armed conflicts.  It has jurisdiction over them but again the definition of crimes is, in some cases, narrower than those in international treaties and there are high thresholds before the court can exercise its powers.  The Minister is probably aware of the other points made by Amnesty International, so I will leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  My party supports the legislation which demonstrates the determination of the people to co-operate fully and in every respect with the international tribunals in their efforts and attempts to bring to justice the perpetrators of some of the most appalling crimes which have been committed against humanity this century, if not ever.</P>
      <P>If it were not for television, it may well be that the international community would never be fully appraised of the utter horror, sheer evil and depravity of the crimes under discussion this evening and which have given rise to the setting up of the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals under consideration in the legislation.  We often decry the fact that television sometimes cheapens values held by the last generation and which we would like to perpetuate in the next.  However, we must pay tribute to television for the manner in which it has opened the eyes of the world to the atrocities of which we speak.</P>
      <P>The legislation sends a strong signal to the perpetrators of the atrocities which have been so vividly described this afternoon that there will be no shelter, safe haven or refuge within our shores for them and that we will co-operate fully in the manner laid out in the legislation to ensure such people, if they do find themselves here, will be surrendered in accordance with the legislation without delay or remorse.</P>
      <P>I hope the conviction, sincerity and passion of this debate will communicate the will of the Irish people to square up to these issues with a new set of urgencies, resolve and determination.  It has been sad to witness the delay and ambivalence about establishing systems to bring to justice the perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and some of the most heinous crimes ever perpetrated against humanity.</P>
      <P>Our consciences have been stirred to the core by what we have seen in Rwanda.  The planned rape of Tutsi women has been one of the most depraved acts in history.  It is difficult if not impossible to estimate the impact which this has had, and will continue to have, on an innocent community.  Dealing with this issue will be as complex as the issue itself.  The culture and tradition of Rwanda and its neighbours does not make it easy for tribunals to operate or for the perpetrators of heinous crimes to be brought to justice.  Nonetheless, this should not mean that our efforts are not intensified.  This situation must be tackled with urgency.  What is done is done and the damage is irreversible.  Two things must now take place, the criminals responsible must be brought to justice and initiatives must be taken to ensure that this never happens again.  The prevention of such depravity must be as important an item on the agenda of every right-minded country and the international community as the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Events in the former Yugoslavia have been a blemish on the conscience of Europe.  As Europeans we pride ourselves on being the inheritors of the great civilisations of Greece and Rome.  We <Col N="1020" /> expect a higher standard than was witnessed in the atrocities which took place in parts of the former Yugoslavia.  We support the initiative which has led to the agreement between the Serbs and the Kosovars.  I hope that this agreement will provide a breathing space to enable some permanent solution to be worked out during the next three years to ensure that the quarrel will be settled amicably and permanently so that this kind of atrocity cannot repeat itself.</P>
    <P>Adequate and proper protection must now be given to the thousands of Kosovars driven from their homes by the barbarity of the Serbs.  As they make their way home, hopefully to be settled in before the savagery of the winter adds to their hardship, they must not be intimidated by Serb soldiers acting cruelly.  I hope that civilian forces, backed by NATO, will ensure that the Kosovars will not be further intimidated as they make their way home.  What has happened in our back yard has been horrendous.</P>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald referred to the ambivalence in the international community.  The lack of will to act in accordance with principles of justice has been a feature of the international community to date.  Ireland has no agenda or ancient quarrel with any of those involved.  We carry no political baggage and have no economic self-interest in the region.  I hope that this will enable us to influence the international community to deal with these issues with greater speed and directness and a sense of justice and principle.</P>
    <P>This Bill is only a stop gap, but it is an important and essential measure.  I hope that the establishment of a permanent court of justice can be expedited and that it will be brought about with the minimum delay.  Unless and until this is done, we cannot say that the international community is responding effectively and efficiently to atrocities, particularly those in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister uses every opening and influence available to the Government to expedite the establishment of the permanent court.  We are dealing with very complex issues which will take time to resolve.  We have seen the difficulties encountered by Mary Robinson on simpler human rights issues.  So many countries are entrenched in bad practices and evil and depraved ways of dealing with those they deem to be their enemies.</P>
    <P>I hope that Ireland, as a country with a fairly good record, will be a major driving force in moving the agenda forward, so that procedures are put in place whereby those responsible for appalling atrocities are brought to justice.  Not alone will that ensure that justice is done, it will also act as a deterrent to tyrants who would seek to continue to carry out this kind of depravity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It would be impossible for the international criminal tribunals to operate without legislation such as this.  I share much of the concerns expressed by Senator Liam Fitzgerald about the workings of these tribunals, <Col N="1021" /> which have been extraordinarily slow.  The situation may have improved in the past year, but is important to remember that the first chair of the Yugoslavian tribunal, Judge Richard Goldstone, left his post in October 1996 because he was so deeply disillusioned with the manner in which the tribunal was progressing.  At a farewell lunch, he told journalists that if the tribunal was unable to do the job it was created to do, there was little point in keeping it going.  Although the situation may have improved somewhat since, Senator Liam Fitzgerald was correct in saying that the lack of political will has been all too obvious.</P>
      <P>I am very cheered by the fact that Ireland is making a bigger financial contribution than is necessary.  I do not think the importance of obtaining forensic evidence for these tribunals is fully recognised.  Many problems have occurred because forensic evidence has not been made available to the tribunals.  The fact that mass graves have, for example, remained undug has prevented the collection of necessary evidence.</P>
      <P>When one considers the level of protest here at the failure of the IRA and other paramilitary groups to identify the graves of the disappeared, one must remember that a huge number of people have also disappeared in Yugoslavia and Rwanda whose bodies are lying in unmarked graves.  Their relatives have a right to expect the location of these bodies to be identified so that people can be given proper burials.</P>
      <P>I gather only 20 of the 185 members of the United Nations have, to date, introduced legislation regarding Yugoslavia, with only 11 having introduced legislation on Rwanda.  Senators Quill and Norris stated we should use moral authority to encourage other countries to introduce such legislation.  Without such legislation, the tribunals are unable to act if they find suspects within their boundaries.</P>
      <P>The international criminal court has been referred to by several Senators; I was delighted Ireland was so well represented in Rome when the legislation was being drafted.  I recall the Minister for Foreign Affair's speech to the UN General Assembly some weeks ago in which he expressed Ireland's fervent hope that the international criminal court would be set up in the near future.  I hope we will use our friendship with the US to encourage it to support the setting up of the court.  It was most unfortunate the US decided it would have to exercise a veto over the court if it came into existence.  It is always easier to listen to friends than to those with whom one is not on good terms and if we can encourage the US to change its views on participation in the international court, we should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue about which we should all be concerned is that this legislation is constitutional; I am sure those who drafted it have done their best to ensure this is so.  However, in some of the countries which introduced this legislation, there have unfortunately been cases where it has been found that the legislation did not comply with the constitutional requirements of that country.  The <Col N="1022" /> experience of the US Government offers a cautionary lesson.  Last year a Texan judge released an indicted Rwandan war criminal in spite of the fact that Congress had passed legislation similar to this Bill in 1995.  A retired minister of a Seventh Day Adventist Church who was indicted for orchestrating the massacre of hundreds of men, women and children who had sought refuge in his church was freed.  Even though our intentions might be honourable, I hope the Bill will stand the test of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>There are many less obvious things we can do to assist the tribunals.  I am aware there is a possibility of international jurists being involved with the tribunals.  If I may boast on behalf of my own constituency, Trinity College is, with the backing of the Government, sending books from its law schools to Arusha.  A library of material on human rights and humanitarian law was sent to Arusha and will be of use to prosecutors, defence lawyers and judges at the war crimes tribunal there.  That represents a constructive contribution towards bringing the perpetrators of genocide to justice and we should welcome it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said that I would deal with the situation regarding rape.  Once again, Ireland has made an effort in this area.  With the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Rape Crisis Centre has played a particularly important role in helping those in the former Yugoslavia to bring cases to the tribunal.  It is important to remember that this is the first time rape has been considered a war crime and a crime against humanity.  The number of complaints received from women who have to live in the same villages as their rapists is appalling.  I had the doubtful privilege of watching a film entitled &ldquo;Calling the Ghosts&rdquo; which was brought to Ireland by Valerie Hughes, Fr. John Feighery and other members of Ireland Action for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It depicted events in the Omarska prison camp where men and women were tortured and where women from various parts of Yugoslavia were systematically raped.  The kind of practical help which can be offered to people to bring cases to The Hague is very important.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on a slightly sour note. Some victims of human rights abuses, forced to flee their country because their lives are in danger, will make their way to our shores.  The 1996 Refugee Act has not been implemented and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has created its own guidelines which do not allow a proportion of asylum seekers the right to independently appeal a negative decision, in spite of the fact that this is required by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment.  While the war crimes tribunal legislation is very important regarding the surrender of indicted war criminals to the international tribunals, we must correct the faulty procedures currently operating in this State which could allow the victims of human rights abuses to be surrendered to the arms of their persecutors. Without the enforcement of the refugee <Col N="1023" /> legislation and its important safeguards, our human rights reputation internationally will be marred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to debate this Bill which can be a help in resolving some of the current problems.  I am glad that, even before passage of the Bill, we have paid our dues to setting up courts of international tribunal in Rwanda and Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>We talked about European civilisation and people's surprise that such atrocities should happen in Europe.  European civilisation is a myth.  We have seen some of the greatest war crimes being committed in Europe, be it in Germany, Hungary or Russia. We must give the lie to the idea that we are part of the most civilised area in the world.</P>
      <P>The only future is through the establishment of the international criminal court.  However, if the tribunals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda are not successful, the international community will not look very favourably at the setting up of the international criminal court in trying to protect people against crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  One hundred and twenty-two million dollars has been contributed to the cost of the tribunals, with the UN levying states.  However, sometimes imposing a levy is as far as it goes.  When one sees the amount of money owed by the US to the UN over the past number of years it is clear that levies do not count unless paid and there must be some means of ensuring this is done.</P>
      <P>The question was asked as to whether the UN is capable of establishing courts or if it can be successful.  The UN has been a very unsuccessful organ of world peace and its maintenance over the past number of years.  This can be traced back to the historical roots of the UN when, after the Second World War the Security Council took over the running of the UN.  The Security Council protected itself from getting involved in too many places because of the threat which existed in the context of the Cold War with Russia always balancing against the US.  The influence of both nations balanced against whatever else was happening in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal in Rwanda is not working simply because a sufficient number of international trial lawyers have not gone to Rwanda.  Three courts have been established.  I do not think there are sufficient judges and there definitely is an insufficient number of lawyers to deal with the problems in Rwanda.  The jails in Rwanda are full of people who have not yet been brought before the courts.  There are people in jail who may never be brought to court because it might be proved they were not involved in the genocide.  Many people in jail will escape before they are brought before the tribunal and this is the source of a huge problem in Rwanda.  Women and men have been incarcerated although an attempt is being made to get babies and young people out of the jails. <Col N="1024" /> Legislation was passed by the House providing that children should be isolated from the problems of war, but children are still involved and in Rwanda they are not being protected and remain in jail.  My information is that the tribunal on Rwanda is not working.</P>
    <P>I do not have as much information on the situation in Kosovo, but a very small number of cases &mdash; there have been 20 public indictments against 58 individuals &mdash; have come before the court.  To believe that only 58 individuals were involved in genocide in the former Yugoslavia is going against the balance of all truth.  In one very high profile case in Rwanda Jean Kambanda was jailed for life while the tribunal in Kosovo sentenced one person to five years' imprisonment for a genocidal crime.  How can anybody justify giving a five year sentence to somebody accused of genocide?  It might be said that the individual was not the leader of the pack.  However, it makes no difference whether he was the leader or not &mdash; he took part and killed people.  He received five years' imprisonment for this.  Another person is appealing a case at the tribunal in Kosovo.  This does not seem to provide justification for setting up a tribunal which costs about $57 million per year.</P>
    <P>The future of international tribunals and the international court which I hope will be set up depends solely on the success of the two tribunals now being held.  Today I received an article concerning Lebanon with a headline which says &ldquo;The only protection is knowledge&rdquo;.  Knowledge that an effective international court of justice will deal with people involved in genocide might prevent people from committing atrocities.  The world is strewn with cases of people not being brought to court for crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.  In Sudan, for example, the northern Government is trying to kill everybody in the south &mdash; there are not so many saints in the south either.  Some people say the people in the south are Christian, that they are &ldquo;our lads&rdquo;.  We must take into account the perception that if people are Christian they are good and if they are anything else they are bad.</P>
    <P>The public is more knowledgeable about what is happening in foreign parts than they were some years ago.  Missionaries, who are no longer acknowledged in Ireland, have done exceptionally good work in human rights, the establishment of proper means of communication, water, sewerage, etc.  We must not forget the work of NGOs, including Amnesty International, Trócaire, Oxfam, Concern, GOAL, etc., and the number of people who have gone to live in very difficult situations.  They have been a help and are bringing back to Ireland the knowledge that the world is not like it is here.  The Garda and Army have gone abroad.  Sometimes politicians are denigrated for not doing things, but they have been listening, watching and seeing what goes on.</P>
    <P>This legislation is extremely welcome.  It is necessary and enables Ireland to fulfil its obligations to co-operate.  I hope it will not be too <Col N="1025" /> long before we return to discuss the extension of the provisions of the Bill to facilitate the establishment of an international criminal court.  Somebody said such legislation could not be retrospective. I do not think such a court could process cases retrospectively.</P>
    <P>With lawyers making so much money it is very difficult to get them to help in situations outside Ireland.  However, it is necessary for the legal profession to get involved and show more concern in international affairs such as the tribunals which have been established.  A huge number of people, because of their age had to retire from State posts, solicitors' offices or the Bar and I am sure a number of these people would help if asked.</P>
    <P>I again refer to the article on the Lebanon which states &ldquo;The only protection is knowledge&rdquo;. This I believe to be true.  If an emergency occurs there is no point theorising about what should be done, we should get in there and do the job.  In this sense, I believe this Bill will have an impact not alone on the Irish people but on the international community in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome this important legislation which will allow Ireland play its part, small though that may be, on the international stage. There should be no hiding place here for war criminals.  We must reflect on why such incidents happen worldwide and what we might do to change the opinions of some people.  Historically there have been many instances of genocide and war crimes.  There is no excuse for any of these crimes.  In this modern age with its advanced telecommunications, advanced education systems and under the United Nations regime, most nations are aware of what needs to be done to stop what is happening in places like Yugoslavia and Kosovo.  I believe the west is acting properly regarding what is happening in Yugoslavia and Kosovo at the moment.</P>
      <P>I spoke to someone recently who has some knowledge of what is going on in Serbia.  That person told me that if Slobodan Milosevic is &ldquo;taken out&rdquo; he will be replaced by even worse.  I asked how could that be the case and I was told that what is happening there is unbelievable.  I understand that Slobodan Milosevic has not got the support of all the Serbs in Serbia and that a significant body of opinion there opposes what he is doing.  Nevertheless, these horrific crimes are being committed.  President Clinton and NATO in particular are acting properly in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Historically the Balkans has been an area of great conflict between Christian and Muslim religions and for many centuries it has been the area where many vile acts have been carried out by both Christians and Muslims.  The root of this conflict is lack of respect and understanding for other traditions and peoples.  To any educated person in western society racial hatred and bigotry do not make sense.  Nevertheless, there are examples in our own country where we ought to have a more Christian outlook and be more prepared <Col N="1026" /> to accept foreigners and strangers in our midst.  As a nation many millions of our people emigrated over the years.  It saddens me that there is a minority opinion in this country which is concerned about the refugee crisis.  I received a letter today from one such person; I do not agree with the views of these people.  When I see economic refugees selling the <i>Big Issues</i> magazine in our towns and cities, I know there are Irish people in other countries in the same position. Throughout history Irish economic refugees have gone to the United Kingdom, Europe and America where they have been welcomed.  We ought to have more respect for economic refugees who come here.  If these people are found not to be genuine refugees they do not have an entitlement to stay in the country.  However, while they are in the country they should be treated with humanity and respect.  What has been happening to some of these people is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult problem for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I know the Minister has tried to tackle the problem as best he can with the resources available to him. However it is important that while these refugees are in the country they are treated well, particularly by the arm of the State with which they come in contact, such as the Garda and officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  These people should have special training to deal with the refugees and put them at their ease while the process of their refugee status is being put in train.  Refugees should be made to feel like proper human beings, treated with humanity and respect and, above all, with dignity.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill mentioned television and how in this modern age we are instantly informed about war crimes when they happen.  I believe this to be the case.  The role of the media in bringing world attention to crimes of genocide is instant and is to be welcomed.  However, the other side of the coin is that young children watch these images on television.  There is a case to be made for organisations such as RTÉ and TV3 not to show some of these dreadful clips at certain times of the day, particularly before the news at 9 p.m. While it is important that adults see some of these dreadful photographs and visual clips, it is equally important that young people, particularly children, do not see them.  The stories should be reported but it is wrong that children under the age of seven or nine should be exposed to these images, which even adults can find shocking.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill whereby Ireland will be seen to play its part in world crises.  Irish people abroad, particularly Irish missionaries, have done tremendous work for deprived communities in Africa and other areas.  For many generations missionary societies have sent young Irish men and women abroad &mdash; particularly the Irish Medical Missionaries of Mary in Drogheda &mdash; who have done wonderful work in the Third World to help bring about mutual understanding and respect.  At the end of the day it is all about respect and our society must reflect these values. <Col N="1027" /> The world community must insist on these values. This legislation will allow Ireland play its part, small though that may be, in this very important role on the international stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I particularly welcome the space given to the Minister under section 37 to recognise further and similar tribunals of this type.  The world has been taken aback in the last number of years by the imagery that comes into our sittingrooms at night.  It brings what is happening close to home.  In the late 1980s Senator Ryan and I were the first to raise the question of East Timor in this House. Some years ago a colleague who was teaching in a little known part of former Yugoslavia wrote to me about the problems of the ethnic group in what I now know to be Kosovo.  I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time and I found that Government and the succeeding Government to be very understanding of the needs in that area.  It is regularly being thrown in our faces that Ireland does not play its part in the important aspect of policing UN resolutions and decisions.  This Bill is a perfect example of how Ireland is doing that effectively and it is important for us to be seen to be supportive of that.  The influence of countries such as Ireland will eventually be of most significance.  What is happening around the world defies and beggars belief.  There was an article in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday about the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It is no different whether it is Afghanistan, Rwanda, or former Yugoslavia.  Man's inhumanity to man is time and time again emphasised, illustrated and obvious.  Humanity demands that we respond.</P>
      <P>It should raise the question of people's views on issues such as neutrality and sovereignty. Views and attitudes to neutrality have changed. There are greater demands on us as part of the international community than was the case decades ago.  Our traditional form of neutrality is no longer relevant.  Whereas it is important for us not to take sides it is equally important to monitor and involve ourselves in international judgments on activities of people, groups and regimes who act contrary to the global common good.</P>
      <P>Currently NATO are primed to act in the former Yugoslavia while the rest of the world has not made up its mind what it should do and people do not recognise what side they should take.  However, nobody wants the world to stand by.  The last time we stood by there was extraordinary criticism of the EU among others.  At the same time people do not want us creating wars. There should be international intervention, but not by NATO.  The UN should keep, enforce and police peace in various parts of the world by way of tribunals, such as those covered in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One half of the coin is missing.  We cannot have a situation where NATO is the enforcer and the UN provides police, courts and tribunals.  I read <Col N="1028" /> the recent contribution of the Minster of Foreign Affairs at the UN and a previous speech given there by former President, Mary Robinson.  The role of the UN needs to be strengthened so that our involvement in international activities, such as those in this welcome legislation, is matched by a UN authority in dealing with issues such as those currently being looked at in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The question of whether there should be intervention would be much easier for people to deal with it if were done by the international community acting as an international community and by people who represent all the groups in the world and not just the superpowers or those with big armies and major military forces.  This Bill is hugely important but it comes at the end of the process and we missed the beginning.  It deals carefully with issues such as people not being tried twice for the same offence The definition of &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; is wide ranging and for the purpose of operating internationally I presume it has been determined as such in other jurisdictions.  I reiterate my support for the legislation and welcome the fact that we are signing up to this important international development.</P>

      <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate.  It is an important Bill and I compliment them on the tone of the debate, which was very constructive and supportive.  It is important that Ireland is seen to be fully honouring its international commitments by bringing forward this legislation.  It is hard to find words which can express adequately the total abhorrence that must be felt by any right thinking person of the human misery and savagery inflicted on countless innocent men, women and children in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, I had the opportunity to view the devastation inflicted on Sarajevo during my recent visit to Bosnia and Croatia.  The Government fully applauds the efforts to bring to justice those who are responsible for the atrocities. When the Bill is enacted the appropriate authorities here will have the necessary legal mechanisms to arrest, detain and hand over persons found in the State who are wanted by the Yugoslav or Rwandan tribunals.  The work of both tribunals is succeeding in bringing evil perpetrators to justice.  It is hoped that many more indictments and prosecutions will be seen over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Yugoslav tribunal has been mandated by the UN to investigate the atrocities that have been committed by Serbs and Albanians since March in Kosovo and to bring those responsible to justice.  That was made clear in the resolution of 31 March and 23 September.  Under the agreement between Ambassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic reached in recent days, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Albanian side will be expected to co-operate with the Yugoslav tribunal in bringing to justice those responsible for the atrocities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> I am glad that since the publication of the Bill there was a successful conclusion to the Rome diplomatic conference held during the summer. A statute to establish a permanent international criminal court was adopted.  Ireland has already signed the statute, with 52 other countries.  The establishment of the court is an important development in bringing the international community closer in its efforts to tackle and bring to justice those who commit the most heinous crimes in various parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor referred to the financial problems of the Yugoslav tribunal and said the $65 million figure mentioned by me covered the Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals.  It does not, nor did I suggest that was the position.  The budget for the Yugoslav tribunal is $65 million while that for the Rwanda tribunal is $57 million.  Senator Norris expressed interest in details of the judgment given by the Rwanda tribunal on 2 September. Unfortunately, I regret that I do not have the details of it to hand.  He also referred to non-retro activity and seemed to suggest that any court or tribunal set up now could not deal with the atrocities committed in Cambodia.  That is not my understanding of the position.  The crimes in question &mdash; for example, genocide &mdash; are established under international law and are open to prosecution at any time.  The Yugoslav tribunal was established in 1993, but it can, of course, deal with crimes committed from 1991 onwards.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry and others referred to the situation regarding asylum seekers in Ireland.  It must be clear to everybody that this has no direct bearing on the legislation before the House.  Nonetheless it is important that we clear up misconceptions in relation to this matter.  As an interim measure, I approved administrative procedures for processing asylum claims and I ensured details of this were circulated to all Members.  These procedures, together with those sections of the Refugee Act which have been implemented, enable us to fulfil our duties.  Ireland has fulfilled its international obligations to persons in need of protection and it will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>A comparative study on the refugee legislation of Ireland and EU member states to be completed by the end of 1998 together with our experience to date are very important components in the review of the Refugee Act, 1996. There is a backlog of 6,252 applications for refugee status.  These must be examined before decisions can be taken on the future of the Refugee Act.</P>
    <P>In February 1998, officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the UNHCR and several Irish non-governmental organisations to discuss outstanding concerns regarding procedures.  On receiving the report of this meeting I agreed certain clarifications should be given and manifestly unfounded provisions should be amended to allow for a longer period in which to lodge an appeal and for an independent appeals mechanism.  The new arrangements follow the procedural provisions of the Refugee Act <Col N="1030" /> very closely; the new procedures reflect the philosophy behind the Refugee Act.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed regarding the length of time taken to process applications.  This concerned me when I took office.  Last year I obtained Government approval to employ an additional 72 staff to deal with the backlog of asylum cases and the ongoing intake of new asylum seekers.  In July 1998, I obtained Government permission to recruit an additional 72 staff for the asylum, immigration and citizenship areas.  At present almost 90 posts have been filled and the remainder will be filled in the coming months.</P>
    <P>On the issue of asylum seekers being treated properly, everything possible is done to ensure the human dignity of asylum seekers is respected at all times.  However, there is a distinction between a person who is found to be a refugee and entitled to asylum and a person who is found not to be a refugee.  A person who is found to be a refugee is granted asylum and given all rights due in accordance with the United Nations convention of 1951.  While the human dignity of a person who is found not to be a refugee is always respected, unfortunately he must leave the State.</P>
    <P>I have made arrangements to establish a one stop shop in Mount Street for asylum seekers. The new premises opened on 12 October.  At present it houses officials processing asylum applications, the appeals authorities, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Eastern Health Board's refugee unit.  In future it will also house the refugee legal service.</P>
    <P>On the matter of staff training and whether those processing applications are equipped to deal with the areas in question, all staff, including retired public service servants recruited as temporary contractors, have undergone training.  The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been involved in this training.  The issue of an appeals authority has also been dealt with. Some people have already been appointed and if more are required in the future they will be appointed.</P>
    <P>Our objective is to deal with applications as expediently as possible while ensuring great care is taken to ensure everybody gets a fair hearing. One has to accept the result of the process which is open, fair, transparent and accountable.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its mismanagement of the current <Col N="1031" /> crisis in farming and calls on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide adequate shipping infrastructure to transport the maximum number of weanlings and other livestock to the Continent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduce a fodder scheme that will address the shortage and cost of inadequate winter feed supplies on many Irish farms;</P>
    <P>&mdash;pay double headage to hill sheep farmers and seek a derogation for the sale and export of culled ewe carcasses such as has been approved for Scottish sheep producers;</P>
    <P>&mdash;extend the family income supplement to farmers and the self employed;</P>
    <P>&mdash;reduce the retention period for suckler cows;</P>
    <P>&mdash;instigate an immediate inquiry into the collapse in pig prices;</P>
    <P>&mdash;pay all grants and subsidies due to farmers as set out under the Farmer's Charter of Rights;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increase the resources of An Bord Bia to get new markets abroad for Irish farm products;</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduce a greatly increased realistic fodder scheme over that already announced and set out now the details of this scheme and make it operational not later than 19 October, 1998;</P>
    <P>&mdash;make a clear and comprehensive statement on the agreement, if any, with Libya on the shipping to that country of live cattle from Ireland with particular reference to when it is proposed to commence shipments to that country; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;make a comprehensive statement on the beef export agreement with Iran with particular reference to the amount of beef provided for export in this agreement and when exactly these exports will commence.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will be constructive in light of the current difficulties facing agriculture.  Historically, Seanad debates on agriculture have been constructive and I hope that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The current crisis is one of the worst in recent memory.  All farmers are affected but especially farm families with low acreage and limited resources and who are dependent on livestock and sheep for a living.  The crisis has been exacerbated by a serious fodder shortage in many areas, a situation that was independently confirmed by Teagasc.  There is no need to outline the serious situation facing pig farmers as the Minister of State will be well aware of it.  It is probably the worst crisis ever to hit pig farmers.</P>
    <P>It is said that agriculture is the backbone of the economy.  Despite the dwindling number of people working on the land, agriculture will continue to be our main industry into the next millennium. Approximately 140,000 people are dependent on the land for a living and thousands more work in related industries.  Overall farm <Col N="1032" /> incomes are under severe pressure, particularly in the livestock sector, following this summer's unprecedented crisis.  At the same time, the national economy is enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth.  Farm families, however, are less confident about their future than any other sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Farmers are frustrated at their exclusion from the growing prosperity of our nation.  Today, as much as in the dark days of the early 1960s and the GATT negotiations of the early 1990s, farmers need leadership.  However, this Government is not giving leadership.  It was sad this morning to see farmers again protesting outside Agriculture House just as they had done in the 1960s.  This is a disaster.  The sadness on the faces of the protesters, both inside and outside the building, makes one wonder if the Government is really aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister to deliver an intervention scheme also makes one wonder if the Government is asleep.  Over the past few days there was a great deal of negotiation between the Government and the EU but it yielded no results. The Government failed to convince the EU of the desperate state of Irish agriculture, the chaotic state of the beef industry and the need to introduce intervention.  The only way the beef industry can be saved is through the introduction of a proper intervention scheme.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the Libyan deal.  Three weeks ago we were told that the Libyans were willing to take Irish cattle.  Two weeks ago, during a debate on this crisis in the Dáil, the Minister confirmed that the Libyan deal would proceed.  However, my information over the past number of days is that there will not be a Libyan deal.  The Minister of State must clarify this tonight.  Unless the deal is secured, Irish producers will be in serious trouble.  Factories, farmers and others were waiting for and planning on the resumption of live cattle exports to Libya.</P>
    <P>The Government is a dismal failure in everything it has done in relation to live exports of cattle despite the fact that, in Opposition and during the general election campaign, Fianna Fáil guaranteed that in Government it would use every boat in the country to facilitate the export of live cattle.  That did not happen.  Members on the Government side can make whatever gestures they wish but the reality is that Fianna Fáil has failed miserably and the farmers know it.</P>
    <P>Recently a rescue package worth £10 million was announced.  There are seven million cattle in Ireland, and everybody knows that they have dropped in value by approximately £100 per head.  If this happened on the Stock Exchange it would have to close for weeks.  In reality £700 million has been knocked off the price of Irish cattle and a derisory £10 million subsidy scheme has been introduced to help people in badly affected areas, despite the fact that the Government, the Department of Agriculture and Food, Teagasc and other bodies warned that this could happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> The family income supplement must be introduced for farming families who need it.  It would not cost the huge amount that has been stated.  I urge the Minister of State to raise this issue with the Cabinet and to make the Government realise that the family income supplement is badly needed.  The Minister of State has a personal interest in the crisis in the pig industry, and small pig farmers are experiencing hardship.  However, nobody cares because they are a small part of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not here although the Minister of State does a good job and I have no complaint with him.  The first thing I was going to do was to ask the Minister to resign, and if he was unwilling to do so, I would have asked the Taoiseach to ask him to resign because he has failed the most important industry in the Irish economy miserably and abysmally.  There can be no further excuses.  This crisis could be seen coming for the last year, yet he took no action.  Everybody knew the condition of the Russian economy six months ago; the looming disaster was known to any pundit looking at the situation.  Everybody knew the exposure of Irish agriculture to the Russian market. We knew that if the Russian currency came under pressure it would have disastrous effects on a country that sold up to 400,000 tonnes of beef there.  Did the Minister take any action?  Did he say anything?  Did he even whimper about it?  No, he did not.</P>
      <P>For that reason alone he ought to resign.  Tens of thousands of farm families are experiencing negative income and, as Senator Hayes said, in justice they should be made eligible for family income supplement.  That was introduced ten years ago by a Government I supported to take people out of poverty traps and to protect those who might fall into poverty traps.  Now tens of thousands of Irish farmers have fallen into a serious poverty trap, and the only scheme we have for alleviating such a situation is the family income supplement.  The Minister has not given honest answers on what this might cost; he tried to say it will cost £60 million, but that is the worst of all possible scenarios and seems to assume that everybody who is self-employed in Ireland would apply for it.  Approximately £20 million or a little more would finance the scheme.</P>
      <P>I contrast this with the last crisis in agriculture, the BSE crisis in 1996.  I do not want to bring politics into this, but the then Minister for Agriculture secured £69 million in special EU funds, backed up by Irish Exchequer funds, in aid to Irish farmers.  That money was paid before the end of 1996, and a further £31 million in income support was paid in 1997.  Approximately £17 million of that amount was from the Irish Exchequer and the rest were EU funds.  All this Minister tells us he has is a fodder scheme which he says will cost approximately £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> What is meant by this fodder scheme?  Who will get it?  When will it be operational?  Does the Minister realise that a fodder crisis exists now, and thousands of farmers want to make decisions about the future based on information on assistance with their present fodder problems?  The fodder problem could have been foreseen.  We had the worst April in generations, according to the Meteorological Office.  We had the wettest May in generations and the wettest June, July and August in years.  Yet this blind Minister for Agriculture and Food could not see the crisis coming. Any fool would have seen that that would lead to a serious fodder crisis at the end of the season. What has the Minister done?  Under severe pressure he has said he wants to introduce a fodder relief scheme.  I and thousands of farmers want to know what that means.  How will it operate, who will qualify for it and how much will it be worth? We want to know before next week.  It is no good introducing this next Christmas; by then the crisis will have solved itself by destroying thousands of farmers financially.  This relief, paltry as it is, should be introduced now.</P>
    <P>What is happening in relation to Libya?  The Minister sent officials to Libya and then came up with a brouhaha of announcements that he had opened the Libyan market.  He said that it would add 5p to 7p per pound to the price of beef.  The week after that, the price of beef, already at an all time low, fell by 5p per pound.  Irish meat factories were allowed to drop the price of beef arbitrarily while the Minister was promising farmers that it would increase by 5p per pound.</P>
    <P>I want to know more about the Minister's very cosy relationship with the meat industry.  The beef tribunal revealed that there was an all too cosy and unhealthy relationship between too many members associated with the Minister's party and the meat industry.  We sincerely hope we are not getting echoes of that.  Any Minister for Agriculture worth his salt would have put his foot down with the meat factories and told them to pay at least the intervention price of beef to farmers. Any other price is profiteering, which is what they are doing.  I am not blaming the Minister of State because I know he would agree with me, even if it would be difficult for him to do so publicly. I am asking his colleague to answer these questions, and that is why I suggest he should resign.</P>
    <P>What is meant by the deal with Iran?  Under severe pressure, the Minister stated that he has reopened the Iranian market.  He does not say when it is to reopen or what tonnage of beef is to be sold there.  If farmers and exporters knew that it might bring some confidence back to the market. Will the Minister of State make a detailed statement?  The policy of say nothing, know nothing and then do nothing is making the situation worse.  The Minister of State should make a comprehensive statement about Iran and what is wrong with Libya.  Is there an agreement?  If not, he should tell us.  The Minister of State should not continue with the nonsense of a different <Col N="1035" /> statement on Libya being made every day.  Let us know now if there is a deal and when shipping of live cattle to Libya will commence.  That is an area of Libyan trade which would address itself to one of the most vulnerable areas of our cattle industry.</P>
    <P>Because of bad breeding policies &mdash; introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in the 1980s when we withdrew the licensing of bulls &mdash; we now find ourselves with cattle of inferior quality and cattle which do not have good confirmation and do not do well in our prime market.  The only outlets for them are markets like Libya.  We were hoping and expecting to get rid of several thousand of these animals to Libya this season.  It is particularly sensitive that we get that market back to address the problems.  That is the area where the greatest price drop has occurred.  The Chairman, as a farmer, will realise this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the Government and, especially the Minister for Agriculture and Food, for their continuing support for the agriculture and food sectors, and their efforts to deal with the difficulties currently affecting farmers through a range of measures including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;acceleration of direct payments to farmers amounting to almost one thousand million pounds in 1998;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the increase in export refunds for beef, pigmeat and SMP, total market support measures in 1998 are expected to exceed £500 million;</P>
      <P>&mdash;agreement from the EU Commission to improve access to intervention for cattle; &mdash;the introduction of aids to private storage for pigmeat and sheepmeat;</P>
      <P>&mdash;securing the Iranian market for beef exports;</P>

    <P>&mdash;progress on re-opening the Libyan market for cattle exports.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased, as a farmer, to have the opportunity of contributing to this very important debate on our number one industry.  There is a clear understanding of the serious situation in the sector at present.  I begin by making it quite clear that I reject, in the strongest possible terms, the Opposition's suggestion that there has been any mismanagement on the part of this Government of the current difficulties in agriculture.  I also reject in the strongest possible terms the suggestion by my colleague, Senator John Connor, that the Minister should resign.  He is doing whatever is possible to overcome the current difficulties in agriculture.  If any Minister should have resigned it should have been the previous Minister who blatantly told lies to this House when he said a gun had been put to his head in the VIP lounge at Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>I am telling the truth.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot be held responsible for the economic situation in Russia any more than the weather.  Recently Minister Walsh announced a series of measures to assist farmers with their cashflow this autumn.  Such measures include speeding up direct payments to farmers; an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent &mdash; this will release an additional £45 million in November and December; more rapid payment of REPS where such payments are falling due; payment of the outstanding top-up of £6 million to certain beef producers; a fodder package for farmers worst affected by the weather in early summer &mdash; and not all farmers were affected; recent agreement to substantially increase beef export refunds &mdash; the increase is equivalent to 5p per lb of beef; and ensuring that appropriate transport facilities are available for live exports.  Each of these measures was identified as an important issue in discussions with farm organisations and, in total, they represent an impressive list of actions.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the serious fodder problem, the Government responded by making £10 million available to deal with fodder difficulties being experienced by some farmers.  The details of the new scheme will be finalised very quickly and the approval of the Commission is being sought with a view to making payments as quickly as possible. The Minister is also seeking the approval of the European Commission to continue sheep headage top-up equivalent to £2.75 million.  The intention is that this money would be made available through a top-up in the subsidy for mountain ewes and suckler cows in the worst affected areas. A major consideration is the need to devise an arrangement that would get assistance to farmers and in that context the Government response was adequate and rapid.</P>
      <P>The problem in the beef market stems almost entirely from the loss of the Russian market. Cattle prices were higher than in 1997 for most of this year but they have fallen back significantly in the last few months.  The Minister left no stone unturned in his efforts to alleviate these difficulties. As early as last August we signalled to the Commission the potential crisis which could arise from the Russian situation and sought measures to be put in place with immediate effect to counteract these developments.  The measures the Minister identified as being necessary included a substantial increase in export refunds, the introduction of an EU sponsored export credit guarantee system, a widening of the intervention system and an increase in the advance of the cattle premiums from 60 per cent to 80 per cent.  The Minister spoke on four separate occasions to Commission Fischler in the past week and he is pleased that his efforts have borne fruit and that a variety of measures are now in place which should help to bring about an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our exposure to the Russian economic difficulties is easy to understand.  In 1997, Irish beef <Col N="1038" /> exports to Russia amounted to 70,000 tonnes and were expected to reach similar levels in 1998. However, the effects of the loss of the market have been compounded by the fact that this was also an important market for other European exporters.  Russia took 40 per cent of EU beef exports in 1997.  Beef previously destined for Russia is now being diverted onto the European market and the resultant increased competition on the European market has exerted downward pressure on cattle prices here.  The situation has been exacerbated further by the fact that other third countries have attempted to exploit the difficulties on the Russian market by forcing down contract prices.</P>
    <P>The situation is not helped by the renationalisation of the beef market in the European Union following the BSE scares in 1996.  There is now a very clear preference in most member states for domestically produced beef.  Nevertheless, Irish beef exports to European markets have recovered significantly from the 1996 situation, particularly to France, Italy and the Netherlands.  There is a very substantial gap between cattle prices in Ireland and prices on these markets and I am glad to see the Minister has been pressing the trade to exploit whatever opportunities exist on these markets.  Bord Bia is also assisting in this effort.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties in beef are extremely disappointing because, in the absence of the Russian crisis, there were very good prospects for cattle prices to remain at the higher levels which prevailed earlier in the year.  There are a number of reasons for this.  In the first instance, the market balance in the European Union has improved significantly in 1998 compared with 1996 and 1997, both because of a continuing recovery in beef consumption and a significant reduction in beef production in the European Union.  The recovery in beef consumption was assisted by the various measures adopted in the last few years to assure consumers about the safety of beef, especially Irish beef.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister called to meat factories and warned them to take account of the serious difficulties faced by the finished cattle sector.  I also welcome Minister Walsh's visit to Teheran.  Arrangements are now in place for the visit of an Iranian technical delegation to oversee export arrangements to Iran.  Live exports from Ireland to both EU and third countries are vital to maintaining competition in the cattle trade and in sustaining farm incomes.  The Government has consistently recognised the importance of promoting live exports and have taken action in a number of areas to ensure market access for our cattle to both EU and third country markets.</P>
    <P>As regards trade with Libya, both the Opposition and the farming organisations are aware of the agreement signed last July by the Irish and Libyan authorities which provides for the reopening of live trade from the end of this month.  That will be done &mdash; unlike when we were told by the previous Minister before an election <Col N="1039" /> at the beginning of June 1997 that there would be live trade to Libya the following week, for which we are still waiting.  However, I assure the Opposition it will be reopened in the very near future and matters will definitely improve.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Ministers of State on their good work to alleviate this situation.</P>

      <P>Every time we debate agriculture I wonder about the party on this side of the House and the two parties in Government, all of which proclaimed their belief in the market economy on 100 occasions for everyone except one sector of the economy.  They have enthusiastically preached the importance of competitiveness and keeping costs low to maintain our national competitiveness to workers in telecommunications, the ESB, the transport system and every other area.  However, apparently none of these constraints applies to one sector in society.</P>
      <P>It appears that agriculture must have the benefits of the market economy, in other words, if prices can be pushed up in any way, irrespective of the cost to consumers, it must be done, but if prices drop because of market forces then somebody must produce money to compensate for the loss of profit.  If 5,000 industrial employees lost their jobs in Fruit of the Loom in Donegal and I said in the House that the Government should guarantee to buy up every piece of surplus product produced by Fruit of the Loom, every Member would laugh at me and tell me it was a daft idea.</P>
      <P>This industry has already had direct payments to its participants of £1 billion.  Depending on how one defines farmers, that represents an average income of between £7,500 and £10,000 a year per farmer.  That is not a bad start.  There are 600,000 people paying income tax whose gross income is £10,000 or less in the estimate of the Revenue Commissioners, with which £10,000 per farmer working in agriculture is a reasonable comparison.</P>
      <P>In addition, based on the best figures I have, the cost to the Irish consumer of the Common Agricultural Policy is between £500 million and £1,000 million a year in inflated food prices.  That is a competitive cost which the Irish consumer must pay to maintain this system.</P>
      <P>If this system did what it is supposed to do, which is to sustain family farms and the maximum number possible on the land, one would have considerable sympathy with it.  However, in fact, it has done the opposite.  It has increased inequality in agriculture and has managed to leave us with the most undiscussed problem in Irish society, which is the appalling inequality of income in agriculture.  The two farming organisations have managed to cover over this appalling inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> If we are to do something about the significant number of farmers whose incomes have suffered dramatically because of the appalling weather conditions, we should take some of the £1 billion in direct aid which is going to farmers who are successful, commercial and rich.  They should be told that they can survive in a competitive economy and a significant proportion should be transferred, particularly money which is being paid for set aside in tillage, in income subsidies to those parts of the farming community which are genuinely suffering.  Let us have a redistribution within agriculture instead of the eternal obsession with a redistribution from those not in agriculture to those in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is a succession of myths about this matter. Would either the Libyan or Iranian markets pay a commercial price, in terms of what an Irish farmer expects, or will they simply get further export subsidies?  There is a need to get real about this issue because, sooner or later, Irish agriculture will have to compete in an open world economy without subsidies, guarantees or quotas. We must start now &mdash; it would have been preferable to do it last year but we should at least do it this year and definitely by next year &mdash; to work out a system of support for living in rural Ireland which is based on keeping people there and not on myths of guaranteed prices for products that nobody in the market place wants to sell.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Committee on European Affairs and I listened to an interesting presentation to that committee by the IFA on Agenda 2000 and many of the problems which undoubtedly face agriculture.  However, two words were never mentioned in the entire presentation &mdash; the marketplace and consumers.  How does one deal with an industry whose chief proponents and most articulate and effective representatives never mention markets or consumers when they are talking about what to do with their product?</P>
    <P>We must stand back and look at this matter. Members of Fine Gael are great believers in the market economy but they apparently want subsidised shipping, fodder, hill sheep and incomes on top of already heavily subsidised incomes.  As a socialist, I believe in all those matters and in intervention, but members of Fine Gael and the Government who do not believe in intervention in the market economy but believe that the market is the distributor of benefits and efficiency can no longer tell the rest of the people that the market economy is good for everybody except agriculture. They are kidding the rest of society and they are also codding farmers because the old days are over.  It would be much better to look further and deeper at giving people proper incomes.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was introduced to deal with the problem of people on low incomes who were paying ridiculous amounts of tax.  If people in agriculture are prepared to move their income tax from Schedule E to Schedule D and have their expenses as rigorously analysed as those of a PAYE worker, I will support the extension <Col N="1041" /> of family income supplement to them as long as they are taxed under the same schedule as those who currently receive it.  However, there is no way that ordinary taxpayers will tolerate a best of both situations for farmers.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable degree of financial support going to agriculture.  It is unevenly distributed and makes those who are already rich richer and leaves those who are already poor poorer. The remedy for the current crisis is a redistribution of income within agriculture and not from anybody else to those in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate, if for no other reason than to highlight the seriousness of the situation and to try to move it out of the political domain.  The unfortunate situation in which the farming community finds itself at present is being bandied from A to B and back to A, with each pointing the finger at the other and saying they would do it better.  That will not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>The problems in the agricultural sector are many but, to a great extent, the two largest contributing factors, particularly as regards livestock, are the Russian economy and the weather over the past eight or nine months.  This needs to be borne in mind.  This country is not isolated from the serious situation in the Russian economy over the past six months.  Of course, it is unfortunate but we cannot change that situation.  All we can do is to try to put in place a safety net so that when something of this nature happens, we can address and feel our way out of the situation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the situation in which livestock farmers, in particular, find themselves is catastrophic for many, especially smaller farmers. Unfortunately, many find they have no income and are losing money daily.  We must consider what safety nets we can put in place to save them. I suggest bantering across this House or elsewhere is not the way to proceed.  I also say to the IFA that camping in the Department of Agriculture and Food might not be the best approach. The argument is in Brussels and that is where we need to focus our attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is in Brussels and the Minister has taken the case to Brussels over an extended period.  In the run up to an election a particular Minister for Agriculture opened a market on polling day which is still closed.  We do not want that because it does not get anybody anywhere.  We want proper negotiation where those with an input sit down with the Commissioner to let him know the exact situation in case he does not know.  We should all put our shoulders to the wheel to try to devise a way out. I look forward to the intervention system which was put in place to address these types of problems and to seeing it opened up considerably in <Col N="1042" /> the near future.  It is a necessity; there is no question about that because this is an emergency.</P>
      <P>We want to see the situation as regards live exports to Libya, Iran and Egypt resolved because it introduces competition into the market. That competition is the life blood of the beef industry.  I would prefer if Ireland sold every animal it produced as a prepared meal but the market does not allow it to work in that way.  We must encourage the live trade wherever we can. Whatever problems we have with the live trade, particularly as a result of BSE, we need to convince everybody that we have the best produce available and that we can supply it when and how they want it.  The Minister, the Department and even the Taoiseach have and continue to emphasise this point.  I have no doubt but that the situation will improve, as it has done.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the factories are gobbling up any benefits which might accrue.  We faced this situation before in the beef industry and it needs to be addressed.  The factories have not played their part in a long-term strategy for the beef industry.  That situation pertained even when some of them were farmer owned and farmer driven.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made the point about the necessity to focus on consumers, with which I fully agree.  We need to sell our agricultural produce to consumers who want it.  That is why the agricultural strategy for this country in the long-term is based on going after niche markets where we can produce the best quality food available. There is a large market in Europe which will get bigger and we need to chase those niche markets for ourselves so that when situations such as these arise we are not exposed to them to the extent we have been in the past.</P>
      <P>I return to the IFA's demand for family income supplement to be made available to the farming community.  I support that demand in the following way.  If members of the community are in a situation where they cannot put bread on the table, they are entitled to be supported by the State.  We need to sit down, examine the situation closely and get all the facts together.  If people are in dire straits, they should be supported.  The family income supplement may not be the best way to support them but I do not know of any other system available to help them.  The best way to help them would be to raise prices in the morning. That is what everyone wants, so we must work towards it.  Again, if people are in dire straits, they should be supported.  It is time to stop bickering and to focus on moving forward.  We are a small country and need to move forward in a way which will benefit everyone, particularly the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Ryan, I hope he never becomes Minister for Agriculture and Food.  As bad as the present Minister is regarded by the farmers, Senator Ryan would be a total disaster.  He has no concept of farming or the farming way of life.  We are trying to preserve <Col N="1043" /> a culture and a way of life.  Agriculture is not an exact science like physics or chemistry; it is different. It is regrettable that it should be classified. The corollary of Senator Ryan's argument would be that if a man cannot find a job he should not get unemployment benefit.  His arguments are completely off the rails.</P>
      <P>The farming community has endured crises in the past dating back to the 1930s with the economic war.  It has great resilience and has overcome many crises and I am sure it will overcome this one.  The fundamental issue here is that the Government's response to the present crisis is inadequate.  Several Members of this and the Lower House mentioned that 100 farmers weekly are leaving the land.  This crisis, as well as being an economic disaster, will also undermine the remaining confidence in the farming community. That is the worst feature of the crisis.  Young farmers, especially, see little future in farming. We have all attended the presentation of agricultural certificates in agricultural colleges and can see that the number receiving those certificates drops each time we attend.  This is an indication that young people have been leaving the land at an estimated 100 per week over the past two decades. If that erosion continues, it will ultimately depopulate rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>To date, the Government's response to this crisis has been totally inadequate.  A figure of £10 million was mentioned as an immediate stop gap offer.  However, one should consider the £10 million subsidy to Teilifís na Gaeilge every year to keep its 10,000 viewers and put this crisis in context. We are discussing an industry which accounts for approximately 14 per cent of Ireland's GDP.  The relative figure in Europe is 0.3 or 0.4 per cent.  This gives us an idea of the value of agriculture to our economy.</P>
      <P>Approximately 170,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in farming and agri-business. It is our major industry and the sheet anchor of the economy.  The IDA has made great efforts in promoting industry in Ireland.  Without those efforts, we would be in a much worse position. However, unfortunately, the bulk of the job opportunities have been created in urban areas. They have become increasingly large while rural areas have become smaller.  The result is that farmers who need part-time jobs to supplement their farm income cannot get them because the bulk of industry is located too far away.  A new emphasis is required and there is a need to locate industry in the west in particular and in areas of serious disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation relating to the Western Development Commission was introduced in the other House last week and will come before the Seanad soon.  A sum of £5 million has been allocated for western development under the package. However, £5 million would not buy a good pub in Dublin.  How anybody expects £5 million to change the face of the western seaboard is beyond me.  Last year the Government gave £20 <Col N="1044" /> million for the construction of a stand in Croke Park.  We all love the GAA and the Sam Maguire Cup was brought to Connacht this year for the first time in many decades.  Nevertheless, that investment must be placed in the context of the current crisis.  Despite the expenditure of a large part of the £20 million, none of us could get tickets for the stand this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a crisis in farming and making the issue a political football is not the way to solve it.  However, this side firmly believes that a measure which should be introduced immediately is a farm income supplement.  This would cost in the region of £60 to £70 million but it is not a major amount in the context of the current budget surplus which is approaching £1 billion. This is the biggest budget surplus in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>Farmers deserve a generous response from the Government at this juncture.  This response should tide them over the immediate problems, which I hope are temporary.  The farming community has faced crises since the foundation of the State.  It has overcome most of them, but the fundamental point of our argument is that the Government's response has been totally inadequate and will not go any way towards alleviating the hardship being suffered by the farming community at present.  Even Members on the Government side will concede that there is a major crisis at present.  It is incumbent on all Members to exhort the Minister to do more than he has done to date to ensure the Libyan and Iraqi trade is reopened and to make a generous gesture to farmers at this critical juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  The current crisis in agriculture is very serious.  As we are all aware, farmers' incomes are at their lowest point for many years.  Beef, pig and sheep prices are at their lowest for 20 years and this, together with the terrible weather conditions, has left farmers at a very low point as we approach the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dreadful weather over the past nine months has left the land in a very poor condition and caused a major shortage of fodder.  Farmers had to house their cattle two months earlier than usual.  Undoubtedly, the weather in addition to poor prices has contributed much to the current situation.  Everybody agrees there is a major crisis in farming.  It is the role of all Members to unite in finding a solution or at least a mechanism to <Col N="1045" /> provide some assistance to the farming sector in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>It is not a time for political point scoring.  Farmers and their families will not thank anybody who attempts to take advantage of the current crisis for political gain.  A solution is not easily found because many factors are involved.  The economic situation in Russia has caused enormous difficulties and the ongoing problems regarding the reopening of the live export trade to third countries are also causing major difficulties.  If live cattle were being exported to third countries, there would be more competition and confidence in the market.  In addition to the bad weather and the shortage of fodder, confidence is very low in the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food are concerned about the crisis and they are doing all they can to improve the situation. Their best efforts to date have had limited success, but I do not doubt that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, the Taoiseach and the Government will continue to work hard for the farming community.  They are aware of the situation in which farmers finds themselves and the extent of the problem.  I do not doubt they will do everything in their power to help.  I hope that in the near future they will have success in terms of the reopening of the live export trade to third countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures taken by the Minister to speed up direct payments to farmers.  The increase in advance premium payments and the rapid payment of the REPS will certainly help.  Seventy five pence per pound for beef is not acceptable as the cost of production is almost 85p per pound. Farmers will not and cannot be expected to sell cattle at a loss.  New measures will have to be taken by the Minister and the Government to ensure that farmers do not have to sell cattle at a loss.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made as we speak to improve the pig situation.  Hopefully they will be successful in the near future.  Any success in opening new beef markets would be very welcome.  I compliment the Minister and his officials for their efforts and the time they have devoted to ensure farmers are supported in this serious crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food who is engaged in important talks.  In the Dáil on 30 September I made a comprehensive statement in reply to many of the points in the Opposition motion but I am pleased to respond to this type of debate.  The current situation in agriculture merits serious discussion but it does not merit a campaign of political points scoring or the putting about of misinformation of the type circulated over the past few weeks.  I am glad to have the opportunity of dealing with the issues raised in this House and to set the record straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject suggestions that there has been any <Col N="1046" /> mismanagement on the part of the Government as regards the current difficulties in agriculture. The contrary is true.  The Government fully appreciates the difficulties being experienced by some sectors of Irish agriculture.  In the main, these have arisen due to developments on the Russian market and the difficult weather in 1998. With the support of the Government, I have been very active in my efforts to alleviate the pressure on the sectors involved.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a series of measures to assist farmers with their cashflow this autumn. These measures include speeding up direct payments to farmers which are worth £1 billion annually and account for half of all farming income; an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent which will release an additional £45 million to farmers in November and December; more rapid payment of REPS where such payments are falling due; payment of an outstanding top-up of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October; a special scheme to alleviate winter fodder difficulties on certain farms and arrangements for Teagasc to hold special free advisory clinics on fodder in the areas affected; promoting live exports through the approval of additional facilities for live exports to EU markets; ensuring everything possible was being done to get Libya to honour the agreement reached between the two Governments in July; increased beef export refunds &mdash; the increase is equivalent to 5p per pound of beef, which follows previous export refund increases for beef, pigmeat and SMP; negotiating the reopening of the Iranian market for our beef exports; the introduction of EU funded private storage schemes for pigmeat and sheepmeat.</P>
    <P>Each of these measures was identified as an important issue in discussions with farm organisations and they represent an impressive list of actions.  Since some of these items have been specifically mentioned in the debate, I will be dealing with them in greater detail a little later.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is significant hardship on many individual farms in the areas most adversely affected by weather conditions.  In August, when the situation was becoming acute, at the invitation of Deputies, Senators and the farming organisations, I visited the affected areas.  West Limerick was the first area I visited.</P>
    <P>The Government made £10 million available to deal with fodder difficulties being experienced by some farmers.  The details of the new scheme will be finalised very quickly and the approval of the Commission will be sought with a view to making payments as quickly as possible.  In addition, I am seeking the approval of the European Commission to continue sheep headage top-up equivalent to £2.75 million.  The intention is that this money would be made available through a top-up in the mountain ewes and suckler cows in the worst affected areas.  A major consideration is the need to devise an arrangement that would get assistance quickly to farmers, and in that context, <Col N="1047" /> and together with the wide range of measures, the Government's response was appropriate and rapid.  The fodder scheme in the selected areas is close to being finalised and the intention is to make payments without delay.</P>
    <P>In comments from the Opposition on the fodder package, an attempt has been made to create the impression that this is the only payment being made to farmers.  The fact is that direct payments to farmers will amount to nearly £1 billion in 1998 and they account for a very large share of income. Specific payment targets for these schemes are laid down in the Charter of Rights for Farmers. I have made clear my intention to make these payments as early as possible this year.  Excluding BSE payments, £140 million has already been paid to farmers under the 1998 headage and premium schemes.  The corresponding figure paid at this time last year was £89 million.</P>
    <P>Payment of sheep headage commenced on 21 September.  This was ahead of the commencement date in 1997 and, to date, over £12 million has been paid.  Payment of cattle headage commenced on 26 September 1998, three weeks ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  Over £47 million has been paid to date.  Effectively, over £67 million has already been paid under the 1998 disadvantaged areas headage schemes.  This compares with just over £22 million which had been paid this time last year.  Payments under these schemes will continue over the coming weeks with a view to ensuring that all eligible applicants are paid by 31 October.</P>
    <P>While referring to the headage schemes payable in disadvantaged areas, it might be appropriate to point out that in the period 1994-8, the total expenditure on these schemes, including the amount provided in the Vote for this year, will amount to just over £605 million.  While these schemes are 65 per cent funded by the EU, the reality is that the total Exchequer contribution in the period 1994-8 will be just over £305 million, representing 50 per cent of the total amount spent.</P>
    <P>In so far as the suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes are concerned, I recently secured the agreement of the European Commission to an increase from 60 per cent to 80 per cent in the rate of advance payment which may be made under these schemes.  I sought this change in order to alleviate the problems facing cattle producers arising from the low cattle prices and the fodder shortage.  Payment of the advances at this higher rate will enable my Department to pay an additional £45 million in premiums to farmers this year.  This will substantially improve their cash flow.  I have also made arrangements for payment of additional BSE compensation to those producers who had more animals in 1996 than 1995 &mdash; the year originally chosen as the base year for the 1996 BSE compensation package. This measure will be worth over £6 million to the producers and payments commence today.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one other matter which has been mentioned and which is linked to the <Col N="1048" /> amount of these payments.  This led to changes in the retention period of suckler cows.  This year £455 million has been paid in headage and premium schemes.  That is a huge amount of money.</P>
    <P>The retention period for the suckler cow premium scheme is set out in the Council regulations. Producers who lodged their suckler cow applications in early May will have completed the retention period in early November.  Varying the retention period, even on a once-off basis for 1998, would require the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  In the unlikely event that such a scheme would be forthcoming, it would involve a lengthy process involving the Commission making such approaches to the Council.  Therefore, any such agreement would not be in time to benefit a reasonable number of producers this year.  I am confident that the package of measures I have announced to deal with the fodder difficulties, together with payment targets I have outlined, will more efficiently address this problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor made reference to the existence of a cosy arrangement between the meat processors and the Minister.  I categorically refute that; the suggestion that there is any kind of collusion is outrageous.  The Minister had a relatively difficult meeting with the meat processors today during which he put his cards on the table on this issue.</P>
    <P>The decline in beef prices which is adversely affecting the beef market stems almost entirely from the loss of the Russian market due to the economic turmoil in that country.  In 1997, Irish beef exports to Russia amounted to 70,000 tonnes and were expected to reach similar levels in 1998. The effects of the loss of the market have been compounded by the fact that this was also an important market for other European exporters, although it must be understood that we are more exposed than other member states.</P>
    <P>The renationalisation of the beef market in the European Union, following the BSE scares in 1996, has given rise to this and has in fact created a situation where we are very much on our own within the EU in regard to this problem.  Irish beef exports to European markets have, it must be said, recovered significantly from the 1996 situation, particularly to France, Italy and the Netherlands.  Nevertheless, there is a very substantial gap between cattle prices in Ireland and prices on these markets and I have been pressing the trade to exploit whatever opportunities exist in these markets.  An Bord Bia is also assisting in this effort.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties in the beef sector are extremely disappointing because, in the absence of the Russian crisis, there were very good prospects for cattle prices to remain at the higher levels which prevailed earlier in the year.  From the very onset of the Russian crisis in August, I signalled to the Commission the potential crisis we were facing and sought a range of measures to be put in place with immediate effect to counteract these developments.  The measures I identified as <Col N="1049" /> being necessary included a substantial increase in export refunds, the introduction of an EU sponsored export credit guarantee system, a widening of the intervention system and an increase in the advance of the cattle premiums from 60 to 80 per cent.  I am pleased that the Commission has so far responded positively with regard to export refunds and payments of the advances in the premiums.</P>
    <P>It was alleged that successive Fianna Fáil Administrations made many poor decisions on animal breeding over the years; animal breeding policies during the 1980s were specifically referred to.  A Fine Gael Administration under Garret Fitzgerald pursued animal breeding policies in the 1980s in which the procedures for the licensing of bulls were changed.  Fianna Fáil has always been to the forefront in developing good animal breeding policies.</P>
    <P>A major breakthrough has been made with the European Commission on behalf of Irish beef farmers.  Following a request from the Minister, a major package of measures on intervention has been agreed.  The 04 grades will be eligible for intervention, the weight limit will be adjusted and the processors' margin will be increased.  The net result of these measures will be that almost 50 per cent of Irish steers will be eligible for intervention. These new intervention arrangements will remove surplus beef from the market, thereby stabilising it and underpinning the increase to beef producers at this time.  It will be up to manufacturers to implement these measures and pass on the benefits.  The management committee has yet to agree to the changes announced by the Minister on Friday but this should pose little difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Commission increased the refunds on live cattle by 7.7 per cent on male carcases, 8 per cent on boneless hindquarter beef and 27.  5 per cent on male boneless forequarter beef.  The changes in refunds on boneless beef amounted to an average increase of 12 per cent and is worth 5p per pound carcase weight.  This increase will improve the competitiveness of our cattle and beef exports on third country markets and should enable our processors to pay higher prices to producers for cattle.  I have insisted these refund increases should be passed back in full to producers by the factories; in fact, I have requested the meat processors to not only pass back refund increases but to fully use the support available.  It is clear this has not been done this week given the low use of intervention.</P>
    <P>I have also secured EU agreement to pay a higher advance of the premiums this year.  The increase in the advance from 60 to 80 per cent will be worth an additional £45 million this autumn and will provide a major injection of cash at this difficult time.  This cash will be of particular benefit to livestock producers who will be experiencing fodder shortages this winter.</P>
    <P>I have also made a request to the Commission for an export guarantee system to be introduced specifically to deal with the Russian situation. <Col N="1050" /> This would provide EU exporters with the necessary confidence to resume trading with Russia pending the restoration of normality on the Russian market.  The crisis occurred towards the end of August when the rouble came under pressure. For the first six months of 1998, we exported 38,000 tonnes of beef to the Russian market, 2,000 tonnes more than in 1997.  An Bord Bia, the State food development and promotion agency, forecast that we would export more than 70,000 tonnes of beef this year.  That may not now become a reality because of the situation in Russia. The market there is effectively closed due to the economic crisis in that country.</P>
    <P>In recent days I have had further and lengthy discussions with Commissioner Fischler on the reopening of intervention, in particular in a way which would provide timely and meaningful support. I have received a commitment from the Commissioner that this would be done and a meeting took place earlier today between the Secretary General of my Department and the Director General of the Agriculture Directorate of the Commission to advance the matter.  Specifically, we are requesting that the Commission put more effective and flexible intervention support arrangements in place to help stabilise the situation, including the inclusion of the 04 grade in the eligible categories for intervention, an increase in the maximum weight limit to 360 kg, and an increase in the processing margin from 10 ecus per 100 kg to 14 ecus per 100 kg has been sought. This would increase the quantity of steers eligible for intervention from a current level of about 20 per cent to approximately 48 per cent, thereby rendering this market support measure more effective.</P>
    <P>While there is major reluctance by the Commission to reopen intervention again in light of the current stock levels of some 570,000 tonnes which are overhanging the market, I believe that in the current situation, all market support measures must be brought into play.  The temporary re-opening of intervention purchasing is therefore essential at this time and I am making every effort to bring this about.  I made a preliminary announcement of what will happen on Friday and I welcome the efforts of the Department, the Minister and the Secretary General, who travelled to Brussels in an attempt to bring about this decision to alleviate the current crisis.  I hope it will satisfy the requirements of the farming community because no stone is being left unturned on their behalf.  The Government fully realises the importance of the beef farmers and the measures I have outlined will help to alleviate the problem which exists.</P>
    <P>As far as the long-term is concerned, I have recently received a copy of the McKinsey report on the most appropriate future strategy for the beef industry.  The objective of the report was to prepare a development plan for the industry in the context of the challenges which already face it and which will intensify as we move into the next century.  The report has concluded that the <Col N="1051" /> industry could substantially improve its profitability by the adoption of a series of initiatives, particularly at producer and processor level.  In particular, the report has identified over-capacity in the slaughtering sector, the need for greater discipline in marketing and the introduction of a quality based pricing system as the major issues to be tackled.  While some of these issues are already being tackled, it is essential that the main recommendations of the report be examined thoroughly.  In view of this, I have invited Enterprise Ireland and McKinsey to meet me next week to present their analysis for the future of the sector.</P>
    <P>As a result of the BSE crisis, the Iranian market has been closed to Irish exports since 1996. The Minister visited Iran last week for extensive negotiations with senior members of the Iranian Government on the re-opening of this market for Irish beef.  The Minister spent three days in intensive discussions with the Iranian representatives, who were impressed with the systematic and comprehensive BSE controls operating in Ireland and with the advanced traceability system now in place.  The Minister was able to give assurances regarding the safety of Irish beef and this, together with the declining incidences of BSE, resulted in agreement to re-open the market to our products.  The extensive county ban will be replaced by a more limited exclusion of herds in the immediate area of any confirmed BSE cases. This is an enormous improvement on the position up to now and marks a very positive step towards alleviating some of the market difficulties facing the beef sector.  The Iranians agreed to send a technical delegation to Ireland within the next week or so to finalise details of a protocol for the resumption of trade which the Minister is confident will take place immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>This year has been a mixed year for lamb sales. Following a request which I made to the European Commission for assistance, a scheme of aids for private storage was introduced which helped to alleviate this difficult market situation.  There then followed a period of several months during the summer when lamb prices were at record levels and reached as much as 12 per cent above last year's level.  Since mid-August however, this situation has changed and we again face a depressed market here, in the UK and in France.</P>
    <P>There is a particular problem with the prices of mountain lamb and with the sale of cull ewes, which are considerably back on last year.  This current market situation is due to weak demand in the Mediterranean market for light lambs and to the impact of the economic crisis in Russia. The collapse in the demand for sheepskins and a knock-on effect of lower beef prices resulting from the difficult market in Russia have had a negative impact on the demand and the price for lambs here and in the UK.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the process of examining the possibility of introducing a cull ewe slaughter scheme under which farmers will be compensated <Col N="1052" /> for the removal of between 100,000 and 200,000 cull ewes from the overgrazed commonages.  Subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance I hope it will be possible to provide funds of £3 million for the scheme and that the scheme will be up and running in the next few weeks, because culling will have to be completed by early December.  This initiative is designed primarily to ease the situation for those producers who will be faced with some level of destocking under the environmental programmes in 1999.  However, it will also assist producers who have not been able to find a market for cull ewes this autumn, and at the same time make a contribution to easing the fodder shortage problem facing many sheep producers.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place between my Department and the farming and processors' organisations to examine the practicalities of the scheme.  Further discussions are due to take place tomorrow.  My intention is that all farmers with land in degraded commonages will receive a slaughter premium to immediately remove at least a quarter of their ewes.  As producers with land in overgrazed commonages will in any event have some of their quota rights withdrawn for 1999, this scheme by providing additional compensation will help them progress towards the required level of stocking and at the same time provide an outlet for animals which have devalued significantly in the past months.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious that hill sheep producers are largely dependent on sheep and of the consequent impact of the current situation on their incomes.  I am also aware that a large proportion of these incomes derive from direct market supports.  I therefore asked the EU Commission to facilitate the early payment of the second instalment of the ewe premium.  The Commission has agreed to this request and the second instalment of the premium, amounting to £5.33 was fixed at a sheepmeat management committee on 2 October 1998.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address the market problem in a targeted way, I have taken steps to encourage the live export of sheep.  The <i>Holstein Express</i> was cleared to carry live lambs some time ago and a second vessel, which sails to France, is currently undergoing inspection.  I am hopeful that live trade of light mountain lamb to southern Europe will give a boost to the sector and I am doing all within my power to encourage and facilitate it.</P>
    <P>I have requested An Bord Bia to undertake a promotion campaign this autumn to encourage the consumption of lamb and especially to raise the profile of mountain lamb which becomes available at this time of the year.  An Bord Bia has also focused a promotional effort on the Spanish retail trade and in September I travelled to Spain to meet with retailers to promote Irish lamb sales on this premium market.  I was very encouraged by the attitude I encountered to Irish lamb and am happy that a very good job is being done on behalf of the Irish sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> On the question of headage payments to hill sheep farmers, I have already referred to the top up of £2.75 million for which I am seeking Commission approval.  Any proposal to further increase the rate of headage grants would need to be backed by convincing structural reasons.  The Commission does not regard once-off difficulties associated with market conditions, weather conditions, etc., as constituting sound structural reasons for increasing rates.  One must also take into consideration the amount of money remaining in the envelope for headage payments and the Commission's view that too high a percentage of the overall envelope has already been allocated to headage payments.</P>
    <P>In the pig sector, an over-supply of pigmeat in the EU as a whole is the chief cause of the low prices being experienced by producers at present. Consumption in the EU has not shown any marked increase and the Asian and Russian markets, traditionally major outlets for EU exports of pigmeat, have been poor this year.  In fact, the Russian market is now effectively closed. Increased production, static consumption and difficult export markets have combined to make the EU 108 per cent self-sufficient in pigmeat at present.</P>
    <P>On the home front, the fire last June at a pig processing plant in Northern Ireland has added to the problems of certain producers who had been supplying it from the South.  Around 5,000 pigs per week went to the plant.  I have been continuously keeping the pigmeat market under review and in early summer I looked for increased export refunds and got agreement from the EU Commission.  In May last the Commission increased the rate of refund on pigmeat exports and followed this with a further increase in August.  In view of the continued weakness on the export market, and in particular that of Russia, I have been pressing for a further increase in refunds.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I also requested the Commission to introduce an aids to private storage scheme to support the market.  The Commission has agreed to this and a very attractive scheme is in operation.  The scheme will provide EU funding for the storage of 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat destined for third countries for a period up to six months.  On this point, I would like to urge pig processors to make use of this support scheme. Apart from giving the wrong signal to the Commission, it makes little sense to introduce an attractive support measure which is fully EU funded and make little or no use of it here.</P>
    <P>There is further good news as this evening the Commission agreed to a further and very substantial increase in pigmeat refunds of 33.3 per cent which should be of further benefit to Irish producers. This refund increase is in response to a request made by Ireland and a number of other pigmeat exporting member states.  I am hoping we will see a major improvement in pigmeat processing and that major advantage will be taken of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> The fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland caused some additional problems for the market in the South.  A backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter built up.  To deal with this my Department, the IFA and the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors put arrangements in place for Saturday slaughterings.  I very sincerely thank the slaughterers for the efforts they have made following the intervention of myself, my staff and the Department.  There were a number of meetings with the farming organisations and the processors agreed to come to the rescue at that time.  The backlog has now been greatly reduced.  The problem of overhang of pigs on the market should be further lessened with the recent purchase of a major pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland by the owners of the plant which was destroyed by the fire last June.</P>
    <P>To assist pig producers I have also put a proposal to the EU Commission for an adjustment in the veterinary inspection fee to reflect the price payable to the producer at a particular time within the pig cycle.  I am pressing the Commission for an early response &mdash; to date there has not been a response.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has recently launched a pigmeat promotion campaign on the domestic market. This should in due course lead to increased consumption.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the subject of live exports. Live exports from Ireland to both EU and third countries are vital to maintaining competition in the cattle trade and in sustaining farm incomes. The seasonality of the livestock trade in Ireland makes market access for live exports particularly critical during the back end of the year when large numbers of weanlings come off farms.  I have consistently recognised the importance of promoting live exports and have taken action in a number of areas to ensure market access for our cattle, to both EU and third country markets.</P>
    <P>As regards trade with Libya, both the Opposition and the farming organisations are well aware that last July, following discussions over five days in Dublin, agreement was reached with a delegation from the Libyan Government which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the reopening of the Libyan market to Irish cattle and beef before the end of September.  This agreement was formally cleared by the Libyan authorities before the end of September.  Reaching this agreement marked the culmination of frequent contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997.  I identify with the IFA which was so involved in this issue and which clearly understands the current situation. The IFA was fronting the issue as much as I have ever seen it do.  In this it received much assistance from myself and others and I say well done. However, the market has not opened but we are making major progress in this area.  The Irish Ambassador in Rome and his assistant are currently in Tripoli.  They will probably return this evening or tomorrow and I am hoping they will have ironed out the difficulty.  We have done what we can as the regulatory authority and it is <Col N="1055" /> for traders and those involved in the business to take up the issue.  We are trying to iron out the difficulties.  The Libyan authorities have also indicated that they wish to have the agreement implemented as early as possible.  The problem is purely commercial rather than regulatory or diplomatic in character.</P>
    <P>The availability of shipping services to transport cattle and other livestock to export markets is, of course, a critical factor.  However, we must be clear about the facts.  Commercial operators of roll-on/roll-off ferries, both Pandoro and Irish Ferries, are again carrying livestock to the Continent and this is being augmented by the carriage of large numbers of animals on dedicated vessels. So far this year we have exported over 98,000 cattle to the Continent.  This is more than four times the number of cattle exported last year and twice the number exported in all of 1996.  Cattle exports to continental EU countries so far this year are already almost on a par with what we exported in 1995, which was the high point in recent years.  These are facts and figures which those who have sought to create an impression of crisis around live exports consistently ignore. Between 4,000 and 6,000 cattle per week have been exported to the Continent in recent weeks and I believe exports will continue at a high level.</P>
    <P>People in the industry told me that there are sufficient walk-on, walk-off ferries but there is a shortage of roll-on, roll-off ferries.  We realise that small animals travel better on roll-on, roll-off ferries, particularly to countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy.  Pandoro and Irish Ferries operate roll-on, roll-off services.  We are looking at additional ferries and hope that commercial operators will work in that direction.</P>
    <P>Over the past four weeks we exported more cattle than in 1997 to continental EU.  These figures speak for themselves, particularly when contrasted with the comments of those who have not acquainted themselves with the facts.  The Government has fully lived up to its obligations on this issue.  I have ensured that a detailed, ongoing monitoring of the trade is maintained and exporters are facilitated in every appropriate way in shipping animals to Europe and elsewhere. In that regard, I am particularly anxious to provide that the long-term interests of the trade are served by ensuring that relevant welfare, animal health and certification requirements are observed by all concerned.  My Department will, therefore, continue to give such matters careful attention and I again urge all other interested parties to do likewise.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion called for the extension of family income supplement to farmers and the self-employed generally.  This scheme, which was introduced in 1984, was designed to provide an incentive to employees with families to take up or remain in low paid employment.  There are cost difficulties in extending the FIS and there is no point in pretending otherwise.  There have been substantial changes in the interim, including, for <Col N="1056" /> instance, the change to net assessment of FIS which is to be introduced this month.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the role that the &ldquo;Smallholders Assistance&rdquo; can play in alleviating the difficulties faced by farmers with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Currently, more than 7,000 farmers are in receipt of £33 million annually under the scheme, which is available to all farmers on low incomes. The Minister assured me that his Department will be intensifying its information initiatives at local level to increase awareness of the scheme and to emphasise its applicability to farmers.  During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, the then Minister for Social Welfare in the coalition Government told a constituency colleague of mine that FIS was not workable.  I remind Opposition Members to check the record.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa stated:</P>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult to police an extension of the family income supplement scheme to the self-employed area.  Self-employed persons make their own returns with regard to income tax; by and large they have a self-assessment.  The intention of the family income supplement in the first instance was to assist those people who had children to support and who, because of the social welfare they were in receipt of, might be better off remaining on social welfare if the top-up was not available to them through the family income supplement.  I am willing to examine this issue again but I would not hold out any expectation that we would be in a position to extend FIS to the self-employed.</P>

      <P>The role of Bord Bia has also been raised.  More than £12.5 million has been allocated from Exchequer and EU funds to give a total budget of more than £18.3 million to the board for its activities in 1998.  This expenditure represents good value for money to the economy when one notes that many sectors, including dairy and food ingredients exports and the consumer foods and drinks sector showed an improved performance in 1997 compared with 1996.  Indeed, food and drink exports grew by more than 3 per cent in 1997 with earnings of almost £4.9 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the beef sector, Bord Bia, in conjunction with my Department, has recognised for some time that it is necessary to develop beyond its <Col N="1057" /> traditional core markets.  Bord Bia is focused on maintaining and improving the traditional markets, while at the same time developing markets in France, Italy and the Netherlands.  The board has done an excellent job on behalf of the food industry.  It is only a promotional agency with responsibility for growth in the home market.  It was a new concept initiated four years ago but in that time it has done excellent work.  One can look at the projections in its corporate plan; by and large it has reached them.  I am a little disappointed that Senator Connor should target such an organisation and be critical of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was not here for the debate.  I am disappointed he was not.</P>
      <P>The downturn in the pigmeat industry in recent times has been addressed by Bord Bia through programmes to promote pork on the domestic, European and international markets.  In addition, the board is identifying new markets and segments within existing markets for quality Irish pigmeat.  Similarly, the sheepmeat sector is being targeted by the board and the Department through a new quality assurance scheme.  The promotion of Irish lamb on new south Mediterranean markets during key supply periods will supplement marketing campaigns in traditional markets.</P>
      <P>Irish agriculture is facing difficulties as a result of conditions in our international markets and recent weather.  On both fronts the Government has taken effective action to support the industry through a range of measures, including improving access to intervention for beef cattle; increasing export refunds; putting transport facilities in place for live exports; reopening Iranian markets and maintaining contact with Libya to ensure live exports resume &mdash; all of which have been achieved; accelerating payments to farmers, more than 97 per cent successful; increasing advance payments; providing for advisory support and actively promoting our products on export markets.</P>
      <P>I also met meat exporters and sought a commitment from them on prices in return for the improved intervention in market access which I negotiated.  In addition we will put in place the special schemes targeted at the winter fodder problem this year.  My Department already spends £2 billion per year in support of agriculture. This is a level of support which no other sector enjoys, but we are committed to continuing it in order to protect our farm families and our agri-food industry.  This Government has proven by its actions that it is fully committed to the sector.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  This issue has been topical recently and throughout the summer, particularly with regard to fodder prices. This is our first opportunity to address it.  I have waited two weeks to respond to comments on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 30 September by the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, who announced that there was no crisis in Irish agriculture. I wondered whether he was living on the same planet as me, never mind the same country. I appreciate that the Minister is very much in touch with the situation on the ground but if the Government Chief Whip tells the nation on a major current affairs programme that there is no crisis, then the Minister present and his colleagues should set the record straight.  For the past month there have been rescue packages and special measures introduced in response to the pressures that are on people.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have alluded to the fall in cattle prices to their lowest in 25 years.  The Minister is aware of the problems in the pig industry.  The weather has been a big factor and throughout the country, as a result of these measures, farmers are resisting opportunities to sell fattened cattle because of the dreadful prices they are receiving. Due to the fodder shortages they will find it very hard to keep cattle housed over the winter period. I do not believe that the Minister is responsible for the weather.  If politicians could control the weather, I am sure we would have sunshine all the time.  However, I believe there is a responsibility on politicians to deal with the consequences of the weather and the other factors that impact on agriculture at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, have been very busy in the past few weeks.  A £10 million package was announced a few weeks ago to deal with the winter fodder difficulties. On 25 September an increase was announced in export refunds for beef and live cattle.  Four days prior to that we had a progress report on the reopening of the Libyan markets. Many people would like to know if that progress report was based on a firm foundation.  On 16 September the Minister announced an extra ship to accommodate cattle exports to the Continent. On 15 September he announced aids to the <Col N="1059" /> private storage scheme in the pigmeat sector. While all these measures and actions might go some way towards assisting in the short term, they will do nothing to ease the overriding crisis, which was pinpointed recently by Mr. Pat Lalor in the <i>Drystock Farmer</i> magazine.  Mr. Lalor stated as follows:</P>
    <P>The young people in farming are unsure of their future and are being scared by everything they hear and read about their gloomy future. They are being frightened by their friends who are earning £500 per week driving a digger with the full week-end off to enjoy their earnings.</P>
    <P>This crisis, rightly identified by Pat Lalor, is about the future of family farms and the communities they support.</P>
    <P>The decline in interest in farming is of greatest concern to disadvantaged areas where farms are small and where the brunt of the present difficulties are being felt most.  To this end, it is imperative that we do not just depend on a series of emergency measures to deal with the current crisis.  What is needed now more than ever is a proper agricultural policy which will ensure that it continues to be our most important indigenous industry and sustains the maximum number of people working in agriculture.</P>
    <P>During the last debate on agriculture in this House I mentioned installation aid.  This is an area to which I wish to return.  If a young person of 18 years finishes their leaving certificate and is considering a career in anything other than agriculture, the State will make a major investment in their future.  They will probably attend a regional college or university at a cost to the Exchequer of £6,000 or £7,000 per year.  They will then take up a job which is grant-aided by the IDA, Forbairt or an enterprise board.  If we are serious about encouraging young people to remain in agriculture we must adopt similar measures of support for them.  Since the suspension of installation aid there has been a marked decrease in the numbers attending agricultural college.  In 1996, 932 students enrolled in the 11 agricultural colleges, but these numbers dropped by more than 8 per cent in 1997.  According to the first quarterly household survey published in May, every economic sector except agriculture has indicated an increase in the numbers of people working in them.  In contrast, the period between April 1997 and November 1997 has shown a decrease of 6,000 in the numbers employed in the agricultural sector.  In April 1996, there were 141,000 people employed in this sector; in 1997, there were 141,000 in the sector also, but the latest figures show that only 134,000 are employed in this sector.  Recent statistics show that those people currently farming are on average the oldest in Europe, with only 12 per cent of farmers under the age of 35 years.  The average Irish farmer is now 15 years older than his Australian or New Zealand counterpart.  Added to this, people working in agriculture are among the <Col N="1060" /> poorest educated in the country, with a little more than half of workers in the sector having received second level education.</P>
    <P>The suspension of the installation aid scheme has been central to the problems associated with encouraging young people into farming.  I am very confused by the response of the Minister for Agriculture and Food over the last number of months in this issue.  The Minister has repeatedly given public assurances that proposals to introduce a modified version of the installation aid scheme are already in train.  In May we were told that the Minister for Finance had approved the scheme and it would be only a short time before it was implemented.  Last week Deputy Penrose was informed in the Dáil by the Minister of State that the proposals for the revamped scheme were only sent to the Commission in late July.  Since then the Commission has raised a number of questions regarding the proposals and as a result a date can no longer be given for its introduction. I believe the Minister has not been straight with us on this issue.  The delays in reintroducing the scheme are sending a negative message to young people who are considering agriculture as a career.  I would impress on the Minister the need to ensure in the forthcoming budget Exchequer funding for the installation aid scheme and reintroduce it as a matter of urgency.  A sum of £6.5 million would fund the scheme for a year.  This is a small price to pay for what is a very worthwhile intervention.  Last year, 94 people applied for participation in the installation aid scheme every month while 100 people left farming each week. The introduction of this scheme is the least the Government should do to halt the drift from farming.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on the announcements he has made.  The meeting he has outlined with the meat management association will go a long way towards alleviating some of the problems in agriculture. I am somewhat puzzled by what some speakers have said here this evening and I wonder have they read the announcements that have been made in the last few months.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his efforts.  I do not believe that Ministers for Agriculture and Ministers of State in the past have worked as hard to try to secure proper incomes for the farming sector.  I know there are difficulties in farming but more than the Minister must share the burden and come on side to help in these very difficult times.  Recently Minister Walsh said he was very disappointed with the meat factories for failing to take account of the serious difficulties facing farmers in the disposal of cattle.  They made a very small demand for cattle for intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of motions have been tabled by the Opposition and I would not like to see them rejected.  I support the motion tabled by Senator Cassidy.  In the past the Minister achieved higher export refunds for cattle to the tune of 5p, but it <Col N="1061" /> did not get through to the farmer.  Can the Minister be blamed for that despite his hard work to ensure the benefit would go to the hard pressed farmer?  He did excellent work trying to reopen trade with Libya and getting approval for boats dedicated to exporting cattle and sheep to the Continent.  I must compliment him on the boats used for exporting our young stock or weanlings. If the Government had not intervened to ensure boats were available, there would be a real crisis for small farmers.  Those farmers have been able to sell some of their stock.  Perhaps they would prefer to sell more, but at least much of the stock that has been exported and sold has not lost money.  With headage payments those farmers have done reasonably well.</P>
    <P>The speeding up of headage payments is very welcome.  Previously farmers had to wait until well into the following year to receive payments. I welcome the move by the Minister and his officials ensuring that payments have started and that a large number of payments will be made in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fodder scheme.  Some people would comment that it is only £10 million. However, £10 million is a large amount of money and I welcome it.  It is earmarked for people from areas which suffered real losses.  The Minister said he was in parts of Kerry and Limerick which suffered losses.  I am from an area which has losses every year as a result of the Shannon flooding.  I hope the Department will target this money at those who suffer losses.  I remember an incident where someone showed an empty silage pit but did not show his adjoining field in which he had 500 wrapped bales of silage, a substantial amount. I hope the £10 million is targeted at those with real need, particularly in areas where farmers have to carry their dairy stock over the winter and cannot dispose of them.</P>
    <P>I heard Members speak gloomily on the high refunds for cattle under the EU funded export credit guarantee scheme.  We all know there are problems but we can work together and help each other.  Some farmers have a substantial amount of feed and could help out fellow farmers by sharing or selling at reasonable cost.  Some farmers are selling at a high price and pushing hard pressed farmers further into borrowing from banks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and look forward to developments in the next few days. Hopefully factories will tender for the maximum amount for intervention to ensure a floor price is established in the beef sector.  If we get over the current difficulty, farming will go from strength to strength.  I have no doubt that the Minister will soon introduce installation aid for young farmers and farm pollution control.  These measures will help.  Some farmers are due payments.  Perhaps the Department could make early payments and this could keep these farmers afloat.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, is a brave man.  In the words of the poet John Milton &ldquo;You have with word clothed in reasons garb endeavoured to make the worse appear the better reason.&rdquo; Deputy O'Keeffe comes from a farming background and I am sure he would agree this is the worst time for farming in living memory.  Farmers are affected very badly, particularly those with low acreage and limited resources who are dependent on dry stock and sheep.  The crisis has been exacerbated by the serious fodder shortage to which Teagasc referred.  Moreover, the pig industry is also in crisis and our most important beef markets remain closed.  The depth of the fodder crisis is not understood or appreciated by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The Minister has been in denial of the crisis for a long time.  The Government's pathetic response to the farming crisis clearly indicates its profound lack of understanding of the depth and extent of the difficulties that livestock, sheep and pig farmers face.  The Minister has proved totally ineffective.  It is no wonder that such a damp squib of an aid package was all that was produced.</P>
      <P>Teagasc estimates 25,000 farmers will face additional fodder costs this winter, averaging £2,000 each.  The Government must introduce a better fodder aid scheme and allow intensive free Teagasc advice for farmers in need of assistance. The Minister has stood idly by as meat factories have gradually brought prices down to a lower level than at the height of the BSE crisis.  Factories have used the Russian crisis to cut cattle prices at home and this is extremely detrimental to the long-term stability of the cattle industry.  This is short-term opportunism and means a quick profit for the factories and more for the beef farms. However it does nothing for confidence in suppliers and is undermining the future of the industry. It looks after the barons who have cost the taxpayers so much; we are still picking up their tab.</P>
      <P>This is all going on against the background of farmers being forced off the land.  If nothing is done to stop this, Irish farming will wither as increasing numbers of young people opt out of agriculture to pursue more secure and better paid jobs in towns and cities.  One of the key measures which should be reintroduced is the installation aid scheme.  It should be expanded, with a total of £12,000 being made available to young eligible applicants over a five year period.  It is also necessary to provide new entrants to the industry with farm development loans up to a maximum value of £30,000 which would be subject to a special rate of interest discounted by 3 per cent per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Stamp duty on the transfer of land to new farmers should be abolished and there should be tax relief on the profits from farming for the duration of his or her first long-term land lease.  With regard to quotas, new entrants to farming should be given the same treatment as small quota holders, making them eligible for quota priority rights in order to ensure they directly benefit from any increase in available quota.</P>
    <P>Much has been said, rightly, about the need to extend the family income supplement to farmers. It is incomprehensible and discriminatory that this has not been applied.  It is badly needed to provide an income safety net for low income families, particularly when one considers what they face in the spring when fodder will not be available and when what will be available will be unaffordable. It is disgraceful, given that equality is guaranteed under the Constitution, that a Government is not prepared to look after people who are facing not having the wherewithal to survive in the near future.</P>
    <P>It was disappointing that there was no clear or comprehensive statement by the Minister of State on the agreement, if any, with Libya and Iran.  He said the Government would ensure that everything possible is done to get Libya to honour the agreement reached between the two Governments in July.  Was the agreement made in the desert with lines drawn in the sand?  Everybody knows what happens to such agreements.  The Minister of State also referred to the conclusion of contracts.  It appears that the agreement, unfortunately, is far from being firmly in place.  I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a need to provide adequate shipping infrastructure to transport the maximum number of weanlings and other livestock to the Continent. The Government has been singularly inept in this regard.  There is no proper structure in place. Many farmers and exporters combined in a co-operative way to ensure better arrangements in this regard and they have been sadly let down by the Government.</P>
    <P>Many other matters of great concern to farming families are listed in the motion.  I agree there are many factors at work but, sadly, the Government is not tackling any of them well or adequately.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Ministers of State at his Department for their efforts on behalf of the industry at a time of unprecedented difficulty. One cannot overestimate the depth of the crisis which confronts the industry.  It has been defined in substantial detail in the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis is not in dispute.  It is affecting all sectors including beef, sheep and pigs.  However, <Col N="1064" /> it is important to look at the figures and not just at what goes on in the background.  Much attention has focused on the fact that approximately 3,500 people leave the land each year.  It is significant that when one consults the ESRI about this, one is told that the figure represents people who retire, people who die and people who have no heirs.  It does not represent commercial, active farmers.  They are not leaving the land but are farming their way through the crisis and, with the help of this Government, we hope they succeed.</P>
    <P>By any economic yardstick, agriculture is falling further and further behind the rest of the economy and is not benefiting from the Celtic tiger.  In terms of numbers employed, output or exports, agriculture is falling behind.  That has been the case for many years.  The figure of 3,500 for the number of people who leave the land each year has been applicable for the past 20 years, as was acknowledged by one of the Opposition Senators.</P>
    <P>The crisis exists and the question is what will be done about it.  The significance of the industry and its importance for the Irish economy is accepted by all.  However, it must also be acknowledged that it is of declining importance and that, in terms of numbers employed, it has been overtaken by the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Look at some of the successes.  Live exports in 1998 are four times greater than they were for 1997.  The number of live exports to date this year are running at twice the total for all of 1997.  That is tangible evidence of the Government's success in securing extra boats to export live cattle.</P>
    <P>The current Minister differs in only one respect from his predecessor.  Both are alike in terms of energy, effort and talent but the current Minister differs in the area of propaganda.  He does not make a big fuss about what he does and does not constantly trot out to the Irish Farm Centre for photo opportunities.  Every Minister for Agriculture this country has had was and is committed to defending the industry and doing their best on its behalf in Brussels.  To suggest otherwise is wrong.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it that the fire in the Bally money pig plant, which caused devastation in the pig industry, was caused by the Minister for Agriculture and Food?  Are we to take it that the 170 per cent of normal rainfall in June and July which fell at Belmullet and Clones is his fault?  Are we to conclude that the fall in the Russian rouble and the collapse of the Russian market, which was taking 70,000 tonnes of Irish beef a year and which took 38,000 tonnes until its collapse, was caused by the Minister?  Of course not and it is ridiculous to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>What can be done, apart from carrying out publicity stunts by camping in Agriculture House as organised and choreographed by the publicity department in the Irish Farm Centre?  The news announced by the Minister of State with regard to intervention is one way of dealing with it.  I do not like intervention.  Many of the problems in <Col N="1065" /> this industry were caused by intervention.  Farmers did not have to sell to the consumer and, consequently, did not have to pay any attention to the consumer.  However, if intervention is required to clear a temporary glut on the market, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>We need to examine what Agenda 2000 will do to this industry.  If we are to keep our eye on any ball, that is the one to watch because it is the most important.  Teagasc gave great impetus to the agriculture industry in the 1970s.  It transformed the technology and introduced high input, high output profitable farming.  That energy must be rediscovered.  Teagasc has a serious responsibility to provide the technology which will reintroduce impetus in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I agree with Senator Dardis that nobody disputes that agriculture is experiencing great difficulty at present.  There is also no doubt that it is not due to the Minister or the Ministers of State.  I compliment them on the work they have done in recent months, particularly in dealing with problems in beef exports.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Opposition acknowledges that the Minister is not responsible for the weather or for Russia's currency problems.  That is a welcome change because he is being held responsible for everything else.  A negative campaign is being staged by a number of farming organisations.  It seems to be their way of operating for many years that every problem that has arisen in agriculture is a crisis, but when we have difficulties in agriculture the public perception is that the farmers are at it again.  The farming organisations are helping neither themselves nor the people they are supposed to represent with such campaigns.</P>
      <P>We all accept that there are problems in agriculture. I compliment the Minister on his efforts, particularly the increase in export refunds.  The role of the meat factories should be emphasised; they did not pass that increase on to producers. There is no reduction in the price of meat in shops either, and perhaps supermarkets should be targeted for not lowering meat prices for consumers. Beef sales have dropped all over the world, but if a greater emphasis were placed on reducing the price of cheaper cuts of meat rather than the price of sirloin steaks, that might increase consumption, which would help in the long term.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem in my area, apart from the weather, is the difficulty with pig slaughtering facilities.  We have suffered as a result of the fire in Ballymoney, and despite the Minister of State's best efforts with the McCarron's meat factory in Cavan, matters are not working as we would wish. However, I compliment him on his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the McKinsey report we should be looking into small farmers forming processing groups to increase their influence with meat factories and shops.  That could help them to secure <Col N="1066" /> better prices.  We seem to be in an age of large producers, and this may be the way small farmers should work.</P>

The detail of the motion is such that it means there is a crisis, and the Minister of State is in a defensive mood because he sees merit in the points we are making.  I am glad attention was drawn to the fact that we are not blaming anyone for the weather or the Russian crisis.  However, the best indication to me that there is a crisis has come during my presence on local radio in the last few days.</P>

      <P>The Senator should listen.  Most of the current affairs programmes have been devoted to farmers, and there is no urban-rural divide.  City dwellers are aware of the seriousness of the problem and the only intervention came when they hoped that there would be a reduction in meat prices for them.  Shoppers saw no appreciable drop in the cost of meat across the counter.</P>
      <P>I am a farmer's daughter, and I know there were periods of crisis in agriculture the past.  I did not just meet representatives of the farming organisations at the National Ploughing Championships; I also met farmers' wives, and the problems farmers were facing was the only subject people were discussing.  We are talking about all farmers, but particularly those on low acre farms with few resources and who depend on dry stock and sheep.</P>
      <P>It was stated on local radio that cattle prices had dropped to their lowest in 25 years at 68p per pound.  Fine Gael is not crying wolf, because that is a fact and has exacerbated the situation for farmers who are already hard hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was aware when preparing for this debate that the Minister for Agriculture and Food was going to be in Brussels fighting for changes in the EU intervention regulations.  He made a verbal agreement with Commissioner Fischler over the telephone. I am glad that the Minister of State made a positive proposal in allowing 04 grade animals, good quality Irish bullocks, into this scheme.  We are not churlish.  We welcome this proposal and we know the Minister is in Brussels fighting for Irish farmers.  However, there was nothing but aspirational language in the Minister of State's comments.  As a teacher, I always look at tenses, <Col N="1067" /> and I would be happier to see things accomplished in the past tense rather than being promoted for the future.  The problem is that we are hearing that various things will happen, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not at all happy with aspirational language for the future.  We can look ahead for certain things, but I would prefer the past tense to describe what have been achieved.</P>
      <P>The fodder crisis has been uppermost in farmers' minds.  We have not said we do not accept that there has been a lousy summer.  One could not even call it summer, and the weather has been atrocious even until now.  However, silage could not be cut and there will be a winter of discontent and poverty.  Last year one would have paid £10 for a bale of silage, but this year, if one has the money, it will cost £20.  Again, this is a fact that farmers will have to live with.</P>

      <P>There is no incentive for young people to go into farming.  When they look at their points and realise they can study engineering, computing, science or medicine, they will opt to study one of those.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct the Minister of State on one issue.  At the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Family, Deputies Mary Wallace and McGrath accepted that farmers should get the family income supplement and it was included in a submission. That is the contradiction.  Both of them advocated the committee's suggestion regarding the supplement.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed we did not hear a more pragmatic and positive message rather than having to scrutinise what is happening in Brussels and wonder what is happening in Libya.  We felt we should have received this information on 26 September, but we still have no definite facts.  I had hoped to hear what has been done, not what is hoped will be done in future.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Senators Chambers and Walsh.  There is a crisis in the farming industry; there is no denying that. I live in a rural area which has a huge problem with fodder.  Everything seems to be on fire at present &mdash; the pig industry, the sheep industry and the beef industry.  The existing problem must be resolved.  People in the industrial area were under extreme pressure when exporting to the <Col N="1068" /> UK because there was a difference of 17 per cent or 18 per cent between the punt and sterling and they had to face up to their problems.  I am sure farmers could do the same if they cut their cloth to suit their measure.  The biggest crisis facing them at the moment relates to pricing and the biggest problem they will face this winter will be with fodder.  If that can be contained, we can overcome this crisis and the industry will grow. Farmers would be better off if they got together and worked with the Government and Opposition to try to resolve the problems.  I appeal to those people to try to work together.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I thank Senator Dan Kiely for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>Everybody, including the Government, recognises that there is a crisis in the industry and is trying to work out a solution but market forces are the real issue at the end of the day.  I welcome this evening's announcement of intervention though, as a Senator said earlier, it is not an answer to the trade problem.  However, it will alleviate the huge amount of stock held within the agricultural sector particularly in beef and it will help to bring buoyancy to the industry and will mean money in farmers' pockets.</P>
      <P>In times of crisis there is a responsibility on meat factories and the people involved in the business to see that farmers get their fair share and that they do not take advantage of the money provided in intervention.  With the ewe scheme for mountain sheep, for which there is no place at present, and which runs in tandem with the Government's policy of the REP scheme, I think the factories have an obligation to be reasonable and fair.  The Government and farming organisations must succeed in getting agreement on that before the schemes are implemented.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Agriculture Ministers have done everything in their power to provide opportunities for trade which are very difficult to find and sustain.  Every opportunity in relation to premium and headage payments has been taken by the Government with a view to getting payments to farmers and putting money into the pockets of the people who need it.  I have been in communication with farming organisations but they have not come up with a solution to the problem of long-term sustainability.  It is an industry that needs to be looked at and planned for in the future.  Substantial changes are taking place within the industry but unless it is properly planned we will again find ourselves in the same position in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>It will be difficult to do justice to the debate in one minute.  It is important to recognise when we talk about crisis that we can perpetuate and increase the level of problems within the industry.  There are obviously difficulties, ones which have been there for quite some time.  Sustainability is one such problem which <Col N="1069" /> requires long term ongoing policies to redress that situation.  It is important that we do not have a campaign of misinformation and politicisation of the situation.  While politicising various economic issues is the work of the Opposition, it is regrettable that the IFA in particular have gone down that road.  If agriculture needs anything at this stage, it is a very responsible, considered approach and professional leadership from those involved in the industry.  Without doubt efforts and initiatives have been taken which will reduce the difficulties in farming, but they will not ameliorate them completely.  Those difficulties which have existed for some time will need to be addressed in a comprehensive way over the coming months and years.  The various interested parties involved must be harnessed to work in a much more cohesive way.  In this way we can ensure that the real difficulties are tackled in a way beneficial to farmers and to the social and demographic situation of this island in which farming has played such a pivotal role.</P>

They want action and they want it now.  We do not want to hear long winded speeches that mean nothing; we want action. Young people who wish to make a career of farming are finding they are not wanted or welcome. There is no incentive for them to take up farming. The Minister did not mention young farmers in his speech.  What is essential is that young people in particular be given a financial incentive to get into farming.  Fine Gael, in Government, have a policy whereby we will give a grant of approximately £14,000 set up for young farmers to get into the business.  Farming is becoming a very difficult business.  We need to have bigger farms in order just to stand still.  The system is wrong; it is driving out the smaller farmer, the backbone of <Col N="1070" /> the country.

      <P>I am grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me this opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment and I appreciate that the Minister has come to the House to respond.  When I tabled the matter for debate last week, the situation looked much blacker than it does today.  Thankfully, progress was made yesterday and today thanks to the intervention of the ESB group of unions.  As I had to remind a journalist earlier, we are not yet out of the woods.  We must ensure the opportunity now presented to us to avert a dreadful disaster is grasped and made work.</P>
      <P>On 24 September a bombshell was dropped in County Offaly when ESB management arrived to announce their intention to recommend to the board of the ESB that the £16 million refurbishment programme in Ferbane should not proceed and, as a result, the station would close next year.  This refurbishment programme was in a way a result of an initiative taken a few years ago by the ESB workers in Ferbane along with their colleagues in Bord na Móna to prolong peat generation at the station well into the next century. After a feasibility study and a report on the issue, there was great joy early in 1997 when this news was announced.  It was seen as a lifeline for many communities in west Offaly in serious social and economic decline.  Senator Moylan and I attended a meeting on Monday night of the West Offaly Partnership where the elements of that decline were painted in stark detail.</P>
      <P>It was hoped with last year's announcement that jobs would be secured not only in the ESB and Bord na Móna but in the many supply and service industries and outlets dependent on these companies.  On 24 September this hope seemed to be dashed with this announcement.  A black depression descended on the county, particularly in the past week when no resolution seemed to be in sight.  All the local bodies in the county voiced their concern.  County Offaly VEC, of which I am a member, contacted the Minister and the ESB management and group of unions to express its concern about the effect Ferbane's closure would have on a number of schools in the county, many of which were already under pressure for numbers.</P>
      <P>Offaly County Council, after an emergency meeting, set up a special group to work on the issue, which the Minister met at very short notice last week.  In my contribution to the council debate I stressed that the only solution could be a negotiated one.  Feelings locally were running high, boycotts and ostracisation in a small community were being talked about.  Pressure such as this can divide a community for generations.  I hoped that the ESB industrial council would find a solution last Thursday week and I was disappointed when it adjourned without finding one. However, I am glad that a negotiated outcome is being considered again.</P>
      <P>Many soundings and contacts continued to be made on all sides and I welcome yesterday's initiative by the group of unions.  I am glad that its proposals have been accepted by both sides as a basis for progress.  I hope the industrial council will recommend a solution soon and that this will not only be accepted but implemented.  Most of all, I want the refurbishment project at Ferbane to proceed without any further delay on anybody's part.</P>
      <P>However, even if it proceeds quickly as we all hope, it will not solve the problems of west Offaly or of peat generation by the ESB in the midlands. Serious issues remain to be addressed in Rhode and Shannonbridge in my constituency and also in Lanesboro.  Serious measures need to be taken by the ESB, the Minister and the Government to reassure the public that peat generation, even in a competitive environment, will remain part of the energy mix in Ireland as long as reserves permit. Confidence in these other stations is very low and must be restored if genuine partnership is to work again and if progress is to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even more fundamental is the need to plan for a future in west Offaly when peat and peat generation are no more.  Even when the refurbishment at Ferbane goes ahead, it will be for a limited lifespan.  A special task force or group of some type needs to be established by the Government at this stage, to address this issue, involving the ESB, Bord na Móna, the local authorities and statutory agencies with the assistance of funding from Exchequer and EU sources.  People in <Col N="1073" /> County Offaly have first hand experience of what the loss of a peat fired power station meant in Portarlington.  We do not wish to see it repeated elsewhere in our county without proper provision being made.  There is no point waiting until the dreaded day comes to face up to it.  We need action on this issue now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on the outstanding contribution she made to resolving this matter.  The news trickling through from the unions in Ferbane is that things are looking good and I thank the Minister and all those involved.  They did their utmost to bring about the result which appears to have been achieved with the unions.  I look forward to the Minister's comments in that regard.</P>
      <P>We made every effort with certain people in the area to meet their requirements and bring them on side.  However, some of those who were deeply involved would not meet public representatives. Some of them called a press conference today in Tullamore to make a number of announcements.  I wonder why they called a press conference when they would not meet elected public representatives for the area.</P>
      <P>The closure of the plant in Ferbane would have sounded the death knell for south-west Offaly.  It would have finished the area as an industrial zone and the Bord na Móna operation in Boora would have closed.  I commend a number of people in other unions for their efforts in bringing others on side.  They worked long and hard and much of the time they should have spent with their families was spent trying to reach a settlement and talking common sense into certain individuals in the area.  I compliment them on their efforts.</P>
      <P>I am a member of an enterprise board in County Offaly, and over the past five years approximately 300 permanent jobs have been created.  When I left home this morning it appeared that those jobs, with the exception of one or two, would be lost in one fell swoop. Thankfully, on the basis of the information available, it appears circumstances have changed and we look forward to the ESB going ahead with the developments in Ferbane.  This will secure employment in the Ferbane ESB generating station and Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister were never found wanting in the past in ensuring the continuation and development of Bord na Móna and the ESB.  I look forward to necessary developments in the future in Rhode and Shannonbridge. There is some distance to go yet and the board is due to meet on Friday.  I hope that by the time it meets in Athlone this matter will have been put to rest and the Minister can concentrate on the development of this and other semi-State companies to ensure more jobs are created in County Offaly.  I compliment the Minister on making herself available for this debate and thank her for her excellent work behind the scenes.  She met members of Offaly County Council at short notice and ensured that the ESB met <Col N="1074" /> us.  I thank the Minister and wish her well in the future development of County Offaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be here for this important debate.  Senator Gallagher and Senator Moylan put their finger on it when they said we are at the door in terms of a solution.  However, we are not yet through the door and there remains cautious rather than full blooded optimism on the matter.  The refurbishment of Ferbane power station is vital and necessary if the town, its environs, Shannonbridge, Boora and Blackwater, are to be sustained over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>The issue of refurbishment arose following an examination in 1994-5 by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, of the options in relation to the power stations.  A firm proposal was made that unit four of the Ferbane station should be refurbished at a cost of £11 million.  The cost has since increased to £16 million but the idea behind the project was to secure employment in Ferbane, Boora and elsewhere.  It appeared that was the road ahead until the difficulties arose approximately 18 months ago regarding the non-implementation of part of the CCR agreement which was reached at local level. It is important to note that the plan was agreed at local level.</P>
      <P>As we are aware, competitive manning levels and new work practices are essential if the ESB is to survive in the new liberalised regime which will come on stream on 17 February 2000.  At that time 28 per cent of the top customers will be open to competition.  When we talk about the new millennium it appears to be a long time away. However, the date for the new liberalised regime is only 18 months away.</P>
      <P>The people who conceived the CCR agreement and those who followed it up and signed it were aware that changes had to take place to bring about a competitive environment.  Everybody was delighted when the decision to refurbish the station was taken and they looked forward to the implementation of the plan.  The construction phase alone would bring about much employment and, following completion, the idea is that it would provide secure employment for the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gallagher mentioned the decision not to proceed with the plan which was announced by the ESB almost three weeks ago. The shock in Ferbane and surrounding areas was huge and it reached as far as Athlone.  A large amount of gloom and pessimism was engendered as it seemed there was no way out.  There has been frenzied activity since.  This was carried on at the proper level of communication, probing, lobbying and discussion. I commend the group of unions, the ESB management, Offaly County Council, the agencies which contacted me, including the VEC, Senator Gallagher and the Kilcormac Enterprise Group.  I formally met the ESB management, <Col N="1075" /> accompanied by Senators Moynihan and Gallagher, Deputy Cowen and the representatives of that section of Offaly County Council.  We had a good meeting and the Senators then went to the ESB.</P>
    <P>I also formally met the unions.  Over the past weeks I have had informal discussions with different members of the unions who have kept me abreast of events.  I also pay tribute to John Brown and Eugene Coughlan from my Department who played a stalwart role.</P>
    <P>This was a situation which was best served by people going about their business quietly but with a great sense of purpose.  Some disputes demand shouting and others demand that work is done in a quieter fashion.  This issue was one of the latter. It was an acute and intense issue which needed that level of attention and I commend the two Senators for giving it that attention.  I also commend Deputy Cowen who had many discussions with me over the past few months as the situation became more difficult.</P>
    <P>We are not through the gate yet.  This evening's decision is a step forward.  It has been decided that the matter should go to arbitration with the joint industrial council and that any agreement would be adhered to.  The ESB has properly decided that the refurbishment will not begin until there are manifest indications that the agreement and the merging of the two grades has happened.  If the ESB is ever to make headway in what will be a difficult environment, it will have to be that way.  The two groups will have to be merged.  I understand Senator Moynihan's comments.  I also heard that there was to be a press conference this evening.  Now that we have reached this point and so much work has been put in, I appeal to people not to jeopardise the agreement.  All those involved should decide to move forward.  Ferbane and its surrounding areas, all of those who work in the power station and all who depend on it, must be determined that there will be no faltering at the final hurdle which remains to be surmounted.</P>
    <P>Senators Moynihan and Gallagher have played an important role.  The process needed to be managed and both Senators have done so as evidenced by the timely manner of this debate.  I am proud to be from Athlone.  My husband's family are from County Offaly and I have had no lack of advice as to how to proceed with this matter.  I am hopeful but I am also cautious.  I would ask that every commitment be given by everyone to move to the final stage &mdash; the realisation of the £16 million refurbishment.  The construction will give much needed employment and its implementation will guarantee employment for the next 15 to 20 years.  That is the hopeful and optimistic road ahead.  I thank the Senators for their contributions and the democratic and purposeful way in which they have gone about their business on this important topic. <Col N="1076" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has come to the House to deal with the issue of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  My motion asks for the Minister to undertake a prevalence study to interview the parents and sufferers of ADHD as part of a representative survey.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I have been given permission to have research conducted on the level of services available for the treatment of ADHD in the UK, the USA and Ireland with a view to publishing the findings and recommendations. I am asking the Minister to undertake stage two of that objective &mdash; the prevalence study.</P>
      <P>Even though ADHD has been treated for over 30 years in most parts of the world, it is still a relatively new phenomenon in Ireland.  While it is generally accepted that early assessment and treatment are important, the reality is that many people are only hearing about ADHD in their adolescence and adulthood.  This is why it is important that we conduct further research.</P>
      <P>As a teacher I probably taught ADHD students but did not recognise their condition.  I possibly would have thought they suffered from dyslexia or from social or behavioural problems. We now realise that those children may have suffered from ADHD.  It is interesting that the reason this came to my attention was that two former pupils of mine are now the parents of ADHD children.  They approached me some years ago because they knew there was something wrong with their children but could not say exactly what it was.  Mothers instinctively know that it is not just speech difficulties, disruptive behaviour or learning difficulties &mdash; there is something inherently wrong.  Many parents have spent a fortune going from psychologists to psychiatrists without getting the treatment they require.</P>
      <P>ADHD is accepted internationally as a medical condition of brain dysfunction.  We held a seminar last Saturday week in the Mary Immaculate College of Education which was attended by over 300 people.  There were eminent speakers at the conference, in particular Dr. Kewley and the headmaster of a school for children with special difficulties in the UK.  It was a riveting and intense seminar attended by psychologists, psychiatrists, parents and teachers.  The attentive nature of the audience was uncanny, given that ADHD patients suffer from a lack of attentiveness.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the brain dysfunction relates to the left lobe of the brain and that a sufferer cannot take responsibility for his or her actions.  ADHD is marked by a lack of sustained attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no class distinction among ADHD sufferers. ADD is another form of the disorder marked by introversion rather than hyperactivity <Col N="1077" /> and more common among girls than boys.  It is very sad to see people sitting in another world because they are not able to tune in to the reality of the situation around them.  The children do not necessarily come from disadvantaged areas but they are at risk of being early school-leavers; in some cases they turn to substance abuse and become juvenile offenders.  In the past, parents were accused of being soft, middle class parents who spoiled their children.  Psychologists may have advised them to do a parenting course to help them deal with their children and they were sent away with the impression they were failures when they instinctively knew that was not true.</P>
    <P>ADHD occurs in 3 to 5 per cent, or 105,000 to 175,000, of the general population.  It occurs in 10 per cent of boys and 5 per cent of girls at primary level, 80 per cent having the disorder as adolescents and 65 per cent still symptomatic as adults.  Those statistics are very stark.  This issue will not go away.  I have case studies relating to the trauma the condition inflicts on entire households. I know people who have separated because the mother was able to tune into the child but the father was unable to stick the strain.  Siblings become so irritated at the level of attention being given to the sufferer that family disruption occurs.</P>
    <P>In regard to comorbid conditions, 43 per cent of those with the disorder suffer lifetime anxiety disorders, 30 per cent have oppositional defiant disorders, 20 per cent suffer conduct disorders, 10 per cent suffer antisocial personality disorders, 27 per cent suffer alcohol related problems, 18 per cent develop drug dependency and 28 per cent of those with the disorder suffer separation and divorce as opposed to 15 per cent of non-ADD people.</P>
    <P>There is a desperate need for services for adolescents and adult sufferers of ADD.  The seven support groups in the country collectively estimate 30 to 40 phone calls per day from people seeking services for assessment, diagnosis and treatment.  Our Lady's Hospital cannot take children over 14 years of age and, in spite of the fact the service has only been available for six months, has an eight month waiting list.  There are no available services for adolescents or adults and many families seek treatment in the UK.  If the services were available here, savings would be made in regard to the cost of sending people abroad.</P>
    <P>Medications commonly used to treat ADD and ADHD in adults in other countries are not approved here because of restrictions set by the Irish Medicines Board.  This must be investigated and addressed.  Ritalin is not approved for adults in Ireland and most doctors are unfamiliar with medicines used to treat the condition.</P>
    <P>There is currently no known comprehensive training programme for medical and educational professionals in the country.  There is an urgent need for a national task force on ADHD/ADD and related conditions which would include representatives from INCADDS, the Irish National <Col N="1078" /> Council of ADD Support Groups.  We need a national co-ordinator to organise research, professional training, assessment and treatment services across the country.  We need funding for the national and local support groups, designated ADHD centres in Limerick, Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford, where action committees are already in place and senior psychologists who would train psychologists already working in hospital and health board positions and student psychologists.  We need a consultant adult psychiatrist, child psychiatrist and paediatrician in each health board with special training and expertise in the condition and related conditions and we need training for registrars.  We need a research programme which would include a national prevalence survey, an assessment of ADHD among children in care, a survey of ADHD sufferers among those incarcerated, particularly among those under 30 years of age, and a proposal for specially adapted Youthreach/FÁS vocational programmes which can be combined with psychiatric services in multiplex sites.</P>
    <P>Liaison would be required with the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to develop a course with practical classroom experience which could be incorporated into basic teacher training programmes at university level.  Training programmes for the recognition and classroom management of ADHD children should be provided for current teachers and local screening committees should be set up to screen children prior to eight years of age and to train teachers in identification and management strategies.  An integrated approach to the problem is required.  A figure of £30,000 would be required to carry out the prevalence study; that is not a major cost.  The other issues which I have addressed would have to be incorporated into a comprehensive programme further down the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to come into the House to address this issue which is of particular interest to Senator Jackman and I commend her on her interest and work in this area.  As the Senator may be aware, estimates of the prevalence of ADD or ADHD vary with the degree or intensity of difficulty. ADHD is an internationally recognised condition of brain dysfunction.  It is a complicated and variable condition with many different presentations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behaviour in children is recognised as a disorder when these behaviours are severe, developmentally inappropriate and impair functioning at home or at school.  The numbers presented to the health boards who require medical care would indicate that the prevalence rate is in line with the international norms at approximately 1 to 3 per cent of the child population and is based on criteria for the disorder contained in <Col N="1079" /> the ICD &mdash; the international classification of diseases.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the gradient of dysfunctional intensity can vary greatly and it is important to seek evidence of other psychological conditions such as stress disorders and adjustment reactions before a definitive diagnosis and treatment programme may be undertaken.  A physical examination is useful in ruling out issues such as hearing problems or neurological conditions. Nevertheless, the numbers presenting to the health service may not be representative of the level of children presenting with ADHD-like symptoms and it is therefore crucial that the role of the educational sector is properly recognised, with teachers being provided with the necessary skills in identifying a child under stress.</P>
    <P>A Department of Education and Science planning group, on which the Department of Health and Children was represented, has just finalised a report on the development of a national educational psychological service for all schools and arrangements are being put in place to establish this service under a national educational psychological <Col N="1080" /> service agency early in 1999.  It is intended there will be consultation with the Department of Health and Children on how a new national education psychological service will relate to psychiatric services provided by the health boards for children and young people and on related matters such as the development of guidance and counselling and support for schools in relation to children under stress.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in the process of formulating a policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services which will include consideration of the specific needs of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Services will be further developed as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I will inquire as to whether the prevalence study referred to by the Senator could be undertaken in the context of the formulation of a policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services which is currently being considered.  I will inform the Senator of what the official view on that is.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 October 1998.</P>
