    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 16, motion 34.  All Stages of item 1 will be taken today, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; Senators may share time.  Item 2, Motion for Earlier Signature, is to be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 1.  Committee and Remaining Stages of item 3 will be taken at 4 p.m. Item 16, motion 34, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Item 3 will resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. The Leader indicated to me, perhaps he could confirm to the House, that he hopes to arrange a short debate on Northern Ireland tomorrow.  We would be very pleased if he could do that.</P>
      <P>I gather he also has plans, arising from the discussion in the House yesterday, to have a short debate on the centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  While it is not an association with which I have intimate knowledge, it does a great deal of good work and I would be very happy to have that debate.  My dear mother, who has been a member for even longer than Senator Cassidy, would doubtless approve.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Leader's attention to item 4 on the Order Paper, which is not being taken today but which is a motion to approve draft regulations.  In the past, this House had a committee which examined regulations in some detail. This is an area which should be addressed in the context of Seanad reform.  A great number of regulations come into effect without being examined in any way by either House of the Oireachtas.  I suggest to the Leader that this is a matter at which Committee on Procedure and Privileges could very profitably look, to see if we could reconstitute a committee which would examine draft regulations before they are put into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the fact, which I gather was not referred to yesterday, that the Palestinian Assembly has passed a very important vote removing from the constitution of the PLO the threat to the State of Israel.  That is an act of remarkable generosity and political skill on the part of Mr. Arafat and it should be noted.</P>
      <P>This House has debated East Timor many times.  I ask the Leader to ensure that the last debate held here, which was very important, including the resolution which was passed, be made directly available to the Minister, Deputy Andrews, who I understand will be visiting Indonesia, and perhaps East Timor, and may have the opportunity to visit Xanana Gusmao. This is a most important development.  I am not trying to open a debate, but I would like the Leader to pass on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the strong support of this House.  I understand from my sources that a very significant opportunity will open up during his visit for Ireland to play a pivotal role in the negotiations between Xanana Gusmao and the Indonesian authorities.  Perhaps I could speak to the Leader privately about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no problem with the Order of Business.  Will the Leader clarify the position in regard to item 4, which has suddenly appeared on the Order Paper and was not included in the original schedule distributed to Members?  If it is proposed to take it tomorrow it should be taken with rather than without debate, as appears to have been customary.</P>
      <P>With regard to item 16, motion 20, today's newspapers have stories about unpaid tax by restauranteurs, publicans and hoteliers.  A former Taoiseach has had his £2 million tax bill reduced to zero.  In the eyes of the public we are fast becoming a banana republic in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this what zero tolerance means?  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance if it would not be appropriate to refer the matter regarding the former Taoiseach to the Criminal Assets Bureau?  Here is a man with an extraordinary lifestyle in terms of a mansion, an island, a yacht and racehorses, which is not substantiated by funding from his salary as a Member of the Oireachtas.  There may well be a role for the Criminal Assets Bureau here.</P>

      <P>The House has debated all these matters at great length and they have been referred to other fora.  I would prefer if the Senator did not continue along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader not bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance, both of whom have a responsibility in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the matter of attempted abductions of children around the country.  It happened in my town of Mullingar. I am deeply concerned about the matter.  I have spoken to the Minister since I raised it in the House and he informs me it was raised yesterday in the other House.  The House should show its concern at this very serious development.  It must be the nightmare of every parent.  As a parent of a young daughter I am deeply concerned, as I am sure is everybody else.  The House should invite the Minister to make a statement and perhaps hold a short debate.  It would heighten public awareness of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The area aid section of the Department of Agriculture and Food has final vetting with regard to income support payments to farmers.  This year tens of thousands of such payments have been withheld because of errors made in the section.  Under a charter of rights granted to farmers, the Minister is bound to ensure that all such income support payments are paid by a certain date in each year and that, as far as possible, attempts are made to achieve that. However, that is not happening this year and we are now approaching the festival of Christmas when greater amounts of money are needed by everybody.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister.  Given the limited time remaining to the end of the session, it would be impracticable for the Minister to explain matters to the House or for us to make our views known to him.  I ask the Leader to appeal to him to ensure that, as far as possible, all payments should be made before that section closes for Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That item 16, motion 30, be taken at the commencement of business.</P>
      <P>Probably half of the young people of the State have participated in fasts of one kind or another for one of the two big organisations that provide aid for the developing world.  It is nothing short of a scandal that the State has decided that these people need no more money next year, which will be the most affluent in the State's history.</P>
      <P>We were misled in the House by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a most untypical and regrettable fashion, the House was led astray and given an incorrect impression.  I do not believe it was an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the concept of welfare in this country?  We have three forms of welfare &mdash; social welfare, corporate welfare and agricultural welfare.  Each involves the transfer of large resources to sustain people's incomes unrelated to any productive effort on <Col N="1172" /> their part.  Given that approximately half the budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food constitutes welfare, it should be transferred to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the matter raised this morning and yesterday by Senator Glynn.  A debate would be appropriate, especially when the Minister gave a comprehensive statement to the other House yesterday.  This issue can be linked to another area covering the abuse of children. Many video games will be bought by parents this Christmas.  I would be grateful if the Leader would lend his support in conveying my concern to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there is an urgent need for an amendment of the Video Recordings Act.  Video games are an exempted category.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter this time last year because it was appropriate to do so.  The Department said then that, although it had sympathy with the proposed amendment to the Act, it was unable to deal with the matter because of the backlog of legislation.  However, sympathy is now running short.  Although 97 per cent of video games are inoffensive, there is a hard core of 3 per cent.  The industry regulates itself, which is no longer tenable, and legislation is now required.</P>
      <P>I have two small children and you, Sir, would not believe the graphic violence in some of these video games, specifically &ldquo;Mortal Combat&rdquo;.  I mention it in the House because I hope parents will take note in the absence of an amendment to the Act.  I also hope the Leader will convey this concern to the Minister.  Perhaps, in view of Senator Glynn's request, there could be debate on all these attacks on our children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most tourism projects that would normally be expected to have funding through the operational programme for tourism are now on hold due to the lack of funding for the programme. Some regional boards have advised me they have been told not to submit new applications to the Department because they will not even be considered.  Many worthwhile projects are on hold pending the new programme.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to advise when funding will become available for the many worthwhile projects in the pipeline?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Glynn's call for a debate on child abductions.  This is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous and outrageous that a Member should use the sanctity and security of the House to make a scandalous character assassination on a man who has done more for this country, culturally, educationally, financially and commercially, than any other man.  Despite the number of tribunals that has been established in response to the Senator and his cohorts, none of them has been man enough to give evidence outside this <Col N="1173" /> House.  Nothing wrong has been proved against that man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That man has done the country proud.  I am ashamed that Senator Costello, as a Sligoman, has lowered himself to such a degree. If he has proof he should say it outside this House.  He insinuated that the appeals commissioner acted illegally or irresponsibly.  He did not.  He acted correctly and the publishers can now go to the High Court if they wish.</P>

      <P>Senator Farrell, these political matters are not appropriate to the Order of Business and the Chair would much prefer if reference to such matters were avoided.  The Chair tries to extend as much latitude as possible so that Senators can raise matters of concern on the Order of Business.  The politicisation of the Order of Business is something that the Chair will not allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by my colleague Senator Glynn for a short debate on the number of attempted abductions of children.  Unless it affects your own area there is no public awareness.</P>
      <P>In a similar vein, I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the confirmation in this morning's newspapers that he will establish a register of child sex offenders for which I called yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the concern the Leader shared with me yesterday regarding the position of shop workers who were compelled to work on Sundays in the run up to Christmas.  In response to item 10 on the Order Paper, can he make time available before the conclusion of this session to allow for Second Stage of the Protection of Shop Workers Bill to be taken?  May I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Ryan to allow us debate overseas development aid here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor and call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure that all area aid payments are made before Christmas and that farmers, or whoever is owed money, are paid.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate in the next session on waste disposal?  This is the greatest task facing us at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>About two months ago I asked that the Gaming and Lotteries Act be <Col N="1174" /> reformed and perhaps new legislation enacted. To the best of my knowledge I did not receive a reply.  Will the Leader refer this matter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see if this very outdated, rather archaic and backward legislation compared to European standards can be replaced with new legislation some time next year?  We are losing lots of revenue in several areas under the existing legislation.  As a practising lawyer I know this legislation is unworkable.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader produce the programme of legislation that is coming before this House early in the new year so that spokespersons will know what legislation will be introduced in the next or subsequent session?  If a programme were laid out it might not be possible to adhere strictly to it but we should be given advance notice of, perhaps, a month or six weeks.  I urge him over the Christmas recess to look at the next and subsequent sessions in terms of what legislation the Government will introduce here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make a statement on the Government's position about the Great Southern Hotel Group?  There is a lot of concern among the staff &mdash; we know how excellent these hotels have performed over the years &mdash; about rumours that the Government intends to sell off the group.  From a State's point of view, apart from their great success, there is a huge investment involved which needs to be safeguarded. At this time I am thinking of all the staff from the two hotels in Killarney, one at Parknasilla and throughout the country.  I would welcome a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland for removing the offensive advertisement &ldquo;Our jocks are our best asset&rdquo; which was the RTÉ2's advertisement poster all over the country.  I also found the Kleenex advertisement equally insulting to my colleagues because it said that their tissues were soft, thick and disposable just like men.  I disagree with its sentiments.  I object to the diminution of standards throughout the advertising industry, particularly with regard to sexual innuendo on posters.  I do not want to be considered a prude but we have a problem that I have referred to before in this House as to what seems to be an uncontrolled increase in the pornographic industry. For that reason the Leader let me down on the last occasion when he did not support me on the Bill.  However, he did assure me that these matters would be introduced by way of a Bill from the Minister.  I do not want to return to Victorian days but we are all greatly concerned about the insidious lowering of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Members who sought a debate on child abduction.  I am concerned about this because, as a teacher, I would have been aware of children who were dropped at school before it was opened and who would wait <Col N="1175" /> at the school when the school was closed.  We need to have co-ordinated school transport to ensure that children are not left loitering when it is very obvious that anyone who wishes to abduct would have a very easy way of detecting when young children, primary or secondary, are alone. Parents are not always able to reach their destinations on time due to traffic.  This issue should be raised now.  I would like to know what we can do to alert the public and young children.  A debate on child abduction would be of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to introduce regulations urgently to meet the growing problem of food labelling?  We are aware that beef, lamb, pigmeat, chicken and poultry, etc., are being imported. With the absence of clear labelling the consumer is not getting information on the country of origin of meat products and many people are extremely concerned about this.  We have also introduced traceability, but I have some difficulty understanding how we can offer the Irish consumer a product that fits into that categorisation of traceability even though imports are coming from many countries, non-EU as well as EU.  Will the Leader bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and seek immediate action on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many issues have been raised on the Order of Business.  It is very important that we have a discussion or a statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the protection of our children on our streets.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come here to make a statement on this issue to assure people? Perhaps the leaders on each side can tell if this problem is prevalent in all our towns, and not just the city of Dublin.  The Garda Síochána has informed us about this problem.  It is very important we have a statement at the very least within the next two days to assure people, particularly over the Christmas period.  This is a very serious matter; it is one of the most serious issues ever raised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for either regulation or, if necessary, legislation on food labelling. It is totally inappropriate that inadequate food labelling is giving the wrong impression to customers and shopkeepers.  The information available is that there is an attempt by unscrupulous people in the business to hoodwink the public into buying items such as pork and bacon under an Irish packaging label even though the produce is imported.  Legislation should be introduced to ensure there is proper labelling of produce.</P>
      <P>I am always amazed at the ability of the Labour Party to take the high moral ground.  This week it finally buried James Larkin for good and the Democratic Left buried Ceaucesco.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Manning, I am pleased to confirm to the House that I propose to set time aside tomorrow for statements on Northern Ireland.  I can also confirm that I have contacted the Minister for Public Enterprise and there will be statements in the House tomorrow from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. on the need to have a centenary stamp to commemorate 100 years of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association in Ireland.  Already 40,000 tickets have been sold for the commemorative celebrations in Croke Park on the last Sunday in May.  I thank Senators who have supported this.  I look forward to worthwhile contributions from them tomorrow and a positive reaction from the Government to this matter.  I thank Senator Farrell for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to item 4, it was my intention to bring this item forward for early signature on Friday morning.  However, I will discuss this matter with the leaders of the groups following the Order of Business today to see how we can facilitate Senators' requests.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Norris's concerns regarding East Timor.  Senators Glynn, Mooney, Farrell, Connor, Jackman and Cregan expressed concern about the abduction of children from the streets. Senator Glynn mentioned events that took place in Mullingar last week.  I will give this matter serious consideration and will contact the Minister's office to see if we can have statements on the matter for two hours tomorrow evening.</P>
      <P>On Senator Connor's concerns regarding the area aid grants, I will contact the Department of Agriculture and Food to see if something can be done to speed up the payments.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney asked for the Video Recording Act to be amended.  This should have been done a long time ago.  The violence to which young people and adults are exposed is very dangerous and I will pass on his concerns to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  This is not fair but he is free to do so if he wishes.  He used the word &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;, but no one was misled in this House.  Time was afforded at his request at the earliest possible opportunity.  He is playing politics with this proposal. I respect the Senator but I do not think anyone was misled.  Senator Ryan called for a debate on welfare.  I will look at this matter early in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senators Caffrey and Burke called on the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to speed up funding for tourism projects under the operational programme.  The two Senators come from the same county as the chairman of that body, who is from Crossmolina, County Mayo, and I am sure they can use their influence on him.  I will pass on their concerns to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to have this matter speeded up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Senator Leonard called yesterday on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to set up a register of sex offenders.  I am pleased the Minister has agreed to her request.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher requested a debate on item 10.  This item will be taken during the next session. Senator Burke called for an urgent debate on waste disposal.  This is one of the greatest challenges facing local authorities.  Those of us who are members of local authorities and who were members of the sustainable development committee during the last Government realise this.  I will set time aside early in the next session for a debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan called for the immediate updating of the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  I will pass on his views to the Minister.  Senator Coghlan is concerned about the Great Southern Hotels.  I agree with him and will pass on his views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge mentioned the RTÉ advertisement. It was confirmed last night that the advertisement has been withdrawn.  I was disappointed at Senators' contributions during the debate on the National Disability Authority Bill last night. I received many calls on the Order of Business in recent months regarding the Bill.  I look forward to the contributions of Senators on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Members of this House will be aware that the events giving rise to this Bill have been the subject of extensive coverage in the media.  Indeed, the articles in the October and November 1998 issues of <i>Magill</i> magazine significantly influenced the overall pattern of the controversy.  The basic elements of the matter are relatively straightforward. Serious allegations were made regarding the collection of deposit interest retention tax. The revelations raised questions in particular about the actions of one of the main banking groups in the country.  By implication, other banks were caught in the shadow cast by the media reports.  Moreover, the efficiency and <Col N="1178" /> effectiveness of the systems and procedures operated by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the administration and collection of deposit interest retention tax were severely questioned.</P>
      <P>Public opinion demanded that, as far as is practicable, all available facts should be brought into the public domain.  This is entirely understandable. This controversy affects areas central to our economy and society, and citizens look to the Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure propriety, efficiency and effectiveness in both financial management and public administration.  Our primary duty is to ensure that the citizens of this State will have all pertinent information made available to them in a timely and effective manner.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I believe that the response from the Houses of the Oireachtas has been rapid and appropriate.  The examination of the appropriation accounts of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners by the Committee of Public Accounts focused on the core issues exposed by the media coverage.  In particular, the committee highlighted the fundamental conflict in evidence about the administration of deposit interest retention tax between the Revenue Commissioners and AIB bank.</P>
      <P>Arising from these deliberations, Dáil Éireann passed a resolution on 21 October which put in place the first important elements of the investigative process.  The Committee of Public Accounts was requested to examine and report <i>inter alia</i> on &ldquo;any purported settlement between the financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners in respect of undeclared DIRT&rdquo; and on information known to the financial institutions and regulatory authorities concerning the use of bogus non-resident accounts.  I am also aware of and welcome the positive response of Members of this House who have expressed their support and commitment to facilitating by all appropriate means the furthering of this investigation.</P>
      <P>As events unfolded towards the end of October, it became increasingly clear that the existing powers available to pursue this matter were not sufficient.  New arrangements were needed to bring the investigation to a satisfactory conclusion.  Accordingly, recommendations were made by the Committee of Public Accounts setting out key requirements for advancing the inquiry into the central issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements envisaged in the first interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts form the essential basis for the particular approach to this investigation made under this Bill.  The process begins with the passage of this legislation to empower the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct a comprehensive fact finding investigation. The Comptroller and Auditor General will then be requested to prepare a report to Dáil Éireann.  Having received and examined this report, the Committee of Public Accounts will continue its examination of the key issues.  In undertaking this examination, the committee will use enhanced powers under the compellability Act.  It will then proceed to draw conclusions, <Col N="1179" /> determine findings and make recommendations for further action.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the Bill to satisfy the specific circumstances arising from this controversy is crucial. The inquiry will look into the administrative arrangements and procedures of the Revenue Commissioners relating to DIRT.  It will also address how the relevant financial institutions exercised their duty of care in relation to this tax. It is not our intention to construct unnecessarily complicated or bureaucratic procedures.  A central feature of the arrangements under the Bill is that the special provisions will, in the main, cease when the inquiries of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the examinations of the Committee of Public Accounts are completed.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that the Bill owes its genesis to a proposal put forward by Members of Dáil Éireann drawn from across party lines.  There is a genuine will to proceed as rapidly and as comprehensively as possible.  There is a shared determination that the process of investigation should be driven by elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The compellability Act, introduced by the previous Government, was supported on all sides precisely because it promised to meet a long standing aspiration to give committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas powers to conduct meaningful examinations of matters of pressing public interest.  There is also a common concern that other methods of public inquiry imposed very substantial costs on the taxpayer and that Oireachtas committees could provide more cost effective means of managing inquiries.</P>
    <P>In evaluating our approach to this investigation, it has been recognised that certain modifications are needed to the compellability Act. These have been provided for in the Bill.  The arrangements also acknowledge that the scope and range of the investigation needed would impose such demands on time that it would be unrealistic to expect parliamentarians themselves to undertake the &ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo; of the inquiry. A commitment of that nature would put pressure on their wider legislative duties and the care of their constituents.  It is proposed, therefore, that the initial process of investigation should be conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, it is necessary to expand his statutory powers on a temporary basis in a manner that is germane to his constitutional role.</P>
    <P>These difficult and complex arrangements have been fairly described as a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; mechanism of inquiry.  Indeed, the two tier arrangement &mdash; in which the Comptroller and Auditor General will present the relevant facts and identify areas of dispute and the committee would reach conclusions, determine findings and make recommendations &mdash; draws on different legislative backgrounds.  Senators will see in these arrangements precedents in the statutory provisions for committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1180" /> and the Companies Act.  This diverse grounding is a source of strength in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the fact that support for this investigation crosses party political boundaries also bodes well.  There appears to be general agreement across the spectrum in relation to the following: the serious matters to be investigated; the essential arrangements for the investigation; the Comptroller and Auditor General should prepare a fact finding report; to carry out his investigation he must have new powers of direction to compel the giving of evidence and confer privilege; the Committee of Public Accounts should examine his report and, if necessary, hear further evidence; the committee should have enhanced powers under the compellability Act in furthering its inquiry and, finally, the committee must draw conclusions, reach findings and make recommendations on further action.  These core elements of the investigation are provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the key questions to be addressed in this investigation.  Was there an agreement between the Revenue Commissioners and a financial institution, in particular AIB bank, in relation to undeducted deposit interest retention tax during the early 1990s?  If so, what was the basis and nature of that arrangement? Were the systems, practices and procedures of the Revenue Commissioners adequate in relation to the administration of the deposit interest retention tax?  Were those systems properly implemented during the relevant period?  Did the financial institutions exercise their statutory duty of care in satisfying themselves that relevant accounts were genuinely non-resident?  Were the financial institutions aware of the existence and extent of bogus non-resident accounts?  If they knew, what did they do about these bogus accounts?  If not, why not?</P>
    <P>Members of the House will appreciate that in seeking answers to these questions we will inevitably get into an area of conflicting interests, rights and entitlements.  Therefore, I have worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General and the legal advisers of the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that the arrangements we will put in place avoid, as far as possible, foreseeable constitutional or other legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent constitutional officer with functions defined in statute to control and audit accounts administered by or on behalf of the Oireachtas. In order to ensure that the arrangements being made in this Bill are sound, we have provided that the Comptroller and Auditor General will have discretion to appoint independent auditors in certain circumstances during his investigation. These may arise where the Comptroller and Auditor General decides that he needs to have access to information contained in the accounts of private individuals held by the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>This will not preclude the Comptroller and <Col N="1181" /> Auditor General looking at books and documents in the financial institutions that might refer to such individual accounts.  The possibility that he might inadvertently come across these accounts is not a barrier to his examination of relevant documents of the financial institutions, such as audit reports.  If necessary, details of individual named account holders can be blacked out of such documents. He will have adequate powers to compel the presentation of evidence and documents in this regard under section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In co-operating with the Comptroller and Auditor General in this investigation those who have evidence to give are not at risk of criminal prosecution on foot of what they say or give as evidence.  However, should the Comptroller and Auditor General come across <i>prima facie</i> evidence of non-payment or underpayment of tax, he can draw that information to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.  The names or any other means of identifying individual account holders cannot be published in his report to the Dáil. The point of this investigation is to concentrate on the core issues and to seek answers to the pressing questions of public concern.  I am satisfied that the statutory arrangements being provided for in the Bill will enable this to happen.</P>
    <P>The Bill is complex in its construction but straightforward in its objective &mdash; to present the truth as fairly and as quickly as possible.  I now propose to give a brief summary of some of the specific provisions.  With the exception of a limited number of matters, the special provisions of the Bill are temporary.  This is provided for in section 1 by attaching the special provisions to the Committee of Public Accounts as defined for the purposes of the investigation.  When the committee completes its report to Dáil Éireann the special provisions lapse unless the precise terms provided for them are replicated.</P>
    <P>I can accurately describe section 2 as the core of the Bill.  The Comptroller has an existing right to examine papers in Government Departments and to probe the background to public spending. The role which the Bill foresees is somewhat different but the powers are germane to his statutory functions under section 3(7) of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1993. Section 2, therefore, provides for the examinations and investigations which the Comptroller will carry out, defines the relevant areas of tax law and specifies the purposes of the investigation. It also provides that the Comptroller may appoint independent auditors to examine the accounts of private individuals held by financial institutions if necessary.  The section also makes provision for the preparation of interim reports where self-contained elements of the investigation have been completed and finalised.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the presentation of the Comptroller's report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann are analogous to the arrangements for the reports of tribunals and will be supported by a resolution to be moved in Dáil Éireann.  They also permit <Col N="1182" /> the Comptroller, at his discretion, to make a copy available to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Provisions empowering the Comptroller to gather the evidence are modelled variously on the compellability Act and, where appropriate, are analogous to the powers of an inspector appointed by the Companies Act.  They are set out in sections 3 to 10 of the Bill.  Using these powers the Comptroller may request witnesses to present evidence or give documents in the knowledge that the privileges and immunities of a High Court witness will apply to them.  If a witness refuses to co-operate, the Comptroller has the power to compel them to give evidence, administering an oath if necessary.  The Comptroller also has powers to seek a direction of the High Court in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill has specific provisions for the payment of reasonable expenses from public money to certain persons giving evidence.  In addition, section 18 allows the Minister for Finance to seek a direction of the courts in relation to the recovery of costs from a financial institution.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a permanent provision which provides for absolute privilege for the Chairman and members of the committee for the purpose of the performance of their functions.  Such protection was specifically requested in the interim report of the committee.  However, this privilege does not cover interviews or comments made by them on television or radio or in the print media.  Section 12 is also a permanent provision which gives absolute privilege for the performance of functions by the Comptroller and his officers.</P>
    <P>Section 13 removes restrictions on the disclosure of information imposed by law or contracts. For example, this section will lift obligations of confidentiality on former employees of companies for the purposes of this investigation.  This removal of confidentiality will not apply to the obligations imposed by EU directives and double taxation agreements with other states.  However, if the Comptroller is already exempted from confidentiality provisions in EU directives, this remains subject to any conditions set, for example, professional secrecy.</P>
    <P>Section 14 allows the Comptroller to seek directions from the High Court to obtain clarification as to how he should exercise his powers and to resolve quickly any potential constitutional conflict.</P>
    <P>In carrying out its examination, the committee will be able to appoint experts to give advice, guidance or other assistance during its proceedings and its discussions at private meetings may not be disclosed without the consent of the chairman.  There are other permanent amendments to the compellability Act to clarify the granting of a &ldquo;block consent&rdquo; to the use of the compellability powers for a full investigation. Section 20 temporarily removes the restriction on investigations in relation to the tax liability contained in the compellability Act.  This is crucial in facilitating the thorough examination of this <Col N="1183" /> controversy by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I present the Bill to this House as a balanced and carefully structured arrangement to bring this investigation to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Public representatives have a duty to seek the truth and inform the public.  I have tried to balance this duty in the Bill with the natural and constitutional rights of citizens to fair and due process.  We are pressed for time.  It may be that a longer period of reflection would have improved the details of these complex arrangements.  Nevertheless, in the short time available the Bill now presented will meet the needs of this inquiry and will provide an effective means of advancing the investigation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his fair summary of the situation in relation to this Bill.  The Minister has cut to the core of what needs to be done.  As he said in his concluding remarks, it is in everyone's interests that this matter be brought to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible while balancing citizens' rights to fair procedure and due process.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome, coming as it does in the wake of the first interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts, the appropriation accounts 1997 and the non-resident accounts deposit interest retention tax controversy.  It is a balanced and fair response to the need, recognised by the committee, for the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out an investigation, with appropriate new powers to pursue the matter in order to prepare a report for Dáil Éireann setting out the full facts of the situation.  The Bill properly provides for enhanced compellability powers for the committee which will better equip it to examine the reports and thereby draw the right conclusions and make consequent recommendations.</P>
      <P>This House appreciates all of the time and effort devoted to this matter by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and its members and by the Minister and his departmental officials.  It is important that the Bill allows the actions and documents of the chairman and members of the committee to be protected by privilege between meetings of the committee and that the same privilege is extended to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff. In that regard, I was horrified to learn that an honourable Member of the other House was in some difficulty in regard to the business of that committee during his tenure as its Chairman.  For that reason I welcome the permanence of the provisions which the Minister has incorporated in sections 11 and 12.  They are long overdue and will be welcomed by all Members of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has got right the balance between the appointment of auditors to access bank <Col N="1184" /> records in regard to individual accounts and the citizen's rights..</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the key questions to be addressed were outlined by the Minister in his speech this morning.  We now realise that this does not involve just one financial institution, but perhaps all of them and that the scope of the committee's work must extend to all of the financial institutions necessary.  The Minister asked if the financial institutions exercised their statutory duty of care in satisfying themselves that relevant accounts were genuinely non-resident.  I always believed that the official before whom the declaration of non-residence was signed would have to satisfy himself as to the bona fides of the person in front of them.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the alleged transgressions in the past, we are now informed there is a very compliant culture in the financial system.  Hopefully that is so.  I hope the financial institutions are conscious of their obligations and that their statements in that regard are true and fair.  The public expects the highest standards of behaviour in its institutions, and banks, no less than anyone else, must now cope with the new unprecedented level of examination from the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General as provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We live in an age of openness, transparency and accountability and none of us would wish the clock to be turned back on this.  Ireland can be thankful it has a competent, reliable, well regulated and innovative financial sector.  There is no doubt banks have improved since the early 1990s in their customer service and best practices.  The matter we are now discussing, which is necessary and properly provided for in this Bill, relates to the early 1980s and 1990s.  None of us believes those alleged practices are prevalent now. Today's banking industry is dynamic and forward looking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward with interest to the Senator's contribution as I respect what he has to say in the financial area.  I am sure we can discuss some of these points in &mdash; as the Cathaoirleach might say &mdash; a more appropriate place.  I have been more than a little amazed with the Revenue Commissioners as regards the deposit interest retention tax controversy because I always believed that, with regard to declarations of non-residency which must contain the name, address and country of tax residence of the person entitled to the deposit interest, the financial institution had a duty to satisfy itself that a deposit was exempt from DIRT before it paid interest gross.  I am sure that is true and perhaps the Minister could respond to this.  Despite the Revenue Commissioners having that power, I believe it never exercised its right to examine those declarations, at least not before April of this year.  That amazes me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> I compliment the Minister on the Bill and on addressing the key questions.  I fully agree with his concluding remarks that we quickly, expeditiously and efficiently put this matter to bed once and for all.  For the sake of the country we need to fully restore faith and confidence in the Revenue Commissioners' tax collecting ability and in our banking system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill.  I compliment him on acting speedily in bringing this legislation forward. It is less than two months since the resolution was moved in the other House.</P>
      <P>This has been a bad year for the public image of banks.  They may have made a lot of profit but they have reached the nadir of their standing in public opinion.  Earlier this year a bank was found to have overcharged its customers by imposing inappropriate interest and had to pay back the money.  This was a totally inappropriate action by a financial institution.  Then there was the situation which prompted this Bill, the abuse of the non-resident accounts system.  There were tens of thousands of bogus non-resident accounts.  We now must establish if the bank was involved.  Perhaps others were but in particular we must establish if that bank was.  We must establish if it was a willing partner in this scam and if it eventually struck a sweetheart deal with the Revenue Commissioners when they complained.</P>
      <P>This legislation and investigation are necessary on the basis that the public are very unhappy with our financial institutions.  They believe they are at the mercy of those institutions, that the institutions have the upper hand at all times and that they are the victim of the practices of the institutions. Our banks and financial institutions have creamed Irish society for years.  I respectfully disagree with Senator Coghlan.  I know he has reason for saying what he said, but any person on the street today would say the level of profit being made by our financial institutions is immoral.  I have seen banks and financial institutions make profits of £500 million in a financial year.  That is wrong.  Excessive interest rates have been set and are still being set.  Those who have overdrafts or credit cards or who got into difficulty with the bank know the penalties, referral and other charges in place to cream off as much as possible from the customer.  It would seem they stay up at night looking for schemes to dig into the customer's account.  It costs to withdraw £20 of one's own money.  Our financial institutions and banks are not in good standing with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the Bill, it is necessary that it be enacted.  The Committee of Public Accounts was doing a good job but found it did not have the powers to continue.  It recommended the Comptroller and Auditor General be given powers to investigate and be brought into the system. This is a new area for the Comptroller and Auditor General as he is now being brought into the private sector.  I am pleased at the mechanism the <Col N="1186" /> draftsmen and the Attorney General have put in place.  He is the appropriate person to do this work.  This legislation, when coupled with the compellability legislation enacted in 1997 and the enhanced powers of the Committee of Public Accounts, should get to the bottom of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General will do his own investigation and report to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It can then use its new powers to advance the investigation further and make recommendations.  The Bill is necessary as we need to investigate the serious allegations and conflicting statements of the Revenue Commissioners and Allied Irish Banks.  However, it is also necessary to address public concerns.</P>
    <P>The public view is that there was an understanding between certain individuals with money and the AIB to evade paying tax.  The public believes that the bank involved was a willing partner in this scam in arranging bogus non-resident accounts, and when the matter was dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners, it appears that a sweetheart deal was done between that body and AIB, though the Revenue Commissioners deny this.  Ordinary PAYE workers, owners of small businesses and farmers feel very aggrieved that they must meet the full rigours of tax legislation, while those in very powerful positions in financial institutions who had wealthy clients seemed able to get around that legislation and evade their responsibilities to the country.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been an acceptance over the years that tax evasion was no great crime.  It was a crime to break into someone's house or not to tax one's car, but tax evasion seemed a lesser crime.  In fact, it seemed a person was getting one up if he or she could evade income tax.  However, it is an equal crime; a person is denying the State what rightfully belongs to it and by doing so the State is denied the chance to put supports and services into the system that the public needs.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an independent auditor to examine the accounts of private individuals held by financial institutions is very necessary, and I am pleased it is provided for in the legislation.  I hope it will be successful.  Certain other powers are provided under the legislation in the event of a person not complying, but I hope that does not lead to cumbersome legal battles in the future. The legislation gives the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to compel people to give evidence by administering an oath, which is also very important.</P>
    <P>Investigations cost money, and that cost is met by the taxpayer.  However, under section 18 the Minister for Finance has the power to recover costs from financial institutions, which is an important provision.</P>
    <P>This legislation is acceptable on the basis that it came from a committee of the House, and not from an individual, party or Government.  That is a good basis for the legislation, and those who watched the initial investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts on television would have been impressed by the serious attempt that committee <Col N="1187" /> made to get to the bottom of this.  Television commentators and print journalists felt the committee was serious about its business.  This is good, because often during investigations the public believes a cover-up or paper exercise is taking place.  On this occasion the public felt that a serious attempt was being made by the committee, which immediately came forward to say it did not have the powers to proceed further.  Absolute privilege for the chairperson and committee members is also very welcome.  I concur with the previous speaker and found it very disturbing when a former chairman was brought into question for doing his public duty.  That threat should not hang over the chairman or members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Absolute privilege is vital if we are to get to the bottom of this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill refers to contracts and the disposal of information imposed by law or contracts.  When I was on the then Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, it could not establish the salaries being paid out of the public purse to people working in RTÉ.  I found it very disturbing that people who were earning up to £250,000 per year in a public broadcasting service refused to disclose the income they were receiving for carrying out a public duty.  RTÉ and their employers, attended the committee.  They indicated they would not disclose the information because they had entered into contracts with well known presenters whose salary details would remain confidential.  I find that quite extraordinary. Not alone are the salary details of Members of this House available to everyone, we almost have a situation where the chickens they might have in their gardens are counted.  If a Member's neighbour buys him or her a double whiskey in the local pub, he or she is almost obliged to disclose that.  Yet people working in the public service who are in receipt of inflated salaries and who, in some cases, use their position to tell elected representatives what to do, do not disclose their salary details.  That is inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that section 13 addresses the issue of contracts.  If I am reading the section properly, I understand that people will not be able to hide behind such contracts.  Perhaps the Minister might explain the paragraph in section 14 which refers to the High Court.  It states that the Comptroller and Auditor General may seek direction or clarification from the court on the manner in which he should exercise his powers should constitutional conflict arise.  Has the Attorney General advised that there might be an opportunity for a constitutional challenge to delay and frustrate matters?</P>
    <P>Section 20 removes the restriction on investigations relating to tax liability contained in the compellability of witnesses legislation.  I do not fully understand the situation which pertains in this regard; perhaps the Minister will shed some light on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I welcome this legislation.  It is very important we examine the whole area of resident and non-resident accounts, bogus accounts, DIRT and so on.  There is a great deal of public concern about the manner in which financial institutions have been operating over a number of years.  I hope this legislation will reveal even more information than it is intended to.  We have only scratched the surface on what has gone on behind the closed doors of financial institutions for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill although I regret it has taken so long for it to be introduced.  Speed is of the essence in regard to this issue.  We must continue to concentrate on the banks and the problems they have created and there should not be any loss of momentum or interest.  In that context, I apologise to Senator Coghlan for interrupting his somewhat irrational contribution.</P>
      <P>Although this issue was initially greeted with a great deal of outrage in these Houses and among the public, there are signs, which I also detected in Senator Coghlan's contribution, that strong lobbying by the banks, particularly among Members of this House, is beginning to bear fruit. There are signs of a softening in people's attitudes in regard to banks and apologists for the banks are appearing out of the woodwork.  I have detected that on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with financial institutions with vast funds which have used those funds since this crisis broke to pay enormous amounts of money to public relations people to lobby Senators, Deputies and particularly the Minister, in the hope of softening the blow which I hope will crash around their heads at some stage in the near future.  Some people in this House have obviously spoken to people acting on behalf of the banks.  I am not saying they should not do that but there are signs that the banks are using their shareholders' money to employ lobbyists to convey a dishonest message.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan stated that the banks behaved very badly in the 1980s and early 1990s but that they are improving now.  I would compare the difference in their behaviour with poisoning people and killing them by euthanasia.  It is a matter of actual and moral corruption.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, banks openly broke the law.  They are still as morally corrupt although they have probably found more subtle means of robbing their customers and the State.  Banks are tough operators which possess greater muscle than any other business.  They are using their funds to promote themselves and get individuals off hooks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with the largest public company in the State.  That is why the matter is so serious.  The problem does not relate to a small number of people failing to pay small amounts of tax.  Nobody in the country could put his hand on his heart and say he paid every penny of tax he ever owed, be it plumbers' VAT or whatever.  The problem here is that institutionalised corruption is being carried out in a methodical way by the largest public company in the State.  The signs of <Col N="1189" /> lobbying are apparent in these Houses on a daily basis and the impetus is being lost on this issue.  I see signs of it in the Bill and in the speeches being made in this House.</P>
    <P>I am determined that when a report is finally published on these matters, it will be acted on.  It should not be used, like so many other reports, as a delaying tactic for failure to take action against the rich, the powerful and the useless. This report will be of no value whatsoever if the Minister or Government comes forward in six, eight or 12 months' time to say they know what happened and that is an end to the matter.  Action must be taken.  It is not sufficient to expose wrongdoing.  Given the size and scale of this operation, remedies must be put in place.</P>
    <P>I am one of the most enthusiastic proponents in the House of the profit motive.  I am an unapologetic promoter of private enterprise and low direct taxation. However, the profit motive is a little different when it comes to the banks because there is no risk attached to what they do.  They are not ordinary businesses &mdash; they are not making things.  It is not as simple as the Minister has said on occasion that they are just buying and selling money.  They take virtually no risk personally.</P>
    <P>Banks make money very easily.  One has only to look at the criminal difference between normal retail deposit and lending rates to see this.  If one asks the Bank of Ireland what it will give on a small deposit it will offer about 0.2 per cent per annum.  It would take a person 500 years to double the capital.</P>

      <P>However, they charge about 24 per cent on a Visa card.  It is not difficult to make money on that basis because there is not much risk involved.  That is how the banks make their money.  They are ripping off their customers. Whereas the State was their victim in the 1989-91 period, their customers are now their sole victims because the State has rumbled them.  They rob their customers left, right and centre.  It is an easy business.  Having heard some of the evidence on this matter and seen some of the figures for bankers' earnings, I wonder for whom the institutions are run.  The banks will say they are run for the shareholders and that is partly true.  Their shares have done extremely well, as have banking shares around the world.  There is very little evidence to suggest that any of the Irish banks have been better run than any others.  They are run in the interests of those who control them and who are the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the people who really benefit from the success of banks in this country are the directors, the executive directors in particular, who enjoy an orgy of options which are unrelated to the risk they take.  One will not find that the executives on the boards of banks <Col N="1190" /> have a great number of shares.  One or two have bought large amounts of shares for themselves. However, most of them get very rich by getting free options, risking no money, cashing them in for millions of pounds, running institutions which are in no danger themselves and ripping off the public.</P>
    <P>Who benefits?  When the market goes down the shareholders will lose money but the directors will not.  They will still get vast salaries, cars and everything going and they will still have options to cash in when business is good.  It is a myth that options are related to performance; they are related to market performance which is completely different.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this inquiry broadened. There should not just be a committee looking at the financial institutions but a permanent body of the Oireachtas examining the behaviour of the financial institutions.  What we have discovered to date on the DIRT issue is but the tip of the iceberg. There have been too many instances of absolute corruption and banks robbing customers unknown to them for anyone to suggest that what we are examining is the full story.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the way in which the matter has been turned by some to focus on the Revenue Commissioners.  There is clearly a conflict of evidence between the Revenue Commissioners and the banks.  The strong lobbying by AIB, using who knows how many PR people from outside AIB, has sought to imply an equality of blame. There is no equality of blame whatever.  There is no doubt that there is a guilty party and there is little for which the Revenue Commissioners must answer.  This will be resolved by the inquiry.  The Revenue Commissioners have little motive to lie in this case.  There is very little reason for them to do so.  However, I will not express any further view on that conflict, except to say that I cannot understand how there can be two opposing corners when AIB is so obviously culpable.</P>
    <P>The dissembling of information and the language used by AIB when it came before the Committee of Public Accounts should be examined. AIB talked about the matter as an &ldquo;industry wide problem&rdquo; which is an amazing admission.  They are saying in effect that the banks were all at it; that everybody was breaking the law and somehow that was all right.  That is not the case.  If anything, it makes it more serious in the case of such a large institution.</P>
    <P>The arrogance of one particular past member of the board of AIB who said that he would not come to give evidence to the committee was typical of the attitude of bankers to the Oireachtas and to their customers.  For a former executive of the largest such institution in the State to say he had better things to do than attend to answer questions shows a contempt for the customers, shareholders and the Oireachtas which is typical of the institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important that the Minister gives a commitment that the inquiry's findings will be followed by action of a punitive <Col N="1191" /> type against the offending banks which will see that the public purse is not left short.  There must also be action to ensure that not only is everything known about what happened but that it will not happen again.  It would be wrong and disingenuous for the Government, the Opposition or Independent Members to cry for accountability or the punishment of former Members of the other House who have apparently offended against the Revenue laws while allowing the banks, who have offended far more, get off scot free.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister; it is the first time I have seen him since the unfortunate tragedy at the end of September, but he seems to have recovered.  I heard a colourful account from someone who ran into him a week after that event, when his form was not as good as it usually is, but then neither was mine.</P>
      <P>It is not often I agree with Senator Ross but I concur with most of his contribution.  I have a minor correction to his figures; an interest rate of 0.2 per cent would double one's money in 350 years, not 500 years.  The rule of thumb is to divide 70 by the interest rate to get the time in which the money will double.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot the ravages of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>A phrase which is widely used in mainstream media in the USA is &ldquo;corporate welfare&rdquo;, about which <i>Time</i> magazine ran an extraordinarily revealing series in the last few months.  It refers to the degree to which the state subsidises big business &mdash; this is in the US, the home of free enterprise and privatisation &mdash; to no great benefit to the state.  Individual states of the Union use sweeteners to compete for the corporate sector, to persuade companies to invest in one state rather than another.  Even corporate jets are subsidised by the state and pay lower than the commercial rates for the publicly or privately owned airports they use.  Everything corporations do is subsidised, protected and mollycoddled because of the apparent capacity of these bodies to create employment.  The myth is that corporate welfare encourages such employment creation; the conclusion of <i>Time</i> is that it is done to make people and corporations rich.</P>
      <P>Everything starts in the US but we can also see signs in Germany and France of the beginnings of a reappraisal of the myth of corporate welfare. In the US, the state spends six times as much on corporate welfare as on social welfare, with no greater benefit to the state.  At least social welfare gives people the chance to live; corporate welfare makes already wealthy people spectacularly more wealthy to no great purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was an example of corporate welfare in this State, it can be seen in the banking <Col N="1192" /> system.  On any index of what it is supposed to do, it fails; the only way it is spectacularly successful is in enriching its executives and shareholders. Most assuredly the banks do not enrich their customers or serve them well.  They have developed a remarkable capacity for glossy public relations and extraordinary inefficiency and rudeness on a personal level.  Everyone I know has experience of the ignorance of the banks.</P>
    <P>It is time their greed was called into question. Why does the Minister think the senior executives of all our banks are worth a salary three times as great as that of the Taoiseach?  What risks did they take to justify such sums?  What contributions did they make to the social, political or economic welfare of this State?  I am no great supporter of the Taoiseach but he takes enormous risks, his career could end at any time and he could literally be out of a job.  He works long hours, has no share options, and cannot sell off an interest in Ireland Incorporated when it has done so extraordinarily well as it has in recent years.  Yet these people award themselves, subject to no accountability, salaries which are multiples of what we believe the Taoiseach is worth.  The irony is that many of these salaries are fixed by a bank executive who regards himself as being worth three times what the Taoiseach is paid.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome but I have a couple of questions.  I must repeat a phrase of Senator Ross because it was wonderful; he described the banks as rich, powerful and useless.  I compliment him for that and would love to have thought it up because it is a great description of our banking system.</P>
    <P>I have a question for the Minister about him and his predecessors; I pursued this matter at an earlier date and sent a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> in October which produced no response.  The historical figures for the revenue from DIRT are hard to find because, for some mysterious reason, the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners do not show a separate figure for this tax, it is incorporated into the sum for income tax, but when one asks the information is provided.</P>
    <P>The initial estimate for returns from DIRT was £78 million; in the first full year, which was 1987, the revenue was £296 million, almost four times what was estimated.  In 1988, the return dropped to £200 million; in 1989, it fell to £185 million, and in 1990, it rose spectacularly again to £270 million.  The trite explanation is that this correlates with interest rates but it does not; some of those figures went down when interest rates when up, and <i>vice versa.</i>  Nor is the trend connected with changing tax rates.  It has to do with the peculiarities of the amount of money on deposit in the financial system.</P>
    <P>There is no simple explanation for the figures, particularly of the fact that the Department of Finance underestimated the amount of money on deposit in the Irish banking system by a factor of four in 1986.  In 1987, the first full year in which the tax applied, interest rates were lower than the year in which the estimate was made, so the <Col N="1193" /> Department's figures were probably out by a factor of five.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about the fluctuations of DIRT revenue since then is that it appears, once people realised they had to pay it, money disappeared out of the system, because the drop in DIRT relates closely to the great orgy of offshore and non-resident accounts.  Returns increase again in 1990, which was about the time the Revenue Commissioners began to throw their weight around and come to settlements with the banks.</P>
    <P>We are talking about this in 1998 but there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence ten years ago that something funny was happening, that is, in 1987, when revenue from DIRT was up to five times larger than the Department estimated.  Why was this step not taken then?  It was for the reason Senator Ross so eloquently outlined &mdash; the banks are big, rich and powerful, and no one likes to tangle with them.  In the late 1980s we had to bail out a bank, and one of the peculiarly Stalinist qualities of our banking system is that the bank now denies that that ever happened.  If you actually dare to refer in public print to the crisis in AIB in the late 1980s its public relations firm will write indignantly to the papers and, in the words of a former Fianna Fáil Minister, will say &ldquo;What crisis?  There never was a crisis&rdquo;.  That is the official line used by AIB.  That is as wonderfully a Stalinist view of history as one could ever imagine.  They get away with this sort of approach because they are so big and powerful.</P>
    <P>They have obviously given up on me because on this occasion I was not lobbied at all.  Back in the 1980s I had the privilege of being brought to lunch by the Governor of the Bank of Ireland and the Chairman of AIB simply because I wrote an article in a magazine about the banks which was rather rude.  As an obscure backbench minor Senator with no great influence I was assiduously courted to try to persuade me not to be so unpleasant about them.  It was a very pleasant occasion and one bank was considerably more hospitable than the other.  One served sandwiches while the other served a most spectacular lunch, after which I slept for two hours.  It would appear the more generous, the bigger the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very good at entertaining but I was tickled, and still am, at the fact that their lobbying effort extended to myself.  I wondered what lobbying they did with people with considerably greater influence.  On this occasion they must have given up on me or just forgotten about me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is long overdue.  Somebody might ask the banks why they tout so heavily the confidentiality of bank accounts.  The question I have asked repeatedly in this House is confidential from whom?  When a bank advertises so vigorously that my account is confidential, what are they telling me?  Are they telling me that they will <Col N="1194" /> not tell my wife or my neighbour?  We all know it is confidential from the Revenue Commissioners. That is what they mean when they say my account is confidential; normal commercial rules means they are not going to tell anyone else.  I am fascinated by the use of this word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.  It obviously means they are signalling quite explicitly to people to put their money into their banks where the Revenue Commissioners will have a damn hard job finding it.</P>
    <P>Similarly I have come across banks in Cork city touting for non-resident accounts miles from an airport and miles from a car ferry.  Who are the non-residents for whom they are looking?  They are people residing in Ireland whom they can facilitate with non-resident accounts.  I would be glad to be convinced that we are beginning to tackle these institutions because they have behaved badly in so many ways.  I remember the way they introduced exploitative labour contracts in the 1980s when we had an unemployment crisis.  They gently eased out large numbers of their experienced employees and brought in young people on exploitative terms of insecurity and low wages.  They actually had to reverse that much to my delight because of the change in the labour market, but they were one of the first to demand the right to exploit young people in order to further enrich their grossly overpaid executives. I regret that such people were rewarded by this Minister by being able to have the capital gains tax they paid when they exercised their share option.  It was not a particularly wonderful incentive to any kind of enterprise, imagination or risk taking.  It was a reward for inertia and for self preservation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to hear what the Department made out of the strange figures on DIRT over the years and why section 22 is necessary. This specifies that &ldquo;Any record relating to an investigation or examination carried out under this Act is not covered by the Freedom of Information Act&rdquo;.  The Freedom of Information Act contains proper and universal exemptions and if there is anything sensitive in these reports then it would be covered by the existing exemptions in that Act.  This provision is unnecessary and I am afraid that from now on everything sensitive will have a clause at the end saying the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to this.  If the Freedom of Information Act is inadequate to cover sensitive information, then let us amend the Act because it should not be possible to disclose information that is either commercially or personally sensitive under the Freedom of Information Act and nobody ever thought it should.  A blanket exemption like this is a very bad idea.  It is contrary to the spirit of freedom of information and it also undermines the role of freedom of information in making our institutions accountable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to a successful outcome to the first attempt to bring power and wealth in this country to some sort of accountability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  This is an appropriate time to deal with this legislation because all over the newspapers and the media today is the account of unpaid tax and how a wide range of pillars of society have had to answer to the Revenue Commissioners in terms of tax unpaid, with interest and with various penalties being added on.  Interestingly enough, a large percentage of them seem to be in the service industry &mdash; hoteliers, restaurateurs and publicans.  I wonder why that particular industry is named so often in the list of people with whom the Revenue Commissioners have problems.  Today the decision was announced that the former Taoiseach's tax bill, which was determined by the Revenue Commissioners, on appeal to the assessment officer was reduced to zero.  That certainly raises major questions in terms of the public perception about how we do our business in relation to tax matters.  I understand the matter was raised in the Dáil earlier and it now transpires that a close relative of the Taoiseach was the assessment officer.  I have absolutely no reason to question the bona fides and I understand the person is of the very highest calibre in every sense, but surely in circumstances of that nature the person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Had I not been interrupted by Senator Finneran I could have continued.  The Bill before us is good; it is appropriate and necessary legislation.  All of us remember seeing senior officials of the Allied Irish Banks before the Committee of Public Accounts and all of us in public life will have experienced some degree of shock in seeing how they behaved towards that committee, the condescending attitude, the arrogance, the absolute statement that this was part and parcel of the industry, that this was the manner in which the industry operated, the wider ethos of the industry, all without batting an eyelid. <Col N="1196" /> At the same time, they stated categorically they were in no way at fault in relation to the major queries about bogus offshore accounts and the payment of DIRT tax.  They effectively admitted it &mdash; without admitting it &mdash; and then blamed the Revenue Commissioners.  It was the most unbelievable case of denial I have ever seen.  It was fascinating that adults, in receipt of huge salaries and with responsibility for billions of pounds belonging to taxpayers, consumers and institutions, could act in that fashion.  One can understand why the public becomes so cynical when people in positions of power and privilege, who are put forward as pillars of society, behave in such a fashion.</P>
      <P>The proper proposals were put forward by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It would have been impossible for it to have conducted the investigation thoroughly and it sought the giving of extra powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who would then produce his report and the Committee of Public Accounts would then have sufficient powers to continue its investigation and finalise the matter.  I think that is the proper approach.</P>
      <P>The only aspect about which I am hesitant is that we seem to lay all the responsibility on the Comptroller and Auditor General when a crisis arises.  Perhaps we expect too much from that office and it might be difficult to keep using it to that degree in the future.  It is essential to provide the Comptroller and Auditor General with the necessary resources to carry out investigations fully and adequately.  We are breaking new ground here and it is exceedingly important that we do it in the proper fashion and that it has proper credibility.</P>
      <P>It was revealed by <i>Magill</i> magazine that AIB was up to its neck in terms of unpaid tax on offshore accounts.  Before that, we saw how NIB was effectively stealing from its customers, in terms of the charges it was deliberately imposing in a number of its banks.  No one has been brought to justice for this.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has tabled a motion, which sums up how the ordinary citizen sees this whole matter.  It states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the practice by financial institutions of facilitating the defrauding of the State of millions of pounds through bogus offshore accounts; further condemns the practice by the Revenue Commissioners of accepting derisory sums of money to settle outstanding liabilities; demands that those responsible be pursued and prosecuted and that the misappropriated moneys and taxes be paid in full to the State; and, finally, that new regulatory and enforcement procedures be put in place to ensure that financial institutions cannot operate outside the law in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that all these elements must be dealt with effectively.  Financial institutions must be brought to book for their facilitating of the defrauding of the State of millions of pounds.  The <Col N="1197" /> importance of this legislation is that it will allow these matters to be properly investigated and the gathering of hard evidence.</P>
    <P>We must examine how the Revenue Commissioners do their business.  Is there a nod and a wink between the Revenue Commissioners and certain financial institutions?  It was astonishing to hear the descriptions by AIB of the deal it had done with the Revenue Commissioners.  It was all done by telephone and there was not a scrap of paper to indicate any deal was done.  However, quite clearly, the banks were not paying the full DIRT that was due and, equally clearly, the Revenue Commissioners were not demanding the full tax due.  There is a clear conflict of statement there which must be resolved.  There can be no solution unless that core area is resolved.</P>
    <P>When the matter is resolved, we must examine the whole question of penalties.  If we are to have hard evidence of very serious defrauding of the State at the highest level of money to which it was entitled by the use of offshore bogus accounts, in the clear knowledge of those who are responsible for making decisions on this matter, the State must act in an appropriate manner.  That appropriate manner must be similar to what would happen at other levels of society, which must mean prison sentences as well as financial sanctions.</P>
    <P>The day when someone who has defrauded the country of a large amount of money due to the State ends up in the prison, will be the day that the rich, powerful and privileged will be seen to be dealt with adequately.  It is probably wishful thinking that that would be the outcome, but the public wants this matter cleared up and for the banks to be dealt with in a proper and serious way.  They want to see people taking the rap for the misappropriation and misconduct which has taken place.</P>
    <P>Someone must be at fault and we must be able to determine who it is.  We were unable to get at the major heroin traffickers until the death of Veronica Guerin.  Very quickly after that we established the Criminal Assets Bureau and enacted anti-drug trafficking legislation.  Now there is not a single major drug trafficker operating in this country as they have all disappeared &mdash; some of them are offshore with their offshore accounts.  Effective action was taken in that case.</P>
    <P>Those are the points which this legislation must prove.  There are also a few actions the Minister can take.  For example, he should have indicated in his budget speech some progress towards imposing a levy on the banks which have been beneficiaries of the reduction in corporation tax. This would be a wonderful opportunity to ensure they pay back some of the money they take from their customers.</P>
    <P>The banks are making exorbitant profits.  The Bank of Ireland made in excess £0.5 billion in its half yearly accounts, which is £1 billion in a year. That is as much as the Minister has in his budgetary surplus &mdash; or, at least, it was until the NTMA suggested there might be another £1 billion somewhere. <Col N="1198" /> The AIB is making similar profits.  We are talking about enormous sums of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has both the opportunity and the duty to ensure the banks are examined very carefully in terms of what the State is doing to increase their profits through the reduction in corporation tax.  I would like the Minister to do this in the next budget as I do not think he can do in the Finance Bill; or perhaps he can.  I do not know how long it will take for the report to be compiled and addressed, but the Finance Bill is usually not enacted until late spring, so there may be an opportunity there.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has been lethargic in the fulfilment of its duties.  It has stated it does not have a hands on role in the dealings of the financial institutions, but it has a broad supervisory role.  With the establishment of the European Central Bank, the bank has been effectively deprived of any major role in the regulation of Exchequer funding, etc.  In view of this, it has a much greater opportunity to provide a supervisory role to the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  It is specifically targeted and I hope this ensure an effective report within a short period which will then enable the Committee of Public Accounts to complete its business, also within a short period, thus ensuring that early in the new year there will be a definitive resolution of this matter and that an effective standing mechanism will be established to deal with serious matters of this kind which are of public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contribution to this debate.  It is clear there is a consensus on the need to act quickly and effectively on the matter and that it must be resolved.</P>
      <P>The public concerns about the administration of DIRT and the conflict of opinions that arose during the hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts cannot be ignored.  The first interim report of the committee and the 1997 Appropriation Accounts recognised the need for the following: an investigation to be undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General, new powers for the Comptroller to pursue the investigation: the presentation of a report to Dáil Éireann setting out the facts as far as possible, an examination of the report by the Committee of Public Accounts using enhanced compellability powers and a report to the Dáil drawing conclusions and making recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these matters and many other crucial elements requested by the committee are effected in the Bill, which is a considered and balanced response to these recommendations.  The Government has made every effort to ensure that the arrangements being put in place are the right ones.  We have covered much ground in a short period.  I have been greatly assisted in framing this legislation by my consultations with the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General and their <Col N="1199" /> legal advisers.  I appreciate the time and commitment they have given to this matter over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>This has been a difficult exercise.  The matters to be investigated are very important.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent and constitutional officer and the request to him to prepare a special report of this kind breaks new ground.  However, I ask the House to take into account the pressing need to progress this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised a number of interesting matters concerned with non-residency.  The onus was on financial institutions to satisfy themselves about declarations.  If there was &mdash; doubt for example, if a person in a financial institution had doubt about the status of the non-resident &mdash; he or she was to seek an affidavit from the account holder.  The investigation to be proposed on foot of this Bill will address the matter raised by the Senator, that is, whether Revenue checked on the operation of the DIRT tax by the banks in an appropriate way consistent with its powers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issues raised by Senator Finneran, the Bill breaks new ground for the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is why it is complex legislation to frame.  A Deputy rightly described it as hybrid legislation.  The Comptroller's functions are specific and are laid down by the Constitution, and to ask him to enter a new area has proved difficult.  There have been difficult legal and constitutional issues to address. That is why the Bill is so complex.  An extraordinary amount of time has been given by officials in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General, by the Attorney General and by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and their legal advisers to try to produce appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>The further we move away from the traditional constitutional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the greater the risk of challenge, especially where large amounts of money are involved.  This is why the Bill provides that he may seek the direction of the High Court in the exercise of his functions and that he may use auditors to investigate the accounts of private persons.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran also raised the culture of cheating.  I am afraid there was a culture of cheating on the Revenue in the 1980s.  I hope we have moved on.  However, to try to eliminate the number of people who do not pay the correct amount of tax is equivalent to trying to eliminate sin; I am afraid it will always be with us.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not unique in this regard.  I have read a number of reports over the past six months or so on the various estimates by German economists of the size of the black economy in Germany and the estimates by various independent institutes of the number of German residents who have non-resident accounts and who use accounts in nearby countries.  This has considerably exercised <Col N="1200" /> the mind of my German counterpart, Mr. Lafontaine.</P>
    <P>While there was a different culture in the 1980s, the change in tax compliance and in Revenue practice from the 1980s to the 1990s are two of the reasons we are enjoying such large Exchequer surpluses in recent years.  As somebody who has practised in the accountancy profession for the best part of 30 years, I can confirm that the Revenue has changed its way of doing business.  Most people in the business will know that its professionalism, more modern communication systems and sheer efficiency, which has occurred over the past ten to 12 years, have helped to increase the largesse to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I hope the culture that prevailed in the 1980s has now changed.  There is a greater degree of compliance in the 1990s, but let nobody be under any illusion that for as long as income tax remains &mdash; it was introduced first as a temporary arrangement to last only a year &mdash; there will be a degree of evasion.  It is the job of Revenue and the law makers to make efficient law to ensure that everybody pays their taxes according to the law.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran also raised a question about section 14.  The Comptroller and Auditor General needs recourse to the High Court to resolve a constitutional challenge.  This is a support to him as he enters into a new and novel area.</P>
    <P>The Senator also questioned the purpose of section 20, which amends the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. This Act contains a specific provision which does not allow the investigation of taxation affairs.  To enable the Committee of Public Accounts exercise the functions of this Act it was necessary to change the provisions in that section.</P>
    <P>The question of privilege was raised by a number of Members.  The Constitution gives Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas privilege in respect of utterances and some years ago this was extended to cover utterances in committees. When I came here in the 1970s and there was a heated debate in the Dáil where Members hurled insults at each other, the common retort was &ldquo;say that outside the House&rdquo;.  This phrase was also used in the 1960s but it is not so frequently used nowadays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

      <P>That phrase was used this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad because when I was a young student, read Dáil debates and visited the House in the early 1970s the phrase &ldquo;repeat that outside the House&rdquo; was often said across the floor of the House.  That emphasises the absolute privilege which was conferred on utterances within the Houses of the Oireachtas but, as I said, it did not extend to anything said outside the Houses.  The conferral of absolute privilege by the Constitution on the Houses of the Oireachtas is very special and is not to be abused.  Some years ago this privilege was extended to cover utterances made in committees but today this Bill goes <Col N="1201" /> a step further in giving privilege to utterances between meetings provided they relate to the committee's performance of their duties.  Conferral of absolute privilege does not extend to television, radio or printed interviews and I pointed that out in my speech.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross made very interesting allegations about the banks and spoke of people being apologetic for them.  He is one person in Irish life who has long been a strident critic of the banking system, both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The matters he raised with regard to the banks have been debated for some time.</P>
      <P>In recent years people have become more cognisant and examine their bank statements to see how they are being charged.  About six years ago I discovered a charge on my account which I had not been aware of for the previous 25 years and it resulted in my paying over the odds.  I am someone who examines their bank statement because, for most of my adult life, my account has been in the red.  The banking system is far better than it was years ago because of the growing awareness among customers and the greater competition between banks.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross raised many questions about the banking scene and he has repeated them on many occasions.  He is not saying anything here today that he has not said before.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that there have to be remedies enforced at the end of this exercise.  He said there was little point going through a very difficult task of preparing this legislation without enforcing remedies.  He also said it would have been better if we had produced it earlier.  The persons that I mentioned earlier worked on this Bill up until last weekend.  Some people worked 16 and 18 hours per day over a long period of time.  Many consultations also took place between the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Finance, the Attorney General and the legal advisers to the Committee of Public Accounts.  With all this work it has not been easy to frame this legislation in the time frame.</P>
      <P>If Senator Ross's allegations are borne out by the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigations we will look to the Committee of Public Accounts to make its report and provide workable and reasonable remedies.  As the Senator has already pointed out, there is little point in having gone to all this trouble bringing this Bill before the House and waiting for the Committee of Public Accounts to finalise its report if we do not act upon it.  The Government will take its report on board.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general aspersions made by Senator Ross about the AIB, I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General will have discretion to give priority in his investigation to the substantive issue involving the AIB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to corporate welfare issues and to an interesting report released in the United States.  He spoke of the enrichment of the banks and shareholders.  This Bill deals specifically with the DIRT issue which has been alleged <Col N="1202" /> to involve an attempt by the banks to enrich their customers rather than themselves.  This is a general point and one to which Senator Ross also referred.  Since this controversy broke, the AIB has been accused, with other financial institutions, of breaking the law.  The committee will investigate this and the Revenue Commissioners said something else.  One of the jobs of the investigation will be to discover where the truth lies. Whatever about the AIB or other financial institutions breaking the law, that is questionable as the sense as to whether an account was genuinely resident, but, for the accounts that were not genuinely non-resident there is no question that the people who had money there were definitely breaking the law because that money would have been hidden from the Revenue Commissioners, proper taxation would not have been applied to it, and this should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether the number of bogus non-resident accounts is 20 or 40 per cent out, we will have to wait and see.  Perhaps this matter will never be resolved because of the lack of the actual number of bogus non-resident accounts. Let us say that the number is quite substantial, it is beyond my credulity that this comes as a surprise to many people because, if the alleged numbers are correct it means that people in every party must have known someone involved.  I would go so far as to say that perhaps Deputies and Senators knew them as well.</P>

      <P>My next comment will bring shock and horror to the Irish nation.  I suggest that journalists may have known these people as well because their father, mother, brother or sister may have been involved.  I am amazed that, since this scandal broke no one seems to know anyone involved.  This type of put on shock and horror does not wash with me.  Many years ago I read a book by Flann O'Brien entitled <i>At Swim-Two-Birds.</i> It is a classic and cannot be bought in bookshops but I have a copy at home.  It is about 30 years since I read it but I know that the first paragraph began with the words &ldquo;He was born at the age of 25&rdquo;.  It strikes me that some people seem to be born again in 1998 yet they were not around in 1988, 1978 or 1968.  This has surprised me in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is probably the last opportunity I will have to speak on this issue until we receive the final report, I would like to make the following comments.  I know Senator Ross has lived in the real world, like myself, in our past lives, we were known to drink, smoke, play cards and place the odd bet but we seem to be the only two people in the country who did this because everyone else is now in a state of virtuousness and will not admit they did all these things.  Senator Ross and myself did all those things and we lived in the real world. According to reports there are tens of thousands of these people throughout the country but apart <Col N="1203" /> from Senator Ross and myself, no one seems to have come across this in their past lives if one was to believe what has been said in this House and the other House and written and broadcast in the media over many months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will include Senator Coghlan as someone who has joined the real world also.  I would not like to offend anyone in the media by including them in this.  No journalist who gets a commission outside his normal newspaper would ever enter into an arrangement with the editor of that particular newspaper whereby he would be paid under the counter.  If such an allegation were made, I would set up a separate independent tribunal to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned that DIRT is not differentiated from other income tax in the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no simple solution to this.  DIRT is determined by a variety of complex factors, including the amount of money on deposit, the rate of tax, the rate of interest and the savings behaviour in the economy.  This is very difficult to estimate. However, I accept the Senator's concerns.  The matters referred to must form part of the investigations by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>I wish to say something to Senator Costello, and I put this down to the party to which he belongs.  During the 70 odd years of the freedom of this State, his party has never had a majority in Government.  During that period Senator Costello and his party have continually cast aspersions on members of my party.  Senator Costello did this in the typical manner this morning. Perhaps he was directed by his leader and his heart was not in it.  This was the typical old type of allegation &mdash; I do not think this man has anything to answer for but I will throw in the muck anyway.  In County Kildare, where Senator Ryan and I come from, if we want to cast aspersions we do it directly, not in a cowardly way.  If Senator Costello wishes to cast aspersions against an individual while enjoying the privilege of this House, he should do so directly and in a manly fashion. He should not do it in a cowardly fashion.</P>

      <P>The Senator raised the question of the levying of banks.  I pointed this out in answer to a parliamentary question on corporation tax.  The Minister for Finance, and probably his successors, would like to devise some ingenious <Col N="1204" /> system of getting more tax from particular institutions, given that the Government has decided on a single low rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent.  The reason we got into difficulty in Europe in this regard is that we had a general rate of corporation tax of 36 per cent to 40 per cent, and sometimes higher, and a low manufacturing tax rate of 10 per cent.  In 1996 the European Commission decided that was a distortion under the State aid regime.  We have now decided on a single low rate of corporation tax for everyone. If I were to devise an ingenious method of extracting money from any sector, I would get into difficulty with the European Commission which would say the same system applies as before, a nominal 12.5 per cent for everyone, but there is a special rate for different sectors.  It is not open to me to devise an ingenious solution at this time.</P>
      <P>The question of the accountability of banks was raised.  I want to draw Senators' attention to the provision in section 18 of the Bill whereby there may be application to the High Court for recovery of expenses from a bank.  The Bill provides that the cost of this exercise will be charged to the Exchequer.  However, under section 18 money can be recouped from financial institutions when appropriate.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is already exempt from the Freedom of Information Act because of the necessary confidentiality of the information.  In this investigation the Comptroller and Auditor General will receive the information under compulsion.  The exemption provided for under section 22 is necessary to ensure that progress in the inquiry is not inhibited by fear of disclosure to which the full application of the Freedom of Information Act might give rise.  This is a belt and braces provision.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is probably covered under the Freedom of Information Act.  However, we <Col N="1205" /> included this specific provision because of the novel role being given to him.</P>

      <P>The activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General are exempt under the Freedom of Information Act.  This section ensures that the investigations in this regard are exempt also under the Freedom of Information Act because of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General <i>vis-a-vis</i> private institutions. Information gathered by the Comptroller and Auditor General is exempt as of now under the Freedom of Information Act.  This will ensure that people will co-operate fully with him in his investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a disadvantage because I did not realise that the Comptroller and Auditor General is entirely exempt.  The section as written appears to suggest that a record created before the commencement of the examination or investigation, or a record relating to the general administration of the office of the Comptroller, is not exempted under the Freedom of Information Act.  I have no problem about the issue the Minister raises.  Of course, sensitive information should not be disclosed.  The principle of freedom of information is not to allow people to pry into other people's private affairs or to pry into matters that deserve to be kept secret.  It is to make sure nothing is kept secret simply because it is more convenient to keep it secret, because it might be politically embarrassing or might enable people to conceal mistakes and so on.  I am not concerned about the specific exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act because they are reasonable but I am concerned that there is a blanket exemption under this provision and nothing can be done about it.  That is too generous to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 provides that the Freedom of Information Act will not apply to the Comptroller and Auditor General for the purpose of the investigation provided for in the Bill. This exemption does not apply to a record created before the commencement of the examination or investigation or to a record relating to the general administration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  This is in line with the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Freedom of Information Act.  The general administration of his office comes within the scope of the Act while constitutional functions are excluded.  After the investigation commences there might be sensitive or confidential records in the general administration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office which could be accessed by requests under the Freedom of Information Act.  The exclusion is to prevent this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the Comptroller and Auditor General in the exercise of his constitutional functions <Col N="1206" /> is not covered by the Freedom of Information Act but the general administration of his office, like any other Department, is accessible under the Act.  The purpose of section 22 is to ensure that any confidential records which might be in the general administration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office would also be exempt during the lifetime of these investigations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I wished to make. I accept that many of the records in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be covered by the Freedom of Information Act. That is reasonable.  However, just because there is a fear that something might slip into the general administration area, even though in that area sensible exemptions apply to commercially sensitive material, personal records and so forth, there is an unfortunate tendency to use a general exemption.  That has a sledgehammer effect.</P>
      <P>If that argument were to be carried to its conclusion there would be no freedom of information legislation.  Sometimes items such as correspondence between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary General of his Department are released to the public because of the Freedom of Information Act.  The logic of the Minister's argument leads to the conclusion that the Act should be repealed even though nobody wishes to do that.  As a matter of policy a general exemption is a bad idea.  Reference should be made to specific records and exemptions and when the exemptions should apply to specific records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can also look at this another way.  There might be something in the general administration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office which the Comptroller and Auditor General might be considering to enhance his investigation.  It might be relevant to his tactics or his approach to a problem which he might not wish to be generally known.  The exemption in that case would be to the benefit of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of situation is envisaged and protected under the Freedom of Information Act.  Reports that are not complete and strategies or tactics relating to matters which are not resolved are already covered by the Act.  That is how the legislation ought to function.  Nobody wishes to make it possible for people to have advance notice of the tactics the State or the Comptroller and Auditor General will pursue. However, they are covered by the Act and correctly so.  It would be ridiculous if they were not.</P>
      <P>This provision appears to be an example of slightly sloppy drafting.  The easiest option was to include a general exemption rather than deal with it in the spirit of the freedom of information legislation, that is, by providing that exemptions which are applicable should be applied.  Instead there is a scattergun effect and that is a pity.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Minister for Agriculture and Food for the increase in incidence of bovine diseases among the nation's cattle herd; and calls on the Minister to investigate the reasons for this huge increase and to outline the proposals he has to deal with this animal health crisis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming here to debate this very important measure.  It gives me great pleasure to propose the motion before the House tonight.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that everybody has been frightened by the increase in the figures published in the past few weeks.  At a time when the beef industry is going through one of the worst periods in living memory, the banner headlines in last week's newspapers &mdash; particularly in the <i>Farmer's Journal</i>&mdash; stated there was a big explosion in TB. It saddened everybody in the industry.  It was a particularly harsh blow to an industry already on its knees.</P>
      <P>During 1998 the number of reactors per thousand tests increased in almost every one of the Twenty-six Counties.  Over 8,000 herds have suffered breakdowns this year compared to 6,600 in the same period in 1997.  This is a frightening figure for an industry already on its knees.  As Members know, 13 counties have a higher incidence than the national average.  Monaghan heads this with 8.4 reactors per thousand tests, followed by Cavan, Wicklow, Laois, Sligo, Clare and Leitrim all of which have an average higher than the national average.  The figure of 40,000 reactors this year compared with 28,600 in 1997 is staggering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When examining the bovine TB eradication scheme we must go back to 1958.  At that time 25 per cent of all herds were diseased.  Major steps <Col N="1209" /> were taken in the past 40 years and it has now been brought down to approximately 0.5 per cent today.  By any comparison, that is a very good effort.  However, it cost the Irish taxpayer a huge amount of money, a staggering £1.5 billion, to bring it to that level.</P>
    <P>There were many hiccups between farming organisations and vets in those years.  The biggest contentious issue was when Deputy Yates, as Minister for Agriculture, proposed an alternative. Instead of the State overseeing the eradication of disease, he put in place a scheme whereby individual farmers would shoulder responsibility. Under his proposals, farmers have the responsibility for arranging their first herd test each year and for taking the appropriate measures to safeguard their existing herds.  Critically, the individual farmer rather than the Department must pay the private vets for carrying out the work.</P>
    <P>He was probably one of the first Ministers for Agriculture who tried to reform the scheme, and was successful.  His proposals for reform included a scheme that was the most radical ever to be undertaken.  That is how he described it then.  It is probably fair to say they were the best prospect for success.</P>
    <P>At that time, Deputy Yates showed his political mettle by devising proposals which divided farmers and vets.  A proposed reduction in the levies farmers had to pay to the Department from £28 million pounds to £10 million concentrated the minds in the farming community.  The farming community at that time were enticed by the proposed abolition of the compulsory 60 day pre-movement test, which farmers at that time had to arrange and pay for to allow them to sell their cattle.</P>
    <P>Farming organisations, such as the IFA and ICMSA, also signalled their support.  At the same time the Irish Veterinary Union continued to oppose it.  It was a long and acrimonious dispute. Despite the division between the Irish Veterinary Union and Deputy Yates at that time, the changeover to private payment by farmers has since been acknowledged and a year later many vets expressed their satisfaction.  At one of their annual conferences this was acknowledged as a better system than the previous one.</P>
    <P>I am outlining the history of TB eradication to help Members understand why I am proposing this motion.  Huge changes have taken place in relation to the funding of this scheme and they have proved very costly from time to time.  Great sacrifices and changes have taken place.</P>
    <P>In late 1997, when an assessment of this scheme took place, the number of animals per thousand failing the TB test was further on the decline.  The herd incidence had dropped from 6.5 per cent to 5.7 per cent.  The Department, in its report, stated the national round of testing under the new arrangement had proceeded in a satisfactory way with the number of tests being carried out on a par with previous years.  Perhaps the most interesting piece of information the Department issued at that time was that in the national round <Col N="1210" /> of tests, the number of reactors &mdash; animals showing signs of infection &mdash; was 3 per thousand tests compared to 3.3 per thousand in 1995.  From any figure or comparison we may consider, in both 1996 and 1997 the number of incidents seems to have fallen.</P>
    <P>However this was until the latest report.  The latest report shows one of the most frightening features.  After some years of improvement, TB levels in cattle are again showing an upward trend.  The latest Department figures show the numbers of reactors per 1,000 animals across the country increased from 2.5 to 3.4 per cent in the past 12 months.  Figures have increased in 23 of the Twenty-six Counties, and increases are significant in Waterford and Wicklow, areas with a high level of wildlife.  I referred earlier to the TB forum and the package that was agreed in 1996. The Department is now carrying out an investigation of outbreaks of disease among wildlife. These cattle are being removed but wildlife that is reportedly carrying the disease is being left in place.  This is a poor way to tackle a very dangerous problem.</P>
    <P>It is unfair and totally unjust to everybody involved in the eradication of TB.  I have a lot of respect for wildlife and would hate to see any of those animals removed from their natural habitats, particularly as we are doing so much under the successful rural environmental protection scheme.  That scheme has done much to preserve the environment for wildlife.  It is a shame that badgers are causing a problem, but we must face reality.  We have to be prepared to take stronger action in this area.  What action does the Minister of State propose to take?  The bottom line is that there is no point taking diseased cattle away and leaving diseased badgers.</P>
    <P>This situation has gone on for too long, and too many people have been hurt by what is happening in the disease eradication area, either with tuberculosis or brucellosis.  It is having a huge effect on our economy at a time when the beef industry and agriculture as a whole are going through a difficult period.  We all know that the food industry is suffering badly, and I call on the Minister of State to give that industry an answer. If we do not have disease free status we will be going nowhere as a food exporting country.</P>

      <P>The increase in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the nation's cattle herd is a very serious matter.  I am interested in the Minister of State's reasons for the huge increases and the proposals he and his Department have to resolve the problem.

      <P>There is a lot of fog in these Houses too at times.  I will be very interested in Senator O'Brien's contribution.  There has been an explosive increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis.  The national figures outlined by Senator Hayes are catastrophic.  There are 13 counties riddled with huge increases in reactor numbers that are out of all proportion.  I would be interested to learn if I am wrong, but I do not think I am.  I acknowledge that one quarter of the national herd was diseased in 1958, and a tremendous effort was made to eradicate that disease but we must look at the enormous cost to the taxpayer, and we are still not rid of it.  Numbers are increasing again and that upward trend is very worrying.</P>
      <P>I am as concerned as anyone about the safety of wildlife, but if it is conclusively known that badgers are responsible, as I think it is, definite and appropriate measures will have to be put in place.  The Department must stop pussyfooting around on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach is very good to people who are disadvantaged.  I come from Kerry, where we are severely handicapped as well as being disadvantaged, particularly my area in south Kerry.  It is similar to west Cork, which the Minister of State will appreciate.  The brucellosis figures for 1997 meant 47 herds in Kerry were depopulated, 39 in 1996 and 65 this year.  That is deplorable. Why is it happening?  As regards TB, the national average is 3.9 per 1,000 tests, but the Kerry figure is 4.9 per 1,000 tests.  I agree with Senator Hayes. We are sending the wrong signals about the food industry of which we are so proud.  I look forward to the Minister of State's proposals.  I hope better and more appropriate measures are to be taken and that the Department will act quickly in implementing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the measures taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to control the incidence of bovine diseases in the national herd.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers have said, this is a matter of grave concern.  Bovine diseases have existed for many years and the recent figures are frightening. There will be 40,000 TB reactors this year compared to 26,600 last year and 30,400 the previous year.  Additional reactors have been identified throughout the country rather than in just some counties or regions.  This has resulted in a breakdown of 8,000 herds this year compared to 6,600 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Fine Gael motion condemning the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The Minister is doing everything possible to address the problem.  I blame the former Minister, Deputy Yates, for these serious breakdowns. Senator Tom Hayes praised the former Minister for introducing radical changes.  I opposed those changes vehemently at the time and I believe it is they which are responsible for the breakdowns which have occurred.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the compulsory 60 day pre-movement test is responsible for the increased incidence of breakdowns being experienced at present.  Farmers or others in the industry were buying cattle which might not have been tested for up to 16 months previously.  In the absence of a pre-movement test, no proof was available to the buyer that the animals were disease free.  The post-movement test was expensive and was not compulsory.  There is not much point having a compulsory post-movement test unless a pre-movement test is also compulsory.</P>
      <P>We all welcomed the reduction in levies but neither I nor any other farmer would be averse to paying levies if that kept bovine disease outside the farm gate.  I had the painful experience of my herd being depopulated, as had my colleague, Senator O'Brien.  A young neighbour of mine starting out on his career in farming has already had his herd depopulated twice, once with TB and once with brucellosis.  Another outbreak occurred recently and he is facing herd depopulation once more.  It is a source of heartbreak for any farmer to face herd depopulation.</P>
      <P>Wildlife has been identified as a contributory factor to the increased incidence of TB and the effect of badger removal is currently being studied in detail.  A survey carried out in County Offaly indicated the level of bovine TB fell significantly following badger removal.  While we do not like to see wildlife being removed, it is necessary in some cases.  I urge the Minister to ensure his Department monitors badger movement in various areas.  The Department has asked farmers to pay for the first test; I do not believe that, coupled with the reduction of levies on farmers, would result in savings for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I am concerned about the bad price being paid for reactors in the factories.  It might be argued that as these animals are diseased, one could not expect a better price for them.  I am aware of a recent case where a TB reactor was identified on a farm and subsequently taken by the Department to a meat factory.  When the animal was examined in the factory after it was slaughtered, it was revealed it was not infected with TB.  The tests are often inaccurate, although it is a necessary precaution to remove TB reactors from farms.  However, it is possible to establish whether the animal is disease free when it has been slaughtered.</P>
    <P>Farmers who are herd depopulated receive only 18p per pound for the animals.  That is a disgrace. What happens to the meat from these animals? Is it identified as disease free or sold on to the consumer?  We must ensure consumers are protected.  We are proud of our green image and the quality of our food and can stand over our record in that regard.  However, if it is proven that animals are disease free following slaughter, a better price should be paid to farmers.  A sum of 18p per pound is meagre and does not encourage farmers to continue farming.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the necessary reintroduction of the 30 day pre-movement test to ensure the disease is controlled.  It was a grievous mistake on the part of the former Minister to abolish the 60 day pre-movement test.  Had it remained, we would not be experiencing the current incidence of TB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous Senators have dealt mainly with the statistics on bovine disease. Statistics can often reveal interesting information but can also conceal vital information.  We must consider the alarming increase in the incidence of bovine TB against the background of CAP reform and Agenda 2000 and do all in our power to make our beef more competitive on the global market.</P>
      <P>In the past five years, the level of beef consumption has fallen by approximately 10 per cent. If that drop continues, our beef market will be in serious trouble.  CAP reform will result in lower guaranteed prices being the order of the day.  It is imperative the Minister grasps this problem. Much of the drop in the level of beef consumption relates to public anxiety about diseases such as BSE.  The dramatic drop in consumption levels following the BSE crisis is only now climbing back again.  Public reaction to the increase in the incidence of bovine TB will set alarm bells ringing and influence the level of beef consumption.  That is regrettable.  It behoves us all to get to the root of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bovine TB eradication scheme has been in operation since 1957 and has cost in the region of £1.5 billion.  Yet, in 1998, 5 per cent of the national herd is infected, while in 1957-8 about 25 per cent of the national herd was infected.  The level of infection has been reduced by 20 per cent but at an enormous cost of £1.5 billion and we <Col N="1214" /> have still not eradicated the disease.  The nature of infectious diseases means that we will probably never reach total eradication but we should nonetheless strive towards that end.</P>
    <P>Numerous causes have been identified for the increase in the incidence of TB.  Badgers and other wildlife have been mentioned, although I do not know what scientific evidence is available to support these claims.  However, they must contribute to some degree to the increasing incidence of TB.  If not, incompetence on the veterinary side would be the only explanation and I would not consider that to be the case because the vets are professionals who have been dealing with the disease for many years.  I am sure their competence cannot be questioned.</P>
    <P>The Department should get to the root of the problem and intensify its efforts to eradicate the disease.  Against the background of CAP reform we must be able to compete with the best beef in the world.  If we have such a reputation we will be able to sell on the global market.  That is where we will have to compete shortly.</P>
    <P>Another factor to be considered is the enlargement of the EU.  Next year six or seven countries will be engaged in membership discussions.  These countries are beef producers and they will be competing with us in a few years time on the global market.  We should be striving to be ahead of them with our quality products.  The enlargement of the Community, especially with regard to CAP reform, will pose many serious problems for the beef industry in the future.  The implications of Agenda 2000 have not been thought out fully.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we should be discussing a matter that will bring a focus to bear which we do not want on the beef industry.  We need to promote our products on the basis that we have the best on offer.  If we can offer the best product Irish farmers will have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take on board the serious issues raised by Senators about the increased incidence of bovine TB.  If the problem is tackled constructively with a renewed and determined effort we will be able to reduce the level of the disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to the House for the debate on this important matter which affects so many farming families around the country.  The increase in the number of outbreaks of bovine TB and brucellosis is of great concern to the farming sector.  County Monaghan is one of the blackest spots in the country for TB.  In these difficult times bovine diseases cause great hardship for many farmers, especially dairy farmers who may have a good dairy herd wiped out.  They get very low prices at the factories for their cows and their returns from milk are lost.</P>
      <P>Diseases such as TB, brucellosis and BSE can have incredible effects on herds.  The level of prices which the factories pay for such cattle is seriously low.  Prices are bad in general but the prices paid for diseased cattle are not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> In the past when herds were wiped out at least the farmer got a reasonable price for the cattle.</P>
    <P>The various TB eradication schemes introduced since 1950 have had little success and have not had a major impact in the fight against TB. Although there are fewer cases of TB now than in the past, they have a far greater effect on farming families.  Cattle change hands many times in their lifetime and in County Monaghan, for example, farms may be divided and the cattle must be moved from one farm to another where they may come in contact with neighbouring herds.  This can lead to diseases being spread easily.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will pass on the points made in this debate to the Minister, Deputy Walsh.  A new tagging system has been introduced which will make it more difficult to interfere with tags.  All previous Ministers have introduced eradication schemes but they did not clear up the problem.  The farmers and their families suffer most from the failure of these schemes.  It can be greatly depressing for a farmer to see his herd wiped out by disease.</P>
    <P>There are others who can help the Minister and the Department in the fight against these diseases. The Department produces leaflets to give the farming community advice to improve matters. Farmers have a role to play in making the country disease free.  We have been working at the problem long enough to expect success.  I hope we have more success in the future because we need it.  Far too many farmers are still affected and I hope the position improves.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Hayes for tabling this motion.  Not many people realised there had been a dramatic increase in TB among the national herd but he has brought this into national focus. An increase of 30 per cent between 1997 and 1998 is alarming by any standards; the numbers of reactors and restricted herds have risen substantially. I hope the Minister will be able to provide a good explanation for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kiely has his own interpretation but I would prefer a full-blown analysis from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  On the point he raised, there was a difficulty because of a lack of staff for pre-movement testing, but that is an argument for another day.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers said, eradication schemes stretch back to the fifties.  As a farmer's daughter in west Clare I remember many herds being restricted, which was a dramatic development. There was a degree of success over the years, with the percentage of the herd becoming infected reducing from 25 per cent to 5 per cent, but it cost a lot of money &mdash; well over £1 billion has been spent to date on eradicating TB from the national herd.  It is therefore a serious matter that there has been such a substantial increase in infection.</P>
      <P>TB is also on the increase among people, as reported by the health boards.  One wonders whether the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Health and Children have compared the figures.  They should be examined closely to see, for instance, if there is an increase in TB incidence among people in a county where it has increased among cattle, or whether beef or milk from reactor herds has caused human TB.  I hope the Ministers can work in tandem to establish if there is a link, because it is extraordinary that incidence of the two diseases should increase simultaneously.  It is for the good of the population that the matter should be examined.</P>
      <P>It is a serious matter for a farmer to have a herd restricted because it cannot be moved and the financial compensation in no way meets the overall loss and suffering which a farm family experiences.  Whether it happens to a small, medium or large farmer, everyone in the family is greatly affected.  Some farmers have had their herds restricted for up to four consecutive years, resulting in phenomenal hardship which no one would wish to endure.</P>
      <P>This has been an extremely bad year for agriculture in climatic terms.  Many farmers could not harvest enough fodder for the winter season and milk yields were down because of poor weather and the poor quality of grass.  When these factors are coupled with the restriction of a herd, it leads to crucifixion for a farm family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, important that the Minister seriously examines the matter.  I ask him to consider compensation for reactors in light of the crisis already existing in the agricultural sector. To have the herd restricted on top of that makes life impossible for the farm family concerned.  I regret that the senior Minister has not responded sufficiently strongly to the current farming crisis &mdash; he has made token gestures but no serious response.  The Minister for State currently in the House is an active and successful farmer; he comes from an area which is unique in Irish agriculture because it has the best land in the country. <Col N="1217" /> Therefore, he is probably not aware of the hardship which small and medium farmers are experiencing. Nevertheless, he is a sensible man and I ask him to impress upon his senior colleague the suffering, hardship and depression among the farming community.</P>
    <P>The other long-term problem, if this trend continues, will be the possible presence of TB in food.  It is vital that our herd be as clean as possible. As Senator Caffrey said, we have to compete within a larger Europe &mdash; we should remember that Poland, which has its foot on the threshold of the EU, waiting to enter, has seven million farmers, more than the current member states put together.  As a small member state, we must be in a position to compete and we cannot afford to have any labels attached to us.  These agricultural issues must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should ask his senior colleague to wake up to the disastrous state of Irish agriculture.  He seems to be oblivious, in a dream world somewhere between Brussels and Skibbereen, unaware of the realities.  I wish he would come to this House for a proper debate on agriculture to see whether he is anywhere near coming to grips with the fundamental problems affecting our farmers.  It is difficult for them to face Christmas, they have little money in their pockets and the Minister has done nothing to relieve their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and support Senator Kiely's amendment.  In the BSE crisis some rogue individuals made a big killing at the expense of farmers but the Department took swift and decisive action against them.  We must move in the same way in regard to rogue farmers who spread TB and brucellosis.</P>
      <P>Senators Hayes and Taylor-Quinn referred to Deputy Yates' proposals whereby farmers were to organise testing of their herds.  There is no doubt that the majority of honorable, decent farmers would agree to that but, unfortunately, the problems emanate from a number of rogue and crooked farmers who have caused the spread of these diseases.  The huge increase in livestock numbers should also be examined.  Last week's farming newspapers pointed out the alarming numbers involved nationwide.  However, they are not a great deal worse than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problems associated with badgers and wild deer, which travel miles across farm land.  They are not restricted from leaving various estates and, because there is no restriction on culling them to reduce numbers, they spread disease.  Recently, a number of them almost caused fatalities when crossing a road near where I live in County Offaly.  A pilot project relating to badgers was set up there and the figures proved it was successful.  When it was first mooted a number of years ago, many people were seriously opposed to doing anything about the number of badgers.  I agree with their preservation, but they cannot be preserved at the cost of farmers losing <Col N="1218" /> their livelihoods.  The herds of some farmers have been cleaned out.  It is a sad reflection of the problem relating to badgers and deer.</P>
    <P>Certain farmers bought land in different counties and this created a problem.  One farmer bought land in a neighbouring county to mine and moved in excess of 150 animals onto that land. After the herd was first tested for brucellosis he lost 100 cattle.  Why did that happen in an area where people did not even know what brucellosis was?  Farmers are losing livestock test after test. The Minister of State can check this with his officials in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>Farmers must move into new holdings with clean herds.  They must not be allowed to bring in livestock which will infect all the other animals in that area.  A considerable amount of land has been sold or set aside for long-term lease which results in cattle being moved a considerable distance. This must be looked at and tightened up quickly if the problem is to be tackled.  I hope the Minister of State's officials will back him and the Minister in ensuring that moneys are provided to avoid what happened in my county as I do not wish to see it happening in any other county.</P>
    <P>Compensation has been mentioned.  It is common knowledge that people have moved large numbers of animals onto farms and, for some strange reason, the entire herd has gone down.  I compliment the Minister of State on the recent removal of certain reactor cattle and the continued testing of the herds involved in an effort to punish the farmers who own them and prevent them from cleaning out the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to bad prices.  He said that certain meat factories are not paying much more than the market price for clean cattle and that if they had their way they would pay as little as the market price.  I hope the Department will make every effort to ensure rogues and crooks are dealt with and that decent, honourable farmers, who are anxious to make a living off the land, will be helped.  We do not want to drive them off the land.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Minister for Agriculture and Food for the increase in incidence of bovine diseases among the nations cattle herd; and calls on the Minister to investigate the reasons for this huge increase and to outline the proposals he has to deal with this animal health crisis.</P>
      <P>While I agree with Senator Moylan's final remarks, they do not reflect the Government amendment which states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the measures taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to control the incidence of bovine diseases in the national herd.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The reality is that the Minister has done absolutely nothing about this since he assumed office. The cleaning out of a herd is a huge cost to be borne by any family.  In many cases families have been put out of business and forced to sell their farms.  The previous Minister, Deputy Yates, had the courage to put initiatives in place.  However, in the past 12 months the incidence of disease has increased because the Minister has done little or nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the motion that the Minister should, as a matter of urgency, investigate the possibility of new measures to tackle this issue, as Senator Moylan said, once and for all.  This very serious problem is costing the taxpayer and the farmers a fortune.  It is now costing farmers on the double because, not alone is it costing them on their tax, they are also paying directly for tests.  I agree with Senator Moylan.  It is a pity the amendment was not framed in a way which said the Minister and all concerned should tackle this very serious issue once and for all.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has decided to wait to hear every Senator speak before he speaks.  I will stray a little from the motion in my contribution because it has been very well covered by previous speakers on this side of the House.  I wish to draw to the Minister's attention my concerns in regard to the fodder aid package.  The Government is proposing a payment of £300 per farm in need of this measure.</P>

      <P>The motion has been very well covered.  The Minister has decided to hear every Senator before he contributes and I wish to bring this matter to his attention.  The IFA is looking for £1,000 per farm.  This is decided on the basis of DEDs, which is very unfair.  I come from a county in which the majority of the land is very poor.  Some farmers are qualifying for the fodder aid package but others are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate, Senator Tom Hayes for moving the motion and Senator Rory Kiely for moving the amendment.  It was a very interesting debate.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to recommend support for the counter motion before the House, to address aspects of the Irish cattle and livestock sector and to update the House on the actions we have taken to safeguard the health status of the national herd in support of the sector.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the tremendous growth rates achieved by other sectors and the current difficulties in agriculture, the agriculture sector continues to be the largest and most important single sector in our economy.  Its contribution extends well beyond the farming and food processing sectors and, indeed, many others areas of economic activity have substantial reliance on its well being. The gross value of the agriculture sector is likely to be in excess of £3.3 billion in 1998 and the value of livestock and livestock product exports will be in the region of £2 billion for the year. Of course, these figures do not fully reflect the contribution which the sector makes to consequential and ancillary employment, nor do they fully highlight the almost negligible import content of agricultural and food exports.</P>
      <P>Our agriculture sector has, of course, a huge reliance on export markets for its output.  In particular, we export the equivalent of 70 per cent of our milk output and an even higher percentage of our cattle production.  Nine out of every ten steers produced here are destined for export markets. Our capacity to find outlets for these products is determined by a number of factors, in particular the perception and quality of the products and their perceived safety from the consumer and animal health points of view.  Down through the years, we have consistently operated measures which seek to maintain a very high animal health status to underpin these aspects and, by and large, we have been able to meet the demanding requirements of all the major importing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years, we operated a restrictive import regime for cattle and complemented this by comprehensive control and eradication <Col N="1221" /> measures for diseases which existed here.  In this way, we have avoided many of the more serious diseases encountered elsewhere, such as foot and mouth disease in cattle and classical swine fever in pigs.  Although the import regime was relaxed following the completion of the Single Market, the import rules that have been put in place continue, nevertheless, to afford a reasonable degree of protection against the more serious diseases. Of course, as an island we are surrounded by sea and we should always be well protected. However, many changes have taken place since we joined the Single Market and some new diseases have been imported into the country.  The importation of foodstuffs from outside the Community is also a cause for concern, on which I voiced my personal views recently.  A number of meetings have taken place in this regard.  I am glad the Irish Farmers' Association is now addressing that problem.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the control and eradication measures we have applied, we continue to have other bovine diseases in particular brucellosis, TB and BSE.  As regards brucellosis, the position is that we have operated control and eradication measures since the mid-1960s. Substantial progress was made in reducing the level of brucellosis in cattle by the mid-1980s and in 1986 the country was declared &ldquo;brucellosis free&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding this, brucellosis continued to be present in the national herd at that time and in the following years.  For example, in the years 1989-95, there were about 400 new breakdowns each year and, on average, some 120 herds were depopulated annually.</P>
    <P>The position began to deteriorate in 1996 and 1997 and a series of measures were introduced to address this in 1997 and 1998.  Among the main measures introduced were the following.  From February 1998, all eligible animals being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement. In addition to the foregoing, and from the same time, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age could not be sold more than once, on foot of a brucellosis test; also such cattle must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding.  A full round of blood testing for all eligible cattle was introduced to augment and complement existing arrangements, including monthly milk ring testing.  Revamped administrative procedures were adopted in the Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds.  There was also the early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities and increased epidemiology work by veterinary staff.  An awareness campaign was arranged to update farmers and others on appropriate farm husbandry and management practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> Under the new arrangements, some 5.3 million blood samples have been taken and tested so far this year, compared with about 3.5 million in 1997.  We recruited additional staff for the Cork laboratory and introduced other arrangements &mdash; for example, Swiftpost &mdash; to ensure an efficient testing service for farmers.</P>
    <P>While the number of new outbreaks of brucellosis will be higher again in 1998, it is too early to draw conclusions as to the full effectiveness of the new measures.  Given the nature of the disease, it will not be possible to draw definitive conclusions on their impact until after next year's calving.  However, the expectation is that the intensive testing regime will have identified reactors at an early stage, thereby facilitating the early removal of infection and contributing to an improved situation in the medium term.  The education and awareness arrangements undertaken complement this and should bring about improved farm management practices to further enhance the measures.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Senators, especially Senator Moylan, who spoke about taking swift and decisive action to clear out the rogues and crooks.  He spoke about wild deer, which are not being tested at present.  Deputy Fox recently tabled an Adjournment motion in the Dáil on the issue of TB in Wicklow, where there are problems with deer, and I met her later in my office.  There are many alternative enterprises nowadays which are involved in deer farming.  Many Senators spoke about deer.  It has also been proved that badgers have an effect in this regard.  There are also many two legged badgers who create more problems in that area.</P>
    <P>I have visited most of the new offices in the country.  The staff and vets working there are very dedicated.  They are genuinely concerned about brucellosis and what is happening.  Nobody has better identified the problem than Senator Moylan. I am aware of the Banagher area.  My colleague from north County Cork, Deputy Michael Moynihan, asked a relevant question on the matter in the Dáil yesterday.  County Offaly had seven cases of brucellosis in 1996 and seven in 1997 and that has grown to 12.  I visited the county during the middle of the summer and was made aware of what was happening in the Banagher area, including the wipe out of many fine dairy herds.  It is not a great dairying county.</P>
    <P>The annual net cost of animal disease to the economy is £50 million.  That cannot continue. Senator Tom Hayes makes weekly demands on the Minister, the Government and me to produce more schemes.  However, while this cost continues it is very difficult for me to make a case to the Government for additional funding.  The problem has dragged on for far too long and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The country was declared free of TB in 1954. A big presentation was made by the then Minister, the late Neil Blayney.  I was appalled and shocked at the figures produced yesterday to which I have referred.  They are a cause of worry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> It is good that Senator Moylan has spoken out here and has identified the cause of the problem.</P>
    <P>There are problems with wildlife, badgers and mischief.  I am not happy that enough has been done to reduce the cost of the disease.  I have visited the veterinary offices and am concerned for the decent, honest farmers throughout the country who work so genuinely to protect their herds. As Minister of State I receive numerous telephone calls at weekends asking if I have heard about an outbreak nearby, yet the caller does not want to be identified.  Farmers must identify more with the problem and address the issue up front.</P>
    <P>Compensation was mentioned.  If the compensation level is higher than the value of the animal it will lead to greater mischief and more problems. Compensation must always be lesser than the value of the animal, otherwise it will become a growth industry and will lead to the kind of troubles we have at present.  I know I will be castigated by the farming organisations for what I have said.  However, I understand the farming business.  A level must be set where it is not profitable to seek compensation.  If it is correctly set control will follow.  Many people urge that we should increase compensation levels in respect of brucellosis because the milk quota system encouraged farmers to buy additional heifers and calves as their herds were not at the maximum suckling levels.  I do not know if that is the answer.  There is a problem here.</P>
    <P>The farming bodies and the veterinary interests attended the Animal Health Forum last week. The Minister also attended.  It was indicated that the measures introduced in 1997 and 1998 will be maintained for a further period.  In addition the co-operation of all concerned was sought to continue to fully operate these measures and to follow and promote good farming practices.  We will continue to keep the position under close review and with the full co-operation of all, we can bring about an early reduction in the level of brucellosis and work towards the early eradication of the disease from the national cattle herd.  The disease can be eradicated with existing technology and through the application of good controls and sensible herd management practices.  It is important that all interests work towards the goal of eradication.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that considerable effort and resources have been devoted to seeking to control and eradicate TB since the 1950s when eradication measures were first introduced. Considerable progress was achieved in the early stages but further sustained progress towards eradication has not been achieved over the past 30 years or so.  A major effort was made under ERAD in the latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s to bring about an improvement in the situation. Under ERAD, a comprehensive testing programme using severe interpretation was implemented with 44 million tests being completed. Some 151,000 reactors were removed over the four year period.  The main conclusion drawn <Col N="1224" /> from the programme was that eradication of TB was more difficult than had been envisaged and that emphasis needed to be placed on the development of technological tools to achieve eradication.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, the emphasis has been on efficient management of the eradication programme with complete and orderly rounds of testing designed to make progressive reductions in the residual disease incidence level.  The TB incidence level has tended to be cyclical with a reactor disclosure rate of on average three per thousand cattle tests. However, the incidence of TB has increased significantly and it is anticipated that there will be more than 40,000 reactors disclosed in 1998.  That is a terrible state of affairs.  The cost to the taxpayer and the farming community cannot continue. It is all about discipline.  The vast majority of farmers are good, respectable people who do their business well.  The situation must be addressed intensively.</P>
    <P>This increase and especially the scale of the increase over 1997, which had the lowest number of reactor disclosures in recent years, is a matter of concern.  The position was reviewed at a meeting of the Animal Health Forum last week.  Arising from these discussions, the Minister has arranged for a meeting of the animal science subgroups of the forum to be convened early in the new year to undertake a full examination of the situation based on an analysis of the likely contributory factors involved in the rate of incidence increase.  Arising from these deliberations, the question as to whether adjustments are required to the current programme will be considered.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant, whether by coincidence or otherwise, that there have been significant increases in the incidence of bovine TB in both Northern Ireland and parts of Great Britain. Accordingly, we will be maintaining ongoing liaison with both DANI and MAFF to seek to identify whether there are common factors involved in bringing about these increases.  Anybody who has read last week's edition of <i>Farmers' Weekly</i> will be aware of what is happening in the UK. Developments are new there.</P>
    <P>In the course of the year, we introduced special programmes involving intensive testing in the worst affected areas of the country.  We have also continued with the wildlife programme.  As regards wildlife, there is increasing evidence to support the view that badgers play a role in the transmission of bovine TB.  We have had an ongoing project in east County Offaly for many years and this has now been supplemented by further research work being undertaken in four specific areas in Counties Donegal, Monaghan, north Cork and Kilkenny.  Apart from this, we also undertake badger removals under licences in areas where herd breakdowns occur and where these can be attributed to the presence of infected badgers.</P>
    <P>In addition, a project team on vaccine development for possible use in wildlife has been formed comprising specialists in the fields of immunology, <Col N="1225" /> bacteriology, zoology and pathology.  The project involves collaboration between CVRL, Abbotstown, the universities, CVL Weybridge and other research organisations.  It is one of the largest and most ambitious projects of its kind ever undertaken by my Department.  The first element of the programme has now commenced and subsequent work will involve more detailed analysis of the immunology of the badger and the pathology of tuberculosis in this species.</P>
    <P>With regard to BSE, despite the impression given by recent publicity, the overall incidence has remained at a relatively low level and has been constant over the past three years.  As at 30 November 1998, a total of 69 clinical cases of this disease had been confirmed in Ireland during 1998.  This compares with a total of 70 cases during the same period in 1997 and 64 for the corresponding period in 1996.  From 1989 to the end of November this year, 334 cases of clinical BSE have been recorded and a total of 42,489 animals have been slaughtered to date.  This latter figure includes animals from BSE depopulated herds, birth cohort and/or progeny animals, UK imported animals and BSE suspect and affected animals.</P>
    <P>Very strict controls are in operation in this area aimed at removing the possibility of exposure of cattle to the BSE agent through the ingestion of contaminated feed and simultaneously providing safety assurance to consumers of Irish beef.  These controls and arrangements include the following. First, a surveillance system and ante-mortem examination of all cattle slaughtered at licensed plants by an authorised veterinarian.  Second, the slaughter of herds in which BSE is diagnosed in a dedicated licensed plant; the carcases of these animals are rendered in a dedicated rendering plant and meat, bone meal and tallow produced are incinerated.  Third, also slaughtered at the same plant and disposed of in the same way are all animals which have been previously imported from the UK, the progeny of BSE-positive animals and birth cohorts of BSE-positive animals. Fourth, knackeries which handle animals dying on-farm are licensed and are operated under the supervision of Department staff.  Fifth, specified risk materials are removed from carcases of cattle and sheep at all slaughter plants and knackeries and are rendered at a dedicated rendering plant. Sixth, the remaining offals are rendered at 133º centigrade at a pressure of bar 3 for 20 minutes in accordance with EU rules.  Seventh, the sale, purchase and use of the meat and bone meal produced by this process is controlled by licence. Only feedmills which solely produce pig or poultry rations and farmers dedicated to pig or poultry production are granted licences to purchase and use mammalian meat and bone meal.  Given that the overall incidence of BSE in the Irish herd is extremely low and in view of the strict and extensive control systems in place to ensure the safety of Irish beef, I am confident that exports from the Irish beef sector will continue to develop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> In view of the foregoing, it is clear that we have concerns in relation to the higher levels of some diseases in the national herd, but we must keep the position in perspective.  The real progress made is sometimes overlooked.  For example, more than 99.5 per cent of our eight million cattle are free from TB disease, 99.8 per cent of our herds are clear of brucellosis at any given time while BSE affects just one in every 100,000 cattle in the national herd.  We also have extensive surveillance, testing and control regimes in place and these can be and, as I have outlined, are amended and extended as required.  At the same time all parties concerned must be fully involved and committed to operational control and allocation measures.  I am satisfied that such commitment does exist at present and that we can achieve progress in curtailing the various bovine diseases with the measures we have and will put in place in consultation with the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the fodder crisis.  We have been quite generous in the way we have addressed this issue but I note the points he raised and I understand the difficulties encountered in a county like Mayo.  I am surprised by his comments because I have not heard much criticism of our programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to badgers and the possibility that they contract tuberculosis and spread it, we are looking at the possibility of a vaccine for them to help alleviate the disease.  They are a protected species and I have a soft spot for them.  We are also living in an age where people are very conscious of our wildlife and environment because we have REP schemes and various other schemes available.  People do not like interfering with wild animals.  We are investigating the possibility of a vaccine.  Perhaps it will be one that can be spread on the ground for the badger to eat.</P>
    <P>With regard to the six day pre-movement test, it is not certain if it will be reintroduced.  This test is an added cost to farmers but all aspects are being examined by the animal science group and the animal health forum.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to reactors and the price paid for them.  Members will be aware that all meat in plants is passed by veterinary examination. There are very strict procedures in place and our vets are very vigilant.</P>
    <P>Opposition Senators made much of the food industry.  We are very conscious of our food industry and its value to the economy.  Senators are probably concerned that we are in danger of losing our IBF status.  We have saved the day and we are on the right side of things.  I do not want to be too ambitious in case things might not go the way we have planned but people with responsibility for food will be really worried.</P>
    <P>Since the price for culled cows is very low, comparatively reactor prices are not that bad.  I am referring to the reactor price again because it comes up every so often.  It is hard to dispose of culled cows and there is no outlay by the meat factories for them at present but trade may pick up in February and March.  Members should <Col N="1227" /> advise their farming constituents to continue to feed their cattle.</P>
    <P>We are meeting the EU export requirements. There are no problems once cattle have passed the 30 day brucellosis test and a general veterinary examination.  The real future breakthrough in tuberculosis eradication will come from research. My Department has a special research unit looking into a number of projects.  It is important to note that research is doing better and better.  This is a vital area if we are to learn what can be done and what is the cause of the problem.  More things cause the problem than meet the eye.</P>
    <P>Our eight million cattle have a very good health status because they are grass fed.  There is little or no concentrate feeding because we are a grass based nation.  We have a herd of about 145,000 in the Republic.  More than 90 per cent of the herd is free of disease.  That is a high percentage when we look at the structure.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for participating in this debate.  I thank Opposition Senators for tabling this timely motion; even though they have been unfair to us and condemned the Government. The cost of disease eradication to the economy and the farming community has to change.  I have held this view for a long time, even when I was back on the other side of the House.  We cannot put a price on the trouble caused to farmers.  We are all familiar with the rural scene and know we have the double problem of brucellosis and tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We are working under the 1996 Act but I hope we will make some improvements under the beef assurance scheme.  We will have to legislate for that and put in a section to cover it; if not, we will have to amend the existing Act and tighten it up. We will get results.</P>
    <P>My reply to a question asked in the Dáil is now public property.  The figures for Kerry, Cork north-east and even Offaly and Louth, which are referred to as non-dairy counties, showed the number of reactors removed or got rid of in November this year has also increased on last year and the number of herd restrictions for brucellosis all beg the question that more has to be done.</P>
    <P>If we are going to save £60 million, £50 million net to our economy, we must have discipline.  I know that this is about discipline and order because I get complaints about the system. Unfortunately, I do not have enough power at my disposal to sort out this problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a very prosperous New Year.  I have no doubt that I will be on this side of the House for three more years.  Again, I congratulate the Opposition. They have been very kind as regards the motions they have tabled since I came here.  On the many <Col N="1228" /> occasions I have visited here as Minister I have always received the greatest courtesy and respect. The Opposition has tabled good and relevant motions.  I encourage them to continue to do so because we have to debate issues and identify problems.  I also wish to compliment my officials who are dedicated to my Department.  I also wish them and their staff a happy Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With those comments it is very hard for me to react.  I thank the Minister of State for coming here.  His knowledge and experience of agriculture always comes to the fore and I compliment him on the way he deals with this subject in such a very forthright and straight forward manner, which is what he has done this evening.</P>
      <P>In summing up the motion, one of the things that regularly comes through is the seriousness of this problem with the increase in the figures. Every Member would concede that that is something about which everyone is worried and of which we must take cognisance in the months ahead, particularly when the meeting the Minister of State has set up with the animal science subgroup takes place and a decision has been taken on the necessary action.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the point raised about wildlife. No one wants badgers to be put down, but if they are causing a problem such a course of action must be considered.  The problem was dealt with in Denmark where the badger is a protected species.  If it is proved on further examination that badgers are carriers of TB, action must be taken to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Moylan that the problem of rogue operators must be dealt with.  Consumers are very concerned about what is happening in the agricultural and food industry.  This industry must be protected given that so many people are dependent on it.  Consumers are very vigilant and can now buy food off the shelf from around the world &mdash; they do not have to buy Irish products. This is happening in relation to bacon.  The same applies to European consumers.  We must be vigilant in this regard which is why I tabled the motion.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I wish the Minister, his officials and Senators a very happy Christmas.</P>
