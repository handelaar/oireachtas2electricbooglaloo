      <P>I have notice from Senator Keogh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the urgent need to establish an independent prison service board to tackle the growing crisis in our prisons.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 3 and Statements on Luas.  Items 1 and 2 are to be taken without debate and we will take Committee Stage of item 3.  Statements on Luas will be taken from 2.30 p.m. until 4.30 p.m. with questions to the Minister from 4.15 p.m.; contributions of spokespersons are not to exceed ten minutes, all other Senators are not to exceed eight minutes, and Senators may share time.  The proceedings on item 3, if not previously concluded, will resume at 4.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed but I suggest to the Leader that the question and answer period should be longer than 15 minutes &mdash; it should be at least 30 minutes.  The Minister is anxious to answer questions and we are anxious to put them to her.  The most effective use of our time would be a longer question and answer period, which would be appreciated by all speakers if it could be arranged.</P>
      <P>On behalf of this side of the House I compliment the Government on its contribution to the Chernobyl fund in memory of the late Hugh Coveney.  It is a generous gesture and a fitting tribute to the memory of one whom we honour very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> I join in Senator Gallagher's appeal yesterday on behalf of the family from Burundi who are in danger of being the first people to be deported. It is dangerous to engage in special pleading but everything about this family suggests they are genuine refugees who would make a contribution to this country, who have already settled in well and who would not be a burden on anyone if given a chance.  There must be a certain flexibility in the way that we, of all people, look at the refugee question and a strong case can be made for taking another look at this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of Statements on Luas in the Order of Business is welcome but I must enter the strongest caveat about the way the business has been done.  I do not know who ordered the business for today's Seanad, it may have been the Minister or the Taoiseach through their announcements in the other House, but I have heard various stories in the last 24 hours about it, which is not good enough.  It is good that we have these Statements &mdash; I called for it yesterday and I compliment the Minister for being available so that the House can discuss the issue today &mdash; but I have grave reservations about the way this was done.  I ask the Leader to confirm whether this was his initiative or if the Government decided in the other House how this House should be run.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to explain to the House the position regarding media coverage, especially by RTÉ, of these and future referenda? There is utter confusion about the matter.  The Government, RTÉ and the rest of us are under pressure from the courts.  However, there is a need to clarify the guidelines and the boundaries. Legislation may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal that item 3 will only deal with Committee Stage today and that Remaining Stages will be taken later.  I am pleased the Leader accepted our recommendation in that regard.  I am also pleased that Luas will be debated today; I requested a debate this week if possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Manning's remarks about the request made yesterday by Senator Gallagher in the context of the deportation order against a Burundi family, while we did not seek a debate, we wanted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to exercise his discretion on humanitarian grounds and ensure that the family would not be deported; this is the only decision that can be taken at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I requested a debate on industrial relations.  The Leader indicated that he would advise the House this morning when such a debate will take place.  I hope he proposes a specific time.  There have been worrying media reports, some apparently from the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, that the role of the vocational education committees would be eliminated from the provision <Col N="559" /> of adult education.  In this regard there was a precondition in the context of the preparation of the Green Paper.  Hitherto, the vocational education committees have provided adult education throughout the country on a shoe string.  It would be useful to debate the issue with the Minister with specific reference to the mainstreaming and provision of adult education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Manning and Costello in requesting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reconsider the deportation order against the Burundi family; one of the couple is a Hutu and the other is a Tutsi. At a time when we are trying to bring people together this family should be allowed stay in Ireland, irrespective of the fact that the regulations specify that they should be sent back to France, which was the EU country they entered first.  If they go back to France they will be deported and this could mean that one or both of them will be killed by one of the factions fighting in Burundi and the surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>In view of the negative news emanating from the peace talks in the Middle East perhaps we could have a quick debate on the peace process there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Costello for a debate on adult education.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, launched the IVA response to the upcoming Green Paper.  Concerns have been expressed within the VEC sector regarding the role of the vocational education committees.  Given the enormous contribution they have made over the years, the input of the vocational education committees should not be diminished.  I appeal to the Leader to use his good offices to ensure that the Green Paper is produced on time.  I hope the White Paper will also be published within the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a couple of matters informally with the Leader and with you, Sir, in the context of the apparent desire by this Republic to avoid as much pomp and ceremony as possible. The emblem of the State, the harp, which is found in all State institutions, such as the courts, should be placed as near as possible to the national flag in the House behind the Cathaoirleach's chair. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>During television coverage of the House Ministers speak against a back light which comes through the window adjacent to them.  It detracts considerably from the impact of their speeches. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should consider placing gauze over the window.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate in Government time on the question of the country having an honours system, which has been raised by many Members both in debate and on the Order <Col N="560" /> of Business?  An MBE was awarded to an Irish citizen who works in the Hard Rock café in London primarily because she promoted British tourism. We should have a similar honours system to acknowledge at official level the contribution to the State made by ordinary people.  Following a debate the Government might act on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by Senator Costello for a debate on adult education, especially with regard to the role played by the vocational education committees.  While I do not consider that their role will be diminished, it is necessary for the Minister to reinforce their input to adult education.</P>
      <P>In view of recent newspaper reports on apprenticeships and the low level of participation by women apprentices, will the Leader ask the Minister to attend the House to debate the matter? We are all aware of the skills shortages in trades, such as woodwork and metalwork, and given that FÁS is supposed to have made rules regarding apprenticeships, it is timely to debate the matter, especially the low level of participation by women.  I hope there will be a debate before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with Senator Manning's request for more time on questions to the Minister following Statements on Luas.  The Minister was very flexible in this regard.  I thank her for making herself available at such short notice.  There appears to be a misunderstanding about what happened; Senator O'Toole appears to be confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there was no official communication on the matter to us from the Leader's Office or the Whip's Office.  Any confusion was created on the Leader's side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Manning requested a debate on Luas yesterday I immediately asked the Chief Whip to telephone the Minister during the Order of Business.  While there was no time in the Minister's diary, she did everything possible to make time available.  She indicated to the Dáil when discussing the Luas project that she would come before this House to discuss it today. It was only at 9.30 p.m. yesterday evening that I received confirmation of the agreed times which would suit the House and the Minister's diary &mdash; she had to cancel two other appointments to make time available.  If Members had gone home and I was unable to contact them, I apologise; but I must bear in mind that 17 Senators requested of me that time be made available at the first opportunity to discuss this issue.  I take these matters seriously and worked hard with the Government <Col N="561" /> Chief Whip to ensure this would happen today.  I am pleased to inform the House this is the case.  Perhaps the leaders might discuss how we can improve communications on all sides.  I know all Members will be anxious to hear what the Minister has to say and I am looking forward to a large attendance in the House when the Minister is here.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Manning and Lanigan called for a debate on the refugee issue and I will make time available for this at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senator O'Toole expressed concern about the RTÉ guidelines with particular reference to its decision about the forthcoming referendum. Again, I will make time available for this.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, McDonagh and Ormonde called for a debate on adult education and I agree to their request.  Senator Costello also called for a debate on industrial relations.  I hope to arrange this within the next three weeks.  The difficulty is that I am trying to have the banking issue debated next week following the many recent calls for the ICC, the ACC, the TSB and the banking issue in general to be debated and I have to give that precedence.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan requested a short debate on the Middle East peace talks.  I will see if this can be included next week or the week after.</P>
      <P>I agree with the proposals made by Senator Mooney.  As the Cathaoirleach has indicated, they can be placed before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and discussed there.  I understand the proposals have been reviewed by the All Party Committee on the Constitution. Perhaps they can be enhanced and brought forward through that committee.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde asked for a debate on apprenticeships and training.  The House can make a major contribution to this area.  In the hotel business there were only 11 apprentices in one section of the training run by CERT.  This is alarming when tourism is one of the three biggest growth industries in Ireland.  Training is not being responded to by the students.  A half day's debate on this issue would be wise and I will make time available for this at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Item 2 extends the time for the taking of divisions from eight minutes to ten minutes.  This is to ensure that Senators who have moved offices will have sufficient time to reach the Chamber when a vote is called.  We are amending the Standing Order to add an extra two minutes to the interval after the bells have rung. The bells will still ring for four minutes and the doors will be locked after a further six minutes.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the plans for the new £25 million millennium building upon which work will start in June.  All Senators, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, at present in the College of Art, will have to move across the road to Setanta House with all the other Senators.  In order to facilitate everyone arriving in time for votes, this is the proposal which was agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at its meeting yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 14 and 15, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) in the case of an administrative county, the council of the county,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At present the Bill states that the county council is the relevant housing authority for what is termed in the Bill as &ldquo;every county health district&rdquo;, rather than the usual phrase of &ldquo;every administrative county&rdquo;.  It is unclear why it should be phrased in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 was discussed on Second Stage and the Minister responded to my query as to why only two urban districts were designated as relevant housing authorities for the purposes of this Bill.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State but there is a case for giving a stronger role to urban authorities.  Since the debate on Second <Col N="564" /> Stage I have discussed this matter with members of various urban councils who are delegates to the AMAI and there is concern that without proper regard for their role the greater burden might fall on urban districts within a county rather than ensuring that the task is shared.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable to consider some of the larger urban councils at least.  There is a precedent in a number of departmental practices for distinguishing between larger urban districts other than Bray and Dundalk.  For example, where the population of an urban district is 10,000 or more there would be merit in a stronger role for the urban authority in the development of the plans.  My amendment reflects the concerns of urban councillors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 3 and 4 is to designate all urban district councils as relevant housing authorities.  The Bill provides that relevant housing authorities will be required to prepare, adopt and secure the implementation of local traveller accommodation programmes. This is a significant task which is more appropriately discharged by the larger authorities.  It is also desirable to avoid having a large number of local programmes, in particular a multiplicity of programmes within a county.  Some counties have a number of UDCs.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill there will be 41 relevant housing authorities but this would rise to 88 if all UDCs were designated as relevant housing authorities. However, there is provision under section 5(2) for the assignment of functions of the relevant housing authority to other housing authorities &mdash; UDCs &mdash; on an individual or group basis with a specified population threshold should this be warranted in the future.  This approach is also in line with the provisions of section 23 of the 1992 Act. That section allows the Minister to transfer responsibility for housing functions between different housing authorities.</P>
      <P>Urban district councils which are not relevant housing authorities will have a number of opportunities to contribute to the preparation of the relevant local traveller accommodation programmes. They will be consulted under section 6 about the assessment of accommodation needs. They will be given prior notice under section 8(b) of the preparation of a draft accommodation programme or an amendment to or replacement of it.  Under section 9, UDCs must be supplied with a copy of the draft, thereby ensuring an opportunity to express their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county council as the relevant housing authority responsible for the programme will have a general responsibility for securing implementation of the programme.  The UDCs will retain control to the extent that a programme includes measures which will fall to be implemented by the UDC in the urban area.  It must be remembered that a specific proposal for housing accommodation being pursued by another housing authority in the urban area <Col N="565" /> requires full planning permission from the urban council.  It will seen, therefore, that such councils will retain control over matters in so far as their functional area is concerned, without the commitment of the resources required at the initial stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the clarification from the Minister of State, in particular his reference to section 5(2).  In the implementation of the legislation I ask him to retain an open mind with regard to requests from larger UDCs, particularly where there is agreement between them and the relevant county councils.  With regard to amendment No. 3, will the Minister of State clarify the reference to county health districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Gallagher.  In my area there is a close working relationship between the county council and the urban councils.  Kilkenny County Council is considering the provision of accommodation on the county border adjacent to New Ross, County Wexford.  In such a situation there should be a requirement for consultation, at least, between the councils involved on the proposals for and the operation of travellers' facilities.  It is important to address this matter to avoid a county council foisting a problem on a UDC in an adjoining county, which might lead to hostility and opposition to what the Bill seeks to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the suggestion that where a UDC seeks to be designated under the legislation and to take on the task of drawing up the development plan, favourable consideration will be given to that application.  I am not sure how many UDCs will want to do so and I am inclined to agree with the Senator that it is the larger ones which might be interested.  The provision is in the Bill and if a request were submitted it would be the intention of this Minister and, I am sure, future Ministers to accede to such a request.</P>
      <P>It is not desirable that this might become a matter for conflict with a Minister responsible for the implementation of a national policy to provide adequate traveller accommodation.  It does not make sense that there should be haggling over whether it should be the county council which prepares a plan for a large UDC or whether the UDC should be allowed to undertake the task if it so wishes.  We are seeking to achieve the greatest level of co-operation possible in the implementation of the policy objectives of successive Governments to provide adequate accommodation for the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the county health district and the county council area are the same in law and that is why there must be a reference to it.  Given the existence of regional health boards, Members may find the reference to the county health districts strange.  Those who are in this business as long as I have been may have been members of <Col N="566" /> health authorities which were confined to the county boundaries.</P>

      <P>Assessing the needs of travellers and the number of sites required in an area is a difficult matter.  At certain times there can be huge influxes of travellers into south Dublin from the east coast and it can be difficult to accommodate them.  How does the Minister of State see us assessing the needs of travellers?  We have tried to do so many times but seem to be unsuccessful.</P>

      <P>This interesting point is one with which all Members will be familiar.  The assessment is carried out in March, which is probably before the spring urge to travel hits the travelling community, and it may be as good a time as any to undertake such an assessment.  Local authorities have been active in providing facilities and have attracted families to their areas in the expectation of benefiting from a proactive council. Accordingly, families are drawn to those areas and other counties do not carry out their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>We intend carrying out a nationwide assessment. When this Bill passes, all local authorities will carry the statutory responsibility to prepare their plans in order to implement the Bill in every local authority housing area.  Local authorities which are not carrying out their responsibilities will not then benefit from the actions of more active areas.</P>
      <P>One can never get an absolutely accurate assessment.  Happily, the traveller population is increasing as their lifespans lengthen.  They enjoy better health now than their grandparents did, and we must recognise that although much work has been done in providing them with facilities, earlier assessments have been far exceeded and there are many people on the side of the road with nowhere to live.  Hopefully that is due to longer lifespans and to the fact that many families are coming home.  The travelling community travels, and it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of a section of the community which has the urge to move around.  However, March is a period just before the urge to travel hits the travelling community, and an assessment in that month is as accurate as we can hope for.</P>

      <P>Determining the needs of travellers has cropped up in my area.  Many of them are obviously needy and require accommodation. However, some of those housed subsequently proved themselves capable of providing accommodation from their own resources.  We have had instances of people with Jeeps worth £25,000 or £30,000 being housed.  It would be reasonable, though not definite, to assume that a traveller with a new Jeep is not using a credit facility but has paid up front.  This brings the effort to house travellers into some disrepute.  Will the Minister of State consider drafting some criterion that allows local authorities greater powers of investigation in such cases?</P>

      <P>We are discussing families which do not have a regular abode and which reside in temporary accommodation, usually caravans, that is located haphazardly and not in official halting sites or other areas where they may legally park. We are not referring to people who trade successfully all over the country and who have substantial houses as their bases.  Such people would not be included in the needs assessments of travellers undertaken by local authorities.  Their housing needs do not exist because they already own houses.  What they do with their houses is their own business, but they would not become the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Illegal parking can be dealt with by different Acts, but we are dealing here with homeless people who have no official place to park their caravans &mdash; the tents are practically all gone.  The Government aims to provide accommodation to meet the needs of such people.</P>

It may be problematic for transient families but it is possible to identify people's needs. We had 54 families in very dire circumstances, and nobody can be proud of that, but their needs have been identified and we are doing something about it.  The difficulty with this issue seems to be a reluctance to deal with the problem rather than the assessment issue.</P>

      <P>This section refers to the five year programme, which must tie in to the development plan.  Is it possible to include a section in our draft development plans which would enable a portion of any rezoned land to be assigned to a group housing scheme or halting site?  Somebody buying a house in an area would then know that a group housing scheme or halting site is to be provided there.  Is it unconstitutional to state in our accommodation programme that the draft development plan must provide that developers might have to facilitate a halting site on their land as a condition of rezoning?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are placing responsibility on the local authorities to draw up a five year accommodation programme to meet the anticipated needs of the traveller community.  Implementing the Senator's suggestion would create an extraordinary situation whereby sites would be designated all around the country because the land was being rezoned, but such sites might not necessarily relate to the accommodation plan which the local authorities were charged to lay down.  I do not see how that would contribute to achieving our objective.  We must keep our sights firmly on that objective.</P>
      <P>If all local authorities were to fulfil their responsibilities under this Bill the required number of sites would be designated, as would be shown subsequently in the development plan. The Senator's suggestion is not practical and would cause unfocused designation which could result in the designation of an excessive number of sites.</P>

Can we only earmark land which belongs to the council?</P>

      <P>Section 9 requires a local authority to publish a notice in not less than one newspaper circulated within a functional area.  My amendment proposes that, in addition to publishing the notice in a local newspaper, it should also be on display in a public library in the local authority area for not less than one month after it appears in the newspaper. Before the change in the planning laws people would say they had not seen the notice in the newspapers.  That problem was resolved by the requirement to provide site notices.  Placing the notice on display in a library would resolve the problem of people not seeing the notice in the newspaper or losing their copy of the newspaper. We must inform the public about what we are doing.</P>

People do not have time to read all the newspapers &mdash; somebody said recently we will soon drown in the amount of post and newspapers we now receive.  Placing a notice in the public library would be an effective way of informing people, particularly given how well the library system is organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that idea, but some areas do not have a public library.  I suggest the amendment should include the words &ldquo;or any other public venue&rdquo; so that the message would get across to people in areas without a library.  I do not mind how we do it but it is essential to inform the public at the very initial stages.  That has been the problem up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A notice could be placed in many places, such as a motor taxation office or council offices but it should be left to the discretion of the local authorities.  The statutory minimum is that a notice should be placed in a local newspaper but the local authorities have discretion to give full public notice.  A public library might be used by only a very small section of people in the area and there is no library within 30 miles of <Col N="570" /> some areas.  Therefore, placing a notice in a public library does not give global coverage either.</P>
      <P>It would be wise for the local authorities to place notices in as many public places and media as they can.  The minimum statutory provision of one newspaper has been included in legislation up to now.  If an authority were to implement an accommodation programme it would have to give planning notice.  This provision refers only to notification of the fact that the council is about to prepare a draft accommodation programme which the public can examine.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 28, after &ldquo;submissions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than submissions of a frivolous or vexatious nature)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a concern I expressed on Second Stage.  There is so much provision for consultation that I fear certain individuals or groups, many of whom would have a lot on money behind them, would use the provisions of the Bill for extensive consultation in a frivolous or vexatious manner to frustrate the provision of traveller accommodation programmes.  There is provision in the Bill for consultation on these programmes. There is also consultation in respect of any changes to the programmes.  Planning legislation already provides for extensive consultation on the adoption or amendment of a development plan by a council.  I have no doubt that some individuals or groups will try to exploit these provisions with a view to holding up the provision of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some cases in which managers or councils have tried to draw up and implement programmes have ended up in court.  Some people did not <Col N="571" /> even have to go to court, they simply managed to have a word with the right person in the right place at the right time to ensure that a proposal for accommodation was stopped.  This may not be the best way of achieving my objective but I am seeking to make it clear that frivolous or vexatious submissions need not be considered in detail by an authority as they may delay the provision of accommodation for travellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this amendment. What may seem frivolous or vexatious to me might not seem so to the person making the submission. People are entitled to have their submissions assessed and decided upon.  It depends on interpretation, so I cannot go along with this amendment.  Submissions should go through the process.  Anyone should be able to make submissions and we cannot define what is frivolous or vexatious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 already makes adequate provision for dealing with frivolous or vexatious submissions.  Under that section it is open to the manager to identify submissions which could be regarded as vexatious when preparing the report on submissions received.  I presume that the intention of this amendment is to reduce the volume of such submissions.  The inclusion of such a qualification is unlikely to have such an effect.  In fact, it would imply that a manager must make a formal decision on each submission as to whether it is vexatious or not. This in turn may give rise to a higher level of court challenges.  The planning Acts already give powers to An Bord Pleanála to deem an appeal unworthy of consideration if it regards it as frivolous or vexatious.  How many times do we see An Bord Pleanála making that decision?  It is fraught with the possibility of legal challenges.  This matter is covered by section 11.  Managers are usually good, solid common sense people who have to look at every submission which goes before the councillors who will make the decision one way or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to pay close attention to the implementation of this area of the legislation when enacted.  I have no doubt that certain groups with access to resources will seek the best legal and planning advice and try to use the provisions to block the provision of accommodation.  In the first instance it will be up to members of the councils, and managers in particular, to try to ensure that this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Ethics in Public Office Act was being passed by the previous Dáil and Seanad it was a concern of Members that frivolous or vexatious claims or assertions made against Members of the Houses should be dealt with in a particular manner. The amendments accepted to that legislation resulted in a situation where people would almost be afraid to make a claim or assertion in case they <Col N="572" /> would be levied with a penalty.  I do not accept that one cannot decide in law against accepting frivolous or vexatious assertions.  The consultation provisions are welcome but we will have to keep a close eye on this area to ensure that people do not use the proper provisions of the Bill with the sole and expressed intention of holding up the provision of accommodation for travellers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone familiar with the history of measures taken over the past 30 years to provide accommodation for travellers knows that there will always be those opposed to such proposals and who wish to slow down progress in this area.  There are those who would not only be prepared to make frivolous or vexatious submissions to a council preparing an accommodation programme, they would also be happy to spend a lot of money fighting such proposals in the courts.  We are not approaching this matter in a naive state of mind.  We are conscious of this problem and the legislation is based on extensive consultations at all levels, including cross-party consultation.  It is an attempt to chart a new course where, hopefully, greater progress can be made in providing accommodation for those condemned to live in deplorable conditions which none of us would condone.  The Government is seeking to fulfil its responsibility in meeting the needs of these people as quickly as possible.  That is what this Bill is about but we are aware that there will be those quite willing to oppose the measures with all the resources available to them.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the first accommodation programmes under the legislation should be published this year.  The legislation will not be held up in either House and it should be possible for it to be enacted quite soon.

Even if the Bill was enacted today it would not be possible to comply with all the statutory, consultative and other procedures involved in the preparation and adoption of the first five-year programmes by the end of 1998.  On Second Stage I stated that at <Col N="573" /> least 12 months would be required.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 46, to delete &ldquo;such period and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;each succeeding 5 year period and shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first accommodation programme to be prepared by a relevant housing authority under this legislation is for a five year period beginning on a date specified by the Minister.  He may then direct that further plans be adopted on a date specified by him.  It is preferable that there should also be a clear five year period for the adoption of subsequent plans.  When local authority members and staff, the communities in which accommodation will be provided and travellers in those areas become familiar with operating this legislation, it would be useful if the five year cycle was repeated in respect of subsequent plans.  That is the case in respect of development plans and people have become accustomed to the fact that they are supposed to be reviewed every five years, although in many cases they are not.  It is preferable that it be legislated for that each plan would have a five year duration rather than the Minister fixing the duration of each following the adoption of the first set of plans.  It would lead to the smoother operation of these provisions if a five year programme were adopted on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment is to tie subsequent programmes to five year periods.  I am not convinced that this is a desirable step at this stage.  In future, programmes of a greater or lesser duration may be deemed to be more appropriate having regard to the nature of the outstanding problems.  I am in favour of retaining the flexibility inherent in the provisions of section 10(1) to specify any period for subsequent programmes so that decisions on the <Col N="574" /> appropriate period may be taken in light of the prevailing circumstances.  I have already heard of cases where reviews of housing needs in a local authority area were carried out within a specified period.  I have heard criticism in the other House that the period is too long, that circumstances change so rapidly that the figures with which we work are out of date and that, as a result, we should not have to wait for a fixed period to carry out the next assessment.  It may not be the wisest thing to tie ourselves down at this stage in legislation. Under the provisions of the Bill it can be five years or it can be a longer or shorter period. It is left to the wise judgment and discretion of the Minister as to the best thing to do.</P>

      <P>I accept circumstances may arise where it would desirable to adopt subsequent plans for shorter periods, particularly if the provisions were having the desired effect in the medium term.  However, it would be unwise for plans to go beyond five years.  Those who deal with development plans in local authorities believe that the manner in which such plans are let slip beyond the five year period, where councils apply to the Minister for further extensions of time, does not lead to good planning law. There has been criticism that the less than high regard in which some development plans are held in some areas is because they have been let slip considerably beyond the five year period.  One of the local authorities of which I am a member adopted a development plan last week.  It adopted the previous one in 1985.  That is not good practice and I would be reluctant to see the period for subsequent plans go beyond five years. Will the Minister consider setting five years as a maximum period for subsequent plans?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like the Senator to have the impression that there might be a similar recurrence with the accommodation programmes and that they might not be reviewed after a period of five years.  I am happy to consider inserting a requirement that plans be reviewed after five years.  However, I am also anxious to ensure that, <Col N="575" /> regardless of the time span, it would be the same for every local authority in the country and that there would be no stepping stones as there were with the development plans.

Most people are reasonable but, if difficulties arise in a community, those are amplified by people who <Col N="576" /> agitate against the accommodation of travellers in their area which results in others following their lead.</P>
    <P>I could give instances of the types of problems which have arisen in my local authority.  I do not blame the travellers because they have lived in bad accommodation on the side of the road, in tents in the past and in inadequate caravans and are not used to living in settled accommodation. I have received complaints from people who have seen cattle accommodated in sitting rooms and horses brought into kitchens to drink water. Stairs have been removed and used for firewood. Subsequently, the local authority is put to considerable expense.  My local authority has had to pay £16,000 to £20,000 to repair houses when travellers have vacated them.</P>
    <P>Many of those problems and social difficulties which arise could be avoided.  The integration process could be addressed if sufficient social workers were provided.  In Wexford, we have looked for a social worker in each electoral area for a number of years and eventually the number was increased from one to two.  Councillors and senior officials believe the number is totally inadequate to deal with the scale of the problems which arise.  If we are to accelerate the accommodation programme, which I support, the need for people to help in the integration process will become more important.  This may or may not be the appropriate place to include such a provision, but failure to provide a backup service will militate against the success of what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Walsh on this aspect and I do not know if this is the appropriate place to talk about it.  I speak from experience of a small halting site with five families in the Firhouse-Knocklyon area.  We started on the right basis in that we got everybody involved. Social workers visited the site and I visited every two to three weeks so I got to know the people concerned.  I brought in St. Vincent de Paul, the various other social bodies, the teacher associations and established a link with the primary schools.  Not only are there insufficient social workers, but there are not enough council officials.  We do not have the personnel to visit these sites, establish needs and what is involved. We need to nurse these sites step by step as integration is further down the road.  If we have the resources from the start and reassure the public they are available, we will make a breakthrough. If we say a halting site or group housing scheme will be located in an area and that resources are available but we cannot detail what will happen at any given time, we will not succeed.  We must get this aspect right from the start.</P>

      <P>I support what my two colleagues said.  I am sorry I did not mention it on Second Stage, although I intended to.  For some years we in Dublin city have been refurbishing our flat <Col N="577" /> complexes.  When we went back four or five years later, they were in the same state so we are placing the emphasis on estate management, which is the key and is working well.  We have trained personnel in each housing estate.  If we are to have traveller settlements, they must be managed in the same way.  We must have the staff and finances to look after them.  If we do so, we will prove to the public that the system is workable and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support comments made by previous speakers.  I raised this matter on Second Stage and said it was not a case of acting in a mechanistic fashion by passing laws, telling councils they must enact them and that money is available. I pointed out that the human resources in local authorities would have to be improved, not only in terms of numbers, but that appropriate skills and training would have to be provided for the accommodation programmes to be drawn up and implemented in the way we desire.</P>
      <P>Those of us on local authorities will know housing staff are already overburdened.  If they are to be expected to engage in the level of consultation and preparation involved here along with their ordinary duties, they will find it difficult. I also suggested new skills were needed in respect of getting involved in the process of consultation, facilitating people in putting their views forward and in having them considered.  It is not a matter of putting a notice in the paper and hoping for a response.  We must actively engage in the process and facilitate it.</P>
      <P>I contemplated putting down an amendment to this effect but I was advised, rightly or wrongly, that it would impose a charge on the Exchequer and that it would be ruled out of order in this House.  However, we are getting the chance to discuss the issue and perhaps it is one to which the Minister will respond and address in the other House by way of an amendment.</P>

      <P>I note in the explanatory memorandum a reference to the direct Exchequer costs arising from the Bill.  It specifies that local authorities will incur limited but unquantifiable extra staff costs in the preparation programmes and consultation with travellers, etc.  To get programmes to work, there needs to be effective consultation. The county councils need not only housing officers but specific traveller liaison officers, if one could use that terminology.  Staff in local authorities, who are already extremely busy in the housing area, need the required skills. Unfortunately, it is true to say specific skills are needed in liaising with the traveller groups, given the different culture, different expectations and so on.  This is a skill which cannot be expected of people and it is one they must learn.  It means somebody must be appointed to working with the travelling community and the consultative groups.  Unfortunately, this will cost money.  Will the Minister give us his views on this matter and <Col N="578" /> the resources which might be made available in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a deprived section of our society, the traveller community. Travellers are deprived not only in the area of housing and accommodation needs but also in many other areas, including poor health and poor educational facilities.  The denial of an opportunity to lead a better life is understating the problem.  Their difficulties will not be resolved merely by the provision of accommodation.  This Bill and my responsibility is to deal with the accommodation needs of travellers.  They have many other needs which affect programmes in the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and nearly all Departments.  I accept that adequate resources must be provided to make this aspect of the traveller policy work.</P>
      <P>Section 28 provides for a housing authority to make available improved, managed and controlled sites for travellers and to carry out such works incidental to the management and maintenance of sites provided.  The proper management and maintenance of schemes is important, apart from the maintenance of the quality of life for the residents.  There is also a recognition of the importance of high standards in this area to facilitate the acceleration of the programme of providing further accommodation, including residential caravan parks.  Poorly maintained sites, particularly older sites, are readily pointed to as an indication of the inability of local authorities to manage such sites and are the basis for much of the opposition to new sites, as we well know.</P>
      <P>The Department has been working to improve the management and maintenance of traveller specific accommodation.  With effect from 1 January 1997, the Department recoups a percentage of eligible management and maintenance costs of halting sites, which includes caretaking, routine maintenance, skip hire and caretaking costs which are associated with group housing schemes as well.  Part of the funding under the scheme focuses on pilot initiatives for improving the management of traveller accommodation through partnership arrangements between travellers and local authorities.  A scheme of grant assistance is available to local authorities to implement this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding social workers, local authorities will incur limited but unquantifiable extra staff costs in the preparation of programmes, consultation with travellers, etc. Some local authorities, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Kerry County Council, have reassigned officials to work full time in this area.  The Dublin local authorities have staff working full time on traveller accommodation issues; many social workers are employed by local authorities to deal with these issues.  Social workers will have an important role to play in implementing the provisions <Col N="579" /> of the Bill with regard to assessment of accommodation needs, implementation of the accommodation programme and consultation with travellers.  In many cases, they will deal with travellers on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>A system for the recoupment of the salary and expenses of social workers employed by local authorities to work on the accommodation needs of travellers has been in operation since the early 1970s.  There have been certain modifications to the general scheme applied over the intervening years.  At present the level of recoupment stands at 90 per cent of salary and expenses; the latter, in the main, relates to travelling and subsistence. It also includes course attendance, seminars and miscellaneous expenses relevant to the employment of the social worker on his or her duties pertaining to traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>Social workers, in the main, are employed directly by local authorities, although some of the smaller authorities second the services of health board social workers as a means of addressing the accommodation needs of travellers.  At present the Department makes recoupment to 36 local authorities and voluntary organisations in respect of 52 social workers.  It is worth noting that the term &ldquo;social worker&rdquo; for the purpose of the Department's application of the recoupment scheme includes housing welfare officers employed by some corporations and welfare youth officers employed by voluntary organisations, such as Cross Care, Clare Care, the Traveller Youth Movement and others.  In 1997 approximately £1.3 million was recouped by local authorities and voluntary organisations under the recoupment scheme.  An equal amount has been allocated for this year and is expected to be fully expended.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the legislation for the appointment of two persons to the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group who, in the opinion of the Minister, have experience in relation to accommodation for travellers or are concerned with the general welfare of travellers. A social worker in Dublin Corporation who works on traveller accommodation issues was appointed by me to the group in March.</P>
    <P>I accept the points made that these measures will not work unless adequate resources are provided to ensure that the accommodation is properly maintained and sufficient support is available at social worker and other levels to help the families concerned.  This is an important part of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments. It is most important that the implementation of the programme is headed by the right person.  He or she must be able to relate well to both sides.  Everybody has experience of other areas where a person might be good at their job but is unable to relate to the various sides.  In this instance, the person must be able to relate to the <Col N="580" /> consultative committee, residents and travellers. It could be the best programme in the world but it will not work unless the person in charge has the right personality.  Many good programmes have failed because the person in charge was dogged in terms of the implementation of measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's comments and I concur that the Department in recent years has facilitated and supported the appointment of caretakers.  This is a progressive move. However, the Department has not shown the same degree of commitment to the social workers issue.  There is a limit on the number of cases an individual social worker can effectively handle. The ultimate objective is to place travellers in housing schemes.  The answer is not to place them all in one scheme.  If they are to be effectively integrated into the community, individual travellers should be placed in housing schemes with settled people.</P>
      <P>This would help the entire process and also provide travellers with the opportunities we wish to give them.  However, this needs to be managed properly.  If that does not happen, all types of problems will arise.  Perhaps the Minister could consider adding a provision to the Bill on Report Stage to cover this aspect.  The experience of my local authority is that it sought the support of the Department in this regard but it never received it.  My authority has campaigned over 15 years for adequate facilities in this area but it has always received a negative response.</P>

      <P>The Senator has not approached me about these matters since I was appointed.  I would be happy to give him as positive a response as possible because all sides work together on all local authorities towards achieving the satisfactory progress everybody wants in this area.</P>
      <P>In terms of the different methods of providing accommodation, people may have individual preferences and consider that they should be allocated local authority houses.  In this day and age, the wishes and needs of the families one is trying to accommodate must be taken into account. Many of them do not wish to live in local authority houses.  The problem would be easy to solve if all travellers wanted to live in local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to provide halting sites and group housing specially constructed for travellers. Accommodation must be offered to families but many of them have turned it down.  Many families who went into halting sites, group housing schemes and local authority houses have left them.  The solution is not only to provide roofs over their heads.  It is more complicated than that <Col N="581" /> and requires the availability of many of the support services highlighted by Senators to ensure that families find the best option.  I will be glad to take all the comments made into account before Report Stage, although I am not making any firm commitments other than those made already.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to re-examine the time allowed for councils to consider the draft plan brought forward by the manager and staff. The section states not later than two months but this obviously means some managers may allow a longer period.  However, it is essential that the timeframe is longer.  If the draft plan is published at certain times of the year, for example, when estimates or, as in the case of my council at present, development plans are being discussed, the two month period may be too short to allow proper consideration.  If councillors are not engaged in the decision making process, the programme may not have the public commitment required to ensure it is effective and workable.  I urge the Minister to consider a longer period. This ultimately would be beneficial to the integrity of the entire process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill is in operation the Minister will be required to lay down a specified date for the adoption of accommodation programmes. The two month period refers to a requirement on the manager to notify members of the proposals at least two months before the adoption date.  The manager of a relevant housing authority must submit the draft accommodation programme or the draft of an amendment to or a replacement of the programme and the report on the public consultation process referred to in section 11 to the members of the authority not later than two months before the date specified for adoption under section 7 or 10 or where appropriate.  This is a minimum period and the intention is that the specified date by which programmes must be adopted will allow for a longer period of consideration by the members.  The authority must as soon as possible after such submission to the members furnish a copy of the draft to any of the bodies notified earlier in the preparation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Senator Walsh's point that the two month period is not long enough even if it is a minimum period.  If there is cross party support for that, I will look at it, but I am not anxious to do something that will add further delays.  An amendment was already tabled which sought that everything would be enacted in 1998.  If I accept <Col N="582" /> extensions to the time limits, autumn 1999 will not be reached which was the date I set and we do not want to go down that road.  However, it is important to ensure local authorities have a reasonable time span within which to consider these matters.  There is no obligation on the manager to wait for the minimum period before he puts the draft programme before the members; he can put it before them much earlier than that. Any extension of the time limits will delay the implementation of the legislation, which I am not anxious to encourage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State and Senator Walsh but the object of the exercise is that everybody understands what is happening. The programme is important and if it can be discussed within two months and everybody is happy that they have grasped its implications, I have no difficulty with it.  More time may help, but if the public is included at the beginning of the process, two months may be enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreed the programme should be adopted as quickly as possible.  Senator Walsh's argument depends on the time of year it comes before the local authority.  Many do not meet in August while in November estimates are adjourned left, right and centre.  None of us is anxious to delay the Bill but we are anxious to ensure that when it is put before councillors, it can be properly considered.  It may be possible to look at that in conjunction with Senator Doyle's amendments in respect of the time available for the adjournment of meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an effort to delay the process when it gets to the council but it is important that councillors are engaged in it.  Two months is an inadequate period after the manager puts the programme before members given the other business of the council.  This may lead members to opt out, let the manager off and then oppose him.  They will then create a groundswell of public opposition to the programme as well. We are caught on the one hand trying to facilitate the Bill but, on the other, trying to get it to operate properly.  However, I support it working effectively upon implementation.  Will the Minister consider this in conjunction with other amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be better to consider this in the context of time allowed for the adjournment of a meeting as it is necessary to concentrate minds.  If we allow too much time it might give people an excuse not to apply their minds.  Senator Doyle's amendments in respect of the time allowed for the adjournment of meetings might offer a way out.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), line 39, to delete &ldquo;21&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;40&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This important section deals with the failure of elected members to adopt an accommodation programme.  We have a responsibility, especially with the reorganisation of local government, to look after the traveller community and others who are socially excluded.  On Second Stage I compared the health of travellers with those in the settled community and the difference was frightening.  There is an onus on elected members to address that problem and to provide proper housing for the traveller community.</P>
      <P>It would be a terrible mistake if councillors did not adopt an accommodation programme and it was left to the manager.  Will councils be given a second bite at the cherry before the manager steps in and introduces his or her proposals if they fail to agree in the first instance?  I want more time to be given to councillors because they often must hold two or three meetings when making difficult decisions, but eventually they come to the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle because it is imperative the programme is adopted by the council.  The programme will get public support which it would not have if it was seen to be imposed by the manager.  While the law is the law, many laws on the Statute Book are not enforced or are difficult to enforce.  This will also apply if a programme is imposed.  While the Minister will not entertain my suggestion, it is totally undemocratic that a manager would be given any statutory powers.  His or her powers should derive from the authority of the council he or she serves. On Second Stage, I suggested authority could be given to the elected chairman because he or she would be accountable to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keogh strongly disagrees also but an extra period of time might be a way around the problem.  The process would be strengthened and councillors would be encouraged to accept responsibility and make decisions without leaving them to the manager.  The more legislation is <Col N="584" /> drafted to entice councillors into doing that the better and there would be improved results also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Walsh has said, I expressed my views on this matter on Second Stage.  I agree that elected representatives should do their duty and formulate a plan.  I would have no difficulty in allowing some flexibility in the time allowed for that but I have had the experience of a county councillor insisting that the only way to deal with the traveller accommodation problem was to insist on all travellers being housed in local authority houses.  As the Minister has already said, some travellers do not want to do that.  We must take account of the needs, requirements and wishes of the travelling community. We must not forget that travellers also have responsibilities, but there are county councils which will never face up to their responsibilities unless there is some method of making them do so.  The method proposed in the Bill is as good as any.  If councils do not face up to their responsibilities decisions will be taken by the managers and councillors will have less say in the implementation of plans than they would like.  I would prefer to have proper consultation leading to the agreement of elected members, but if we want to adopt the accommodation programmes which are needed we must have a method of ensuring that they are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ideal world councillors would adopt this plan.  The adoption of estimates is the most basic function of a council, yet they sometimes do not do so.  In such cases the Minister appoints a commissioner.  It would be preferable if members adopted the proposal but I would prefer to see the manager step in, with further consultation which I will refer to later, than have a commissioner appointed and decisions taken without any local reference.  This difficulty would be best accommodated by extending the period for which meetings may be adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The public perception is that the manager implements all proposals and local public representatives have no control.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. The period of 21 days must be viewed in the context of the minimum period of two months immediately preceding the adjournment period which members have to consider the document and the motion before them.  The 21 days is intended to cover unforeseen or extenuating circumstances only.  The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to increase the period for adoption of the draft by over 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of 21 days is based on the period allowed for the adjournment of council meetings <Col N="585" /> where the adoption of estimates are being considered under section 10 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  All councils who adopt estimates have experiece of operating within that system and it has worked satisfactorily.  In a small number of instances councils have not adopted their estimates. Extreme action was taken in an even smaller number of cases &mdash; for example, Dublin, Bray and, I think, Kildare.</P>
    <P>We will discuss this area in greater detail on Report Stage.  If one looks at all the necessary procedures, the period of time when the draft accommodation programme is in the public domain is quite extensive.  I do not think that such an enormous amount of time is needed to deal with this issue.  If the will is there it can be dealt with in a very short period.  Seeking extensions will not make issues go away.  The 21 day period has operated satisfactorily for the striking of a rate under section 10 of the Act.  That same period should apply in this case.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing my view that it is important that elected members rather than the manager adopt the programme. Will the Minister consider on Report Stage some mechanism that would allow councillors a little more time to come to the right decision?  This question cannot be compared with the striking of a rate.  We are dealing here with a human problem and with people who need to be rehoused.  It will take time to persuade the majority of a council on some of the issues involved.  I am sure, given time, that councils will come to the right decision.  I merely ask the Minister to give councillors a little more time if they fail in the first instance to adopt the programme.</P>

      <P>I must repeat that I cannot accept the amendment.  Much of the work on the Bill was done by my predecessor.  In many cases I have followed the proposals of the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus.  I had hoped for cross-party agreement on such an important issue as this.  The two months when council members consider the programme comes after a long period of public consultation and submissions and debate in the media.  If councillors fail to adopt the programme within that two month period the Bill provides for a further extension of 21 days.  If the extension was not provided for, Senators would propose that that would be done.  The extension has been written into the Bill in anticipation of reasonable requests for it.  To extend the 21 days to 40 will not solve problems which have already been in the public arena for several months.  The 21 day extension period is an important part of the Bill and I must reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 1, to delete &ldquo;one month&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We do not want to delay the process but we are trying to ensure it works in a way in which we can stand over it.  Section 14 deals with a default situation where the council fails to adopt an accommodation programme in the required period. It then falls to the manager to adopt the programme within a month of the completion of the council's consideration of it.  This power is given to the manager following a long period of consideration and it is a serious one.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities know that time elapses quickly between meetings.  Given that the manager is empowered in the allowed period of one month to make any modifications that he considers fit, it is important that proper time is allowed.  It is possible, though unlikely, that a plan could be adopted with members not quite reaching agreement.  It is not as significant as the Northern talks.  However, members of a council may almost come on board, without the resolution of some outstanding issues. It then falls to the manager to adopt a programme within a month.  He then has the power to make any changes, no matter what stage of consideration it was left at by members.  A two month period is more appropriate for such an important power.</P>

      <P>I have given careful consideration to this amendment, on foot of an undertaking I gave on Second Stage.  However, I am satisfied that the period of one month is adequate.  The manager will be deeply involved in the preparation and adoption process for many months before the issue is considered by members.  The manager will, therefore, be familiar with the issues involved and will be in a position to respond quickly to any new issues raised during members' discussions.  Any extension of this period could lead to demands for extensions to other time limits.  The cumulative effect of this would be considerable and would put back the implementation of this section.</P>
      <P>The arguments raised by the Senator about councillors being just about to come on board at the end of a one month period could also apply to a two month period.  If it was extended to three months, people could still be about to come on board.  We must face up to the reality of a time factor where decisions must be made at a specific time.  A decision period of one month is sufficient for a manager to adopt the programme, as it is in his hands at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> It is important that people know and understand what is being done.  It is also important that councillors know it is in their hands to adopt these programmes.  They have adequate time and there is a varied process of consultation with the public.  There is also a long period of time when the issues are debated.  Failure to adopt the programme triggers the manager's involvement.  The manager does not have an executive function until members have rejected plans.  This is a critical part of the Bill.  It is a question of making up one's mind.  Extending the time period will not make it easier for those who want to oppose an accommodation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this is a critical part of the Bill, which is why it should be operated in a fashion which will allow as much support as possible for the plan adopted by the manager. Between meetings, managers have discussions with councillors and others.  This provision gives the manager the power to make any changes he sees fit to the draft plan.  This is a strong power and it should be possible for the manager to engage in further consultation and discussion, even on an informal basis, with a view to securing a programme which commands the widest possible support from the council.  This amendment proposes to allow time for this to happen, particularly where the manager makes changes to the programme over and above those which existed at the stage at which consideration was completed by councillors.</P>

    <P>In page 12, line 2, after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that two weeks public notice <Col N="588" /> of such modifications is given, and that regard is had by the manager to any submissions received within two weeks of publication of such notice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the point I raised earlier about the power given to the manager to introduce any modifications which he sees fit to the plan after the council has failed to adopt it and during the period of one month available to him to make further changes.  He can then order the adoption of the plan.  I am concerned that having gone through a long process of public consultation, a manager could make major modifications which may not have due regard to the submissions and consultations which had taken place during the period when it was before the council for consideration.  This amendment proposes to provide for some review mechanism for modifications which the manager proposes to introduce at the default stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to introduce a further round of public consultation into an already extensive consultative process.  Presumably, this further round is dependent on the extension to two months of the period allowed to the manager to adopt a programme, which was proposed in an earlier amendment.  From a practical point of view, it is unlikely that a manager would be able to complete satisfactorily a further round of public consultation in the format proposed within the extended period of two months.</P>
      <P>On the question of principle, there does not appear to be sufficient justification for further consultation, particularly in view of the ending, with effect from 31 May 1998, of the exemption of halting sites from the planning requirements which apply to local authority developments in their functional area.  Other proposals for housing accommodation which may be inserted by the manager at this stage will also be subject to the appropriate public notice procedures under the planning regulations.  It is important that a programme be adopted within a reasonable period and that would not be served by the introduction of a further consultative stage along the lines proposed. A programme adopted by the manager must comply with the other provisions relevant to its format and content.</P>

That is my concern about the powers given to the manger during this period.</P>

      <P>As I said, the exemption from notification under the planning process is being withdrawn at the end of this month so the public will have the right to comment on the manager's <Col N="589" /> proposals through the planning consultative process under Part X of the Planning Act.  If council members choose not to adopt a programme it falls to the manager to put one forward; he can amend or change the programme put forward and discussed by the members or he can adopt the programme as he originally presented it to them in draft form.  He will have the benefit of having studied all the submissions made by the public and of having heard the arguments made by members in the council's discussions, and he will be familiar with the reasons given by some councillors for refusing to support the programme.  He will have to exercise his discretion as to which format that draft programme finally takes when he submits it.  The programme adopted by the manager must comply with the provisions of the Act, including the requirements of section 10(2) and (3).  The councillors will be familiar with all these possibilities and one hopes that will influence them to make the decision themselves rather than letting the matter pass for decision by the officials.</P>

      <P>What is the position regarding other housing authorities?  For instance, an arbitrary line has been drawn between South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as regards dealing with traveller matters.  One area is within the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown boundary but impacts on South Dublin; however, South Dublin councillors have little influence on it.  In theory councils are supposed to consult with adjoining administrative areas and we should emphasise that councillors should have an input into halting sites or group housing schemes in immediately adjoining areas.  That has not happened up to now and I do not know whether it will happen under this legislation. Whenever we deal with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, section 59 of the Planning Act is mentioned and we are told South Dublin County Council has no role in the matter, but it is we who must deal with the public because the sites have an impact on our area.  Whatever programme is implemented this provision must be tightly enforced and councillors of one area should have a big role to play as regards schemes in an adjoining council area.</P>

Great work is being done by the senior traveller training centres &mdash; the Minister will be familiar with the centres in Galway city and county.  These support services should be highlighted and perhaps the Government could give more resources under this programme to local authorities.  The traveller training centres are doing great work under the aegis of the vocational education committees and more resources should be made available to them also so that their role can be strengthened.  The two matters are interlinked and can complement each other in the context of an accommodation programme.</P>

Why <Col N="591" /> would there be a need for a review &mdash; because needs have changed, an influx into the area, or a lack of consultation between council administrative areas, such as between Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Dublin?  Do councils have control if there is a sudden influx into their area in the middle of a programme?  What is the county manager's role in this regard?  Is there always co-operation? For instance, if there is an influx from the boat at Rosslare, will councils in Dublin know about it within a short time?  Will there be a consultation process with each county area?  For example, we might have to do a review because they have all moved from the other county areas and are coming to Dublin.  While these areas would not be required to undertake a review, authorities in Dublin would be obliged to.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) provides that a review of existing programmes be undertaken at least once every three years or at such times as may be directed by the Minister.  Additionally, should the relevant housing authority consider it appropriate, it may review its programme at any stage during the period to which a specific programme relates.  This would allow authorities to take account of various factors affecting change within the traveller population to facilitate constant and updated consideration of needs within that community.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides power as a consequence to a review carried out under subsection (1) for the amendment or replacement of any accommodation programme.  The other subsection provides for a limit on the time necessary to adopt an amendment or replacement programme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provision allowing the Minister to require consultation between two or more housing authorities.  Will it allow the Minister to ask such authorities &mdash; for example, those covering Border towns &mdash; to engage in joint programmes or part of a programme?  For this to <Col N="592" /> be successful it is important that accommodation be dispersed around counties and areas.  Concentrations lead to a build up of other problems. While local authorities will tend to take the former approach in their own counties, problems may arise when there is a lack or co-ordination between programmes in neighbouring counties.  Is there a provision allowing the Minister to intervene in such circumstances &mdash; for example, by asking two authorities to liaise regarding areas in their jurisdictions and agree a joint programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Walsh has reiterated my views.  A good example is the minimal co-ordination between South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Gallagher, the assessment of need will have been established and there will be a statutory obligation on each local authority to prepare an accommodation programme based on the established need.  If the outcome is that suggested by the Senator it would mean that a local authority had failed to fulfil its statutory responsibility. That would have to be looked at.  However, I do not expect that to happen because of the procedure provided for here.  If members were tempted not to fulfil the requirement it would fall back to the manager to do so.</P>
      <P>The other questions are answered in the section.  It enables the Minister, following consultation with the relevant housing authorities concerned, to require that accommodation programmes be prepared jointly by two or more housing authorities in a specified way and by a specified date.  The section also extends to the Minister a similar prerogative with regard to the amendment or replacement of an accommodation programme as that contained in subsection (1) with regard to the adoption of programmes. Power is given to the Minister, following consultations, to require two local authorities to work together to prepare a joint programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of my colleagues have indicated their concern about the composition of the local consultative committees.  There is a view that it is imperative to include representatives from areas where existing halting sites or travelling housing schemes are in operation.  It can be argued that the local representatives are representative of the county as a whole, including all the areas.  However, if so, we are also representative of the travellers, despite their involvement in the committee, a measure with which I agree.</P>
      <P>However, perhaps a proviso to the effect that the council would have the option to select people from areas be included.  This would mean that while the council would not have to exercise the option, it would be able to select people from areas such as those I have mentioned.  This will provide a conduit for information.</P>
      <P>In areas where we have halting sites we have found that failure to detect problems early has led to groups organising themselves and opposing difficulties and expansion of the halting sites.  The surrounding publicity has led to people in other areas where we had intended to do something forming themselves into opposition groups.</P>
      <P>Failure to consult the settled community has been a fundamental flaw for a long period.  There is a view that we should try and address that in the Bill by providing for the inclusion of people from such areas.  This would only enhance our efforts by providing early warning signals and ensuring that we learn from mistakes and avoid them in the future.  The inclusion of such people on the consultative committee would also reassure other people in other areas that we will implement planned programmes and that the council is receptive to a partnership approach &mdash; that is what the ethos of government is about &mdash; where concerns and problems will be heard and addressed.  That would give confidence to people to work with us on the plan.</P>
      <P>If I have a criticism of the Bill, it is that it tends to impose things.  For example, it stipulates that the manager will do something and a plan will happen.  We have found in the past that this system has not worked.  The reason for this legislation is because of the failure of previous attempts.  Surely we should learn from the various approaches to partnership by the social partners that an inclusive process is much more likely to be better founded and will, therefore, have a better chance to succeed.  I urge that such an amendment be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Senator Walsh regarding the composition of the local consultative committee.  I do not know how we will find a mechanism to include a person who will reflect an entire area.  Most resident associations have umbrella groups within an area. Within that one could find a person who could represent the settled community.  If a halting site is proposed for an area he or she could liaise with the local residents in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> While we are the representatives with a mandate, we must be seen to be fair.  There must be a member from the settled community on the local consultative committee to liaise with the local settled people.  The appointing authority will appoint the chairperson and members of such a committee. How will they be vetted?  What criteria will be used to select people?  I ask the Minister of State to consider a mechanism whereby a member of the settled community can be on the consultative committee.  It would do much to overcome the problems that have prevailed to date.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator McDonagh, I point out that we are dealing with accommodation. I mentioned earlier that the needs of travellers extend beyond accommodation.  They also have health, education and training needs.  We must keep in mind that this Bill deals with the accommodation needs and the section refers to the membership of the local consultative committee dealing with accommodation.  I appreciate the valuable role of the staff of the training centres and others who work with the travelling community. However, it is not appropriate or necessary for them to be represented on the local consultative committee.  Various interests are represented on the national consultative committee, including social workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have sought representation on the local consultative committee for local communities by people who do not represent the travellers and who are not travellers, elected councillors or council officials.  When framing this legislation I concluded that the broader community is represented by the people elected locally.  Were I to exclude elected councillors from the committee I <Col N="595" /> would face a different debate in the House.  Providing for the membership in the manner proposed is intended to guarantee adequate representation for the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Senators hold strong views on this issue. However, I am not sure if there is room for manoeuvre without diminishing the effectiveness and strength of the committees.  The compositional balance of the representation of the local committees is confined strictly.  The proposed parameters for the representation of each group is intended to ensure that no group will be excluded from the committees' deliberations.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the matter of representation by other groups and authorities. However, I am satisfied that, in view of the detail likely to be discussed by local committees, particularly with regard to the assessment of needs and the participation of travellers in planning, design and management of their accommodation and to further improve understanding between local authorities and travellers, the representation proposed in the Bill is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I took into account the other channels available to local communities to express their views on local developments, including the opportunity to have an input to the draft of an accommodation programme and the recently announced decision to end the exemption of halting sites from the public notice procedures of Part 10 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, which apply to local authority developments in their own functional area.  That is to come into effect on 31 May.  I am also conscious of the proposals in the context of general local government reform for the establishment of strategic policy committees for the major policy areas, including housing, which will comprise community representation.</P>
    <P>I recognise that a wide range of services is provided to travellers at local level and the arrangements to ensure co-ordination of those services are a matter for the authorities concerned.  In this case we are dealing with housing accommodation. I am aware that some local authorities are part of local co-ordinating arrangements but it is not necessary to provide for this specifically in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In accordance with any directions issued by the Minister under section 21, the Bill provides for the appointment of a chairperson and members of the local consultative committee and it specifies that the membership is to be confined to members and officials of the appointing authority concerned and representatives of the local travellers and traveller bodies.  In cases where a local consultative committee has been appointed by a county council one member will be appointed from each relevant housing authority, if any, within the administrative county concerned.  This means that the five borough corporations and the urban district councils named in the Bill must also have a representative on the local committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> It is proposed that members of the local authority cannot exceed half the membership of the committee and representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies should not be less than a quarter of the membership in order to achieve a fair working balance between the groups.  In deference to the arguments made about representation for local communities, I recall that in the past many local authorities had local traveller committees for which the councillors proposed the membership and they included people who were not elected and, in some cases, did not include travellers.  We are addressing that anomaly by providing that members of the local authority shall not exceed half the membership of each consultative committee.</P>
    <P>Before Report Stage I will examine the possibility of giving councillors the option of proposing people who are not councillors and giving them the option of electing interested persons.  I am prepared to examine that possibility although I cannot guarantee to agree to it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comments on this thorny issue and I appreciate that he wishes to see how this problem can be overcome.  He has said that the public will be made aware of what is happening at the draft stage, but people do not focus their attention until something is about to happen.  They may then find that the councillor on the consultative committee favours a halting site in their area against the wishes of their local councillor.  We must get this programme up and running but we cannot be seen to exclude one particular section of the community.</P>

      <P>Such people would be granted membership to oppose proposed accommodation programmes.  I am worried by the suggestion that those appointed would represent areas where halting sites are proposed and that there would be no opposition.  That is the other side of the coin.  I do not want to open up a Pandora's box on this issue as I want to make progress.  The consultative process being put in place is absolutely new; it is open, transparent and moves away from the old system whereby in many cases managers suggested a site for traveller facilities because the council owned that site.  It was not the result of judicious site selection, which is an important part of this process, and an attitude of forcing matters through was involved in that system.  I hope that the procedures we are proposing mean that thought will be given to the best location that satisfies the wishes of those who are to live there <Col N="597" /> and that is also reasonable to the local community.</P>
      <P>It is no use having our heads in the sand about the strength of communities' views on these issues.  Communities have strong views on many matters, but traveller facilities and public dumps are two issues that blow the lid off people's reason.  I have seen venom and hatred in the eyes of people who would be admired as high ranking Christians in their own communities when these matters arose.  That cannot be ignored and I hope this legislation deals with the matter sensibly, reasonably and in a way that accommodates as many people's views as possible.  We can then provide satisfactory accommodation for people living in intolerable conditions.</P>

      <P>I do not think so and will give the Minister of State an example.  Wexford County Council had problems for over a decade with a scheme for Drumgoole at the bottom of Vinegar Hill.  It is well known in the Department of the Environment.  Various attempts were made to impose halting sites on the area.  A small traveller housing scheme there was in an atrocious condition and that led to intolerable circumstances for the neighbouring settled community.  Some members of that settled community felt so strongly that they brought a case to the High Court.  The case aroused the ire of the manager and some of my council colleagues, but as a result of it the community forced the manager and council to engage in dialogue.  A very satisfactory outcome to that dialogue eventually emerged.  It was costly because of the court action but instead of a halting site there is an extended housing scheme which is working very well.  The area has been cleaned up and travellers are accommodated.</P>
      <P>Failure to recognise the difficulties such schemes can impose on communities and to provide measures that will anticipate and address such difficulties will provide the seeds of failure for this legislation.  Because of that experience, Wexford County Council is seeking to appoint travellers' representatives to our groups, but it is also looking for representatives of the settled community who have experienced problems in this regard.  That is a progressive step.  We must identify the issues and put mechanisms in place to deal with them.  If we fail to do so we will encounter widespread opposition to what we are trying to do here.  This is a strongly held view in our Seanad group, and some Members have expressed it to me privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State has said he will examine the issue between now and Report Stage.  Nobody wants to put obstacles in the way <Col N="598" /> of progress in this matter.  As the Minister of State said, the priority here is the accommodation of people who are genuinely in need.  However, we must also learn from experience if we are to succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 36, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;15&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult area and I realise the Minister of State is operating under many constraints in putting forward these proposals.  My amendment seeks to address a practical situation that could arise.</P>
      <P>This provision allows the council to serve notice to remove a temporary dwelling to a serviced site, including a site with limited facilities, within a five mile distance, where the temporary dwelling could be appropriately accommodated.</P>
      <P>I would like more flexibility in this section to allow a council to offer accommodation on a transient site it might have available.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is addressing this area, because councillors will know that efforts made to provide accommodation can be quickly undermined by unauthorised encampments that can be set up very quickly.  My fear relates particularly to rural local authority areas, where a council could assess needs in a number of towns and set out a programme to meet that need.  A number of transient sites could also be provided throughout that county.  A situation could then arise whereby a permanent halting site is full because the county's needs have been met.</P>
      <P>Extra people who move in must also be accommodated. If a transient site were available in the county at a distance further than the five mile radius allowed in the Bill the council would be precluded from meeting its obligations to accommodate such people.  The council is under no legal obligation to house a settled person on the ordinary housing list within five miles of where they currently live, although I know the housing officers will do their best to offer them one of their first three choices.  Legally, such people can be housed anywhere in the county, which could mean a distance of over 15 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not insisting on 15 miles as an absolute limit; I am using it to illustrate the point that the council will be unable to move illegal encampments in a town which has provided three or four halting sites to vacant accommodation provided at taxpayers' expense.  It will lead to further difficulties, resentment and agitation among the settled community if the council cannot meet its obligation to travellers who arrive in an area at short notice or on a temporary basis by offering <Col N="599" /> them accommodation on transient sites in the county.</P>

      <P>The legislation is very weak in this regard.  If the council does not have a halting site it cannot move travellers from the side of the road.  There have been several High Court judgments on this issue which stated councils cannot move travellers unless they provide proper, standardised halting sites with running water and other facilities.  I have spent four months dealing with the problem of travellers in my area who are living at the side of the road in terrible conditions, creating litter and abusing public amenities.  We cannot move them on because we have nowhere to move them.  This legislation will be implemented in five years' time but we do not have a serviced site at the moment.  The legislation will be meaningless because officials are unable to move travellers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Gallagher's comments on the five mile limit on the grounds that it may cause a major problem in rural areas. The Minister should expand that limit and give local authorities an opportunity to carry out the necessary developments.  Local authorities cannot afford to provide hard stands in more than one or two locations in a county.  Most travellers in the midlands tend to stay in one county.  The five mile limit is tying the hands of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if 15 miles would be considered a reasonable distance but I have no difficulty extending the limit.  I cannot understand why this is a discretionary power.  It costs at least £40,000 or £50,000 to build a halting site.  The section states the local authority may require the person to move to a site provided they can &ldquo;appropriately be accommodated on that site&rdquo;, which assumes the local authority has a discretionary power to move a caravan to a vacancy on the site.  That should be mandatory because many of the problems have arisen due to the failure of local authorities to confront these issues.</P>
      <P>I know council officials who failed to act because they wanted the council to decide to extend a halting site from six bays to 20 bays, which was rightly unacceptable to the councillors. They then allowed a build up of caravans on the roadside in order to create public pressure on the councillors to make that decision.  That is an intolerable way to deal with the problem.  The result was that a halting site which had been very well managed became a shambles because of the congregation of caravans around it.  It has since been improved but it was never restored to its original condition.  It should be a mandatory rather than a discretionary provision that caravans within five miles of a halting site should be moved to any vacancies on that site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher's amendment proposes to change the five mile limit to a 15 mile limit.  The provisions of the new section 10(1)(b) of the 1992 Act do not specify a distance within which the alternative site must be located.  The provisions of paragraph (b) are intended to cover many of the situations anticipated by the Senator's proposal to increase the distance from five to 15 miles.  The difference is that the distance limit has been removed only in the circumstances stated, that is, if the temporary dwelling is unfit for human habitation, likely to interfere with the public or private amenities or on health or safety grounds.</P>
      <P>The existing limit of five miles has been regarded by the courts as reasonable.  I am advised any extension of this limit must have regard to a test of reasonableness, which would be linked to the circumstances set out at paragraph (b), having regard to the principles of natural justice.  Due to the existing pressures on halting site accommodation, the number of vacancies at any one time is only a fraction of the number of families seeking bays on sites.  In these circumstances the courts have questioned the rationale of moving travellers when no alternative accommodation is available.</P>
      <P>The acceleration of the rate at which accommodation is provided, which is the main purpose of this Bill, is the key to eliminating unauthorised encampments.  Given what I have said, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 31 provides for improvements in the powers available to housing authorities under the Housing Acts to require the removal of an unauthorised temporary dwelling, which is a caravan parked in a public place.  Under the revised provisions, a housing authority will be empowered to serve a notice to move in certain circumstances. In the event of non-compliance with the terms of the notice, the housing authority may remove the temporary dwelling to the specified location or, in the case of the category at subsection (1)(c), to a place which is not less than one mile from the accommodation concerned.</P>
      <P>At present under section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, a housing authority may only serve a notice to move if the temporary dwelling can be appropriately accommodated on a site provided by that authority within a distance of five miles.  The existing section 10 has some practical limitations.  An urban district council could not serve a notice in respect of a temporary dwelling if the alternative site was provided by the county council, although the site might be very close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1)(a) provides that notice may be served to remove an unauthorised temporary dwelling to any serviced site provided by any housing authority, or by a voluntary body with the assistance of a housing authority, within a five mile distance where the temporary dwelling could, in the opinion of the housing authority serving the locality, be appropriately accommodated. <Col N="601" /> The site to which the temporary dwelling may be removed may be in the functional area of the housing authority or, with the agreement of another authority, in the area of another housing authority, or, with the agreement of a voluntary organisation, on a site provided by that organisation. It is also clarified as a result of the revisions to section 13 of the Housing Act, 1988, including the new definition of site with limited services that the alternative site may have services other than those envisaged for permanent accommodation. It is intended that the level of services for limited sites, that is, sites for stays of a short duration, would be the subject of separate guidelines to be issued in the near future.  These guidelines are already being prepared in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1)(b) deals with the removal to a site within or outside the functional area where the authorised temporary dwelling is unfit for human habitation due to lack of proper basic services, is likely to obstruct or interfere with public or private amenities or is likely to constitute or be a risk to personal or public health or safety. The notice may require the removal of the temporary dwelling to any serviced site, including a site with limited facilities within the functional area or, with the agreement of another authority, to a site within the functional area of another housing authority.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction.  There is the right to remove a caravan, in certain circumstances, to a distance further than five miles.  However, if there is a site where a caravan which is not deemed to be in contravention of the stipulations made in the Bill &mdash; unfit for human habitation, interfering with public and private amenities and so on &mdash; and can be appropriately sited on an existing serviced site, it can be moved to a distance of five miles.  This is a reasonable provision.  This is the kernel of many communities' objections to the notion of halting sites and facilities being provided in their vicinity.</P>
    <P>Illegal parking has resulted in the creation of very unsightly conditions.  The settled community is embarrassed to think that anyone could live in such horrible conditions.  It is a reflection on society that people are parked illegally in all sorts of places without proper facilities such as running water or toilets and where the basics of life are denied to them.  It is obvious that people living on such sites are going to create unsightly conditions which cause anger.  Local communities have two feelings &mdash; they have an inner feeling of sympathy for anyone living in such conditions and they do not want their area dragged down by the location of such an unsightly installation.</P>
    <P>The law has been interpreted and the traveller community and local communities are aware of this.  Local authorities have been in and out of courts.  Where there is no provision for travellers the courts have not supported the local authorities in seeking to move people away from high <Col N="602" /> profile, unsightly sites.  This is an attempt to deal with this situation taking into account the experiences of local authorities and others in the courts and the advice of the Attorney General.  It is deemed that what is provided for in the Bill will be interpreted by the courts as reasonable.  If we extend the five mile limit to 15 miles the courts would not deem that reasonable and the section would be upended in the courts.</P>
    <P>The courts will examine subsection (1)(b) which gives local authorities the power to move caravans beyond five miles in certain circumstances. If circumstances are worse we may be dealing with one mile limit at a later stage.  I cannot accept this amendment but I hope the House understands the effectiveness of paragraph (a) as distinct from paragraph (b) and how paragraph (b) covers the point the amendment seeks to address.</P>

      <P>It would be unwise to make it obligatory on local authorities to act in all these cases as with the one mile radius under subsection (1)(c).  It is important that we leave the discretion to those dealing with individual families and circumstances. When one includes mandatory regulations personal circumstances are sometimes not taken into consideration.  In view of the sensitivities of this issue, I would not be in favour of making these powers mandatory.  We will have to rely <Col N="603" /> on the common sense and experience of senior local authority officials.  We are giving them powers which they have not had up to now.  These powers increase their authority to deal with certain situations.  However, at all times the individual family circumstances have to be taken into consideration by the official who is going to initiate these procedures.  That is why it is important that the provision is discretionary and not mandatory.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Minister of State is saying.  However, if a family is in a caravan at the side of the road and the council attempts to move them to a halting site where there are satisfactory services, that is improving the situation for that family.  I am concerned about instances where officials may be working to a different agenda.</P>
      <P>This is a good provision which gives powers to local authorities to move people.  However, am I correct in thinking that this will have little effect as it is predicated on there being alternative accommodation available at a halting site to which the caravans can be moved?  That is the difficulty.  The results on the ground will not be much different than at present unless a large number of halting sites are constructed quickly. From talking to officials who have struggled with this issue over a long period, and, for various reasons, including public liability claims which have become the trend in halting sites, there appears to be a move away from the provision of halting sites and towards providing houses.  The power is good but the solution does not appear to be effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Walsh's concern. It is hard to choose a limit.  My intention in choosing a 15 mile limit was to put the council in a position where, having accommodated travellers assessed as being in need within the council area, it would discharge its obligations by offering a place on a transient site to any travellers who arrived in its area on a short-term basis.  I am not hung up on the 15 mile radius but I have no doubt the provisions in section 31(1)(b) will end up in the courts.  The council will send notice to someone telling them, under subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii), to move to a transient site eight or ten miles away and that order will end up in the court. Section 31(1)(b)(i) states &ldquo;(i) unfit for human habitation due to lack or inadequacy of water supply.&rdquo;.  As few if any caravans have that facility, almost all could be moved on but I do not believe the courts will not allow that to happen.  A council which attempts to exercise its power under section 31(1)(b) will have it tested in the courts and what they will decide is impossible to predict.  A council which has done its best and which has met its statutory obligations to reasonably accommodate travellers in its area should be able to offer a place on a transient site to <Col N="604" /> additional travellers who arrive without that power being questioned.  I do not know how that can be worded but I would like to see it being made law.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 27, to delete &ldquo;one mile&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 miles&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Minister's response to my concerns in this area and I accept that the one mile limit is the recommendation of the task force.  I am also concerned that it has been the pattern in many council areas that where halting sites are provided, it is the same part of the town or county which is consistently asked to shoulder a greater proportion of the burden than is necessary. Where part of a town or county is prepared to accept a halting site, it should be possible to reassure them that they will not have unauthorised encampments in the area.  One mile is a decent radius and I do not quibble with that.  Sites have tended to be located in local authority areas or near dumps or sewerage works.  A situation could arise under this Bill where an area of a town or county which has accepted a halting site is also asked to accept unauthorised encampments. There should be a three mile radius but I accept the points made in the task force report about tests of reasonableness so I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendments. However, it should be possible to reassure people that, where there is a properly serviced halting site in their area, there will not be two or three illegal encampments around it.  I am aware from my town that the most significant obstacle to further provision of halting sites in the town is that there are two illegal encampments beside the official one.  A one mile radius would allow some leeway but I would like to see it extended to two at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have difficulty with this part of the section.  It is unclear whether it is a one mile radius or one mile by road.  In my area there are three encampments within a one mile radius of the halting site.  It is also difficult to define a traveller family within a site as they can easily move from one site to the next.  It creates many problems so perhaps the three mile radius is necessary.  However, that might be too much so I would be happy with the two mile radius.  I understand the Minister's stance when he stated that, on legal advice, a limit greater than one mile interfered with natural justice and that an area should not be ringfenced as off-limits to travellers. If the Attorney General has argued that anything <Col N="605" /> more than one mile is unreasonable within the terms of natural justice, then we could run into trouble with the one mile limit.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most towns have a boundary which is established by the speed limit at its perimeter. The Minister should enforce the one mile limit from the perimeter of a town because, if a site is on the approach road to a town, the one mile limit could result in an illegal encampment being on the other side of town.  Sometimes the sites of these illegal encampments are near schools.  Will the Minister consider a one mile limit from the town boundary established by the 30 mile speed limit as it would be fair to the residents of the towns in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what has been said but I wish to expand on it.  Leaving aside the expansion of the limit, there should be an absolute proscription on any illegal parking within one mile of a halting site.  It is the one issue which has bred opposition to halting sites.  By allowing it to happen, we have cut a stick to beat ourselves.  It is a part of the Bill with which I am unhappy.  I know from experience that officials will tend not to take action in the hope there might shortly be a vacancy on a halting site.  Alternatively, they will use the argument that going to court will not achieve a favourable decision, which is often the case.  They will also ask where the travellers will be situated.  Since the travellers are often related to those living in the halting site, they will tend to congregate in illegal encampments around it. That creates opposition to the concept of providing halting sites.  If the idea is to be successful and to be accepted, the sites must be seen to be effectively managed.  The only way that can be done is by having a prescribed area adjacent to them in which caravans will not be allowed park, be it a one mile radius or otherwise.  The Garda and councils should also have the authority to physically remove the caravans.  Anything less would allow the huge opposition to halting sites to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember the main purpose of the provision is the protection of the travellers who have been allocated proper accommodation and the protection of residents in the immediate vicinity from an influx of other families seeking to be accommodated.  This &ldquo;honey pot&rdquo; effect is well known to all of us and is what we are dealing with specifically here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one mile limit with no provision as to alternative accommodation was recommended in the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community. <Col N="606" /> This is the only power under the Bill to deal with unauthorised encampments without a corresponding obligation to provide alternative appropriate accommodation.  As this represents a significant departure from the existing provisions of section 10 of the 1992 Act and the position adopted by the courts in many cases, the advice of the Attorney General was sought on this provision. On the basis of that advice, I am satisfied that the one mile provision is reasonable in the circumstances stated in paragraph (c) (i) and (ii).</P>
    <P>A radius of one mile encompasses a significant area, particularly in urban areas and the protection offered is considerable.  Depending on the distribution of sites or other accommodation, it could result in the exclusion of unauthorised encampments from a large area.  Any further increase in the one mile provision could result in a blanket prohibition in some areas.  The experience has been that the courts have taken a poor view of such far-reaching measures in the absence of adequate justification.  I consider, therefore, that the radius of one mile is more than adequate for the purposes for which the provision is designed, that is, the protection of residents and amenities where accommodation has been provided.</P>
    <P>Any extension of this area could lead to the possibility of the provision being used for purposes for which it was not intended and also of being upended in the courts.  It is based on careful legal analysis on what might or might not be deemed reasonable by the courts.  It is on that basis that the one mile provision has been included.  It was a recommendation of the task force and is a major instrument which will be available to local authorities to deal with one of the most regular complaints they receive from residents.</P>
    <P>With the provision of facilities, relations gather around a settlement.  They cannot get inside because of barriers or whatever and so they park outside.  We are all familiar with this problem and this is a serious attempt to regulate the situation. We must bear in mind that the solution to these issues is the implementation of the accommodation programmes and the provision of proper facilities for travellers and that such situations will not arise.</P>
    <P>I hope we are talking about a short-term measure, which is necessary to build confidence among communities in other areas.  If they, after the due process of consultation, support proposals, they will know what they support and will not find that a six caravan halting site means 20 families move into their area.  The six caravans would be adequately and satisfactorily provided for on site where all the facilities would be available, but the other 14 caravans &mdash; that may be an exaggeration &mdash; would be parked on the footpath or in lay-bys with no proper facilities and unsightly and unsanitary conditions for those living in them and with children being reared in <Col N="607" /> those circumstances.  This a new provision which I ask the House to support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would accede to one mile from the town boundary.  This will result in travellers moving from one location to another in towns which provide halting sites. We tried to move too fast in the past in that we should have moved on hard stands and halting sites and then to housing.  I hope the Minister will look again and get legal advice on this issue.  The one mile radius will be helpful but the Department will tell local authorities with a problem on the other side of a town to provide a halting site there.  One or two towns in a county will be overloaded while other areas will not have to take their fair share.  If we all take a share, we will not have a problem.  We will be creating a problem by not moving one mile from the town boundary.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Senator has looked at too many maps in relation to town boundaries.  It is the most irregular anomalous line which may be drawn on any map.  If one looks at the town boundary for my city, it is the most irregular line one could imagine and follows ditches and streams. It does not follow a rational or logical course.  When making law, it is important to lay down something which can be clearly interpreted and where there is no doubt as to where the line is.  A radius is a satisfactory method to implement the distance factor which must be determined here.  I do not know if a situation will arise where somebody will have to measure it.  It could be clearly established that the local authority would have a line and it would know exactly where it was if it was seeking to implement this provision and tow away, as would be the procedure, caravans illegally parked outside new halting sites. Town boundaries would not provide a satisfactory marking as it would not bear any relationship to the distance from a particular halting site.  One might have to travel a long or short distance, depending in what direction one travelled.  That is certainly the case given the way the boundary around Galway has been drawn.</P>

      <P>In page 24, lines 40 and 41, to delete &ldquo;a caravan on&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, the relevant authority can refuse a letting of a house owned by it to a tenant involved in anti-social behaviour.  This section seeks to extend this provision to caravans.  However, it omits to qualify the requirement referring to caravans or sites owned by it or operated under statute.  There cannot be any legal authority to refuse authorisation to occupy a caravan unless the authority owns it and unless its by-laws apply to it.  The amendment seeks to make clear that it is the site which the authority has control over and not a person's caravan.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment was not clear to me.  The term &ldquo;authorised to occupy a caravan and site&rdquo; is used extensively throughout the new section 3(a) in relation to site excluding orders and in sections 3(a) and 14(a) as such an authorisation is the key reference point to initiate the proceedings or actions provided for.  The phrase derives from the power of housing authorities under section 13 of the 1998 Housing Act, as revised by section 28 of this Bill, to provide improved management controlled sites for caravans. The normal provisions of the housing legislative code, that is, in relation to lettings and tenancies, do not apply.  Control and allocation of bays on sites is exercised on the basis of authorising a caravan or caravans to occupy or to be occupied on the bay or site.  &ldquo;Caravan&rdquo; as defined in section 13 of the Housing Act, 1988, and revised by section 28 of this Bill covers all the types of temporary dwellings which are authorised to be placed on sites.  The term is technical and I am satisfied that it covers the situations that are expected to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members who requested this debate.  I have always been agreeable to come to Seanad Éireann, where my political life began, and I have many happy memories.  As Minister for Education, I attended the House frequently but I have not been called on very much in my new capacity.  I hope that changes as I have only been here for one Adjournment Matter on rail safety.  I am glad to have such a democratic forum to set out my stall on Luas.  I am most grateful for the opportunity to come before the House and set out the decision the Government took to re-energise and refocus the Dublin light rail project.</P>
      <P>The Seanad debated the light rail issue on a number of occasions.  I will, therefore, be brief in setting out the background to Tuesday's Government decision.  The Government programme <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i> contained a commitment to an independent study of the option of putting the light rail system underground in the city centre.  Upon taking up office, I obtained Government approval to go ahead with that study.  W. S. Atkins were subsequently appointed to do the job and produced their report at the end of April.  It is salutary to note if I had not honoured that commitment I would have been hauled before the Dáil and the Seanad to explain why we were not fulfilling it.</P>
      <P>The Atkins report was a very valuable piece of work as it set out the facts in a clear and unambiguous way.  It dealt with the issues which concerned Members, such as disruption during construction, the long term passenger capacity of the system and the impact of light rail operations on the traffic system generally.  It provided objective factual information, whereas previously we only had claim and counterclaim.  However, we are back to claim and counterclaim of another nature now.  The Government gave long and serious consideration to the report before making a decision. Ministers received a presentation from the consultants on their findings and held a question and answer session with them.  The Cabinet debated the issue on two separate occasions.</P>
      <P>This emphasises the Government's concern to take a decision in the best long term interests of the capital city and its citizens.  Everyone loves Dublin and wants the best for it.  On Tuesday the Government decided the first phase of the Dublin light rail network would comprise two lines.  The first is a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station based on the CIÉ preferred alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street and which is consistent with the surface option recommended by W.S. Atkins.  Myths grew that everything in the consultants report was thrown out but we have added to it because it made sense even though it is more expensive.  The second is a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport using the old Harcourt Street and Broadstone railway alignments with an underground section in the city centre linking these alignments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> It is also the Government's objective to proceed without delay with the construction of the Tallaght &mdash; city centre and Sandyford &mdash; St. Stephen's Green sections.  This is, of course, subject to the relevant statutory procedures and to the necessary detailed technical confirmation on the Sandyford &mdash; St. Stephen's Green section. This first phase should be seen as part of a longer term vision for the development of an extended light rail network for the city serving destinations such as Swords, the Docklands, Cabinteely and Clondalkin.  This extended network is consistent with the DTI strategy and the expanded network considered in the Atkins study.  While the Government took no formal decision on this wider network, it was most anxious to ensure its decision on the first phase would facilitate the longer term development of the network on these broad lines.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain briefly some of the key considerations the Government took into account in reaching its decision.  The underground section in the city centre is proposed to run from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone.  It is designed to address two important issues raised in the W.S. Atkins report &mdash; disruption during construction and potential longer term capacity constraints in the central area as the network is extended.  The report set out a very vivid picture of the scale of disruption which would occur over a two year construction on many of the capital city's principal streets &mdash; Lower O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, College Green, Nassau Street and Dawson Street.  The proposed short underground section will address this.</P>
    <P>People think I caved into business interests or succumbed to commercial pressures but I have no aspect of commerciality in my life.  I shop like everyone else and go about my business.  I noted the comments of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, IBEC and others and I make no apology for listening to everybody's opinion in coming to a final decision.  I have great respect for commercial interests but my part in commercial life is that of a consumer not a practitioner.</P>
    <P>The Atkins report also clearly identified the potential for capacity problems as the network expanded, particularly on that part of the route which is now going underground.  While Atkins suggested options such as a loopline through the docklands to provide some relief, the Government decided to take a long-term view.  What we build now will serve this city for many generations to come.  Because this will take some time to sink in, debate on this subject is very welcome.  The Government will not make a rushed decision.  We need a properly integrated transport system.</P>

      <P>The needs of the city of Dublin and not of the Government are most important. I am amazed to hear misgivings expressed about <Col N="612" /> the cost of this project.  The Government intends, over a period of years, to spend the necessary money.  I was asked in Dáil Éireann yesterday if the cheque was written and signed as though the new transport system should be in operation immediately.  The Government's decision on Luas is now part of the public capital programme.  It is built into the public capital budgetary programme for each year and will be called down as it is needed.  The amount, £400 million plus, is part of that programme.  I wish to make that very clear lest it be thought that I am plucking figures from the sky.  My Department, and the Government subsequently, very carefully adopted the figure of £400 million plus.  I was asked yesterday what &ldquo;plus&rdquo; means and I answered that it means extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>How much extra?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We therefore decided to address the capacity problem now by building a tunnel on the city centre section.  This is a much more sensible approach than attempting patch-work solutions along the way as traffic grows.</P>
      <P>It is also important to understand &mdash; and I welcome the opportunity to stress this &mdash; that the tunnel now proposed is not the short tunnel considered in the Atkins study.  The Atkins short tunnel went from St. Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street and then westward to Smithfield, serving both the Tallaght and Dundrum lines.  One of the major drawbacks of that option, which I assume was the reason for its rejection, was its limited flexibility in terms of extending the system in the longer term.  The Government decision proposes a south-north tunnel from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone on the Sandyford to Dublin Airport line.  This overcomes the constraint on extending the network identified by Atkins.</P>
      <P>The first phase network now proposed also provides for much greater integration with the rest of the public transport system as I laid down from the beginning.  Heuston and Connolly Stations will be directly linked by a light rail line. This will leave only a short walk to Busáras connecting the rail and bus networks.  There will be a direct interchange between light rail and the DART and suburban rail systems at Connolly Station.  The airport will be directly served by the light rail network and will have much improved links with the mainline and suburban rail systems.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Tranportation Initiative placed much emphasis on making the best possible use of existing assets.  This is now being achieved by bringing both the Harcourt Street and Broadstone disused rail alignments back into play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which becomes very clear when you read the Atkins report is that light rail on its own will not solve Dublin's traffic problems.  I spent nine months going to chamber of commerce dinners and residents' and community groups' meetings and I found a common misconception that <Col N="613" /> Luas would, like a magic rope, solve traffic gridlock in an instant.  Luas will accommodate 1 per cent of the present private vehicle traffic. However, the integrated approach to Dublin's traffic problem will lead to a much greater usage of public transport than we have seen heretofore. As the lines are extended and more loops are incorporated into the system more people will be served.  Luas is not a panacea for all our traffic ills.  Traffic management is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment but he and I have discussed the importance of an integrated approach.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Government took particular account of the Atkins view that traffic management had to be addressed whatever light rail option was chosen &mdash; surface or combined surface and underground.  It was with that in mind that the Government gave the go-ahead for environmental traffic cells and for three road projects identified as essential for effective traffic management in the city.  These are the Macken Street Bridge, the Cork Street/Coombe relief route and a minor scheme at Mercer Street.  This will involve a total expenditure of about £30 million.</P>
    <P>When deciding on the development of the light rail network for Dublin the Government also noted that the cost had been estimated to be in excess of £400 million.  Some people have been demanding instant precise figures for the cost of the project.  This is both unreasonable and irresponsible. The next stage is to carry out the evaluation work which will lead to a firm cost estimate. This will require much detailed technical work on the development of the underground section including the drilling of boreholes along the corridor to determine the precise geology.  I do not intend to be drawn into a debate on figures until that work is done, except to say that my Department and the Government have consciously and carefully said that the cost will be £400 million plus.  I can assure the House that appropriate funding arrangements will be put in place to deliver on the Government's commitment to the project.  As is the usual practice the precise funding commitments for the project will be addressed as part of the normal budgetary process when the Government is preparing its annual public capital programme.</P>
    <P>The possibility of private financing for infrastructure projects is being addressed by the Department of Finance.  This is of a general nature across a range of Departments.  I expect that this general issue will be considered by the Government in the near future.  It would therefore be prudent to await the outcome of Government deliberations on general policy in this area before taking any decision on the scope of private financing of the light rail project.  Unlike some previous Government decisions, the figure was actually included with the decision.  I have seen Government decisions on capital projects which included no projected costing.  I stress the importance <Col N="614" /> of including the actual projected sum on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to EU funding.  I have always made it clear, from the first interview I gave on this subject in July 1997, that EU funding would not be the determining factor in making a decision on Luas.  My primary concern has always been to ensure that Ireland does not lose the EU funding involved.  This objective will now be achieved through the timely transfer of this money to other suitable projects.</P>
    <P>I will be working hard to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the £114 million decommitted from the light rail project will be used to address public transport requirements.  The Atkins report has highlighted a number of areas where investment is needed in transport infrastructure in Dublin.  My Department has also been working for some time with CIE to identify projects on suburban rail, including the DART and Maynooth line, where work could be undertaken by 2001.  We will now be entering into urgent consultations with the Commission on this issue.</P>
    <P>The light rail project, as decided upon by Government on Tuesday, will also be submitted for EU assistance under the next round of EU structural and cohesion funding.  When Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies came to see me last October we discussed EU funding and I explained that funding was not my priority; it was to establish a planned transport system.  She was emphatic about the provision of the Ballymun line for equality and a more cohesive system. Some of her staff had also asked for a link to the airport.  We will draft our proposals to achieve EU approval in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to tie myself or the Government to an implementation timescale at this stage, when the project is still subject to statutory approval procedures and to necessary detailed technical evaluation work.  Decisions in relation to the public inquiry are a matter for the inspector. His is a judicial role, and I have no role in relation to the inquiry.  All county councillors know this.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn and I served on Westmeath County Council.  All politics is local, but there are implications.  As you, a Chathaoirligh, and Senator Finneran know, we sat through discussions for years about where the Athlone bypass would go.  Various routes were suggested and it took a long time to make a decision. Motorists now think it is great to whizz around Athlone into south Roscommon and east Galway as quickly as possible.  However, those of who served on the relevant authority at that time know the judicial processes which have to be gone through.  The will of the people must also be respected, if they wish to object to, or support a proposal.</P>
    <P>People will laugh and ask why I am talking about a relief road to Athlone.  However, everyone who now travels that road thinks it is a great idea.  The people of Athlone think it is a wonderful <Col N="615" /> idea because the town has been revitalised and people can go about their business because there is no more heavy traffic.</P>

      <P>As regards the timetable, the Government decision has cleared the way to get on with the project.  It has dealt with the major issues of capacity and disruption which had been bedevilling the project, quite literally, for years. The Government has also set the project planners a clear objective of proceeding without delay on the Tallaght to city centre and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections.  The Government is confident that these elements of the project can go ahead quickly and that the detailed planning of the St. Stephen's Green to Dublin Airport, via Ballymun, section can proceed in parallel.</P>
      <P>My Department met the CIE light rail project team yesterday morning to brief them fully on the Government decision.  I will meet them tomorrow morning to make a political input to that urgency. The project team will now get on with the technical work programme necessary to give effect to that decision.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the Government took a far-sighted decision on the development of Dublin's transportation system.  I have no doubt that the passage of time will demonstrate the wisdom of that decision.  For too long the light rail project has been the subject of a contentious debate.  The Government commissioned an independent study which objectively addressed the issues raised in that debate.  It acted quickly and decisively once it had fully considered the consultant's report.</P>
      <P>We now need to focus our energies on delivering the light rail network to the citizens of Dublin without delay.  I look forward to everybody working together to find solutions.  That is the real challenge.  We should work together, not fight each other.  I do not wish to upset Latin scholars by quoting Horace, who said &ldquo;<i>carpe diem</i>&rdquo;.  If we do this together, Dublin city and county will have what it deserves.  I hope I can rely on the support of the Members of this House in that endeavour.</P>

      <P>As a result of the Minister's decision, we will lose £114 million of EU funding, which was specifically provided for Luas.  That money is lost to Luas because we are not going ahead with it within the allocated timeframe.  It may be provided under a new tranche of EU funding.  The Minister said it will be used for other purposes.</P>

      <P>Commentators are saying that if the tunnelling option goes ahead, there is an absence of specific plans, viability studies, geological surveys and detailed budgetary layout. <Col N="617" /> None of those has been given to us today to support why the Government has taken this decision. We do not know what the cost of the tunnelling will be, yet the Government is committed to taking this route.  It is saying the cost will be £400 million plus &mdash; plus what?  Queries have been raised about the wisdom of introducing a one mile stretch of underground and twenty miles of overground rail line, on the basis of the enormous extra cost and the inevitable delays in completing the project.</P>
      <P>Dr. Adrian Phillips, an associate Professor of Geology in Trinity College, Dublin, said that if the Government goes for the tunnelling option, the tunnel will have to run through bedrock where available and then across deposits of sand, gravel and boulder clay, or it will have to go deeper into bedrock below the original 45 metre deep Liffey riverbed. It is not a simple tunnel.  Both options present problems and will put the Luas tunnel under sea level.  Excavation will be liable to water seepage or possible flooding, particularly when cutting through gravel.</P>

      <P>These channels are deep down, well below sea level, and are in effect, very large water mains.  A professional geologist has said we do not know the cost of these proposals and we cannot quantify their impact.  However, what we do know is that Luas could start immediately if we went for the completely overground option but under this proposal it will not.  Judging by <i>The Irish Times</i> today, the Taoiseach is unsure when it will happen &mdash; he thinks there will be delays and it will not start before 2002.  In the same newspaper Dr. Garret FitzGerald wrote that the only advantage to be gained from tunnelling as opposed to digging up city centre streets would be a slight improvement in bus times, because they would not be slowed down by trams.  On this ground he questioned the logic of the Government's decision.  A better authority than any I have quoted is Mr. Frank McDonald.</P>

      <P>Mr. McDonald is our most important journalist on environmental matters. As I am sure Senator Norris will acknowledge, his stand on the demolition of Drogheda Grammar School was first class.  If I am looking for an authority on environmental issues I will turn to Mr. McDonald because he has tremendous credibility in this area.  He wrote that the Government's decision demonstrates there is no political will to take the hard and potentially unpopular decisions now required to begin sorting out Dublin's traffic problems.  It demonstrates that Ministers lack the courage to tread on the toes of vested interests.</P>
      <P>The Minister should reconsider what she has decided.  The newspapers reported that the Cabinet was split &mdash; the PD Ministers held one view and Fianna Fáil Ministers held another.  Luas will not now go ahead, which is a major catastrophe for the people of Dublin.  The dynamics of traffic management in the city have been put back by many years.  The Government should look again at this matter in the interests of the people of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily welcome the Government's decision.  A senior and long-established environmental journalist has criticised the Government for lack of courage but I take the opposite view.  When the Minister took office nine months ago she was faced with a proposal for a phased overground rail system which discriminated against many parts of the city.  She realised that many aspects of the proposals needed to be considered.  She decided to look at it carefully and call in consultants to evaluate it independently and objectively so that she would have more independent information to address her deep seated concerns.  I commended her action at the time and do so again today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am baffled by the anxiety of some spokespersons to see the main recommendations of a consultant's report agreed by the Cabinet and approved for implementation within an hour. This country is littered with major reports on the economy and the environment &mdash; this applies to all Governments We had the Culliton report and a report on the implementation of Culliton.  These reports were studied and the Governments of the day wisely pulled back from rushed implementation. Many of the proposals and suggestions in these reports were meritorious and successive Governments have taken on board these objectives. However, the major recommendation of one report on house prices was that mortgages should be taxed and if the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, had adopted that policy it would have been daft in the extreme.  He was wise enough to state on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the <Col N="619" /> proposal was a non-starter, and rightly so.  When asked to elaborate, he said that more properties needed to be released in an orderly way on the private house market.  In another report consultants concluded that the State examination system was basically sound at a time when boxes of examination papers were falling off lorries.  That knocks on the head the idea that we should rush to implement a consultant's report without due deliberation.  I congratulate the Minister for taking time to consider it.  This is a far bigger issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not implement something because it is the pet project of a particular party.  The issue is far bigger than any environmental journalist's ego.  The Minister recognised this and addressed the matter in a far more holistic and integrated fashion in the best interests of the nation.  The result of this is her decision, which I commend.  She did not go for the short-sighted populist option of grabbing the money while it was there.</P>
      <P>I commend her for extending the system on an integrated basis to Dublin Airport and Ballymun and for connecting Heuston and Connolly railway stations and Busáras.  If any system is to be worthwhile and to have a chance of being feasible in the medium to long term, it must be a fully integrated plan.  No one thought Luas would be the be all and end all or a panacea, it would be one element in an overall package of measures.  If it was to be workable it would have to be built into the existing network, as recommended by the report.</P>
      <P>People have said that Dublin has lost out because we did not follow the original proposals and Dublin people should condemn the Minister and the Government.  That is patent nonsense. The decision to ditch the phased version of Luas &mdash; the manner in which it was originally proposed for implementation &mdash; is in the long-term interests of Dublin.  The implications of proceeding with it would have been horrific in the short term and it would have been a national albatross in the long term.</P>

      <P>A decision to proceed with phase one on the southside of Dublin was blatantly unfair to the northside.  I challenge Labour Senators to state whether they agreed with it.  I never did and never will, so I am glad that provision has been removed.  I look forward to the comments of the Labour Party Members.  The first phase of Luas lacked co-ordination and integration. The absence of an underground system whereby work overground carried out exclusively <Col N="620" /> in the inner city, would have had a massive disrupting effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister considered it necessary to respond to the criticism that she gave in to vested interest groups in commerce and industry.  The heart and soul of Dublin in terms of its social integration and inclusiveness and its culture, sport and other aspects depend on a structure that facilitates not only these but also some of the elements that give them vibrancy &mdash; the industrial and commercial life of the city.  If these fail or are seriously damaged then, inevitably, integrative Dublin will suffer and eventually become seriously damaged.  If the Minister took the view that the industrial and commercial implications for the inner city were a serious consideration she was right.  We should not accept a policy because it was fully prepared or because £114 million of EU funding was available.  If we perceived that it would seriously impact on inner city Dublin and perhaps return us to the kind of blight and decay that preceded what is now &mdash; Senator Norris will confirm this &mdash; a thriving, if unfinished, rejuvenation, we should not condone and endorse a system because somebody's super ego wants it put in place immediately.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about finance and questions have been raised about how the Minister can justify losing £114 million.  It has been amply proven from her office, the Government and commentators that there are many projects within Dublin and throughout the country, adverted to in this House yesterday, where this money can be drawn down quickly.  The Minister is confident, and was from the outset, that we would not lose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions she referred to the fact that she carefully read the Seanad Official Report because they did have a certain importance.  In 1996 I put this matter down for my Private Members' time.  In the same year, the Dublin Transport (Light Rail) Bill was introduced when the Independent Senators held the balance of power.  An amendment in my name, supported by my colleagues, sought the specific inclusion of consideration of the underground option and was accepted.  That was a significant factor.  The practical consideration of this matter started in this House and I hope there will be a public record of this because frequently we hear that the Seanad is redundant and does not do anything.  Here is something very clear and practical which will affect the well being of the citizens of Dublin which did.  At that time I said we would defeat the Government on this matter if the amendment was not accepted and if an independent arbitrator was not established, and we got both.</P>
      <P>Unlike many of her critics, this clear sighted Minister has read the Atkins report.  When I first heard the reports on this matter I thought we had lost because what the media printed were the conclusions.  I believe Garret FitzGerald was right to describe the report as fascinating but whose conclusions were vitiated by the timidity that was displayed.  All the evidence went on our side of the argument, but for short-term financial reasons the authors of the report felt constrained to make its recommendations because it expected the Government to be pennypinching.</P>
      <P>Frank McDonald is a dear friend of mine.  He is a superb journalist and has done tremendous work for the city of Dublin.  One of his headlines in <i>The Irish Times</i> referred to the underground option for light rail: &ldquo;Tunnelling CIE's light rail project through Dublin would have a devastating impact on city centre streets&rdquo;.  I hope he reads the Atkins report because, on balance, it comes out unquestionably in favour of the underground option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  With regard to disruption, the Atkins report says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surface scheme is likely to have a more general impact over a wider area of the city centre.  There will be lane closures of some <Col N="622" /> roads, increased delays at junctions and temporary bus routes, bus stops and footpaths.</P>
    <P>The financial appraisal is the only criteria in the report in which there is a decision in favour of the overground option.  It states: &ldquo;In the long-term economic analysis, the underground option is significantly better.&rdquo;.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;over the life of the scheme the underground option provides net benefits (economic NPV) of £1,136m compared with £980m for the surface option.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In terms of development, the report states: &ldquo;The underground option is likely to provide beneficial impacts for land use development at a small number of key sites, for example, Tara Street in the city centre.&rdquo;.  In terms of capacity and comfort the report is clear:</P>
    <P>The underground option will be able to carry more people in greater comfort than a surface scheme and because of the benefits it brings to road users, the underground will almost certainly provide a better rate of return in terms of the wider social costs and benefits, though both options are viable in economic terms.</P>
    <P>This is what ordinary people are interested in &mdash; speed, safety and comfort.  The report comes down unequivocally on the side of the underground option.</P>
    <P>In Seanad debates we demonstrated, with the assistance of people like Garret FitzGerald, that, given the length of the vehicles, the capacity of the proposed Luas could not possibly cope with the numbers of passengers it was claimed it would deal with.  It was then suggested that the length of vehicles would be increased from 30 metres to 40 metres and then almost doubled to 50 metres. Try to imagine 50 metre long vehicles passing across O'Connell Bridge approximately one every minute.  Even allowing for this, the Atkins report admits that there would be a possibility that they could miss a time slot, requiring their storage in Abbey Street and Dawson Street. What a lovely prospect to have gigantic 50 metre behemoths of trams whizzing across the city &mdash; they cannot get across because there are so many of them &mdash; and stuck in Dawson Street and Abbey Street.  It is astonishing that people seem to think this is a good idea.</P>
    <P>In terms of the construction in the city centre, the Minister has not been warm enough in her self congratulations.  She was told she was gutless in bending to economic pressures from vested interests.  There were plenty of vested interests on the other side, including the shrill voice of Tom Coffey and city centre business people.</P>
    <P>According to the Atkins report, the construction of the LRT will involve enabling works and demolition, utility diversions, excavations, earthworks, formation, trackbase and roadbase, tracklaying, surfacing and carriagway finishes, and overhead electrification and installation of operating equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> There will be further disruption.  The report indicates that the level of impact on general city centre road traffic after the system is put in will be broadly similar to the impact of the scheme in operation.  In other words, we will suffer through for three or four years and the net benefit will be disruption forever.  How lovely.  That must delight Mr. Frank MacDonald.  I know he is devoted to his bicycle and, although I cycle myself, I do not see why we should all have to follow along regardless of our physical capacities or ages.</P>
    <P>According to the Atkins report the underground option offers faster journey speeds to the city centre than the surface option and a higher capacity.  It also indicates that the underground option offers a potentially higher level of comfort. Speed, comfort and road safety &mdash; the advantages that Independent Senators were decried for setting out.  The Atkins report states:</P>
    <P>The underground option has clear advantages over the surface option in terms of reducing conflict between LRT and road traffic and pedestrians within the City Centre, and the associated risks of accidents.</P>
    <P>We were right again.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, either scheme will reduce the proportion of those travelling by car by 1 per cent, but at least with the underground system one has the option to go underground through the creation of a different level.  Senator Quinn telephoned me and asked me to make this specific point, citing the experience in Chicago.  Again the underground option wins out.  The report points out that the operating efficiency of the underground option increases with growth in demand.</P>
    <P>The argument was made that people, in particular women, are afraid to go into underground stations.  The Atkins report states:</P>
    <P>The findings suggest that the experiences that make people feel intimidated could apply to either surface or underground options. Indeed it could be argued that encountering the intimidatory effect of rowdy behaviour by young people is more likely to be experienced at an on-street stop particularly if it is located close to a public house, club etc.</P>
    <P>Dublin has many such premises.  Once again, we win out.</P>
    <P>The report then turns to considerations of the environment, so beloved of Senator O'Dowd.  I apologise for interrupting the Senator, but in undergraduate university debates one is only protected by the chair when one is a maiden speaker exercising one's rights.</P>

      <P>The report states: &ldquo;The surface option is more environmentally intrusive as a <Col N="624" /> result of the noise of the light rail vehicles and the visual intrusion of the overhead wiring.&rdquo; I recommend that the opponents of the Government's courageous decision read this report.  I am reminded of a day I spent in the High Court before Mr. Justice McWilliams arguing the case for the decriminalisation of homosexual behaviour between consenting male adults.  The judge accepted our argument point after point, but in the end told us we had lost nevertheless. There is a similar tendency with the Atkins report.  However, we are lucky to have had a courageous and far-sighted female Minister, who ran with the inevitable logic of the case that had been made and, despite criticism, implemented what was necessary.</P>
      <P>We need to be reassured that this is not an attempt to derail the project.  We must show commitment and get the project implemented.  We must not penny pinch.  The Atkins report refers to the costs involved in the stations and the level of decoration.  This is a capital city and we should seek the best, like Paris or London, where Irish workers have slaved.  Let them come back to work in their own city, to beautify it and to make it fit for decent people to live in.</P>

      <P>I cannot think of a major project in the State's history which has generated as much controversy as the Luas proposal.  Unfortunately, for much of the time the debate has been waged with more heat than light.  The proponents of the fully on-street option have been almost messianic in their zeal to run the system overground through the city centre.  Among them is a certain journalist who has abandoned any pretence of objectivity on this issue.  A prominent Labour Party politician asserted that running any part of Luas underground would rule his party out of participation in a future Government.</P>

      <P>It is worth highlighting the major advantages of the Government's plan compared with the proposal of the previous Government.  This new plan serves the north and south sides of Dublin; the previous proposal served only the south side.  The new plan is fully integrated with the DART; the previous proposal allowed for no integration with the DART.  The new plan provides full integration with the mainline and suburban rail network; the previous proposal allowed only limited interconnections with mainline and suburban rail. The Government's plan will mean that Heuston Station, Connolly Station, Busáras, Dublin Airport and Dún Laoghaire ferryport will be linked by a single rail network for the first time in the State's history.  That is what I call an integrated transport system.</P>
      <P>There are great advantages for Dubliners.  In a few years it will be possible to travel by fast and reliable rail service from Sandyford to Dublin Airport, from Tallaght to Malahide and from Bray to Ballymun.  The new network will revolutionise public transport in the capital.</P>

However, as we have heard, an examination of the new plan indicates that the Atkins findings have been taken into consideration.  The cost benefit analysis undertaken in the report showed that the underground option would deliver more social and economic benefits to Dublin.  Sections 14.8 and 14.9 of the report have received little attention from the media and the Opposition. They deal with the issue of extending the original and limited Luas proposal into a citywide network.</P>
      <P>Section 14.8 states:</P>
      <P>The underground option is not expected to experience any difficulty in accommodating the increased demands associated with an extended network until well after 2030.</P>
      <P>Section 14.9 states:</P>
      <P>[When the on-street option is extended to the whole city] the system becomes increasingly complex to operate, with a number of merging routes causing potential delays as vehicles [that is, trams] become delayed through waiting at junctions</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section indicates that demand starts to approach line capacity, particularly on the city centre sections where the maximum number of vehicles per hour is effectively constrained by changes in the traffic lights.  Dubliners would not thank the Government for building a system that <Col N="626" /> replaced car congestion with tram congestion, or &ldquo;carriage jams&rdquo; as Senator Finneran called them. That would hardly be a solution to the city's transport problems.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Atkins study that if there was a serious political intent to construct a city-wide network the city centre section would have to be run underground.  The Government has taken that message on board.</P>
    <P>The question of the timescale is very important. It is assumed by opponents of the Government's plan that it will be held up for years with public inquires and that legal objections may cause lengthy delays.  The same people assumed that the existing Luas proposal would sail through the same process without a hitch.  Neither assumption can be made.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice O'Leary is free to make his own decisions.  Any company or individual along the route has recourse to the courts to have their grievances addressed.  The possibility of legal objections to any part of the system cannot be ruled out, as everyone knows.  Another key component of the DTI strategy, the Southern Cross Motorway, was held up for years by a small group of objectors to the intense annoyance and inconvenience of south side motorists.</P>
    <P>The issue of personal safety has also arisen in this debate, and Senator Norris quoted the section I was about to quote.  There had been an argument that underground stations were dangerous and that on-street stations would be inherently safer.  The Atkins report states that people would be more intimidated by those coming out of pubs late at night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a woman, I failed to find any solace in the argument made by advocates of an above ground system.  They argued that women would feel insecure on an underground section.  I have travelled on many underground rail systems around the world, including London, which has more than 100 underground stations.  I felt safer there below ground than over ground because of the security measures in those stations.  It is easier to monitor and police underground stations, though Luas will probably have only two such stations in any case.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt openly with the red herring of EU funding.  The Opposition knows that proceeding with the Government plan will mean no loss of EU funding, so that argument is gone.  If the £114 million originally committed to Luas is no longer available for that project, as a Dublin person I feel it could be spent on other Dublin transport projects.  However, that money has already been drawn down all over the country. There will be no loss to Dublin or the country.</P>

      <P>Either.  There are several worthy public transport projects which could get the go ahead.  Extending the DART from Connolly Station along the Sligo line to Maynooth should be a priority because it would improve the transport links between Dublin and the rapidly growing north Kildare region.  Part of the money could go into upgrading Dublin's bus fleet.  There are still 17 and 18 year old vehicles in service which belch fumes all over the city.  How is that for pollution? Those vehicles are neither customer friendly nor environmentally friendly.  The Luas plan gives us the chance to explore innovative ways of financing major public transport projects. I was particularly gladdened by the Minister's reference to the possibility of private financing for public infrastructure.  The Government should encourage private sector provision of such services. We have already seen the benefits of this approach with the West and East Link Bridges, and private financing initiatives could be feasible for all or part of the new LRT network.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a bold, imaginative step that will provide Dublin with a state of the art integrated light rail transit system to serve the needs of the city well into the next millennium. Of all her political decisions, this may be the lasting tribute to her; it may even outlast her.</P>

      <P>After years of dithering, no practical or realistic proposals are yet in place to address Dublin's chronic transport problems.  The President of the Royal Institute of Architects stated in a recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> that the suburban rail system is one year behind schedule, the quality bus corridors are two years behind and the port tunnel and completion of the C-Ring Motorway are four years behind.  The Government's Luas decision means these have been put back indefinitely and it is unlikely that I will see the completion of this proposal in my lifetime.  I doubt there will be any Progressive Democrats at the launch of the underground system either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin suffers from traffic congestion, but there are implications beyond congestion for efficient business and frustration for shoppers.  Continued dependence on private cars results in noise and air pollution and causes significant damage to the general quality of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to understand how the Government is opting for a short tunnel in the centre of Dublin which has been rejected by the principal recommendations of the Atkins report.  The Government has decided to go along with a scheme specifically rejected by the independent consultants in their £200,000 review.  The Government <Col N="628" /> has come up with a nightmare proposal which many will never see.  The Minister is on record as stating that the city centre underground section linking Stephen's Green with Broadstone was intended to address the scale of construction associated with the on-street system and the potential long term road capacity constraints in the central area.  However, the Government was committed to the implementation of the full DTI strategy, including the traffic management elements planned by Dublin Corporation to reduce the level of traffic in central areas.  The Atkins report lays heavy weight on Dublin Corporation's proposals and I feel that that body's traffic plans had a big influence on the final decisions reached in the Atkins report.</P>
    <P>Even with an underground system there will substantial disruption, as stated by Dr Adrian Philips, Associate Professor at the Department of Geology in Trinity College.  There is no way of determining tunnelling costs, though to get information one needs to drill holes.  This would be very difficult and expensive.  To bore holes successfully, drilling must be done in the streets, which will cause serious traffic problems.  The tunnel would be unlikely to follow the line of the street on the proposed route from Stephen's Green to Broadstone, which means drilling on private property.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with building underground stations.  I was sympathetic to an underground system at one stage and spoke in the Seanad in favour of it.  It was then brought to my attention that drilling bore holes and building stations would cause further disruption, because a station would have to be built from the roadway down.  One can imagine the disruption this would cause in O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the Government proposals, such as the decision to proceed with the original Tallaght-O'Connell Street line and to extend this to Connolly Station is particularly welcome as it will ensure the integration of Luas, DART, the mainline rail stations and the interprovincial bus services.  Dublin Corporation is undertaking the regeneration of Ballymun, and the extension of the LRT line to the area underpins that regeneration. I also welcome the extension of the light rail line to the airport; this addresses a major deficiency in the transport infrastructure serving the airport.  As a member of the Dublin Docklands Authority, I welcome the further extension of Luas to the docklands area and hope that development of the line can proceed without due delay.</P>
    <P>The revised Luas plan will lose £114 million allocated by the EU under the 1994-99 National Plan.  The Minister has said that that money will not be lost completely to Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it can be used for other transport projects.  When news broke yesterday <Col N="629" /> that £114 million was to become available, my fellow Senators were quick to indicate where they felt it should be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I told them to keep their grubby hands off the money.  It is Dublin's money and it will be spent in Dublin.  I explained that Luas was only one of the many components that is meant to solve Dublin's traffic problems.  If the money was lost to Luas, initiatives aimed at tackling Dublin's chronic traffic problems should be considered. Many of these initiatives are in train and if others were put in train they would go a long way to solving Dublin's traffic problems in the short term.</P>
      <P>The introduction of quality bus corridors is one such initiative.  One such corridor exists from Lucan to Dublin city centre, and a recent survey showed that 53 per cent of motorists are using that service and leaving their cars at home.  If that happens with the other ten corridors that are proposed, there would be a huge effect on Dublin's traffic.  Infrastructural funding should be given to Dublin Corporation for the other quality bus corridors; I understand it would cost £10 million.  In order for the quality bus corridors to be successful Dublin Bus will have to invest heavily in rolling stock.  As Senator Keogh said, there is no point in having quality bus corridors without having efficient, clean rolling stock.  Such provision would cost in the region of £30 million, which would be a very good investment to help Dublin's traffic problems in the short term.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council is also engaged in creating six environmental traffic cells, two of which have been completed, at a cost of roughly £10 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Traffic cells.  It is also essential to get new buses for the quality bus corridors.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation is also committed to the early implementation of various measures which the Government has accepted as essential to the successful implementation of the Luas development. These include the construction of the Macken Street bridge, the Mercer Street link, the Cork Street/Coombe bypass and the North King Street route, together with the development of the network of environmental traffic cells.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, I welcome the Government's approval of these projects and I hope the necessary financing, estimated at £45 million, will be available from the Luas fund.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has also invested heavily in traffic signalling, including the SCAT system which cost £5 million.  We have also invested in cycle lanes.  Many people will cycle to work if they have a safe place on the road.  I ask the Minister to finance the provision of such lanes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that £114 million, or the best part of it, was invested in Dublin it would go some way towards <Col N="630" /> relieving Dublin's traffic problems.  I ask the Minister to make funding for Dublin traffic a priority.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on a job of work well done yesterday and the day before. The decision which she and the Government made is courageous and farseeing and its benefit will continue to be realised long after she and I have departed the scene.  I am very glad someone at last has a visionary transport policy for this city.  The old streets and infrastructure have been unable to cope with the rapid expansion and development of the city over the past 20 years. As Senator Costello knows, we have been waiting in the north east inner city for North King Street to be widened for 35 years; Senator Costello has probably been working on it for much longer than I have as he is much older than me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never going to be possible to come up with a concept which would address this problem in four or five years.  However, I do not take issue with the people who felt the need to oppose this decision because people have a democratic right to voice an opinion even if it is the wrong one.</P>
      <P>We must remind ourselves how long this process has taken.  We received EU approval for the funding in 1993 but not a sod has been turned since then because of public inquiry mechanisms and democratic objections by small groups.  It was nonsense to say the old Luas plan was going to be completed by 2002.  Anyone who knows anything about public transport will recognise this plan is a long-term strategy.</P>
      <P>Traffic in Dublin has grown at an unprecedented rate and more rapidly than was anticipated when the Dublin Transport Initiative prepared its policy framework.  This is mainly due to our unprecedented economic growth and slower infrastructural investment than was anticipated. The Dublin transportation office is nearing completion of a review of the DTI strategy and is examining what interim measures can be taken to address this difficult transport situation, with the primary focus on the management measures which can be implemented quickly.  A considerable amount of important work is currently in progress in the city on the existing public transport network which, we hope, will contribute towards easing the current chronic traffic congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister announced yesterday the Government had decided to proceed with the first phase of the light rail network for Dublin.  There will be a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station, which is based on the CIE preferred alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street and is consistent with the surface option recommended in the Atkins report.  The other line is from Sandyford <Col N="631" /> to Ballymun and on to the airport, using the old Harcourt Street and Broadstone railway alignments. It will have an underground section in the city, linking the three alignments.</P>
    <P>The two proposed lines are part of a longer term vision for an extended light rail network serving, as the Minister mentioned, destinations such as Swords, the docklands and Clondalkin. This is similar to the extended network considered by Atkins and is consistent with the DTI vision.  I am delighted the Government has an objective to proceed without delay with the construction of the Tallaght, city centre, Sandyford and St. Stephen's Green sections, subject to relevant statutory procedures.</P>
    <P>The decision taken by the Minister yesterday clears the way for the light rail project.  It addresses key public concerns about disruption during construction and the longer term passenger capacity of the network.  Yesterday was a good day for Dublin public transport.  The decisions taken by the Minister will be seen to have been in the long term interests of the capital's transport system and economy.</P>
    <P>The city centre's underground section of the Sandyford-Ballymun-Dublin Airport line will address two important issues which were raised in the Atkins report &mdash; the scale of disruption during construction on key city centre streets and the potential longer term capacity constraints in the central area when the city is uprooted.  The proposed network will also provide a direct light rail link between two mainline railway stations, Heuston and Connolly.  It will also integrate with the DART service at Connolly Station and provide for easy interchange with provincial buses at Busáras.  It revitalises two disused rail alignments, Harcourt Street and Broadstone, and provides a direct rail link to Dublin Airport.  The Minister is to be commended on all those measures.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the conclusions of the Atkins report, the Minister also reaffirmed the commitment to the implementation of the DTI's transport strategy, particularly the traffic management elements.  In this regard, the Minister gave the go ahead for environmental traffic cells in the city, which Senator Doyle mentioned.  She also approved three road projects which were identified as essential for effective traffic management in the city.  These are the Macken Street bridge, the Cork Street/Coombe relief route and a minor scheme at Mercer Street.</P>
    <P>The decision taken by the Minister on Luas shows she is determined to take practical and effective steps to deal with Dublin's traffic problems, for which we thank her as Dublin councillors and Senators.  However, the light rail project is only one element of the Dublin transport strategy recommended by the DTI.  The proposed light rail system will account for only three of the public transport corridors in the city, the others being the 11 quality bus corridors and the three DART suburban rail corridors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> We must recognise the contribution quality bus corridors can make to the overall public transport system.  Bus services will remain the backbone of the existing public transport network, notwithstanding the development of the light rail system. The implementation of quality bus corridors is being pursued by Dublin Bus and the local authorities, with the active support of the Dublin transportation office.  Dublin Bus is also upgrading its fleet and working on the suburban rail development programme, which is also compatible with the DTI strategy and will ensure the best use of all existing rail assets.  On the DART line, this includes the extension to Greystones and Malahide, the acquisition of new rolling stock, the improvement of existing stations and the development of new stations.</P>
    <P>The Dublin traffic situation presents us with a major challenge.  The DTI strategy provides the policy framework within we must work.  Through its membership of the consultative panel of the Dublin transportation office, the Chamber of Commerce has played an important role in the review of the DTI strategy.  However, it is important to make progress on all fronts.  The recent Luas debate has shown us that no one item of investment will provide the solution.  We have to improve our transport system.  We also have to tackle traffic management in a more effective way.  The challenge is for all of us &mdash; public authorities, businesses and local residents.  We have to work together to solve this common problem.  We should seek to find a solution rather than be hung up on the enormity of the problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister has put a great deal of energy into this plan and it looks brilliant on paper.  However, there is only one issue which concerns me.  I once worked for a man who said: &ldquo;If you ever want to block something, you say it is so good it must be made even bigger and you expand it so much that eventually it is impossible to do&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Senator O'Dowd have been throwing Latin phrases around.  Perhaps I could throw in some French.  The Minister may remember the Edith Piaf song &ldquo;<i>Je Ne Regrette Rien</i>&rdquo;.  I am afraid that we are going to <i>regrette rien</i> and nothing will be done.  The scheme is extremely imaginative but it is so big that there will be a temptation for enormous delays.  I am relying on the Minister to deliver on the objectives she has put forward.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this issue has become party political.  We have appalling congestion in the city and the pollution problem is terrible.  Every day the EU standards on car emissions <Col N="633" /> are broken.  We have a serious problem on our hands and the faster we deal with it the better. Party political in-fighting is not going to get us far.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge amount of debate on whether the Luas should be underground or overground. However, the underground section is pathetically small &mdash; only 2.5 kilometres.  My colleagues in Trinity &mdash; Professor Adrian Phillips of the Department of Geology and Professor Simon Perry of the Department of Environmental Engineering &mdash; have made public their concerns about the tunnelling problem.  It will be possible to build this tunnel.  It will be difficult and expensive but it will be possible.  However, while we are tunnelling north-south, we are left with the situation where the east-west section is overground. While I concede that the disruption may be halved there is still going to be a considerable amount of disruption.</P>
      <P>We are not building the Washington underground even though I would like to see us building such a state of the art system.  We have a problem in that we are building two different systems &mdash; one going north-south and one east-west. These systems will be on different levels and there will be escalators and lifts to bring people up and down.  However, will we need different types of rolling stock?  Rolling stock required for underground is not the same as that for overground. There does not seem to be a physical link between the north-south and the east-west axes. Will we need different servicing depots?  It is important to take these cost implications into account.</P>
      <P>The problem in Dublin is that the transport system is not integrated.  This is not the Minister's fault and I appreciate Senator Doyle's comments on bus corridors, cycle lanes etc.  If Dublin councillors can do anything to quell the resistance to these measures they would be doing us a great service.</P>
      <P>The Minister must do her utmost to ensure that work on the Tallaght to Heuston station line begins as soon as possible.  The grand plan is there and pessimists like me will question when it will be completed.  However, pieces of that plan can be brought on stream as soon as possible.  There is no problem regarding legislation for the Tallaght to Heuston station line.  There would be very little disruption involved in getting people as far as Heuston station and buses could be used to complete the journey from there.  People are buying cars and increasing congestion so that they can work on the Sandyford estate.  It is ridiculous that there is no public transport servicing this route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can also proceed easily with the Ballymun line.  The grand plan is great and the Minister will not have to deal with it as it is a long way down the road.  However, while she is Minister, she should go full speed ahead so that we do not paraphrase Edith Piaf.  She should try to ensure that work on the various links begins as soon as <Col N="634" /> possible.  I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me if the north-south and east-west lines will meet?</P>

The main entrances to Dublin city are Connolly and Heuston stations, Dublin airport and the ferry ports.  However, there are no fast connections between any of these sites.  New York is the only other major city that does not have a rail connection to its airport &mdash; JFK.</P>
      <P>We need to do something about our traffic problem and the rapid, safe and comfortable movement of people around the city.  As proposed, Luas was one of the more lunatic schemes which was to be visited upon the long-suffering and unsuspecting citizens of Dublin.  No one could overplay the disruption which the original plan would have caused.</P>
      <P>Many of the points I wished to make have already been made by other Senators.  Senator Norris painted an horrific picture of cycling to the House and being passed by a 15-metre long tram travelling at speed.  As a cyclist, I can empathise with that feeling.  The only way to get around the city is on a bicycle, which I use on a daily basis.  It is only when riding a bicycle and one is passed by a 40 foot lorry that the pull it exerts is realised.  If the cyclist is not already blinded by a shower of rain from the lorry, it will splash the cyclist instead.  A cycle lane is only safe if it is physically separated from other traffic, something which is not being done with many of the cycle lanes being built in the city.  The lane outside the Four Courts is two feet wide and the traffic passing by is so fast it can pull cyclists towards it.  The only consolation is that if a cyclist knocked down in front of the Four Courts, there is sufficient legal expertise to prosecute his or her claim before they even reach the casualty ward in the hospital.</P>
      <P>As regards quality bus corridors, it drives the citizenry mad to sit in their cars and see an empty quality bus corridor beside them.  If Dublin Bus is serious about quality bus corridors, it must put buses on them to move the people around quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for that and will bear it in mind.  It is not realised that Dublin Corporation does not have accurate maps of the underground services in the city, so it is not unusual for a JCB operator to drill into a major water main which was not mapped or for a telecommunications tunnel or gas mains to be broken because they were not mapped either.  The old city streets are not properly mapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to answer one question when she replies.  She said the Government has set the project planners a clear objective of proceeding without delay on the Tallaght, city centre and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green <Col N="636" /> sections.  Does that mean work will begin on those as soon as possible while the planning for the other sections of the line is proceeding?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I was told the standard of debate in the Seanad was high and I can well believe it. We have gone from Horace to Edith Piaf in one fell swoop with no &ldquo;Luas&rdquo; talking and not a tram in sight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is present and congratulate her on this announcement. I was confident when she took on this role that she would make it her own and that she was &ldquo;not for bending&rdquo;.  She allowed the Cabinet consider the matter and to come to a decision.  It is the best one which could have been made given the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The integrated approach is welcome.  The utilisation of the asset of the Harcourt Street line, the link with Connolly Station and the DART and the future link with the airport are welcome.  No one denies that there will be problems with the underground option but it is better to have it underground, causing less disruption and allowing it to last for generations to come by giving it the capacity to expand rather than the short-term, piecemeal approach adopted previously. It is the only way to go.</P>
      <P>I spoke with many people in my area of Dublin south and they were grateful it was going underground. I am pleased that decision was made.  If the Southern Cross and the East Link routes, which complete the ring road around Dublin and which are under way, are integrated with the bus corridors and the new light rail system, the public will see that we are implementing a programme which, although it is long-term, they know we can make work.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government for taking this decision.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for attending at such short notice.  The Minister painted a rosy picture.  It was as though a new, improved, bigger and better brand had been presented instead of the grandiose scheme which was presented.  The Minister is almost like a fairy godmother who will wave her wand for it all to fall into place.  She has not given us any indication of costings.  She stated it would cost £400 million plus.  The plus is defined in terms of additional funding, which is not a scientific definition.  She has given us no timescale and has described it as irresponsible to seek such until test drill holes have been made in the geological strata.  Only then will there be a timescale.  No planning has taken place for the new measures. In many ways it is back to the future.  These are the proposals of the DTI which were published in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The plan may look lovely, but because it is so much bigger and better, it may never be started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The Minister is a practical woman who stated she would accept the recommendations of the Atkins report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but she did not accept them. The report recommended a certain approach.  I did not mind whether the line went over or underground.  However, the Minister introduced just about everything into her proposal and the danger is that nothing will be done because it contains so much and because there is something in it for everyone in it, but no money, timescale or plans.  This is a political cop out.</P>
      <P>There is enormous gridlock in the city and, as a result, Dublin Corporation has appointed a Director of Traffic to deal with it.  There is huge emphasis on quality bus corridors, cycle lanes and traffic environmental cells.  The towaway and clamping functions have been taken from the Garda so that the overall traffic plan will be integrated when it is implemented.  The corporation has a mainframe computer to collate data from traffic cameras which have been located throughout the city.  The last thing needed now is any further delay or controversy.  The greatest danger is that we could now be entering a new period of delay and controversy.  It is not known whether the public inquiry can continue because it is not known whether the terms of reference of the ministerial order are applicable to the new plan.  We must wait for the presiding judge to determine that because it is a judicial function to decide whether it can proceed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come up with various suggestions for financing the project.  We heard yesterday that the semi-State sector might be sold to pay for it.  Now we hear the private sector could be involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main fact is that the £114 million which was promised is now lost to Luas.  Will that <Col N="638" /> money be spent on traffic improvements in Dublin, such as new buses and new rolling stock for railways, on improving the suburban rail lines and on improving the corporation's traffic plans?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the debate cannot continue, but I understand the reasons.  The Minister said the £114 million funding which is lost to Luas will be spent in the greater Dublin area.  This will be the death knell for the western railway line.  The Minister was a member of a previous Fianna Fáil Government which did not include the western route from her own town, Athlone, to Westport and from Manulla to Ballina in the Structural Funds for 1994-5.  Will the Minister give a commitment to give £40 million of the £114 million lost to Luas to upgrade the western railway line from Westport to Athlone and from Ballina to Manulla?  It takes four and a half hours to travel by train from Ballina to Dublin and vice versa.  This is a major issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the morning when all the traffic is coming into the city, it is commonsense that there should be an extra lane inward bound &mdash; three lanes inwards and one outwards.  In the afternoon at 3.30 p.m., will the Minister consider three lanes outward bound and one lane inward bound?  This has been successful in most cities of Dublin's size.  The problem with Luas will go on for another year or two until the lines are laid. As a person of the north inner city, I agree with Senator Norris.  I know Senator Costello in his heart is pleased this has happened.  I thank the Taoiseach and Senator Kett for the great work they have done in getting the Minister, her team and advisers to agree to this.  I would like to see three lanes inward bound on all major routes in <Col N="639" /> the morning and three lanes outward bound in the evening.  Is this possible?</P>

      <P>I understand there is the possibility that a Japanese consortium is interested in tendering for this on the basis that it would be very advantageous for this country were it to take into account a 30 year franchise.  Is this being actively explored and will it go out to tender?  We would not have reached this stage without the wonderful work of Cormac Rabbitte and Rudi Monaghan.  I will not say they were exactly hungry but any time they were in the House to brief me and I offered them lunch, they jumped at the offer. W.S. Atkins shrewdly varied the proposed underground part which cut them out of the copyright. I hope that as a reward for this extraordinary work and because of their acknowledged expertise, a role will be found for these remarkable people who selflessly dedicated themselves to promoting the interests which the Minister and I agree are essential for the city of Dublin.</P>

I preface my brief questions by referring to my genuine sense of disillusionment as a native Dub.  The Taoiseach said he would not let this happen to his city; it is not only his city, it is my city as well.</P>
      <P>On the disbursement of the funds which will not go to the light rail project, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has approved money for the servicing of land in south Lucan for 5,000 houses.  There is a railway station in south Lucan and it needs to be opened.  I am not being parochial in this matter but am trying to face up to reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be about 12,000 new houses and the same road will be used.  As we will not see Luas in the immediate future, will there be a realistic assessment of how public transport could take cars off the road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On accessing the proposed new underground system, neither I nor the Minister are engineers so I will not talk about boring blind tunnels.  Will we have to use elevators to get to the second level line in O'Connell Street?  I am disappointed because the principle behind light rail was to provide accessibility for the mobility impaired, women with prams and the elderly.  I maintain that nobody in their right mind would go down a tunnel to get on a train or bore a hole in Dublin. Will the Minister offer support to those who have been waiting &mdash; for example, the mobility impaired &mdash; to be able to access public transport? This is a grave need and I do not know how it will be accomplished in the new plans which will have to be supplied instead of the Luas.  The <Col N="640" /> benefit of Luas was that everyone could access it even if they were in a wheelchair, wheeling a pram or on a stick.  It was a wonderful system from that point of view.  I have been on the DTI for six years and I expect to be on the old age pension before I access anything at the rate this is progressing.</P>

      <P>I do not have this money.  Over the past two days Deputies and Senators have telephoned and waylaid me and asked for money for various projects.  I do not have that money which would fall to be drawn down through the Department of Finance and the Commission.  The mid-term review will be on 20 June and also the decommittal of that money to worthy projects. There are approximately four times more projects than those for which there is money.  There is a huge demand for that money and I repeat it will not be lost to Ireland.  Last July I said on television and radio that no matter what the outcome of the Atkins review and that as time was constrained, it would be better to act in time and put the money to other projects rather than wait until it was too late and lose the money to Ireland.</P>

If any money is secured from these funds, it will be a further bonus.  This is a happy position in view of all that has happened.</P>

The Senator asked about Mitsui.  It has not made any formal written or verbal approach to my Department. The Senator also asked about Rudi Monaghan and his colleagues.  They have put a huge amount of voluntary effort into this matter and I hope I will be in a position to meet them soon.  I said during a previous debate that I would meet them and that meeting took place.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge mentioned the funds and the areas in which they might be spent.  She also mentioned south Lucan and said that money had been provided to service land in the area for new houses.  She said this development will cause increased commuter traffic and she asked if the south Lucan railway station could be reopened as it would be of great benefit.  I will consider the Senator's suggestion.  People are concerned about Dublin traffic but in many cases commuting traffic to Dublin causes much of the disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators are either members of Dublin Corporation or the county councils and they are aware that the cause of the delays in road schemes and the port tunnel project is that people want their say.  I note the strong support for the quality bus corridors.  However, the will of the people is also holding up the opening of more corridors which would make a huge difference.  If <Col N="642" /> all the corridors were in operation, they would far outweigh the benefits of Luas.</P>

In the city centre there will be an underground north-south link but there is no underground element in the east-west service.  Enormous difficulties have already arisen regarding that proposal because it means all the houses in Arran Quay Terrace must be demolished and the entire road will be eliminated.

Is it possible to start the suburban elements of the project immediately so that the work can be seen to have begun?

Senator Costello spoke in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday morning about the needs of north Dublin.  I appreciate his comments and I reciprocate them because I am aware of the constraints he faces in terms of his party's position and the practicalities of the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry asked about the two lines.  They will be separate and have two separate maintenance depots.  Interchange will be provided in the city centre and it is important to ensure that this is as efficient as possible.  The precise location of the interchange section will be decided as part of the technical evaluation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge mentioned elevators to the underground section of the service.  The Atkins report contains a section about mobility which deals with the right of access of disabled people. The report makes helpful and open suggestions about how that might be achieved in regard to the underground part of the system.  I am happy this element is covered in the report.  The Atkins report also deals with women using the underground part of the service.  The Senator said she did not think women would travel underground. However, any time I was in London I saw thousands of women using the underground system. This is also the case in Paris and many other cities.</P>

      <P>Senator Burke again mentioned the western rail line and I acknowledge his tenacity.  Many other Members share the Senator's point of view. However, I am not responsible for dishing out the £114 million.  The Department of Finance and the European Commission will have that task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> However, we are making a strong case for public transport and commuter routes into Dublin.  We will put forward a proposal for a western line but how that is received is another matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd asked about the number of underground stations and it is anticipated that there will be three.  The length of the track will be 2.5 kilometres, so we are not talking about the Channel Tunnel.  Legitimate concerns were expressed in this House by Members of all parties during the previous Seanad about the city centre and the possibility of it remaining out of order forever.  These proposals are similar to the original ones and we are continuing with them.  There are enhanced additions to Connolly Station, Ballymun and North Dublin and we have allowed for a reawakening of Harcourt Street and Broadstone. We have allowed for a rounded, comprehensive light rail system.  Quality bus corridors and other issues raised are part of making Dublin more traffic free.  This is only one small element and I hope the other House will acknowledge how a good debate can develop.  I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and all Senators who contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, for coming to the House and I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter.  The latest report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee confirms that the prison system is in an appalling state.  The report paints a grim picture of conditions within the prison walls. There is a population of 740 at times in a prison built for 450, increased drug taking and a higher incidence of violence, depression and the spread of infectious illness.  The report concludes that approximately 100 prisoners should be in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It raises other alarming issues which provide plenty of food for thought.  Significantly, in the context of this issue, the report talks about the near despair of the Governor at the lack of response to these reports by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I have to stress here what people often refer to as the &ldquo;permanent <Col N="645" /> government&rdquo; and the Department is very culpable in this regard.  In any democratic society the prison service has a vital role to play in combating crime and protecting the citizen.  Along with the courts and the Garda it is one of three legs on which our system of law and order stands. Failure in any area threatens the entire structure.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with the commitment contained in &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; to establish an independent prisons authority and a prisons inspectorate.  There are major problems with regard to public accountability of our prison system.  Nobody knows who runs it and there is no in-depth analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of the service.  No indicators are set down against which management performance can be assessed.  There are serious questions about the strategic management of the service.  It has failed to respond to the sharp increase in serious crime over recent years and to the changing nature in crime, particularly the impact of drug abuse on criminality.</P>
    <P>A major programme of reform is needed which would set as key objectives improved management, efficiency, accountability and standards of prisoner welfare and rehabilitation.  This is not to take away from the Minister's commitment to additional prison spaces.  We are talking about the way the system is run.  The Progressive Democrats Party has long held the view that reforms cannot take place within current structures.  We wish to see the establishment of an executive agency which would be autonomous and wholly independent of the Department.  The head of the new agency could be directly accountable to the Oireachtas Committee on Legislation and Security. Of course, the Minister would retain responsibility for overall prisons policy.</P>
    <P>The delegation of certain tasks to executive agencies makes eminent sense.  We will soon see the establishment of the independent courts service and I have no doubt this will do immeasurable good for the administration of justice.  I am not sure that is overwhelmingly embraced by the Department.  The same benefits would accrue to our system of detention if it were under the control of an independent agency.  Such an arrangement is the norm in many countries.  I urge the Government to take on this project.  How many visiting committee reports are needed to remind us of the complete inadequacy of our current approach to prisons?  Action is needed now.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for raising the important issue of examining the urgent need to establish an independent prison service board to tackle the growing crisis in our prisons.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is attending the Annual Delegate Conference of the Prison Officers' Association in Killarney today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> The Government in its Programme for Government made a wide range of commitments in this area including the establishment of an independent prisons authority to administer the country's prison system.  First, however, the Government undertook in its programme to tackle perhaps the most fundamental problem in the system &mdash; overcrowding, which was also referred to by Senator Keogh.  The Programme for Government included a commitment to provide 2,000 additional prison places over the life of the Government, including 1,000 prison places within the first two years.  As Senator Keogh has pointed out, we are well on course to meeting this commitment.  The new spaces, which will include a new 400 place remand prison at Wheatfield, will alleviate many of the existing problems which undermine the effectiveness of the service, such as the early release of prisoners due to lack of space and many other concerns regarding the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Keogh of the need for an independent prisons authority, under the strategic management initiative process the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in conjunction with local management of the prison service, has been working on the administrative arrangements to allow the authority to be set up.  This transition work will involve such matters as putting in place appropriate systems such as IT systems, financial management systems, support for management development and, of course, on-going consultation with staff associations, etc.  The necessary legislation will be prepared in due course in the Department &mdash; a process which will be considerably assisted by the draft outline heads of a prison service Bill contained in the original expert group report. This legislation may also address two other important commitments on the reform of the Prison Service contained in the Government programme, namely, the establishment of an independent parole and remission board and the appointment of a prisons inspectorate though, if necessary, the parole board and the prisons inspectorate could be dealt with in separate legislation.</P>
    <P>I can confirm to Senator Keogh that, early in December, the Minister announced that he had received Government approval to proceed with the appointment of an interim board to drive forward the intensive preparations required to effect the transition to the authority, pending the enactment of legislation to establish the new structure on a statutory basis.  There are still some detailed matters surrounding accountability for the Prison Service, and the Minister will be bringing proposals to Government shortly to address these matters.  I expect the interim board will be appointed in the very near future.  Legislation will be brought before Government following the establishment of the interim board.</P>
    <P>I might briefly mention, on other related matters, that an expert review group on the probation <Col N="647" /> and welfare service is to report to the Minister later this year.  The findings of this group will help inform policy on an overall approach to the management of offenders.  Non-custodial options have an extremely important place in aiding the reform of the Prison Service and putting some restraint on the high costs of keeping offenders in custody through the development of viable altenatives to custody for some offenders who might, as things stand, end up in prison.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the transition to an authority, the Minister is fully aware of the need for on-going reform of the Prison Service and, in conjuction with the Government's commitment to the strategic management initiative, issues like delegation of accountability and responsibility, customer service, value for money and cost effectiveness, management of performance and so on will <Col N="648" /> all fall to be addressed as part of the root and branch reform of the system.  These matters are also the cornerstone of the Partnership 2000 Agreement.  The investment over the next three years in computer systems for the prisons is further evidence of the Government's and the Minister's commitment to the modernisation of the Prison Service.  While it is important that this investment in change and modernisation yields economic dividends, it is equally important that the Prison Service which emerges from all of this will be a service that serves the best interests of the community and inmates alike.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Keogh for raising this important issue and I hope she understands the reason for the Minister's absence.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 8 May 1998.</P>
