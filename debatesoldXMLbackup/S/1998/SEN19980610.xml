      <P>I have notice from Senator Keogh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review and broaden the remit of the Refugee Agency.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Chambers of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to outline the plans and proposals he has for the development of the seaweed industry along the Western seaboard.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to retain the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; scheme in operation in the Central Model School, Marlborough Street and Scoil Mhuire, Dorset Street.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Keogh's and Chambers' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Colleagues will have been disturbed to read this morning that not a single Irish person will be appointed to the higher levels of the new European Central Bank.  People who are appointed to the higher levels become European civil servants rather than speaking for their country. Nevertheless, it is very disturbing that the highest Irish official will be at the level of the research department.  There will be no senior Irish person on the board nor in the higher reaches of management.</P>
      <P>This is very disturbing news to people in this country as we embark on what still is an adventure in unchartered waters.  Will the Leader ascertain if the Minister used every effort available to him to ensure this country would get its proper and adequate representation at this level of the new central bank?  It is important people are reassured that Ireland's interests will not go by default.</P>
      <P>This is a very bad start.  The House would like to be reassured that the Minister and the Government have done everything possible and, if it is not yet too late, that the strongest possible representations will be made at the highest level to ensure this matter is rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Manning. The entire House would support the Minister. I do not believe we wish to be critical &mdash; at least I do not.  It is very important we make strong representations on this matter.  It is probably too late.  It is a dangerous situation when interest rates are falling at a time when our control mechanisms have been removed from us by the fact that we have joined the euro.  This is an obvious opportunity to do what women traditionally have done so well in terms of networking.  Ireland has a strong ally in Denmark which has people at the top level of the body.  We should work closely with them to ensure that the interests of small nations are properly represented.</P>
      <P>I and others have raised previously the important issue of the position of the Insurance Ombudsman.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate on this matter?  It is highly unusual that a person of that calibre has been forced out of office by the machinations of an industry which does not regard itself as responsible to the people.  The Insurance Ombudsman spoke on the radio this morning about bullying, censorship and the withholding of funds.  She has been forced out of office by an industry that is out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can instance countless cases with regard to this area and if the Insurance Ombudsman is being bullied, what about average consumers of insurance policies?  It is time the Seanad considered this matter and I intend to place an item on the Order Paper.  A statutory independent <Col N="1179" /> paid official should have responsibility for this area.  It should not be left to the whim of an insurance industry that has shown itself to be grossly irresponsible and totally incapable of responding to the trust placed in it by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris in relation to the Insurance Ombudsman.  It is disgraceful that a person in that position has been bullied out of office.  It is a terrible reflection on the industry. This matter should be debated so the views of Members can be expressed.</P>
      <P>I am equally dismayed about the report in today's newspapers that Ireland does not have any representatives in the senior management or on the executive board of the new European Central Bank.  The Central Bank, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have taken their eye off the ball on this matter.  It is outrageous that in over 50 positions Ireland does not have a single senior representative although all the other small countries are represented.  Our interests are not being protected.  There is ongoing discussion about how vulnerable Ireland will be in relation to inflation and other matters.  Therefore, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Finance on the implications of this matter. How could two countries which are not members of the European currency be represented on the board when Ireland does not have any representatives?</P>
      <P>Two momentous events start today.  The first is the World Cup and although Ireland is not represented, there will be many late nights and bleary eyed viewers over the next month.  The leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations also start today.  I wish all the participants well in their endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey the appreciation of the House to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, regarding the introduction of regulations to control the development of superstores? I have raised this matter twice previously in the House and I am glad the Minister's response has been so immediate.  I thank him for his action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning regarding the appointments to the European Central Bank.  It is most disturbing that Ireland, which qualified as one of the top three countries, has been left out in the cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the issue raised by Senator Norris, I called for a debate on the insurance industry the <Col N="1180" /> morning Ms Marrinan Quinn announced her resignation from the post of Insurance Ombudsman. I was most impressed with Ms Marrinan Quinn's contribution on the radio this morning and the two issues mentioned by her regarding lack of funding and interference in the preparation of her annual report are most disturbing, particularly since she accepted that the office worked effectively on behalf of insurers in general.</P>
    <P>Regarding the World Cup, I regret that Ireland is not represented.  However, I am as excited as I would be if Ireland was represented because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns raised by Senator Manning and Senator Norris about the European Central Bank and the insurance industry. I also join Senator Callanan in welcoming the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's directive yesterday.  As many Members are aware, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has been united in its approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister listened to the advice proffered from so many quarters. I am aware that he had to resist the interests of big business, outside multiples and huge developers. I commend him for his action in the interests of towns and villages.  The trading activities of superstores are all embracing and involve the sale of everything from petrol to bread. Superstores would have dominated the scene to such an extent that they would have had a devastating effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Education and Science regarding the problem of schools which are losing teachers?  The INTO blames the Minister for this problem.  However, it is obvious that the INTO entered an understanding that the number of teachers would drop if pupil numbers fell.  This difficulty affects disadvantaged areas along the Border where if pupil numbers fall by only one or two, the school loses a teacher.  This is a serious problem and the Minister and INTO should be asked to renegotiate the position given the difficulties in many small schools in the Border area. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss and perhaps resolve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's call for a debate on the Insurance Ombudsman.  It is totally unacceptable that somebody who was <Col N="1181" /> appointed to act independently should feel that their job is threatened by lack of co-operation from the industry.  The best interests of the public are not being served as a result and a debate on this matter is appropriate.</P>
      <P>Regarding Irish involvement on the board of the European Central Bank, I understand that the Central Bank will be involved at directorship level.  There is a high level board but I understand Ireland has a direct involvement through the Governor of the Central Bank or his representative and that other personnel are involved at a senior level.  That was expected and I understand it is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to make the Minister for Education and Science aware that students sitting the leaving certificate and junior certificate should be catered for.  There are disturbing cases where young people with certain disabilities are unable to sit the examinations because the Department is not co-operating with them.  I have lobbied on behalf of two cases in my constituency and the Minister should be made aware of this because it is only fair that everyone should have an opportunity, particularly when there is so much pressure on those taking the examinations.</P>

Chualamar go léir le déanaí go bhfuil gach seans ann go mbeidh laghdú ar na seirbhísí toisc easpa airgid.  Cuireann sé seo andíomá ormsa agus ar an-chuid daoine eile, mar tá obair an-phrofaisiúnta déanta, go mór mór le daoine óga atá chun tosaigh sa stáisiún.  Tá an-dea-thoil don Ghaeilge agus do Theilifís na Gaeilge sa Seanad.  I hope the Leader will be able to arrange a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ó Murchú. Tá sé an-áisiúil go deo go mbeadh Teilifís na Gaeilge ann do múinteóirí.  Má táimid chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhúineadh na Gaeilge, caithfidh Teilifís na Gaeilge a leathnú agus a fhorbairt.  Ní fhéadfaimís chur suas le aon ghearradh siar ar an méid sin, agus ar thacaíocht a thabhairt ar an méid sin.  Beidh mé an-sásta a labhairt ar sin nuair a thagann sé isteach chugainn.</P>
      <P>My fellow Independent Member, Senator Quinn, has been raised to extraordinarily high office by being selected to lead the World Supermarkets' Association.  This is a signal honour which should be noted by the House.  It will bring distinction to the country and he will bring distinction to the office.  I am sure Members join me in offering the congratulations of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three Senators mentioned school buildings and school teacher numbers.  The INTO is opposed to losing teachers from schools in the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; programme, Gaeltacht schools, and schools which are one or two pupils short.  This is <Col N="1182" /> happening from Ballyferriter to Ballymun and from the inner cities to Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan.  We will support every school affected as there will be severe acrimony in the next few months.  The Minister has acted cynically by waiting until now to tell the schools and Members of both Houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and would not prevail on you, a Chathaoirligh, except that I noted Senator McGowan had been given some leeway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was because of seniority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a senior Member who is entitled to his opinion and should receive adequate time.  However, his party is in Government so it has the money and the Minister.  The schools should get the teachers because no one will stand in the way.  That is the end to negotiations on our side because we have Senator McGowan's support &mdash; can we now get the Minister's support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a progress report, before the recess, from the Minister for Education and Science on the pilot scheme for introducing sport to the leaving certificate curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Manning, Norris, Costello, Bonner, Coghlan and Finneran in expressing concern about the appointments to the European Central Bank.  As Senator Finneran correctly pointed out, we should have an input as a Government and a nation which has proved that it can operate its economy over the past ten years.  We are a shining example of what can be achieved with the help of the EU.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, Bonner, Finneran and Costello called for a debate on the insurance ombudsman. Senator Henry debated this matter on the Adjournment some weeks ago and, given the amount of business proposed for the next three to four weeks, it will be difficult for me to allocate time.  However, the Independent Group will have Private Members' time in two weeks and if Senator Norris wishes to have it discussed then I will be only too pleased to partake in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a national matter concerning the insurance industry, not this sole issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not pre-empt the rest of my remarks &mdash; I will also offer Fianna Fáil Private Members' time the following week. That would permit a four hour debate if the Senator can get agreement among his colleagues on the use of the Independents' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Callanan and Senator Coghlan congratulated the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, for <Col N="1183" /> introducing regulations to protect smaller stores, particularly in rural Ireland.  I also welcome that move and will pass on the Senators' congratulations.  Senators McGowan, O'Toole, Burke and Hayes called for a debate on education.  Senator McGowan and Senator O'Toole mentioned schools in the Border counties and I am concerned about small schools in disadvantaged areas throughout the country.  I will definitely make time available for a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Ó Murchú and Senator O'Toole, I agree it is timely to have a debate on the progress of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Its viewing hours should be extended rather than curtailed because the service is reaching every parish in the country.  Some of its programming has had considerable success, particularly the GAA programmes &mdash; as an advertiser I know that the TAM ratings for the All-Ireland series on Teilifís na Gaeilge were on a par with Network 2.  I congratulate the station and hope it goes on to broadcast county finals in the winter months so that GAA clubs, which are the backbone and the pride of parishes, can be seen on television. County finals are sometimes better matches than the provincial games.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the House I join in Senator O'Toole's congratulations to Senator Quinn on his elevation to his new position.  It brings honour and distinction to the House and to the Senator's industry.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney) Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the creation of a new agency, Enterprise Ireland, through the dissolution of both Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála and the amalgamation of the relevant elements of the services to business function of FÁS.</P>
      <P>As such it will undoubtedly provoke criticism from Members of the House that all that is involved is merely moving the deckchairs around in response to changes in ministerial portfolios. Indeed, it will undoubtedly be claimed that such benefits as will be gained will be outweighed by the disruption caused to existing operations and the loss of focus which is currently placed on marketing and technology.</P>
      <P>I intend in my address this morning to substantively rebut such allegations.  The fact is that while the Bill itself does consist of the legislative provisions to create new agency structures, it will facilitate a totally new approach to indigenous industry development policy.  That approach is built around the key elements of sustainable competitive advantage and the business development model &mdash; BDM.</P>
      <P>Sustainable competitive advantage is at the core of business growth and survival in a turbulent and changing marketplace while the business development model will be the vehicle whereby agency supports to industrial clients will be assessed and delivered in the future.  What is sustainable competitive advantage?  Quite simply, it is the ability to consistently and profitably deliver products and services which customers are willing to choose in preference to those of competitors.  The definition may be simple but, for the individual firm or entrepreneur developing and sustaining a competitive advantage, it is by no means a trivial issue.</P>
      <P>Success or failure at firm level is determined by a complex interaction of forces that run across the firm's value chain from its suppliers to its final customers.  Among these are the inescapable facts that in the globalised marketplace input prices are considerably more volatile than in a sheltered domestic market, customer needs and tastes are constantly changing, new technologies emerge which give rise to new products and processes and new markets are opening up in Asia and Europe.</P>
      <P>To prosper and grow firms need to constantly evolve to meet the needs of this changing environment.  Failure to do so is evidenced by the fact that every one of the 113 manufacturing firms which started in the year 1974 is now closed.  It is no surprise then that there is a general perception that we are strong when it comes to creating businesses but weak when it comes to sustaining them.  Why should this be the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can certainly gain some insights from an assessment of the performance of indigenous industry which identifies some significant strategic weaknesses and these include an excessive dependence on traditional sectors. Many firms are located in traditional industrial <Col N="1185" /> sectors where growth prospects are poor and competition from low cost producers is intense. Such competition will intensify further with increasing globalisation and free trade.</P>
    <P>Levels of profitability are low.  While average profitability &mdash; return on sales &mdash; has increased in recent years, it remains low in absolute terms at 4.3 per cent for the food sector and 9.2 per cent for general manufacturing according to Forfás surveys.  This restricts the funds available for investment and growth.</P>
    <P>We have a low propensity to conduct research and development.  In 1996, 55 per cent of indigenous companies undertook no research and development.  Of those companies that did, only 19 per cent spent more than £100,000.</P>
    <P>There are deficiencies in human resources. There is evidence that, overall, Irish business does not invest sufficiently to upgrade the skills of workers and management.  This is particularly the case for smaller firms.</P>
    <P>There is continuing reliance on home and UK markets.  Only 44 per cent; of Irish small and medium sized enterprises export compared to an EU average of 54 per cent; 65 per cent of indigenous manufacturing output is sold on the home market and, of the balance that is exported, 43 per cent is sold in the UK market.  These deficiencies have persisted despite an interventionist industrial policy which featured the widespread availability of grants.  In this decade alone, almost 70 per cent of the firms recorded on my Department's industrial database as being in existence in the period received a grant of some kind.</P>
    <P>While the persistence of these deficiencies gives rise to serious concerns, they should be taken in context.  On the positive side, the Irish enterprise sector as a whole is thriving. Employment in the foreign direct investment sector has grown by 32 per cent and 32,000 jobs since 1992, while employment in indigenous manufacturing companies has grown by 13.5 per cent and 16,000 jobs in the same period.  Even more striking has been the growth in the services sector where employment has grown by 142,000 since 1992.</P>
    <P>This growth, and Ireland's very rapid economic progress in the 1990s generally, has been underpinned by a commitment to getting the climate right.  Prudent management of the public finances coupled with the contribution of successive partnership agreements has created a virtuous circle of rapidly growing productivity and real wage increases.  The European Union has also played a major part both through the contribution of the Structural Funds and in the liberalisation of markets in the run up to EMU.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, faced with a conundrum. Overall, enterprise is booming.  In particular, we now have a thriving domestic services sector which is capable of further significant growth as living standards continue to rise.  In addition, we have arrived at the point where it is no longer necessary to grant aid firms simply to offset the <Col N="1186" /> effects of a dysfunctional cost and taxation environment.  In the midst of all of these positives, however, the fact remains that the indigenous traded sector displays significant performance weaknesses which the traditional industrial policy model is failing to address.</P>
    <P>Clearly a serious reappraisal of policy is needed.  On coming into office, l directed my Department to undertake just such an examination with a view to addressing the concerns I have just outlined.  The outcome of that review is the reason I am bringing forward the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill, 1998.</P>
    <P>The traditional approach to the industrial development business can be characterised as supply driven.  Under this approach the development agencies channel their cash into a wide range of schemes which they have established and the onus is largely on the firm to match its needs to those schemes.</P>
    <P>The effect of this supply driven approach is that there are too many schemes and too little focus on the real needs of the client firm.  At best this gives rise to a scattergun approach in the hope that if enough clients get support across enough categories at least some of it will hit the mark. This approach is wasteful, inefficient and less than optimally effective.  Moving away from it requires a much greater focus on identifying the real needs of client firms and addressing those needs in a streamlined, flexible way.  Such a move will result in better value for money, better targeting of supports and better performance from the assisted companies.</P>
    <P>The key to fulfilling client needs is to first establish what those needs are.  Historically the industrial development agencies have tended to concentrate on grants administration based on paper plans rather than on taking a hands-on approach and spending time with the client to develop an in-depth knowledge of their business and the strategic issues facing it.  This approach works well in the FDI context where the majority of firms are well established successful firms who are essentially negotiating the level of cash subsidy which will be paid to secure the location of their project in Ireland and who already have the necessary internal competencies in R and D, marketing and strategy.</P>
    <P>In the indigenous context, however, firms tend to be less well developed and their needs are more complex ranging across the entire spectrum of business functions.  At present firms are faced with the prospect of having to deal with three independent agencies, FÁS, Forbairt and ABT, which are administering in excess of 45 different schemes.  There are, of course, some firms which profit from the current system.  Those firms which have a clear idea of their needs and the resources to exploit the system will be more successful than other less well developed firms and may thus capture a greater proportion of agency resources. In addition, the existence of separate agencies for overall business development, human resources <Col N="1187" /> and marketing offers firms the opportunity of using a positive decision on funding by one agency to leverage funding from the other agency.  This is one manifestation of the grant mentality which has been strongly criticised for its negative impact on entrepreneurship and risk taking in enterprise.  lt also diverts scarce resources from the areas of most need.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report summarised the issue as follows: &ldquo;Industrial firms are integrated business entities.  The different functional areas operate together in a cohesive way.  State support for the functional activities of firms, whether in marketing, training or finance, should be provided in an integrated package&rdquo;.  The Culliton Group's key insight was to recognise that State supports relate directly to the key strategic business functions performed by firms.</P>
    <P>My Department has built upon the Culliton view by developing a business development model &mdash; BDM &mdash; which provides the basis for assessing existing agency schemes and programmes and for streamlining them into a format which is clear, simple and directly related to business development needs of firms in the areas of strategy assessment and formulation, research development and design, production and operations, marketing, human resources and finance.  The goals are simple support structures meeting real business needs and efficient client-friendly delivery.  Three separate agencies operating in excess of 45 different schemes is not the way to achieve this.  If we are to take an integrated, holistic approach to the developmental needs of enterprise we need to have an integrated agency, hence the creation of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland will bring together the business development functions of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and relevant human resources expertise from the FÁS services to business function.  Enterprise Ireland will have a new mission and a new approach to service delivery based on the strategy outlined here.  In bringing together the key elements of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and FÁS, the new agency will have access to expertise across the range of business functions required by firms and outlined in the business development model.</P>
    <P>The following essential elements will underpin Enterprise Ireland.  There will be clarity of mission, clarity of focus in terms of its client base, a close working relationship with client firms to establish their developmental needs, streamlined services which meet those needs and selective deployment of resources to achieve maximum impact on the performance of client firms.  I will now outline those elements in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The mission of Enterprise Ireland is &ldquo;to help client companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to increasing profitable sales, exports and employment.&rdquo; This mission has been devised to reflect a clear statement of cause and effect, that is, sustainable <Col N="1188" /> competitive advantage at the level of the individual firm which leads to the desired policy outcomes of increasing profitable sales, exports and employment.  The key metrics of sales, exports and employment underpin the need for Enterprise Ireland to focus strongly on companies with the willingness and potential to trade internationally.  Given the limited size of the domestic Irish market and its increasing openness in a globalised competitive environment, significant growth in sales and employment can only be achieved through exporting.</P>
    <P>The client base of Enterprise Ireland will be comprised of manufacturing and internationally traded services companies which are genuinely Irish based and whose growth and development can be enhanced through working with Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland client companies will essentially fall into two categories. The first category will involve companies which are Irish owned at start-up and where any foreign involvement is of a purely financial nature only. My primary intention here is that Irish start-up companies which are bought out by overseas investors, often at a relatively early stage of development, should remain as clients of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>The second category will comprise companies which are foreign owned but whose Irish management has autonomous decision-making power in relation to a majority of key strategic business functions, that is, strategy formulation, research and development and marketing.  Such companies are effectively indigenous in terms of functions and, as such, appropriately belong in the Enterprise Ireland client base.  Companies whose long term strategic development is determined in Ireland will fall within the Enterprise Ireland client base, while companies whose strategic development is determined by their parent corporation will fall within the client base of IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the issue of the delivery of supports.  In the context of the client base segmentation which I have just described, there will be one clear source of financial assistance for companies for each element of the client base; Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will be responsible for financial assistance to their respective client groups.  As regards the issue of non-financial soft supports, which are largely of an information or advisory nature, these will be directed primarily, but not exclusively, at Enterprise Ireland's clients since these companies face greater developmental challenges than IDA Ireland's clients.  However, the objective of embedding foreign direct investment companies in the economy through sub-supply linkages and the location of strategic business functions, such as research and development and marketing, must also be taken into account.  In that regard, the overall policy goal is that the maximum number of foreign direct investment companies should become fully rooted in the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> Significant diseconomies of scale would arise from splitting the provision of soft supports between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  In the new agency structures, therefore, soft supports in relation to linkage, marketing, research and development and human resources will be provided centrally by Enterprise Ireland. The main focus of these supports will be on Enterprise Ireland client companies.  However, Enterprise Ireland will also provide these supports to IDA Ireland and other agency clients which have specific developmental needs and where Enterprise Ireland supports can add value.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the business development model will be central to Enterprise Ireland's functions.  The key strategic concept is that flexible, customised supports should be delivered to Enterprise Ireland clients as part of a structured development process involving an analysis of client needs, delivery of the supports themselves and subsequent monitoring of client performance.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland will have the necessary expertise to add value to its client base in the analysis and quantification of client needs across the six functional elements of the business development model, that is, strategy assessment and formulation, research, development and design, production and operations, marketing, human resources and finance.  Enterprise Ireland will also draw on its internal resources to provide added value services which meet identified client needs.  However, the agency will also facilitate third party provision of developmental services where this is the best way of meeting client needs. In order to effectively implement the business development model and the structured development approach, the following activities and associated resources will transfer to Enterprise Ireland: all of An Bord Tráchtála's functions, Forbairt's business development, investment policy and commercial assessment functions, the relevant elements of Forbairt's research and technology functions and the relevant elements of the services to business function of FÁS.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the issue of focus and to underscore its importance.  My aim is to ensure that Enterprise Ireland is a genuinely new and focused organisation and not simply an amalgamation of the component parts and activities of the agencies involved.  The business development model will provide the overall strategic direction for the refocusing and streamlining of the various schemes operated by the agency and the mechanisms through which they are delivered.  My Department will work in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland to ensure that the model is effectively operationalised and that the necessary streamlining of schemes takes place.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that a clear strategic direction is set for Enterprise Ireland's technology operations and to remove some of the confusion which has persisted since <Col N="1190" /> the incorporation of the former Eolas into Forbairt.</P>
    <P>As part of Enterprise Ireland's overall company developmental mandate, its technology function will provide needs analysis and developmental, value adding supports to client firms.  To achieve this, Enterprise Ireland's technology activities will encompass technology auditing as part of the overall client needs analysis, advice and problem solving, contract research and development where identified market failures exist, assistance and advice with licensing and technology transfer and co-financing of in-company research and development.</P>
    <P>It must be clear that Enterprise Ireland is an industrial development organisation, not a stand alone technical institute and its technology activities must fit that brief.  The corollary is that Enterprise Ireland should not be involved in public good or regulatory activities or non-developmental testing services and services where, relative to private sector providers, a competitive advantage is gained through cross-subsidisation from other parts of the organisation, either in cash or in kind.</P>
    <P>In light of the foregoing the Government has decided that some functions currently exercised by Forbairt will not transfer to Enterprise Ireland.  In this context it is intended that the existing Forbairt functions in the metrology area will transfer to the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  It is also intended that the Irish Energy Centre should be constituted as a statutory agency of the Department of Public Enterprise and separate legislation will be brought forward by the Minister for Public Enterprise to achieve this.</P>
    <P>As regards those elements of the existing Forbairt technology activities involving the third level sector, such as the programme in advanced technology and the measure 4 scheme, these will be incorporated within Enterprise Ireland on the clear understanding that they must contribute to the development of enterprise in the long, medium and short term.  I conclude on this aspect of Enterprise Ireland's functions by reiterating that, where necessary, specific technology activities transferring to the agency from Forbairt will be reoriented and reconfigured to meet the agency's overall developmental mission.  Where necessary, such reconfiguration will involve the discontinuation of non-developmental activities.</P>
    <P>I want now to outline the human resources dimension of the new agency.  I am committed to ensuring, as with the other elements of the business development model, that Enterprise Ireland has the capacity to address human resources development within its client firms. That capacity will be provided through the transfer of relevant elements of the FÁS services to business function.  Significant elements of STB activities interface directly with the overall mission and strategic approach of Enterprise Ireland, in particular assisting companies in <Col N="1191" /> assessing training needs; assisting them in the development of company training plans; and the delivery of training grant schemes.  The relevant staff and resources required to exercise these functions within Enterprise Ireland will transfer from FÁS to the new agency.  Other elements of the function will remain within FÁS.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the specific provisions of the Bill and to outline its key features to the House. As I indicated at the start of my address, the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the new industrial development agency, Enterprise Ireland, through the amalgamation and restructuring of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and certain elements of the services to business function of FÁS. Consequently, the Bill provides for the dissolution of Forbairt and ABT.  The Bill also provides for the transfer of the metrology functions currently exercised by Forbairt to the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for amendments to the Industrial Development Acts, 1986 to 1995, and the Metrology Act, 1996, arising out of the restructuring, as well as certain other minor amendments to those Acts, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Acts, 1959 to 1995, and the National Standards Authority of Ireland Acts, 1996 to 1998, which are mainly concerned with the updating of certain financial limits.  I intend that the new agency will be established during the month of July, and section 3 provides for the making of the necessary order to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the establishment of Enterprise Ireland &mdash; known in the Bill as &ldquo;the Agency&rdquo;&mdash; as a corporate body and as an agency of Forfás.  In that regard, Enterprise Ireland will come within the policy and co-ordination remit of Forfás and its powers have been expanded to allow for this in section 45.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the functions of the agency. This section provides the broad powers to allow Enterprise Ireland to implement the business development model.  In addition to these broad functions, the agency will also draw on the specific provisions of the Industrial Development Acts, 1986 to 1995, to provide its client firms with a comprehensive range of advice and developmental supports.</P>
    <P>Staffing provisions for Enterprise Ireland, and related provisions for IDA Ireland, are dealt with in a number of sections, while the provisions of the Industrial Development Act, 1993, are also relevant.  Under the terms of the 1993 Act which continue to apply, Forfás is the overall employer of both its own staff and those of Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  Initially, it is proposed to retain this approach in the Enterprise Ireland context; that is to say that staff will be employed by Forfás and seconded to Enterprise Ireland.  This is provided for in section 39 for ABT staff and in section 40 for FÁS staff.  Under the terms of the 1993 Act, the staff of Forbairt are currently staff of Forfás <Col N="1192" /> and, as such, the power already exists to second these staff to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>In regard to the staff of FÁS, as I have already indicated, only certain elements of the FÁS services to business function will transfer to Enterprise Ireland.  Section 40 therefore provides the powers to transfer the relevant staff.  In order to allow sufficient consultation for this, the section will come into force by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made in the Bill to allow Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to assume the role of employer should this prove necessary. In the case of Enterprise Ireland, this is provided for in sections 18 and 19.  A similar consequential provision is being made for IDA Ireland in sections 36 and 37.</P>
    <P>The successful pursuit and implementation of Enterprise Ireland's new mission and strategy will require a very different approach to that currently pursued by its component agencies.  As such, the success of Enterprise Ireland will be critically dependent on its staff.  I want to ensure that the new agency has the full scope to implement a human resources policy which underpins its distinctive mission and business needs.  Should this require a change in the staffing structures established under the 1993 Act, then such change will be made and the necessary order making provisions are included in the Bill to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides for an amendment to the Industrial Development Act, 1993, to allow for an increase &mdash; from £750 million to £2 billion &mdash; in the aggregate amount of grants to Forfás, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  The increase is necessary because the bodies in question are now nearing the existing statutory limit in respect of the total amount of moneys which may be granted to the bodies for the exercise of their functions.  Similar provisions are made in respect of Shannon Development in section 35.  It should be noted that this is the gross amount of money to be granted to the agencies and has no impact on the percentage grant aid to individual companies.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for an amendment to the Industrial Development Act, 1993, to allow for an increase in the aggregate threshold &mdash; from £2.5 million to £4 million &mdash; for grants to an individual undertaking above which Government approval is required.  The existing threshold dates back to 1981 and, taking inflation into account, its continued application has resulted in a significant increase in the number of projects which require Government approval.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for a <i>pro rata</i> increase in a range of individual grant thresholds set out in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, above which Government approval is required, thus bringing these thresholds into line with the increased aggregate grants threshold.</P>
    <P>Sections 49 to 51 provide for the transfer of the metrology function to the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  In the first instance, the staff of the metrology function will be seconded <Col N="1193" /> by Forfás to NSAI.  However, consistent with the provisions being adopted for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, provision is being made to allow the subsequent transfer of staff to NSAI.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by reiterating my earlier assertion that the creation of Enterprise Ireland is not simply a case of moving the deck chairs. This Bill, the structures it provides for and the strategic thinking underlying it, which I have outlined to the House today, are part of a fundamental reappraisal of industrial policy in Ireland.  It is based on a firm commitment to putting the business environment first and to critically reassessing the role of State interventions within that overall context.  It is also based on a commitment to putting the customer first and to delivering streamlined supports which address real business needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to deliver better value for the significant amounts of taxpayers money which is devoted to industrial development, and to build the kind of industrial base which will provide the impetus for the economy of Ireland into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, I must apologise.  I must leave the House because, as many Senators may be aware, the US Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Daly, is arriving in the Republic of Ireland with a business delegation from Northern Ireland at 12.30 p.m. in Sligo.  The intention is that I will be there to meet him on behalf of the Government. I am sorry that that is the case and I apologise, but the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will take over.  I look forward to reading the contributions of Senators and to responding to them next week on Committee and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>I especially thank the House for facilitating such an early debate.  I was anxious that this agency would be established in July.  It is important, particularly for the staff, that the restructuring will be done as quickly as possible. Therefore, it was rather ambitious to be able to get Government approval and have the Bill drafted and through the Oireachtas by 2 July.  As the Houses are rising earlier this year, there was a greater rush at the end than I would have wished.  I appreciate the understanding from all sides of this House of the time pressures which we are under in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister to the House and thank her for the comprehensive overview of the Bill.  We are again happy to be understanding and I respond to her remarks in that regard on allowing the Bill to be taken here today.  As she will appreciate, we only received the Bill in the last day or two.  Therefore, my remarks will be of a preliminary rather than a comprehensive nature because of the lack of time for research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill creates Enterprise Ireland.  One hopes that this new super agency will provide a fresher and better approach to service delivery.  That appears to be the Minister's intention.  The amalgamation of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála <Col N="1194" /> and the services to business section of FÁS is a major change to existing structures.  Resistance to change is natural and it would be interesting to hear the views of staff and key personnel in those agencies.  We have shown an ability to make things work and it is in that spirit that this new body will be established.  The metrology functions of Forbairt will be taken over by the National Standards Authority of Ireland where they more properly belong.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of the Bill is the establishment of Enterprise Ireland to allow an integrated approach to company development.  It is logical to provide a single point of contact for firms.  I agree with the general thrust of the Bill and I give it a broad welcome.  Sections 6 and 7 form the core of the Bill.  I welcome section 8 which deals with ministerial directives.  We had a very good example yesterday from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of a good use of a ministerial directive.  They should be applied more often and we should be prepared to see them employed.  Governments after all are elected to govern.  I welcome the provision which allows for a ministerial directive from time to time as might be required.</P>
    <P>I hope Enterprise Ireland will match the mood and reality of the Celtic tiger's success.  There is no doubting the success of the IDA in attracting industry over the years.  It is equally without doubt that nothing like the same has been available to indigenous enterprise where the support structures have lacked success and a proper degree of focus.  We all share the Minister's hopes for Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the structural level there have been too many agencies and schemes.  Rationalisation is long overdue.  A tighter, slimmer, even meaner machine is required.  Business can never rest on its laurels.  We must strive for continued improvements in all areas.  We need more export markets.  Denis Brosnan of the Kerry Group in my own county is a shining example in this regard.  We need more investment in research and development.  We have  the educational capabilities to fill all the necessary functions to further enhance our efforts with more focus.</P>
    <P>The structural changes provided for in the Bill will present a challenge but they are the correct and necessary measures.  Compared with the unsatisfactory situation which has developed, with three indigenous development agencies, the new approach which is client centred and has systematic identification of individual firm needs is the correct one.  Very often there has been a lack of understanding, sympathy and support for indigenous industry and particularly for smaller firms.  The intention of focusing on all aspects of a firm's strengths and weaknesses and of having them properly assessed is a laudable goal which will, in each case, lead to an agreed plan prioritising the client industry's needs.  This will be linked to six key business functions: strategy assessment and formulation, research, development and design, production and <Col N="1195" /> operations, marketing and distribution, human resources and finance.  Plans will be implemented through a team of client development executives who will have specialist resources available as required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the intention to reduce the number of schemes and programmes with which companies have to cope.  Firms wish to access support in the least complex way and for that reason all simplification and streamlining is to be welcomed.  The new approach will, I hope, reap substantial benefits.  As the Minister said, An Bord Tráchtála's overall goal is to increase exports while Forbairt's goal is to grow profitable sales.  She also pointed out that independent evaluation of An Bord Tráchtála's activities found that 60 per cent of agency clients were common with Forbairt and that in many cases Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála were grant aiding different aspects of the same project. Rationalisation is necessary.  I also welcome the intention to establish a restructuring implementation task force to assist in seeing this through.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in her speech, spoke of the need, willingness and potential to trade internationally. This is the key to our further success.  She rightly said that given the limited size of the domestic market and its increasing openness in a globalised competitive environment we need significant growth in sales and employment.  This can only be achieved through exporting.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will respond to some of the questions I will now pose.  The first is near to my heart because it concerns the lovely countryside of south Kerry.  I have on previous occasions raised the matter of the vacant Pretty Polly factory in Killarney. Another industry is also promised for Killarney. I appreciate the fact that the IDA is working hard on both projects and I also stress the needs of towns such as Kenmare, Cahirciveen, Killorglin and Dingle.  South Kerry has a tremendous tourism industry, thank God, but it is not an all year industry.  We have a sufficient workforce and we are badly in need of industrial jobs as, no doubt, are many other parts of the country.  The owners of the Pretty Polly factory willingly handed the premises back to the State and it is now vested in the IDA.  It is a huge complex and very few assets of its size and capability are available anywhere in the country.  The Minister met councillors from Killarney many months ago and outlined her hopes for the factory and briefed us on the efforts of the IDA.  She said that, all going well, a replacement industry would be in the factory by last Easter.  I wish the IDA well.  I think they are very close to bringing another industry to Killarney and I would like updated information on these developments.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the publication of the Bill but has reservations about the new super authority proposed, namely, Enterprise Ireland. The thrust of the Bill is welcome but there are <Col N="1196" /> issues I would like addressed in the reply to the Second Stage debate.  Will the larger authority be unfocused because of its very nature?  The Minister stressed that this would not be the case and I hope she is right.  Is there enough emphasis in the legislation on the promotion of exports and support for exporters?  Our future lies in exporting.  However, exports are not specifically mentioned in the Bill.  Services to business need to be flexible.  Will this be possible with a large bureaucracy such as that proposed?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that the same level of services will be available to small businesses?  There has been an unfocused approach in the past because of the multiplicity of agencies.  Will the Minister of State guarantee that the same level of services will be available under the new structure?  Will measures be taken to ensure the smooth transfer and harmonious integration of staff into the new agency?  The Minister said the matter would take place by ministerial order because consultation is required, but that has not yet taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is experiencing unprecedented economic growth.  However, to continue to provide a proper environment for businesses to grow and develop, systems and structures often require to be amended.  Ireland's continued growth must be developed on the back of the small and medium sized firms.  Indigenous industry is part of the lifeblood of the country and small and medium sized companies are vital to Ireland's continued success in European and global markets.</P>
      <P>Such firms have the characteristics of being small in size, often owner managed, providing family employment and being based in local rural communities.  Such firms not only provide employment but stem the flow of rural depopulation.  They provide employment in local areas and their contribution locally and nationally is vital.  These firms are the foundation of Ireland's future.  Their continued growth and development are vital to provide the resources Ireland may need in a future global recession.</P>
      <P>In 1993 Eolas and the IDA were successfully restructured.  I commend IDA Ireland on its fine and professional work on our behalf.  I have had the opportunity to meet with IDA Ireland representatives in the US on a number of occasions and I have been impressed by their initiative, hard work and their commitment to Ireland.  At home the IDA Ireland staff go to great lengths to do their jobs and they achieve success for Ireland in the competitive task of attracting multi-national business.  The objective of the restructuring in 1993 was to create a clear focus and that was achieved.  The restructuring has made a positive contribution to Ireland's success in attracting, retaining and further developing foreign investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look at the success stories to see how initial developments have continued to grow &mdash; companies such as Boston Scientific and APC in <Col N="1197" /> Galway and longer established firms such as Thermo King, Nortel and Digital which have made major contributions to the economy of Galway and the west for over 20 years.  These companies started as small initial investments and have continued to expand and create employment.  Their success is a recognition of the input of the local workforce, the various support agencies and the attractiveness of Ireland as a base.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that it can be confusing for indigenous enterprises to identify the help available to them from State agencies.  There are too many schemes and agencies to deal with and this causes confusion and the confusion impacts on their ability to address their development needs with State support.  Their weaknesses are in areas such as sectoral positioning, profitability, traditional sector development and a strong concentration on the UK market as the only export market to be exploited.</P>
    <P>The existing State agencies can help indigenous industry to address these weaknesses, but the Minister and the Government have identified that a new approach is necessary.  State intervention should be a benefit not a hindrance or an interference.  Sourcing State assistance in enterprise development is difficult at present.  The services provided are driven by the agencies' perception of the needs of industry rather than by the needs identified by industry.  There are problems for the recipients of the aid because the agencies drive the agenda.  There is confusion among client firms, most of which are small developing companies that do not have time or expertise to identify their key requirements and needs.  Such companies are busy surviving and do not exploit the opportunities available to them, opportunities which the State will try to help them to exploit.  Many of the key managers in such companies are bright entrepreneurial people with drive and vision.  However, they sometimes have difficulty framing their vision in a format acceptable to the funding channels.  Dealing with three agencies makes it difficult for the entrepreneurs to benefit from a unified strategic approach.  This lack of unity and strategic focus can impede a firm's long-term development which impacts in turn on Ireland's growth.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister have recognised this difficulty and the Bill reflects their attempt to address this element of indigenous development.  The existing system will be replaced by a streamlined, client centred approach as outlined.  This new approach will be implemented by a team of client development executives who will be able to draw on specialised resources as required to allow them to assess client needs and to deliver the requisite supports.</P>
    <P>Key elements of the approach include a participation process whereby client organisations seeking supports will participate in a structured development process.  This will take place in association with the relevant development personnel.  It will establish the <Col N="1198" /> position of the business, its strengths and weaknesses and the internal and external competitive forces that impact on it.  This process will be carried out in collaboration with the development agency personnel.  This process of analysis will lead to an action plan which will prioritise needs and identify the State's input into the process.  Importantly, this will put in achievable, measurable targets that will have to be reached before continued State support can be received.  The benefit of this process is that all parties can see pre-established targets and measure performance against them.  The objective is to help companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>The intention is to create more growth, more jobs, increased sales and increased exports. Measuring results in terms of sales, exports and employment will underpin the focus of this new agency.  Given the limited size of the domestic market, firms benefiting from State intervention must focus on export and must be willing to operate in a globalised market.  An overall aim of the restructuring is to create a simple, one stop shop type environment which will be a simple support structure meeting real business needs. The agency aims to provide the best of both worlds: in-depth analysis and planning as well as a clearly defined single point of contact.  There will be no more eternal knocking on doors and missing out on the correct service for one's requirements.  Red tape and bureaucracy will be cut and an efficient, user friendly approach is the implementation objective.</P>
    <P>There are a number of benefits to this new approach, and if it is as successful as the restructuring of IDA Ireland, the future looks bright for the energetic, dedicated, entrepreneurial indigenous firm.  Those benefits include easier initial access to State supports and assistance by identifying and prioritising key development needs.  This identification and prioritisation will help ensure that the resources available are utilised to their best advantage according to real client needs.  The synergistic energy of the combined agency expertise will greatly assist and support developing organisations.  It will also be easier to measure results and to review and amend programmes as success is measured.  This provides for better accountability and transparency in the process.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets the scene for the creation of a new company development agency.  The goals are simply defined: a client centred approach to support provision, addressing the real needs of the business requiring support and developing a simple, user friendly, effective service.  As has been said, three separate agencies cannot achieve this, and 45 schemes are too confusing and daunting.  An integrated agency is the way forward in assisting indigenous industry to develop in a sustainable and competitive manner and to assist it in continuing to make its contribution to the necessary development of Ireland as an emerging market leader.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The new company development agency will bring together the business development functions of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and the services to business brief of FÁS.  It will have a new face, a new mission and a new way of doing business.  It will benefit greatly from the synergy of its combined expertise and it will be a case of the sum of the whole being greater than the individual parts.  There will be a single point of contact for client companies and there will be wide ranging expertise available in one organisation.  As I have said, this will be an integrated, user friendly approach.  The central agency seems a natural progression for the agencies, as the groundwork for missions and shared objectives is already there.  An Bord Tráchtála's goal is to increase exports and Forbairt's role is to promote profitable sales. Given the size of Ireland's domestic market, developing profitable sales must involve exports. Ireland's indigenous firms need some assistance in attacking the export world.  Irish firms are often too insular and lack the confidence necessary to attack markets outside their comfort zone.  Irish produced goods and services are second to none and are highly valued abroad.</P>
    <P>A Galway software manufacturing company, which is Irish owned and managed, has created its first export sale without State aid or intervention.  This is not because there was no support forthcoming, but because the company's key management staff were so busy trying to attend to its everyday survival that it was unable to tap into the right source of funding.  Many small firms experience the same problem.  They are too busy to sift through the State schemes to see what is available to them.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets up Enterprise Ireland through the amalgamation and restructuring of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and certain elements of FÁS's services to industry.  The Bill sets out the functions of that body and allows for the integrated approach that is so necessary.  It provides for the dissolution of Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála and allows for an increase in the grants and incentives that can be paid to the agencies.  This has no impact on the percentage grant aid which may be paid to individual companies.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a move into the future.  The creation of Enterprise Ireland sets the scene for indigenous firms as we enter the new millennium. Enterprise Ireland will deal with genuinely Irish based companies whose growth can be enhanced with its assistance.  Such organisations will generally have in excess of ten employees. Enterprise Ireland will not compete with existing structures such as the enterprise boards, area partnerships, business innovation centres and Leader programmes.  The focus will be on growth companies with export potential.  I hope this restructuring achieves its aim of providing direct, user friendly support to indigenous firms in a one stop shop.  There should be less red tape and a <Col N="1200" /> greater spread of expertise on call.  The future of Ireland's economy is dependent on strong exports and strong internal profitability for Irish owned small and medium sized enterprises.  A place in the global market for Irish products and services is essential.  The Government is providing the environment and supports necessary for that and Enterprise Ireland is an important step in that process.  I commend the Tánaiste's initiative and look forward to the successful operation of Enterprise Ireland and the continued growth and development of Irish industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad.  It is unusual to have so many Bills introduced in the Seanad and I hope this is the start of a new trend.  However, I do not necessarily welcome the Bill with the same enthusiasm, despite being one of the most vocal opponents in 1993 of the crazy arrangements that had export development in one Department and industrial development in another.</P>
      <P>I am glad that that arrangement will be a thing of the past.  Whether it makes sense to merge Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and a section of FÁS is another matter.  The Tánaiste said she assumed that this would provoke the criticism that this was just moving deck chairs.  She did not mention the <i>Titanic.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is now a success story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great success.</P>
      <P>I am opposed in general to the proliferation of semi-State agencies and any overlap or duplication of effort which arises from bodies' remits impinging on one another.  It is preferable as a general principle that companies in the private sector, particularly smaller ones, should have to deal with as few State bodies as possible.</P>
      <P>However, that is not to say all mergers of State agencies are a good idea.  Mergers can have disadvantages as well as advantages and are not automatically a good thing.  In any given case we should weigh one against the other before deciding on a shake up.  I wonder if that has been done in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly worried about the disappearance of an agency specifically devoted to export development.  Export development is a highly specialised task which needs specialised skills.  Since the establishment of Córas Tráchtála 50 years ago we have had an agency which provided a focus and home for that specialised expertise.  Our national export agency has built an identity, a sense of corporate purpose and an <Col N="1201" /><i>esprit de corps</i> among its employees, all centred on that one export function.  That specific function and mission will now be lost, and I am not completely sure that will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>I say this in the full knowledge there has been a considerable overlap in recent years between the activities of Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála in the field of company development.  However, that could be solved simply by taking An Bord Tráchtála out of the company development business and slimming down its role to its original one of concentrating on market development overseas.  Merging the two agencies completely seems an unnecessarily drastic way of dealing with a comparatively minor overlap problem, especially since an alternative approach is available which would bring An Bord Tráchtála under the Forfás umbrella but still leave it as a separate agency.</P>
    <P>Another reservation of mine concerns Forbairt itself.  It is only four or five years since we created Forbairt and that agency has painstakingly and expensively created an identity and role for itself over those short few years.  That identity is now to be thrown out the window and client companies will have to get used to dealing with another completely new body.  Is that wise?</P>
    <P>We need only look at Forbairt to realise not all mergers of State bodies are painless or trouble free.  The fundamental thrust behind the creation of Forbairt was to have an agency to focus on indigenous development, which was an excellent and commendable idea.  However, the agency has also taken on total responsibility for scientific research and development in this country, which I think has been less successful.  Some of the more long-term aspects of that activity sit very badly on an agency that is concerned mainly with developing scientific companies in the more medium term.  As a result, our approach to long-term research has been weakened rather than strengthened under Forbairt.  We have lost the benefits of having an agency which was clearly seen to be focused and concentrating its efforts on science and technology.  There is a strong feeling in the scientific community that our national development in science and technology is not best served by the present organisational structures.</P>
    <P>We are now similarly going to lose a sense of focus and commitment by effectively abolishing a specialised export agency.  One of the problems is that once we have done it, it will be very hard to undo.  It is very easy to create mergers at the stroke of a pen but it would be much more difficult to recreate an export agency in four or five years time if we find at that stage that the new arrangement has left a gap which needs to be filled.  That concern has not been recognised in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the &ldquo;merger mania&rdquo; we have seen in the area of State agencies is that people confuse State agencies with Government Departments.  When I became involved in An Post almost 20 years ago I discovered how a <Col N="1202" /> Department could change its functions and tasks. It is very easy to chop and change Departments because of how they are structured into divisions, each of which is run by an Assistant Secretary General.  However, State agencies are organised differently and any attempts to rearrange them cause major upheaval.  That was very evident in 1993 when the effort was made to create Forfás and the other new agencies.</P>
    <P>Any rearrangement needs to be carefully evaluated in terms of advantages and, more particularly, disadvantages.  I question whether that has been done in this case, despite the rosy scenario painted by the Minister this morning. What makes me most sceptical about the size of the benefits in this case is that I do not see the move arising from a clear customer need &mdash; I see it as much more driven by internal considerations. Business does not want to deal with a plethora of State agencies, but how widely has business been consulted about the need for this merger?  Can the Minister give us a sense of that?  Is it only being driven by internal considerations or are the changes being made on the basis of consultations with customers?  To what extent is the Bill a response to the needs of the marketplace served by these agencies and to what extent is it a response to the bureaucratic need for something that is tidy, neat and more easily understood?</P>
    <P>I think business people will not see this merger as a move which addresses their priorities.  If that is true, Enterprise Ireland will have its work cut out for itself if it is to justify its existence to its customers and client base.</P>
    <P>I visited several countries in South East Asia last week.  I was impressed by the fact that some of them had succeeded while others had failed. Some of those success stories came about because of focused State agencies which set out what they were trying to achieve.  Therefore, there are functions which can be achieved effectively by State agencies, as has been done so well in the past here.  I trust and hope this Bill will be successful in doing that and I wish the people involved every good fortune and success.</P>
    <P>This may not be the most sensible or necessary of measures but once we are stuck with it, it is in the national interest that it is made to work.  I believe the Minister has put the necessary work into it although I question some of the motives behind it.  However, I believe it can be made to work and I wish the Minister well with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me.  However, I think he has been somewhat contaminated by his sojourn in An Post; while I am a great admirer of a great deal he does in the area of enterprise, I was sorry to hear him pay tribute to the State sector in such glowing terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to this Bill.  Those who said it is simply moving the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i> are right.  I am disappointed that a Minister who has shown such commitment to private enterprise and starred in many other areas of which business <Col N="1203" /> interests approve is introducing a Bill of this sort, which is concentrated not on a radical reappraisal of these agencies but on changing things around and not attacking the core problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a means to make it easier for businessmen to obtain grants.  They are confused and do not know which agency to approach for grants and the Bill makes life easy for them in that regard.  This legislation will merely increase the existing dependency culture in this country. There is evidence of that in section 33 which increases the statutory limit of grants from £750 million to £2 billion.  I see no reason for this.  In my opinion the Minister should advocate a reduction in the number of grants, in people's capacity to obtain them and in the Government's capacity to provide them.  Instead she is introducing an enabling clause which will allow the Government to provide businesses with additional grants and increase the dependency culture.  The Minister is making it possible for the Government to provide additional money and she is making it easier for business interests to obtain it.</P>
    <P>A Bill of this nature is not required in the current economic climate.  What the Minister ought to have done, which would have been in keeping with the philosophy of the Progressive Democrats, was to consider the cost of operating these agencies and ask whether they are needed.  I welcome the announcement in this morning's newspapers that the idea of trading houses &mdash; another disastrous and unsuccessful piece of State interference in enterprise &mdash; has been abolished.  Incidentally, the name of the agency covered by the Bill, Enterprise Ireland, is a deception designed to fool people into believing it is an enterprising agency.  It is not; it is a grant giving agency.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has had an opportunity to read our contributions I hope she will state that, instead of changing things around in the way the Bill suggests, she has been considering FÁS and that she was unaware it cost £500 million per year to operate.  Following next Friday's Cabinet meeting about the next budget, I hope the Minister will indicate that she has been considering the possibility of reducing the operating costs of FÁS &mdash; when in Opposition she always favoured keeping spending down &mdash; because the European Union has informed us that spending must be reduced.  I hope she will also state that, as a committed member of the European Union and an advocate of the euro, there is a great opportunity to make reductions in her Department in the area of FÁS, which costs £500 million per annum to run.</P>
    <P>Many FÁS schemes are exploited by people in employment, which costs the Exchequer a great deal of money, a large proportion of the buildings used by the agency are empty and the equipment housed in them is not being employed efficiently. When I referred to FÁS on previous occasions I received a large number of representations which <Col N="1204" /> convinced me that people working for the agency have little to do.  As a result of some of those representations, I visited a FÁS training and enterprise centre.  My hosts were extremely good, genuine, hard working and committed people and they inquired how I could make such statements about the agency.  I informed them that I agreed with much of what they were doing but I inquired if it was worth £450 million and asked why certain rooms were empty 24 hours a day.  That is the problem with FÁS.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  However, I felt I had to respond to Senator Dardis' provocative interruption.</P>
      <P>The State agencies to which I refer are empires. They are not enterprising organisations, they merely provide grants.  In my opinion, the Minister ought to radically attack the root of the problem, namely, the grant structure and the grant mentality.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the process of political appointees to the board is set to continue.  During her time as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, the Minister introduced a novel way to appoint people to the board of the Environmental Protection Agency &mdash; EPA.  To some extent, that avoided the trap of making political appointments.  However, the Bill before us reverses the position.  We have not been served well by political appointees on the boards of semi-State or Government agencies.  The names of the same people crop up all the time on various boards.  I do not know what they will do if these agencies are finally merged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be to the Minister's credit &mdash; there is time for amendment &mdash; if she reconsidered the issue of political appointees.  She should state that appointments to the boards of these agencies will <Col N="1205" /> not be dictated by political considerations.  Above all else, grants are subject to political pressure.  In the past there were unfortunate cases which gave rise to unease in respect of the allocation of grants because of the presence of political appointees on these boards.  This would be a great opportunity to break that tradition, which is not practised particularly nobly in this country, and see if there is another way &mdash; as in the case of the EPA &mdash; to appoint people on merit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn, I am pleased the Bill was introduced in Seanad Éireann and that it will commence its passage in this House. The EPA legislation, which the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced during her time as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, is a good precedent in terms of legislation being introduced in this House and subsequently becoming law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to provide the statutory framework for the establishment of Enterprise Ireland and it represents a blueprint for the future of indigenous industrial development policy in Ireland.  It should be welcomed by every Member of the House &mdash; I am not surprised that Senator Ross opposes it &mdash; as another important element in underpinning the Government's commitment to providing the climate to allow home-grown business to develop and progress in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>It has been frequently stated that Ireland has enjoyed phenomenal and unprecedented economic progress during the past decade.  The House recently debated Objective I status and the need for a regionalised approach to securing this for certain parts of the country.  I made the point that the fact that we no longer qualify for Objective I status on the basis of our GNP and GDP figures is a matter of considerable celebration and successive Governments can take credit and satisfaction for that.  When we joined the Common Market on 1 January 1973 nobody expected wealth in Ireland to approach the European average, and that is to be greatly welcomed and celebrated.  That growth has been the product of a combination of factors, including the prudent management of public finances and the stability fostered by a succession of partnership agreements.</P>
      <P>There are other factors at play, especially at political level, which have contributed significantly to growth but are frequently overlooked. It is important politicians state this, particularly in regard to changes in taxation.  A decade ago the standard rate of corporation tax was 50 per cent; it is now 32 per cent.  Capital gains tax on investments is down to 20 per cent.  The founder of the Progressive Democrats Party, Deputy O'Malley, can take considerable plaudits for what has taken place in the area of income tax and the role he, the Tánaiste and others played in reducing the rates of personal taxation from a high of 56 per cent to 46 per cent for the top rate and from 32 per cent to 24 per cent for the basic rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> That creates the investment climate which attracts outside industry and people to invest in indigenous businesses who will put in the effort because they see there will be a reward.  For too long people who were prepared to work hard, invest in their business and work in the interest of the country were not adequately rewarded.  This fundamental change in taxation has been central to creating an enterprise environment.  The IDA and others can take a great deal of credit for what they have done, particularly in respect of inward investment, but those who created this environment should also be recognised.</P>
    <P>It is up to politicians and the Government to provide the proper business climate where people can be successful and be rewarded.  That pro enterprise climate has contributed to unprecedented employment growth throughout the economy in the manufacturing and service sectors. Evidence of this new climate of economic growth is to be found in the ever increasing number of foreign investment projects which choose to locate in this part of Europe; this should be celebrated also.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to attract more than its fair share of new projects from the United States, especially in the hi-tech industry where the amount of inward investment in Ireland relative to the rest of Europe is extraordinarily high.  Foreign direct investment continues to be an important source of new jobs for the economy and our performance in attracting projects on this scale is all the more remarkable when set against the strong international competition that exists in the global marketplace for much mobile investment. The fact we are competitive in that environment is something from which we can take a great deal of satisfaction.</P>
    <P>However, it is vital we encourage the development and growth of a strong indigenous industrial base and we simply must not make the mistake of putting all our eggs in one basket &mdash; foreign direct investment.  We know how volatile some of these industries are, particularly in the hi-tech area where they can expand and decline rapidly. We must be conscious of that and underpin what has taken place with a strong indigenous base which can survive shocks to the system as a result of high profile losses in the hi-tech sector.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the development of the indigenous sector of the economy raises a number of complex issues and in order to address the key deficiencies which arise they must be dealt with. In particular, we must ensure the constant availability of affordable finance to fund the capital requirements of fast growing companies and encourage firms to grow beyond their traditional boundaries.  Frequently, the difficulty of securing affordable finance is one of the main impediments to the development of companies that would otherwise be vigorous and expand.</P>
    <P>More than 80 per cent of Irish owned companies are small and medium enterprises employing fewer than 250 people while more than 50 per cent employ between 11 and 100 people.  Such <Col N="1207" /> enterprises play a vital role in most developing economies and Ireland is no exception to that rule.  It is important we recognise and cater for the special requirements of these small firms because their requirements and role in employment creation were neglected too frequently in the past.  All the focus and attention has tended towards inward investment and not small and medium enterprises which provide the foundation for many jobs in the economy.</P>
    <P>The development of indigenous industries means encouraging diversification away from traditional sectors, even though a great deal has been done in the food sector.  Diversification means generating increased profitability, thus providing funds for new investment.  Business is about profit and frequently in their dealings with business State agencies neglect the fact the only route to success in business is profit.  &ldquo;Profit&rdquo; is not a dirty word and if Irish companies are profitable they will be successful.  Diversification also means encouraging greater activity in research and development.  A glaring deficiency in recent years is the absence of adequate research and development in companies which are the focus of the Bill.  There will also be diversification into non-traditional markets abroad.  We are aware of the vulnerability of the economy which has a large dependence on the UK market.  In the context of the single currency, there is potential for difficulty but it is important we diversify into other markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland's industrial base must develop in tandem with overall economic progress.  Growth and survival make it imperative for firms to reduce their dependence on the domestic market.  Our approach to the future development of indigenous industry must take into account these factors and provide responses that meet the needs of the client in the marketplace.  This comes back to Senator Quinn's point that the focus of all these initiatives must be the client.  In the past, it was often the case that the focus was on bureaucratic and administrative systems rather than on the client which these organisations were there to serve.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland should be client focused and that is why the Bill is important.  A key function of Enterprise Ireland in terms of meeting the needs of client firms will be to first identify the precise nature of the requirements of those firms. This is not as much of a problem with foreign firms locating here which are more than likely already established and successful in their home markets and can be expected to have the appropriate internal financial and marketing structures already in place.  The needs of indigenous firms, however, will be more complex and range across a variety of commercial activities.</P>
    <P>Such firms are faced with the prospect of having to deal with three independent agencies, Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and FÁS.  Between them, they administer more than 45 schemes aimed at assisting native companies.  Is it any <Col N="1208" /> wonder people who are trying to set up and develop businesses are confused when there is such a number of schemes and agencies to deal with?  In addition, there is a multiplicity of agencies at local level with Leader groups, county enterprise boards and area based partnerships and there is an urgent need to rationalise them.  I understand there are different schemes and sources of European funding but it should be possible for somebody wishing to start up or develop a business locally to go to one source for a response.  That is why the report prepared by the Department, which has resulted in this legislation, is welcome.</P>
    <P>The diffuse nature of these available supports understandably leads to confusion and frustration among client firms and means the State is not providing the most effective support possible to ensure they meet their full development potential. By combining the relevant functions of the three agencies the State will be in a better strategic position to address their needs.  In this regard I was impressed by the Minister's emphasis that the new agency would be in a position to meet the real needs of its client firms.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross also made reference to the grant culture and the increased provisions in two sections regarding the amount of moneys that would be made available.  However, the existing thresholds date back to 1981, even though we are concerned with 1993 legislation.  When one takes inflation into account it is reasonable that the figures should be increased to their present extent. The Senator is incorrect in his assertion about the grant mentality.</P>
    <P>This legislation should mean avoiding the old pitfalls of addressing the needs of firms on the basis of throwing a range of supports into the air in the hope that some of them reach the right spot.  The emphasis will be on a narrow focus aimed at identifying real needs in indigenous firms.  This new approach is to be encouraged as it seems clear it will result in better targeting of available resources and consequently a better return on the State's investment through growth and sustainable employment and better overall performance of the companies.  It is reasonable for the State to expect a return on its investment.</P>
    <P>It seems clear from the Minister's speech that significant benefits will accrue to the client firms. They will benefit from a more comprehensive and complete response to their needs and will find it much easier to access the various supports available. The expertise available in the development agencies will be brought together in a more cohesive unit, ensuring it is correctly targeted in areas of weakness where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>With Senator Quinn I was extremely critical when legislation was passed by the House in 1993 providing for the separation of Forbairt and IDA Ireland and the creation of another layer on top of them called Forfás.  As Senator Quinn said, it was a crazy arrangement and I do not see why it was considered necessary.  However, I differ from Senator Quinn in the conclusion from the criticism <Col N="1209" /> we both made of the separation of IDA Ireland and Forbairt.  I believe this legislation is a move back in the right direction in terms of bringing some coherence and cohesion into this area. The single entity approach will also allow a better monitoring of the effectiveness of individual supports, thus ensuring optimisation of the results at both departmental and agency level.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister also outlined the mission statement of Enterprise Ireland.  It is a refreshingly simple statement in that its aim will be to help client companies to develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to increased profitable sales, exports and employment. This returns us to the need to ensure that these companies make profits and that Enterprise Ireland is customer oriented and not just a self perpetuating bureaucracy and administrative edifice.</P>
    <P>The simplicity of the mission statement should not allow us to become blind to the important and complex task that lies ahead of the new agency.  Enterprise Ireland comes into being at a time of unprecedented economic growth.  Expectations for the future are high and the focus must be on continuing to ensure future economic prosperity for the benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland will be a key element of the Government's strategy in this regard.  It will be an agency with an important range of functions all aimed at improving the relative performance of client firms.  The size of this task should not be underestimated but is one which the new agency will be ideally placed to undertake.  It represents an important and radical change in the State's promotion of the support for indigenous industry, builds on past successes and looks to the future with confidence.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to ministerial appointments. It is appropriate that agencies of this nature should be subject to ministerial appointment. Given the modest levels of remuneration &mdash; in many instances there is none &mdash; it is surprising that people of significant calibre and business experience who hold senior positions within companies are prepared to take places on State boards and work unselfishly and willingly in the service of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 8(1) is a welcome provision in that it deals with what the Minister may or may not do in terms of general policy directives.  Section 8(2) provides that the directives which the Minister might give</P>
    <P>. shall not apply to any individual industrial undertaking or to giving preference to one area over others in regard to the location of an industrial undertaking otherwise than as a part of the general review of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>That precludes the so-called political interference route in terms of locating industry in certain areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The other provision related to this is the disqualification for Members of the European Parliament, Houses of the Oireachtas and county <Col N="1210" /> councillors.  I have always taken the view that county councillors should not be excluded from the membership of State boards because frequently their experience and expertise can be of significant value.  However, in this instance it is right that county councillors or other elected representatives should not be able to serve on the board because of the capacity which might exist to create an unlevel playing pitch and to ensure that investment goes to specific areas.  That would not be correct.  There should be a much more objective assessment than that.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in the past has been perhaps too much attention on inward investment, even though it has been extremely important and very beneficial from the point of view of job creation.  However, the indigenous sector has sometimes felt left out of initiatives taken by the State to help industry and small business.  I hope this legislation will address that imbalance and that the focus will be a balanced one between the need for inward investment and the need to help develop our indigenous industries, to make them competitive and to enable them bring their products to foreign markets with confidence and to sell them there at a profit, which in turn will reflect well on the economy and the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that certain elements of the Culliton report, which was a seminal document and should not be forgotten, are being taken on board in this legislation.  I also welcome the fact that marketing, training and finance are not treated as isolated republics.  Companies are doing all these things at the one time and require an overall and integrated approach when dealing with their problems in these areas.  I welcome the legislation and I hope it will be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's agreement to initiate this important Bill in the Seanad. It is good to see the initiation of important Bills in this House.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide a merger of Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála and to include elements of FÁS with regard to work experience training.</P>
      <P>In her speech the Minister said she expected the proposals to be criticised on the basis that they appear only to be moving the deckchairs rather than being concerned with substantial matters. Such criticism is justified to some degree.  We are all anxious to ensure that structures are in place to provide the best service with regard to research and development advice for companies trading in this country and abroad.  One must examine whether the benefit of changing titles without changing the functions of organisations or merging elements of organisations and thereby depriving another organisation of one of its core areas will have sufficient effect on the operation of the companies.  One must also consider whether the disruption is worthwhile in terms of the morale of the remaining staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will FÁS respond to the fact that one of its critical areas regarding work training will be taken away?  This is its most important area and <Col N="1211" /> its most relevant function in terms of its link with industry.  The main complaint from the Small Firms Association in the past has been that there is not enough people with in-house skills whom they can employ.  FÁS traditionally has provided this type of skills training to people in the marketplace, but this area will be removed from it.  What will be its response?  Has FÁS been consulted? How will it respond to the fact that this key area which it developed will be taken from it and merged with another organisation?</P>
    <P>One aspect concerns the two organisations which will be directly affected, but what about the organisation which will be deprived of some of its staff who will be seconded initially and then, by direct order of the Minister, deployed in a fulltime capacity in the new organisation?  Will staff be taken from FÁS?  This is not clear from the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of this exercise is to provide a super agency which will be a one stop shop for services related to industrial development, competition, marketing and training, why did the Minister not spread her net wider?  Why did she not involve the other areas of job creation or industrial development, such as the multiplicity of agencies which have been established over the years?  What are the Minister's plans regarding the partnership boards which operate in approximately 38 areas?  They have a role in relation to marketing and company development in the small and medium sized sector.  What are the Minister's views in that regard?  What are her views about the county enterprise boards?  They are also involved in employment and industrial development.  What is the position with the Leader programme?</P>
    <P>The Minister has concentrated on some areas but not on others.  She has concentrated on marketing, industrial development and specific skills training, but this is out of kilter with her proposals. If she wants a specific agency to replace Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála, why did the Minister not stick to the area of development and marketing?  She has extended the brief to include skills training.  She has included some elements of FÁS but omitted others.  FÁS will be hung out to dry.  It will be without any support mechanisms and its morale will be severely dented.</P>
    <P>In terms of mergers and the creation of a super agency, what will be the detritus?  What will be the effect on morale when one element is chosen to be part of the new agency but others are omitted? The new agency may leave staff members with sore heads in relation to their treatment and also affect other agencies in terms of their functions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The mission of Enterprise Ireland is to help client companies develop a sustainable, competitive advantage, leading to increasing profitable sales, exports and employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> However, this is the mission statement of Forbairt, the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and every other body involved in job creation and increasing exports.  It is nothing new, but the Minister presented it as if it were a bright, fresh and new mission statement that she suddenly discovered and which will be introduced to create a sustainable environment with profitable sales, exports and employment.  However, Ireland has been exceedingly successful in terms of sales.  If it was not selling products or marketing successfully abroad, it would be difficult for it to create the current level of prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Minister's intention is good but her practice raises a huge number of questions.  I considered the Minister would have taken a different approach in relation to putting more resources into developing indigenous industry to ensure that it is more competitive in addition to dealing with the staffing of the new bodies.  The Minister has fallen on both counts.</P>
    <P>The fastest rate of development has taken place in the computer industry and Ireland is to the forefront in the software sector.  However, there is approximately the same number of people employed in small and medium sized indigenous companies as there is in multi-nationals in the computer industry.  Yet there is ten times the level of productivity in the computer sector in terms of output compared to the indigenous industries.  The multinationals are either performing ten times better with the same number of employees or there is a problem regarding the sourcing of profits through Ireland because of the tax régime.  I ask the Minister to address this point.  It is one of the conundrums facing that rapidly developing industry at present.</P>
    <P>In terms of the development of indigenous industry, the key area is investment and the provision of money for research and development. The Minister said that 55 per cent of small indigenous companies are not involved in research and development.  However, has this area been supported?  What contribution has the Minister and the Government made to research and development?  It is difficult to expect small and medium sized companies to put money into research and development when, by definition, they have a low level of profit and a limited number of staff.</P>
    <P>One cannot expect them to be pro-active in that area because they are by nature parasitic industries.  They feed off and into larger companies. They will not provide the seed funding for research and development unless the Government is prepared to put a package together to assist them.  This is the key area on which we should concentrate rather than creating new names for a new agency.</P>
    <P>I attended a conference recently on the EUREKA project.  I doubt if many Members have heard of it.  Perhaps the Minister of State or his advisers heard of this but I was not aware of it and I doubt anyone else in the Chamber was. The EUREKA project consists of 26 countries <Col N="1213" /> across Europe who are involved in research and development.  Ireland is one of those countries but we have only made a small contribution to facilitating our small and medium sized industries to become involved in this area.  EUREKA operates specifically for that purpose; if a private company has a research and development project, the State provides a funding element and partners in another country help to defray the cost.  It is an ideal way to conduct research and development and to meet markets abroad, yet the most Ireland has contributed has been £1 million and we have few projects &mdash; since it started about six years ago we have averaged two projects a year.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister talk about a new super agency which will do so much work when the existing framework is under-resourced?  Surely she is putting the cart before the horse.  She has this wonderful idea of merging our flagship agencies &mdash; Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and FÁS &mdash; but she is denuding FÁS of its major component and is trying to make a name for herself by creating a super agency from the other two, without any indication that the disruption will not be greater than the benefits which will arise.  If we want to concentrate on indigenous industry we should supply the support mechanisms.  The Minister decried the grant system but that has served us well in attracting industries from abroad and it has been well used.  In this changing climate, unless we put resources into research and development and are pro-active with funding and advice we will not get anywhere.  Creating a new title, which seems to be the Minister's response, will not work.</P>
    <P>There is little or no awareness among the Small Firms' Association and ISME about the EUREKA programme.  How is it advertised?  It is not seen on the television or in the newspapers. How are the small industries who could avail of this to establish research projects and develop their workforce being informed?  What level of funding is the State prepared to put into projects? I understand it is quite low.  There is an awareness problem and existing mechanisms are not being used to the maximum.  The Minister should address that point before embarking on another titular policy direction without an indication of the substance behind it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also put the cart before the horse in the staffing of the new agency; I am worried about sections 18 and 19 which cover this area.  Staff will initially be seconded to Enterprise Ireland from the two current agencies and under section 18 the new agency will assume the role of employer and employ the staff directly.  However, section 19 provides that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will establish by order that staff will be transferred to the new agency.  She will assume the role of dictator and determine that staff will be deployed from the two bodies to her new, super, shining organisation.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to happen after collective bargaining but when will that take place and why has <Col N="1214" /> it not happened already?  The staff of the agencies do not know what is happening.  The new chief executive officers, Mr. Dan Flinter and Mr. Pat Molloy, will have to deploy staff and deal with redundancy packages before they can consolidate the organisations into a unit which will progress our competitiveness, research and development capabilities, and everything else intended.  We are unlikely to have an efficient service in the short term if those matters must be dealt with initially. Why did the Minister not sort all this out before the new agency was established as a statutory body?  Why have negotiations not taken place with unions and staff?  The level of consultation leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I want a thriving small and medium sized enterprise sector.  At the moment 50 per cent of our industries are multi-nationals and 50 per cent are indigenous, so we need to increase our indigenous sector.  Resources and Government support for existing agencies are required rather than the replacement of these agencies.  Too often we have expected that a new title will solve the problem when all it provides is a different name. It does not provide substance in the form of determination, commitment, resources and training. There will be so much fallout from the changes to FÁS &mdash; its interface with industry will be hived off &mdash; that it is difficult to see how it can continue in its present form.  I have many queries about this legislation and I await the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is welcome legislation and I look forward to the Minister of State's response to Second Stage.  He has taken a hands-on approach to his post which is similar to the philosophy behind the Bill.  It reflects the Government's approach to the challenges of the millennium and beyond.</P>
      <P>Several issues arise from the research and comment on the Government's proposals to amalgamate the various boards.  During last year's British general election, the current Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, was asked what were his Government's priorities for job creation and competitiveness. He said there were three &mdash;&ldquo;education, education, and education&rdquo;.  We could paraphrase that in this State by saying we need investment, investment, investment.  The Government has recognised the threat to Ireland's competitive edge and the challenges which EMU and the introduction of the euro will bring.  It has moved quickly to coordinate and rationalise the various State agencies responsible for job creation.  It is interesting that all the information I have received from sources in the business sector indicates that Ireland is at a crossroads.  We have achieved significant development and an impressive economic performance over the past few years but we are in danger of losing much of that unless we adapt to changing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a believer in adapting the US style of entrepreneurship and the culture of job creation. <Col N="1215" /> Mr. Peter Sutherland, a man who commands enormous international respect, in a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 April, under the heading &ldquo;Sutherland supports a US approach&rdquo;, stated that EMU will mean the survival of the fittest and that we need to examine areas such as competition in the public service and computer investment.  He said that the Republic of Ireland and Europe were failing in computer literacy.  In the US, 54 per cent of people use a PC on a regular basis whereas the highest rate in Europe is 33 per cent. He added that with EMU approaching we need to move rapidly to address such gaps between Europe and the United States.  He also said that European politicians, and by implication Irish politicians, must ask themselves the question which I have often asked as a member of the National Economic and Social Forum, why is unemployment in the US running at historically low levels while European unemployment is at unprecedented high levels?  Mr. Sutherland states that &ldquo;one of the reasons for this is that America has a great entrepreneurial culture, where start-up businesses are facilitated and access to capital is made easier&rdquo;.  He pointed out that more than 7,000 initial public offerings have been made in the United States compared to just 720 in Europe.  He said also that there was the attitude to capital in Europe whereas competition in the US thrives.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the competitive council, Mr. Brian Patterson, in an interview in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 2 October 1997, stated that as Ireland shoots up the global competitiveness league, some are questioning the need for a new competitiveness council.  A recent study shows that it costs as much to hire one Irishman as it does to hire 80 Chinese men.  That is not as bad as in Europe where studies indicate that it costs the same to employ one German, two Americans, five Taiwanese and 128 Chinese men. As European economies creak under the weight of hulking social welfare systems, Mr. Patterson believes that industry in the EU is vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated and low cost countries in the Asian Pacific rim.  He also refers to the availability of skilled labour and the skills shortages which are manifesting themselves in certain areas of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has arisen many times is the significant statistic that Irish owned industrial enterprises remain closely linked to the UK market. The Minister mentioned this in her opening remarks.  The destination of 45 per cent of all Irish manufacturing exports is the UK.  Currently we are taking advantage of sterling's strength. The competitiveness of the sector is dangerously vulnerable to another prolonged bout of sterling weakness, a real possibility in the event of the UK exercising its monetary union opt out.  In spite of the best efforts of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and his recent positive comments on Britain's attitude to the euro, it is almost certain that it will take up to five years <Col N="1216" /> before the UK will enter the system.  Currently all the social indicators suggest that sterling will go through another bout of weakness over the next 12 months, that sterling and the IR£ will reach parity by the end of the year and that Ireland may be trading above parity to sterling when it enters the EMU system from 1 January.  This is a scenario which, according to a recent ESRI report, could see Irish industry lose thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>We need to retain a competitive edge.  That is what this legislation is about.  Mr. Patterson stated the only way we can create new wealth is by competing in international markets.  Without increased wealth we cannot improve the standard of living, reduce unemployment and improve the quality of life.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Minister's proposals in this Bill, I wish to refer to the impressive economic performance of the state of California.  Why should I refer to California rather than any other state in America or any other part of the world? California is the world's seventh industrial power. It constitutes 25 per cent of total US trade and yet even in an economy of this size, it was foresight on the part of the state itself that many of the old habits which had made California the most popular state in the US throughout most of the post-war period, did not replicate in the early 1990s.  The Californian political elite realised that the twin threats of Asia and free capital movement had moved the goalposts dramatically and it was up to the state to react or sink.</P>
    <P>At the moment, to draw a further comparison between California and the EU, the EU spends only 10 per cent of its total investment bill on information systems as opposed to 25 per cent in the US.  This must increase.  If we look more closely at the trends in the United States, we see they would give us a better snap shot of Europe in 2010 than any number of EU summit communiqués. One of the most interesting developments in the US has been this revival of the Californian economy.  In the past ten years California has survived earthquakes, the collapse of its defence industry, the greatest bankruptcy in US municipal history in Orange County and a net outflow of population.  Not only has it survived, it is now the fastest growing region in the United States.  The turnabout, while dramatic, offers food for thought.</P>
    <P>In 1991 General Motors shut down its California plant, a move which coincided with the end of the Cold War.  Thus the car and defence orders, the two mainstays of the Californian economy, were undercut.  The industries collapsed almost overnight.  California lost 730,000 jobs between 1991 and 1993.  However, since 1994 all these jobs have been replaced.  Last year 43,000 new businesses were set up because the state diversified away from defence related industry. There are now more than 875 firms of which half were founded in the past five years.  Those firms are involved in the multimedia business.</P>
    <P>These figures seem to suggest there is a need for some form of mechanism to be responsible for <Col N="1217" /> the indigenous sector in this country.  There is no entrepreneurial culture in this country.  Parents, because of their traditional belief that a job is for life or because of a certain snobbishness, tend to encourage their children to have more traditional occupations, such as doctors, lawyers and nurses. There is nothing wrong with that but there is a need to develop an entrepreneurial culture.  This matter first emerged in the Culliton report.  I am interested to know if the Minister has any views on this aspect of Irish society.</P>
    <P>All the statistics indicate that we have an unhealthy dependency on inward investment. The number of foreign owned companies providing jobs in this economy is at an all time high. There is a real danger that the boom will be followed by a bust no matter what we try to do.  We should be prepared for that eventuality and we should introduce contingency plans to ensure that indigenous Irish industry is encouraged to expand.</P>
    <P>An interesting comment was made by a person in industry who said that because of the success of the Celtic tiger there was a growing number of BMWs in the Dublin area, many of which were bought by self-employed people with their own companies.  These companies employ 15 to 20 people.  When surveys were carried out to inquire of these companies what type of research and development they had done and budgets they had provided before expanding their workforce and developing new markets, the response was that they were doing all right and they had enough money to buy a BMW or a Lexus.  The people who supply the Lexus in this country, which costs in excess of £50,000, exceeded their target for the year in the first quarter.  If the survey had been more detailed, it would have discovered that such cars could be found along the east coast.  The Celtic tiger has created an entrepreneur who is happy to generate sufficient wealth for themselves, their family and their immediate needs. Once they are able to go on two or three holidays a year and pay their 15 or 20 employees, they do not concern themselves with further expansion.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome because it draws together the various agencies to ensure a more competitive edge.  A recent report, of which the Minister is aware, was harshly critical of the manner in which the operational programme for industrial development was implemented over the past five years.  It blamed State agencies and Departments.  Although the Minister did not refer to that in her contribution, it is obvious that the key people in her Department were, on the basis of that confidential report, alert enough to realise that there was a need to address the deficiencies in the infrastructure which has been in place for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The final message should be that we cannot afford to be complacent and that irrespective of the enormous economic growth which this country has enjoyed and will continue to enjoy for some years to come, there are inherent weaknesses in the grant aid and subvention structure <Col N="1218" /> and in the level of encouragement being given to the development of indigenous industries.  As a result of that thinking and philosophy and of the warning bells which have been ringing in the Department for the past couple of years, this legislation is before the House today.  I wish it well and I hope it goes some way towards ensuring that this country retains its competitiveness well into the millennium and is therefore able to sustain the prosperity we are beginning to enjoy at long last.</P>

      <P>Is onóir dom teacht anseo chuig an Teach iontach seo chun freagra a thabhairt don díospóireacht thábhachtach a bhí againn faoin gcomhlacht Státurraithe nua, Fiontraíocht Éireann, atá á chur ar bun ag an Rialtas.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil do gach Seanadóir as ucht an pháirt a ghlac siad san díospóireacht thábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed that in the creation of this new agency there will be a lessening in focus on the vital function of marketing which was carried out by An Bord Tráchtála.  I reiterate the Tánaiste's assurance that that will not happen.  Any attempt to address the problems of Irish indigenous industry must, if only because of the small size of the Irish market, have a major export led dimension as no individual company can hope to survive without proper emphasis on the marketing needed to succeed in commercial markets both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland will be crucially focused on marketing, but the difference is that it will not be solely focused on marketing, training, technology or finance.  Different companies have different needs, whether because of the type of market they are in, the stage of their development or the skills of their management team or owners.  Some companies will need marketing assistance but they may not have the right products at a particular time or stage of their development.  It may be more appropriate for them, after a joint assessment of their needs, to engage in a product development programme to enable them to move with changing market tastes.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland will have the integrated skills and resources to assist and advise the client firm on which is the right course of action.  There will be no need for the company to create different applications in order to draw from the different pots of taxpayers' money, as was the case up to now.  There will be no temptation for the client development executive to encourage a company to accept a possibly inappropriate targeted marketing consultancy or Measure 1 research and development grant in order to meet his internal agency targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for science and technology, I am well aware that concerns have similarly been expressed about a loss of emphasis in the new <Col N="1219" /> agency on science and technology.  The officials in the Department, who engaged in an exhaustive round of consultations with representatives of management and unions in the three agencies, the Irish Research Scientists Association, the Irish Exporters Association and others, told me it was notable that each sectoral interest was concerned that there would be a downgrading in their particular area or interest.  The response they received from us was that no such downgrading was intended and that human resources, technology, marketing and production facilities are all important but they are not all equally important at all times to every firm.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'e tre</i> of Enterprise Ireland is not to do everything that each of its component parts was doing in the same way as before.  The objective now is to focus on the integrated needs of the client firm in respect of those activities and to deliver a responsive and effective service targeted on the company's real needs rather than on specific services provided by the agency.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on a specific concern which has been brought to my attention in relation to basic science.  There has been much discussion in recent months to the effect that basic research has been pushed off the Enterprise Ireland agenda.  This has stemmed from the emphasis placed on achieving focus in the activities of the new agency, so that only activities which will have at least long-term industrial benefits will be carried out by it, and on the grant approval profile of the National Research Support Board, otherwise known as the Measure 4 Board.</P>
    <P>While the 1998 Estimates allocations to the Office of Science and Technology were as high as ever, the allocation for basic research was only sufficient to fund carryover commitments from 1997, even though we allocated £2 million for basic research alone in 1997-8 which was absorbed by previous commitments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first of these, the Minister and I are determined that Enterprise Ireland will be focused on activities germane to the development of its indigenous industry client base.  The major benefit of the previous agency restructuring in 1993-4 was that IDA Ireland benefited significantly from such focus and, consequently, Ireland Inc.  benefited completely from the change.  The irony is that Forbairt, at whose clients, it could be said, the change was addressed, never achieved a similar concentration of focus.</P>
    <P>Basically, our fundamental research can continue to be assisted by Enterprise Ireland in accordance with the industrial relevance criteria of Enterprise Ireland's strategic remit.  This is a direction in which Forbairt, in conjunction with the Office of Science and Technology, has already been positively moving.  I should also point out that I have clarified the future position of basic research within Enterprise Ireland for the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, the Higher Education Authority and Forbairt, all <Col N="1220" /> of which I met yesterday.  ICSTI and the other bodies have advised me of the concerns expressed by researchers in third level colleges regarding this matter but I, as Minister of State for Science and Technology at both the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science, must add that I have a wider responsibility than that embodied in the future remit of Enterprise Ireland.  In that regard, I want to reassure all research scientists that there is no dilution in the Government's commitment to basic research <i>per se.</i>  I have already announced an additional £500,000 in 1998 to address the specific issue of Measure 4 approvals.  I am aware of the demand for further funding and I am examining the options available in this regard.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the Government, through the Department of Education and Science, has allocated an additional £3.5 million to be awarded to basic research this year.  We have provided two new funds with a gross value of £10 million for research development in innovation in Ireland this year.  The core of this new programme will involve putting in place a system of competitive bidding between third level institutions for submitted research programmes based on, and consistent with, the stated research policies and strategies of the individual institutions. Therefore, not only will Enterprise Ireland continue to fund the peer review system for basic research of an industrially relevant nature under its specific remit, but the Government is significantly augmenting the overall spend on basic research to underpin the future academic excellence of our superb third level system.</P>
    <P>This Bill is largely about the technical and logistical requirements which must be in place before Enterprise Ireland can become operational.  As such it may give the impression that what we are talking about is simply more shifting of the institutional or agency deckchairs. The Minister has already clearly demonstrated to the House that this is neither the intention nor the likely result.  The simple fact is that the changes embodied in this Bill will facilitate a radical change in the interface between the industrial development agency and its clients, present and future.  With sustainable competitive advantage as the objective and the business development model as a framework, Enterprise Ireland will be enabled to deliver a user-friendly client focused system of supports which is geared to the real development needs of Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan sought a guarantee of the same level of services to small businesses.  Subject to the proviso that there will be a clear distinction between Enterprise Ireland and the county and city enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland will be focusing on those small and medium sized enterprises which have the potential to grow and export.  The Minister has already clearly stressed that the new agency will not be merely delivering exactly the same as before, rather it will be assessing, in terms of its mandate, objectives and <Col N="1221" /> scarce taxpayers' resources, where its efforts can best be directed.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the county and city enterprise boards will continue to provide for all micro enterprise.  They will continue to support and care for all enterprises with a potential job creating capacity of ten jobs or less.  The success of the county and city enterprise boards has been phenomenal since their creation by us in 1992. They are locally based, properly focused and have a capacity to deliver a broader remit across all the sectors in their functional areas. Consequently I, on behalf of the Government, can confirm that the county and city enterprise boards are here to stay and will remain permanently domiciled as part of the enterprise family in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>As Senator Coghlan acknowledges, much of the thinking behind the proposals in the Bill, not just of the Bill itself but also of the new industrial policy which drives it, is the delivery of a simple and user-friendly service to all its client companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the vacant Pretty Polly factory in Killarney and spoke of the industrial needs of other towns in south Kerry. Enterprise Ireland will have a specific regional development mandate precisely to ensure a more even spread of projects throughout the country. IDA Ireland is offering specific premia to projects in its grant assistance package outside the major urban centres.  I can confirm that IDA Ireland is actively involved in marketing the Pretty Polly plant in Killarney.  It is currently in discussions regarding this project.  IDA Ireland will continue to market the plant until a new project is secured for the area.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn shares the diagnosis behind the Bill but does not like the particular prescription. In his view, An Bord Tráchtála should essentially be confined to its overseas marketing role, but the assessment carried out in preparation for the new agency specifically had advice from senior management in An Bord Tráchtála that it was vital that there is a clear and close link between the overseas marketing information and what is done in Ireland for company development.</P>
    <P>Forbairt has consulted extensively with its customers on the delivery of its services.  The virtually unanimous response was that there are too many schemes and too many agencies and what the customers want is a single point of contact from which to source State assistance and advice.  This has clearly been the message which has been given to the Government, the Minister, the Department and senior officials who have been involved in all these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross believes that we are too agency dependent and that we should get rid of all of these agencies altogether.  I can confirm that the Minister specifically considered all these options, including a scenario without agencies, which were addressed in the departmental review.  She satisfied herself that indigenous industry has not <Col N="1222" /> yet reached the stage where it could be totally self-reliant and that it would continue to need both advice and assistance to address the deficiencies which the Senator described earlier.</P>
    <P>Nobody would suggest that we should cease foreign direct investment, so it would be anomalous that we continue to assist overseas industry and ignore indigenous industry.  This would be economic suicide.</P>

      <P>Regarding the increase of financial thresholds in the Bill, the fact is that there is every intention to continue the current trend of reducing grant costs per job created.  This has been happening for the past ten years, with the cost per job being halved from a previous average of £20,000.  This trend will be continued by all State agencies as the economy grows.</P>
      <P>I can inform both Senator Costello and the House that there is no question of merely changing titles or moving agencies without changing functions.  It is precisely through the objective of sustainable competitive advantage and the vehicle of the new business development model that a new industrial development policy will be pursued by us.  There is no desire to create a super agency.  We have had extensive and intensive consultations regarding this Bill. Officials of the Department have been engaged in an unprecedented level of consultation with ABT, FÁS and Forbairt officials and staff, including consultation with members of SIPTU and MSF which included another meeting with SIPTU members of FÁS over the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello expressed concern about the <Col N="1223" /> future of FÁS and the morale of its staff after the creation of Enterprise Ireland.  Less than 3 per cent of the staff of FÁS will be involved in the move and comprehensive consultation is taking place with them on the transfer.  We are all aware of the EUREKA programme and are positive participants in it.  It is actively marketed by Forbairt and succesfully utilised in Ireland.  If the Senator wishes to have any details of it I will be delighted to make them available to him.</P>
    <P>The evidence is that productivity is as much related to sectoral positioning as to the ownership of the firm.  Indigenous firms in high-tech sectors tend to have productivity levels which are quite close to foreign firms in the same sectors.  This is the strength of enterprise, industrial development and job creation in Ireland.  Focusing on our indigenous industry, observing the needs and demands of multi-national industry in our country, fulfilling the sub-supply advising needs, and caring for the creation and expansion of an indigenous industry sector will eventually ensure that we have sustained, permanent economic development into the future.  If we do not make changes and re-focus, we could find ourselves overdependent on the multi-national sector and major technological and financial changes and international mobility would bring about an economic crisis.  We cannot allow that to happen. All our studies and programmes involve future step-by-step planning so that our economy will continue to grow.  Differences between indigenous and mult-national firms are often ones of scale.  Large foreign firms which are highly automated have, inevitably, higher productivity than small and medium sized indigenous enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am personally pleased that the Irish Energy Centre is being transferred, as a semi-State organisation, into the Department of Public Enterprise.  As  Minister  of  State  with responsibility for energy I was involved in the establishment of the Irish Energy Centre.  It was established in Forbairt at the request of the Department of Public Enterprise.  The overall role of the Irish Energy Centre is to promote awareness in energy efficiency both in industry and among the public generally.  As such, the centre provides a public service of excellent standard and more appropriately belongs in the Department of Public Enterprise than in Enterprise Ireland.  This is a positive and meritorious decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan asked if Enterprise Ireland would have sufficient focus.  The Government, in establishing Enterprise Ireland, is committed to ensuring that the functions of Enterprise Ireland are fully focused on the agency's mission of sustainable competitive advantage at firm level. As the Tánaiste indicated earlier this morning, two specific functions have been identified which do not concentrate on this overall mission.  They are the metrology functions of the Irish Energy Centre.  The reason for taking these functions <Col N="1224" /> outside Enterprise Ireland is that metrology has two distinct elements, legal metrology and industrial metrology.  Both functions are concerned with ensuring that weights and measures used in commerce &mdash; for example, in shops, pubs, petrol stations and livestock marts &mdash; and in industry are absolutely and legally accurate.  This is a regulatory, public good function.  In that context it is far better that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which is concerned with the regulation of standards, would have control of this function.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has done excellent work.  It is a tremendous State service and has great potential for future growth.  It competes with powerful international organisations which have a commercial brief and remit and I am confident that its role will be refocused to give it greater liberalisation in the future.  The transfer of the metrology function to the NSAI will strengthen the authority so that it can deliver a greater service across the industrial spectrum.</P>
    <P>The past century has been one of positive progress for this country.  Our State agencies have played a key role.  We are now in rapidly changing times and we face a new millennium with great optimism.  Political changes in this island and the attitude of people and political parties in all parts of the island create new opportunities for our country undreamt of in the past.  We must be constantly aware of the changes and the opportunities that exist and we must capitalise on them.  Enterprise Ireland is a new, enthusiastic and enterprising organisation with a clear remit to ensure that we have a constantly growing and sustained indigenous sector.  I am confident that the opportunities ahead will be acted on by this new organisation.  I hope it will have the absolute support of all political systems and politicians. Together we can ensure that the progress of today will sustain future generations.</P>

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a necessary and important <Col N="1225" /> item of legislation.  It is also particularly urgent for two reasons.  First, there is an immediate need to give the Commissioners of Irish Lights the legal powers to secure financing facilities for a new vessel.  Second, the enactment of certain provisions will trigger EU Commission approval for the implementation of two important support measures for the merchant shipping sector &mdash; the refund of employers' PRSI payments in respect of seagoing employees to key Irish ship operators and the introduction of a new personal income tax allowance for certain seafarers.  I will deal with each of these matters in more detail in my outline of sections 3 and 5 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>When I was before the Seanad dealing with the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997, since enacted, I indicated to the then Senator Seán Ryan that I would be taking action to deal with outmoded provisions affecting merchant seamen in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and elsewhere.  I am pleased to be before the House fulfilling in part that pledge with regard to certain legislation.  As a wise Cork journalist put it, &ldquo;Walking the plank is to become a thing of the past.&rdquo; The Bill is part of my effort to modernise the legislation dealing with our seamen and to respond to the changing requirements of our maritime sector.</P>
      <P>I take a personal interest in underpinning our merchant shipping industry with appropriate legislation.  This Bill not only repeals out of date 19th century penal sanctions for merchant seamen, but, importantly, increases penalties for breaches of safety regulations, allows EU nationals and corporate bodies to register ships in Ireland, provides limited special exemptions for certain classes of small passenger vessels and introduces a provision to provide a legal basis for the borrowings of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not intended as a comprehensive effort to modernise shipping legislation.  It repeals what would now be considered inappropriate, offensive and outdated penalties for certain behaviour by merchant seamen and introduces certain provisions into Irish law which are necessary immediately.  I propose to outline the Bill's provisions in some detail, putting before the House the reasons for the amendments I have made to the Bill since its publication.</P>
      <P>Section 1 repeals section 16 of the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act, 1875, thereby ensuring that seamen cannot be indicted for conspiracy in furtherance of a trade dispute.  Despite the fact that such a provision might never be used, its existence on the Statute Book is clearly undesirable.  The existence of the provision has been criticised by the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill removes the offence of desertion from the Statute Book by deleting a subsection from section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and repealing sections 222, 224, 225 and 238 from that Act.  As well as removing the offence of desertion and the 19th century <Col N="1226" /> penalties attaching to it, other general offences such as wilful disobedience and combining with others to disobey are also repealed.  Section 2 updates the penalties for offences under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and under subsequent merchant shipping legislation, except where specific penalties apply.  Examples of the types of offence involved would be breaches of section 428 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which requires a ship to be provided with lifesaving appliances such as lifeboats, life rafts and life buoys and breaches of collision regulations.  The maximum fine on summary conviction is £100 at present and it is proposed to increase this to £1,500, which is the level generally applicable at present.  The wording of section 680 of the 1894 Act is archaic and section 2 of the Bill includes a provision for its complete rewriting in terms which would appear in current legislation.  The section as redrafted provides for prosecution on indictment instead of as a misdemeanour and includes a standard provision for offences by bodies corporate.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the Dáil I undertook to take legal advice on the consequences of repealing in full section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to remove not only the offence of desertion as the Bill proposes, but also that of absence without leave.  I am aware that Senators may wonder why the provision is being retained. On the basis of legal advice from the Attorney General's office to the effect that the removal of an established system of penalties could have unforeseen and undesirable consequences if undertaken without proper consideration and full consultation with all relevant parties, I will leave the absence without leave offence on the Statute Book until such time as a more comprehensive revision of merchant shipping legislation can be undertaken.  This Bill is focused primarily on matters requiring speedy attention and is not, therefore, a suitable vehicle for a comprehensive revision of maritime law.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for a matter which requires speedy attention.  The European Court of Justice ruled in June 1997 that the operation of the Irish Ship Register infringed EU Treaty provisions.  The Irish authorities' view was that the requirements of EU law were satisfied because all EU citizens and corporate bodies were entitled to enter the Irish Ship Register following incorporatisation in Ireland.  However, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Irish register must be opened to direct access without the prior need to incorporate in Ireland.  This legislation is, therefore, urgently needed so that we may comply with the court's judgment. However, I intend to seek Government approval as soon as practicable to further modernise the legislation dealing with the Irish Ship Register. This will, of course, be done in full consultation with all relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Widening the nationality provisions in the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955, to enable all EU citizens and corporate bodies to have direct access <Col N="1227" /> to the Irish Ship Register will enable support measures for seafarers introduced by 1997 Social Welfare Regulations and the Finance Act, 1998, to be implemented.  The Commission has already approved the wording used in section 3 of the Bill to bring the operation of the Irish Ship Register into conformity with EU Law.  Any delay in the passage of this Bill will, by delaying the enactment of the provision dealing with the Irish Ship Register, postpone the repayment to certain Irish ship operators of refunds of PRSI paid by them in respect of seagoing employees.  The implementation of this benefit will be worth over £2 million a year to these employers.  Also dependent upon the passage into law of this section of the Bill is the provision of a new £5,000 personal income tax allowance for seafarers who work outside the State for at least 169 days in a tax year.  This provision, for which I argued strongly, was introduced in this year's Finance Act.  I am sure the House will agree that these benefits should be brought into operation without delay.</P>
    <P>In section 4 I propose a number of amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992.  This Act established a system for the licensing of boats carrying fewer than 12 passengers for reward and thus made such boats undergo a system of survey to ensure their suitability to transport passengers. However, the practical implementation of the provisions of the Act with regard to certain classes of boats has proved difficult.  For example, I refer to boats which carry employees or inspectors from time to time as part of their work rather than &ldquo;to or from their place of work&rdquo;, as defined in the 1992 Act, and to boats such as pilot boats where the personnel are experienced and trained in maritime matters.  I propose to exempt such classes by regulation and subject to such conditions as will ensure there is no consequent reduction in safety.</P>
    <P>Another class which lends itself to exemption, again under conditions as regards best practice in safety, are boats used in certain sporting activities where people are under instruction.  One must accept that the problem here is one of interpretation and that a small dinghy, for example, cannot be subject to the same stability and lifesaving requirements applicable to large passenger boats as, for example, there is physically no room for the requisite equipment.</P>
    <P>Many of the sporting activities to which I refer are conducted at adventure centres, and, while I accept that water sports constitute only some of a wide spectrum of activity sports conducted at such centres, I am nevertheless concerned that there should be a co-ordinated approach towards ensuring greater safety in all adventure sports, with particular reference to the monitoring and control of adventure centres which provide facilities for young people.  I have in this regard recently taken up with my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the possible introduction of a system of mandatory regulation of adventure centres.  A high level meeting <Col N="1228" /> between our two Departments will be held shortly to examine how this matter might be progressed.</P>
    <P>In this section I am also making provision for exemptions, again by regulation, in certain exceptional circumstances, for classes of boats operating from inhabited islands where there is no regular service by a licensed boat.  This provision addresses a social need for residents of islands where there is a small population.  I see this measure as a pragmatic, temporary solution to problems encountered by inhabitants of small islands without a regular ferry service.  However, as Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea, I would not like to see this situation continuing for an indefinite period.</P>
    <P>As a result of my concerns, I have recently asked my colleague with responsibility for the islands, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to examine the situation with a view to providing a long-term solution to the problems of inadequate landing facilities, both on the inhabited island and at the appropriate mainland point of departure, and to ensuring that safe access to inhabited islands is not compromised by the absence of suitable facilities.  Such infrastructural development would, in my view, serve to encourage the establishment of regularised passenger boat services to these islands.</P>
    <P>While exemptions may not be an ideal solution, they are, nevertheless, necessary in certain circumstances. I assure Senators that these exemptions will only be applied as is the case with other exemptions already provided for, in limited situations and only where I and my Department are confident that they are appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes two further amendments to the 1992 Merchant Shipping Act to make it more workable.  First, it enables ferry boats working in chains, which were excluded from the passenger boat and passenger ship provisions of that Act, to be brought into the system for survey and licensing and certification.  These vessels use traction power based on land and cables or chains to draw themselves across narrow sections of waterway. Second, it allows the use of unlicensed boats to carry passengers in genuine emergencies where it is necessary to secure the safety of a vessel, safeguard life at sea or otherwise prevent a marine accident.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, section 5 is required in order that the Commissioners of Irish Lights may make financing arrangements for a new ship for which they have already placed a contract with a Dutch shipbuilding company.  The vessel contract price is £15.6 million pounds sterling, or approximately IR£17.9 million.  However, I am pleased that I managed to secure EU grant aid of a little over IR£1 million towards the cost of the vessel. I am very grateful to the European Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Neil Kinnock, for their assistance.  The Commission has indicated that we can also apply next year for further EU funding which, if successful, would result in an additional grant of IR£675,000.  In addition, <Col N="1229" /> due to the fact that the ship is to be built in Holland, the Dutch Government has agreed to pay a grant of IR£800,000 on delivery of the vessel.  If these real and potential grants are taken into account the net cost of the ship would be approximately IR£15.4 million.  If anyone would like me to negotiate major purchases for them we can proceed along the same lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid that at the end it would cost us nothing.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights, an all-Ireland body, have statutory responsibility for the provision and maintenance of aids to navigation around the coast of Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands.  They are one of three general lighthouse authorities in these islands.  The Trinity House Lighthouse Authority has responsibility for England and Wales and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses service Scotland and the Isle of Man.  All three lighthouse authorities are financed from a single source &mdash; the General Lighthouse Fund, which is administered by the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions.  This fund derives its income principally from light dues levied on commercial shipping at ports in Britain and Ireland.  Light dues collected from shipping traffic at Irish ports are, however, insufficient to meet the cost of the elaborate system of lights required by Ireland's geographic position.  Under an agreement reached between Ireland and the UK in 1985 the Irish Exchequer pays the General Lighthouse Fund an annual contribution towards the cost of the service provided by the commissioners in the State.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the new vessel it has been agreed with the UK authorities that the General Lighthouse Fund will meet 65 per cent of its cost, with the remaining 35 per cent to be paid by the Irish Exchequer.  It was decided, with the agreement of the Department of Finance, that the most appropriate means of financing the ship would be through bank borrowing by the commissioners. The terms of the vessel contract require the commissioners to make six stage payments in sterling over the build period up to December 1999 when the ship is due to be delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners have had discussions with a commercial bank with a view to entering into agreements for the financing of the vessel.  They intend to, first, secure a short term loan facility for the construction period of the ship.  When the vessel is delivered the commissioners will convert the initial loan to an Irish tax based lease with a primary term of 15 years.  However, in the course of the commissioners' negotiations with the financial institution the question arose as to their authority to borrow money.  The Attorney General's Office advised that there are no existing legislative provisions which would allow the commissioners to enter into financial agreements to borrow money.  In the absence of legislation to <Col N="1230" /> rectify this deficiency the Exchequer is exposed to certain ongoing and potential further costs.</P>
    <P>The first stage payment on the vessel contract has been made out of the UK managed General Lighthouse Fund as an interim measure until the loan facility is put in place.  In the meantime there is a loss of interest from fund investment and it has been agreed that the Irish Exchequer will meet a proportion of this cost.  Moreover, bank interest rates are currently very competitive and it is most desirable that the commissioners are empowered to enter into financial contracts to avail of these rates as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the second down payment on the vessel will arise around the end of this month when the ship's keel is due to be laid.  It is, therefore, very important that the commissioners are legally empowered to borrow money in time to fund this and subsequent contract payments.</P>
    <P>The commissioners already have such powers in respect of Northern Ireland, under the UK Merchant Shipping Act, 1995.  However, it is not feasible for the commissioners to avail of these borrowing powers in respect of the new ship as they are domiciled in the Republic of Ireland.  It is, in any event, considered appropriate to confer these powers on the commissioners in the State in the interests of legislative comparability and having regard to the commissioners' responsibilities in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I wish to elaborate a little on the new vessel itself.  The new 80 metre ship will replace the existing light tender <i>Granuaile</i> which is now almost 30 years old.  The vessel will have the primary purpose of servicing offshore aids to navigation. The commissioners currently operate and maintain some 170 lighthouses, light vessels and buoys located off the Irish mainland.  The state of the art ship will be equipped with the very latest manoeuvring and positioning technology, allowing it to hold position very precisely for safe and accurate placement of floating aids.  Its design ensures multi-functional capability which will enable it to play an important role in search and rescue and pollution response.  The vessel has been specifically designed to meet the challenges of the north west Atlantic, and helicopter and refuelling facilities will be incorporated.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will be aware of the critically important part that aids to navigation play in vessel safety and in safeguarding life at sea. The ever increasing volume and speed of shipping traffic around our shores unfortunately brings with it a greater risk of accidents.  Ireland's extensive coastline and geographical position at the hub of transatlantic shipping means that aids to navigation provided by the Commissioners of Irish Lights are used not only by vessels plying to and from Irish ports, but also by a considerable volume of passing international trade.  It is essential, therefore, that our seas are protected by the best available equipment.  I believe the new vessel, which is both a timely and shining example of North-South as well as Irish-UK co-operation, will enhance the Commissioners of Irish Lights' <Col N="1231" /> ability to meet their servicing requirements into the new millennium, thereby further reassuring seafarers that their safety is in good hands.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, I would like to briefly refer to an issue raised by Senators Taylor-Quinn and Bonner on Committee Stage of the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997, since enacted.  The Senators expressed some concerns regarding the future use and preservation of lighthouses.</P>
    <P>I have looked into this matter, as promised, and can advise that the Commissioners of Irish Lights, in common with the other general lighthouse authorities in these islands, acknowledge they have a legal and moral responsibility to preserve the cultural significance of lighthouses and to enable their conservation, both for aids to navigation use and as historic structures.  Other lighthouse properties, such as adjoining land or dwellings, when of no further use to the Commissioners is offered for sale where appropriate, or leased or transferred to interested parties. We have an interest in some of that land and buildings from the point of view of the Irish marine emergency service because they could be very valuable and appropriate in developing our coastguard service, of which I hope to be able to announce further details later in the year.</P>
    <P>I have, in this regard, written to the chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to highlight my strong view that every effort should be made to preserve and maintain the historic and heritage value of lighthouse property for the benefit of the local community and for future generations.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the commissioners have already done some great work in assisting with heritage projects.  Surplus property at Mizen Head has been operating as a heritage centre for a number of years and it is proposed to operate a similar facility on lighthouse property at Hook Point.  In addition, property at the Skelligs has been transferred to the Office of Public Works. Examples of other projects are the leasing of buildings at Wicklow and Minehead to my Department for VHF radio communications stations.</P>
    <P>I have also written to my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, asking her to liaise, if she has not already done so, with relevant non Governmental organisations, at both national and local level, with a view to generating interest in the future of Irish lighthouses and developing a policy with regard to their maintenance as part of the built environment.  I trust this information and the steps which I have taken provides assurance to the Senators in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Act, 1997, to insert a new section to allow the commissioners to borrow money, including money in a foreign currency, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the <Col N="1232" /> Minister for Finance.  The total amount of moneys borrowed at any one time may not exceed £25 million.  This figure allows the commissioners some scope to borrow further moneys at some stage in the future if this is required.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the commissioners certain sums in respect of moneys borrowed by them.  Such amounts must be paid from moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  The section further provides that the equivalent in the State of moneys borrowed in a foreign currency shall be calculated by reference to the prevailing exchange rate at the time the moneys were borrowed.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill's final section, section 6 deals with the Short Title and collective citation. I amended this section on Report Stage in Dáil Éireann to remove the Bill's commencement provision. This now means that all sections of the Bill will come into effect with the Bill's enactment, that is, immediately.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and request Senators' co-operation and support in its speedy passage.</P>

      <P>Everyone will agree that shipping and the fishing industry are in decline in Ireland. However, I welcome the Minister's commitment to bringing some of our shipping laws out of the 18th century and into the present one.  It is remarkable that we have survived for so long with such archaic laws governing our seafarers.  Given all the restrictions imposed on seafarers over the years, the industry was more like a prison regime than a commercial operation.  I am glad the Minister has removed many of the restrictions governing seafarers and the laws governing shipping in general.  I thank the Minister for his initiative in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is in all our interests that Ireland and the EU have a common approach to safety standards and the conditions of vessels etc. We are often not competitive because people employed in the industry were forced to work in appalling and uncivilised conditions prior to this.  Those who wish to use our ports should be forced to adhere to the standards we set and to eliminate the possibility of all slave and cheap labour, especially coming from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have an interest in safety at sea.  The environment must also be protected from the possibility of disasters at sea.  During the House's recent discussion of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Senators outlined many of the eventualities which could happen at sea.  The <Col N="1233" /> Minister has taken some steps to safeguard our environment from such catastrophes, for which he is to be commended.  Some EU applicant countries are now being monitored by the EU Commission in this regard.  Some of them have very large shipping registers and it is important that they be obliged to comply with EU laws before they can gain membership.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of the need for safety, especially with smaller vessels.  An aspect of the Bill with which I do not agree is the allowing of vessels capable of carrying one to 12 passengers to be registered, which is rather ambiguous.  What about vessels which can carry 14 or 20 passengers? Is the life of a person who pays to be transported by sea more important than that of a man or woman working by the sea?  The Minister has a responsibility to address that ambiguity.  The provision is too ambiguous in its present form.</P>
    <P>Training is another important issue.  The shipping sector and those employed in it have suffered in the past through a lack of adequate training. Seafarers often come from low income backgrounds and have no training in seafaring. Many vocational education committees and third level colleges are anxiously seeking courses to compliment their curricula and the Minister should give serious consideration to establishing a training course in seafaring.  County Mayo and other areas on the western seaboard would provide a natural base for such training to take place. I am sure Mayo VEC, which is one of the most imaginative and progressive vocational education committees in the country, would give careful consideration to a programme which would incorporate training for those interested in seafaring.  I am aware that sea cadets are trained in County Cork but the training of seafarers is equally important and vocational education committees could play a role in this.  Most vocational education committees run plc courses but none of these offer the type of training to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The shipping sector is perhaps the only area where employment would be virtually guaranteed if proper training was provided.  There is a great shortage of suitably trained individuals in the merchant shipping industry.  That is why European shipowners are obliged to seek labour outside the EU.  At a time when the EU is promoting employment as a key target &mdash; this is stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam &mdash; we should examine the entire shipping sector in this regard.  We are aware there is a shortage of labour and that job opportunities exist.  Ireland can lead the way by setting standards and forcing the issue.  The Minister has gone some way towards addressing this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts in securing the £5,000 personal income tax allowance for seafarers. This is long overdue and it will do much to help seafarers and those involved in the shipping industry in general.  Far too many penalties were imposed on seafarers in the past and there was no incentive for young people to take up seafaring as <Col N="1234" /> a career.  The new £5,000 allowance will provide a great incentive and many young people who heretofore saw a career on the sea as a penal proposition will now see it as a commercially viable career opportunity.  The Minister has done good work in convincing the Department of Finance, which is no easy task, to part with money in this regard.  I am sure his efforts will be reflected by an increase in the number of young people who will take up a career on the sea.</P>
    <P>A number of Irish shipping companies have been successful and are expanding.  In my opinion the future of transport lies on the sea.  When driving to Dublin recently I was struck by the volume of commercial traffic on the roads.  When pondering alternatives I arrived at two conclusions. The first would involve encouraging all commercial transport to travel at night which would leave the roads clear during the day for other road users.  The other alternative would be to transport more commercial produce by sea.  Consideration must be given to the latter proposal because ships travel at night and they transport their loads from port to port in record time without inconveniencing people.  If we are to resolve the serious problems affecting our roads, we must consider better ways to transport more commercial produce by sea.</P>
    <P>In that context, additional and better ports are needed.  For some time I have advocated the provision of extra ports on the west coast in particular where produce must be transported 150 miles to the nearest commercial port.  This places an added burden on our infrastructure and, as many Members know, the roads in the west are not capable of taking an added burden.  Will the Minister give serious consideration to improving our marine infrastructure?  I am sure such improvements would pay off in the long term.</P>
    <P>In respect of section 4, which amends the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, the Minister referred to various companies transporting employees to their place of work, dredging operations, etc. I return to the criteria laid down in the Bill which will be used to licence ships and which are somewhat ambiguous.  These should be reconsidered in the interests of clarifying the position.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious of the need for ongoing inspections and the provision of safe vessels to transport passengers.  Safety standards should not be lowered regardless of whether someone travelling on a ship is an employee or a passenger, but particularly if that person is paying for passage. That should not be a factor.  I do not understand the necessity to include this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In respect of people who own vessels used for dredging operations or dumping at sea, I presume the latter will no longer be tolerated and I am glad the Minister has increased the penalties to be imposed on those who offend in this regard. This development is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to sporting activities at adventure centres and other water sports which usually take place during the summer months and are not subject to strict controls.  The provisions <Col N="1235" /> governing these activities are somewhat slack, and when personal safety is at risk legislation should contain no loose ends.  We should not send out a message that vessels used to transport paying passengers must be registered and inspected while those used to transport employees do not.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the reservations I have outlined, the Bill will take the shipping sector out of the 18th century and allow it to enter the modern era.  I know the Minister is conscious of what must be done to bring the industry further along the road to modernisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on the occasion of the introduction of the Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1997.  It is only seven months since I made my maiden speech on the Merchant Shipping (Commissioner of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997, and a section in this Bill relates to a section to be added to that Bill. On that occasion I invited the Minister to Burtonport and highlighted the need for funding for dredging there.  I thank him for visiting within such a short time and also for announcing the funding for the dredging.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the sections in the Bill, I wish to refer briefly to another maritime matter which the Minister dealt with recently.  I refer to the EU ban on drift net fishing for tuna and swordfish which, despite his arduous negotiations in the lead up to last Monday's meeting, only received the backing of our French counterparts in efforts to block it.  The result is another defeat for our fishermen and fishing industry, on this occasion due to the pressure from the Green agenda and its concern to save dolphins, whales and other preserved species.  I congratulate the Minister on succeeding in having the ban phased in over four years instead of the intended two.  It will take effect on 1 January 2002, a date on which the euro becomes the common currency.  On the same day we lose the punt we could also lose a valuable industry for many of our small fishermen, especially in the south-west.</P>
      <P>The Minister was given an indication that some extra EU fisheries reserve funds will be available. It is essential he continues to fight for additional funds for costly adaptations and compensation for loss of income to many small fishermen. While the industry had to live with curtailment due to scientific data and conservation in the past, the latest European initiative presents a dangerous precedent for our coastal communities which make their livelihoods from the sea.  They must not be allowed to suffer or possibly disappear due to political games.  Our fishing industry has not been treated fairly since the first day we entered the EEC.  We must prepare within our national plan to at least protect what we hold in the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with miscellaneous matters and it contains four sections which amend four Merchant <Col N="1236" /> Shipping Acts.  The changes are necessary due to the passing of time and matters arising due to events which were not legislated for in them. The provisions in the Bill take effect immediately on its passing and not by ministerial order as was originally intended.  I welcome the contents of the Bill.  It updates 19th century legislation with amendments that provide for 20th century circumstances. It includes provisions to allow EU nationals and corporate bodies to register ships in Ireland, something which was not envisaged in 1955 when the relevant Bill was enacted.  The Bill updates the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which dealt with safety aspects of certain types of ferry boats.  It increases the penalties for breaches of safety regulations and also provides for special exemptions for certain categories of small passenger vessels.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains a provision to empower the Commissioners of Irish Lights to borrow money for current or capital expenditure while the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Act, 1997, empowers the commissioners to continue to provide modern technology aids in the interest of maritime safety.  It does not provide powers for them to borrow necessary funding to provide such aids or other related matters as stated in this section.  Section 1 repeals section 19 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  This section left open the possibility that seamen could be indicted for conspiracy in the furtherance of a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>Section 2 repeals part of section 221 and sections 222, 224, 225 and 238 and part of section 680 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  It mainly deals with desertion from ships and compulsory detention and forced labour of merchant seamen in certain circumstances.  This is contrary to the European Social Charter and has been condemned by the Council of Europe.  The section repeals and amends out of date penal provisions in our general maritime law to reflect relevant International Labour Organisation Conventions and the Council of Europe Social Charter. Section 221(a), to be deleted, deals with punishment of desertion by seafarers with penalties involving imprisonment with or without hard labour. Sections 222, 224, 225 and 238 provide penal sanctions in respect of absence without leave, desertion and other offences by seamen.  Section 221(b) of the 1894 Act is not being repealed.  This deals with absence without leave.  The Minister received legal advice from the Attorney General on this matter and intends to deal with it possibly in the context of a comprehensive revision of merchant shipping legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was influenced by the 1995 UK Merchant Shipping Act which still provides penalties for absence without leave.  This indicates the continuing relevance of such a provision for a maritime nation.  Amending section 680 of the 1894 Act brings the penalties provided in line with present day norms.  The maximum fine will be £1,500 on summary conviction.  The current Bill replaces conviction as a misdemeanour by <Col N="1237" /> conviction on indictment.  Section 2 provides for offences committed by a body corporate and its relevant officers or others acting on behalf of it.</P>
    <P>Amendment of section 3 of the Bill is necessitated by a judgment in the European Court of Justice in 1997 which found that the operation of the Irish shipping register infringed EU Treaty provisions.  It will bring Irish law on the registration of ships and recreational craft in line with European Treaties.  It amends the 1955 Act to allow nationals of other member states of the EU or companies established in other EU countries to register on the Irish register on the same basis as Irish nationals or companies.  The amendment will also ensure EU approval for the implementation of the support measures introduced by the 1997 social welfare regulations where certain employers in the shipping industry claim refunds of employer social welfare contributions in respect of seagoing employees.  It will also ensure EU approval for the introduction of the £5,000 seafarers' tax allowances introduced in this year's Finance Bill for seafarers who are out of the State for more than 169 days per annum.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends the 1992 Act which dealt with the safety aspects of passenger ferries and other such craft.  It provides for the inclusion of ferry boats working in chains which were not included in the definitions of passenger boats or ships.  It brings this category of vessel into the licensing and certification process that applies to other types of passenger vessels.  I welcome this because the type of exercise carried out by these boats could be dangerous, especially as most of the vessels are very old.  The section also allows for the use in genuine emergency circumstances of unlicensed vessels in the interest of accident or pollution prevention or in a situation where members of An Garda Síochána or medical personnel need transport for urgent reasons.</P>
    <P>The section also allows certain categories of passenger boats to be exempted from the requirements to be licensed in certain circumstances. This could include pilot boats, tugs and certain small vessels which transport small numbers of islanders from isolated inhabited islands.  This may be necessary due to no landing slipways and where introduction of licensing requirements would cause abnormal costs.  There are many small islands off our coast to which this would apply.  The regulations specified under this section will lay down conditions with regard to the suitability of the type of craft to be used and the requirements necessary in regard to safety equipment.  Safety will still be a priority where boats exempted from licensing regulations will be used.  Provision is being made for penalties for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>Section 5 was introduced on Committee Stage when the Bill was before the Dáil.  The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Act, 1997, did not provide for borrowing powers for the commissioners. This was the opinion of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> The Bill provides that the commissioners can provide for capital or current expenditure by raising or borrowing money that includes currencies other than the currency of the State.  This can only be done with the consent of the Minister for Finance and upon terms and conditions allowed by the Minister.  The total borrowings cannot exceed £25 million.  All money shall be paid from money voted by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Money raised or borrowed in a foreign currency can only be the equivalent amount to that allowed in the State's currency.</P>
    <P>This legislation arises from the need by the commissioners to secure financial facilities to purchase the new vessel referred to by the Minister. It will cost approximately £18 million and will replace the existing vessel, the <i>Granuaile,</i> which is now 28 years old.  As the commissioners is an all-Ireland body, the vessel will be jointly funded by Ireland and Britain.  Our Exchequer will finance 35 per cent of the cost and the balance will be met by the general lighthouse fund administered by the British Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions.</P>
    <P>Due to the signing of the contract to build the ship, the need to protect against currency exchange rates in relation to sterling and the availability of favourable interest rates, it is urgent we pass the legislation today.  The first progress payment has been made by the lighthouse fund and we must now honour our portion of the commitment.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the new vessel will be to service navigational aids under the control of the commissioners.  It is equipped with the latest manoeuvring and listening technology and will assist in servicing offshore navigational aids, buoys, beacons and lighthouses.  It will have ground facilities and its design ensures a multi-functional capacity that will enable it play a part in search and rescue operations and in responding to pollution incidents.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the other House his Department is reviewing the state of the overall prevention and control facilities in dealing with oil pollution and hopes to acquire a separate oil pollution vessel.  There is much excitement and activity regarding the potential oil and gas finds off the west and north-west coasts in the Rockall basin and I compliment the Minister's efforts to have the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet approve funding for the development of Killybegs Harbour, which is the preferred onshore base of the exploration companies who are exploring for oil and gas off our coast.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House, especially in view of the urgency in implementing sections 3 and 5.  I appreciate the Minister's comments regarding the preservation of the lighthouses for heritage purposes.  There are a number of one man lighthouses in County Donegal which were not referred to.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's co-operation with his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The Minister of State at <Col N="1239" /> that Department is in contact with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources regarding the provision of facilities for the offshore islands.  In this regard I refer to the necessary extensions of the slipway and the deletion of rock in front of the slipway for the ferry service operating between Aranmore and Burtonport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this consolidation legislation.  I was unable to read the 1894 Act because a copy was not available.  I compliment the Department's involvement in changing the use of old lighthouses and surrounding buildings around the coast to heritage and interpretative centres, especially the one in Mizen Head, which I have not visited but which I have read about.  It is hugely important.  This development needs greater public attention.  It would be of great use in the teaching area.  It is an important part of our heritage and history.  Even to understand the basics of navigation would be hugely interesting in mathematical and scientific terms.  It would give people an understanding of the great feats of navigation undertaken daily by our ancestors in fishing boats.  I still do not understand how people in those days went out in small boats and in fog were able to return to the point of their departure. They appear to have acquired a sixth sense.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government for taking an interest in the preservation of our built heritage, which, in terms of local history, education and understanding our maritime past, has been neglected in our history books and in social commentary. It is a part of our life which we miss, apart from Tom McSweeney's excellent programme &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; on RTÉ, which is about the only time our maritime history and tradition are brought to our attention.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on island inhabitants.  I share his concern that the legislation will allow for the use of unlicensed ferries to carry people from certain inhabited islands from which there is not a licensed ferry service. We need to consider this carefully.  If we attach a value and importance to the lifestyle of people living on these small islands we need to invest money in them.  That is not happening at present. It is over two and a half years since I last visited Inishturk, which, at approximately 13 miles from the mainland, is probably the most remote of the inhabited islands.  There is no easy access to and from the island.  If I recall correctly, the jetty is not accessible at low water.  Although the island is developing its tourism, the only living for the inhabitants is in fishing.  In view of this, people cannot complain about providing the kind of investment which is needed and I ask the Minister to proceed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way to helping the Commissioners of Irish Lights in terms of developing their new support vessel and I wish them well.  I last debated the role of the commissioners here in connection with the unfortunate proposal to <Col N="1240" /> build the Loran C mast on Loop Head.  While I had a difference of opinion in my dealings with them I found them an extraordinarily impressive group who were very committed to their work. They were the kind of public servants we would be proud to have represent us in any area.  I am delighted the Bill allows them to develop their work a little further.</P>
    <P>I note part of the work of the commissioners is not included in this Bill.  With regard to the buoyage used along our coasts, there appears to be a lack in the application of the European Convention. While there are certain general signs which are the same in England and Ireland, such as cardinal marks, the colours of buoyage on entering harbours and practical matters, such as safe water marks at harbour entries, have not been synchronised in European terms.  Those at sea will appreciate the work of the commissioners in keeping the buoyage up to date.  Yet, there are differences in colourings and markings when one travels, say, from Kilrush to Beleek through the River Shannon and the Erne waterways.  If I recall correctly, three different systems of buoys are used.  While port red and starboard green are used at the mouth of the River Shannon, a different system is used at Lough Erne.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there are different approaches to the management of boats in most parts of Europe.  I cannot glean from the legislation the type of licence a person requires before he or she can take control of a boat such as a cruiser.  The cruising fleets on the Shannon have been developed and their activities are highly valued.  On the Continent people are required to have licences before they can take control of some boats.  Do any issues in this area need to be considered?  I do not suggest the capacity of this business to develop should be reduced.  However, a life was lost in a tragic accident on Lough Derg recently and such events bring these matters to mind.</P>
    <P>In terms of the European approach to this area, there is close co-operation between Ireland and England regarding lifeboats, coastguard services and other areas.  This is most impressive. However, I am not aware of the same level of contact among the European partners.  I recently cruised along the English Channel but I was not aware of close contact between the French and the UK coastguard services.  They appeared to work separately, although there is regular co-operation between other services.  Will the Minister outline the position?</P>
    <P>Regarding the registration of ships, will the Minister explain the position in terms of flags of convenience?  Large merchant ships fly the flag of the port of registration.  However, what is the position regarding smaller boats and ferries?  The convention in this area is that the vessel flies the flag of the owner's country.  For example, an Irish person sailing into a UK port should fly the Tri-colour. I presume the reason for this is that the vessel may be subject to checks by the customs authorities.  If an Irish person can register a boat in another European country and he or she registers <Col N="1241" /> it in Poole in the south of England or Southampton, what flag should be flown on the vessel?  Will the Minister explain the position?  It is probably easily understood but I am a little at sea about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that people working at sea will be brought into a more modern industrial relations ambience.  Up to now people taking usual industrial relations action could have been charged with conspiracy and probably mutiny. People were not aware of this and I am sure my colleagues in the seamen's union will be pleased that this legislation will allow them to do their work.  However, this move raises particular issues in terms of the activities of certain groups controlled by the law at present.  Does the Minister have a record of the last time a person working at sea was charged with conspiracy?</P>
    <P>Although I did not read the original Act, I listened to the Minister but I am still unclear about the difference between desertion and absence without leave.  I presume absence without leave implies that a person intends to return at some stage.  One wonders what the position would be if they were picked up a year later.  The action regarding desertion, mutiny and conspiracy is being taken approximately 200 years too late. When one considers &ldquo;Mutiny on the Bounty&rdquo;, the legislation probably should have been rearranged a long time ago.</P>
    <P>It is always useful to tidy up legislation and I compliment the Department in that regard.  On this occasion the push undoubtedly came from the decent people in the Commissioners of Irish Lights who found, for the third year in a row, that they did not have the authority to do what was required of them and a change in legislation was necessary.  The role of this House will soon be discussed.  Part of the original intention of the Seanad was that it would be a reforming institution. Perhaps the Minister's Department might consider that old legislation in various fields could be dealt with effectively by this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and support its enaction. One cannot object to tidying up legislation.  My heart skipped a beat when the Minister mentioned Senator Taylor-Quinn because I assumed he would refer to Loran C.  I was recently at sea, out of sight of land, and I attempted to get my GPS location.  I looked through some cruising notes which referred to the Loran C chain. Regarding the Kilkee side, the notes stated that the system was to be in operation by 1997.  I wondered if I was in trouble but, thankfully, nothing happened.  The Minister is as good as his word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister held his position on that matter, although I suspect his personal view is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has discussed on many occasion in recent months the Shannon River Council Bill. This matter has been brought to the Minister's <Col N="1242" /> attention, but this legislation passed Second Stage in the House last year with the support of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Progressive Democrats and the Independents.  All sides are committed to the Bill and the Minister should trust Members to move it forward in the way he wants.  Nobody suggested that the Bill should not be amended.  It fits in well with the tidying up work the Department is doing in other areas.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon features in the news almost every week in relation to issues such as mussels, drainage problems and the quality of the water. It is obvious that a council is required to deal with the entire river.  This must be attractive to the Department because it would refer to the Department but also end the position where many Departments are responsible for different interests.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach is becoming uneasy because this matter does not relate to the Bill.  However, I urge the Minister to consider reintroducing the Shannon River Council Bill which has the support of all sides.  The Leader said he intended to reintroduce the Bill but we do not know when that will happen.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire.  Aontaím leis an mBille seo.  Aontaím freisin le a lán de na rudaí atá ráite ag na Seanadóirí eile.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole's contribution was most interesting.  The Senator is now the proud owner of a boat and he will take on a major adventure in the near future when he sails from Kinsale to Dingle.  He will be welcomed by the local pipe and drum band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will note that the Senator is concerned about the colour of buoys around the coast.  However, I wish the Senator every success with his boat.  I hope he will enjoy himself.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the number of times he has come to the House, the number of Bills he has introduced and the announcements he has made for the benefit of the fishing industry and the marine sector in general.  It was good to see the Minister in full flight on television recently, along with people from my town, fighting for the rights of tuna fishermen in Brussels. He was in consultation rather than in confrontation with them, fighting together as best they could.  The outcome was not to the satisfaction of either the Minister or the fishermen but it must be adhered to.  It was ironic that a scuffle broke out between Greenpeace and the Dingle fishermen because, for the past 14 years, they have protected a dolphin, the very creature which Greenpeace claimed they would destroy.  As I have said many times in the House, the fishermen respect the dolphin and have protected it with their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> I welcome the changes in the Bill; there are many amendments to be made to other legislation but this is a start.  There is a lot of outdated legislation.  I remind the Minister of the differences between the penalties which can be imposed by me, as chairman of Dingle Harbour Commissioners, and by the major ports for the same offence.  It is hard to understand why a person who breaks the law in a harbour commission area can be fined between £10 and £100 whereas the same offence under another authority, but tried in the same courts and under the same laws, can be fined anything from £1,000 to £10,000.  If that cannot be changed by this Bill legislation should be introduced, either by this Minister or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to provide that the penalty for an offence should be the same throughout the legal system.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i> and I did not think there were still laws governing people who mutinied or jumped ship. Perhaps I should have examined the Minister's contribution more closely &mdash; he said there would be no more walking the plank because it was outdated. During the debate in the Select Committee, the Minister quoted from a provision which stated:</P>
    <P>if the desertion takes place abroad, of the wages he may earn on any other ship in which he may be employed until his next return to the United Kingdom .</P>
    <P>Why was the reference to the UK rather than Ireland or Europe?</P>
    <P>There may be a reason for jumping ship or absconding.  Over the past few years I have heard of seamen who worked under dreadful conditions and were not released from their contract although they wanted out.  Also, in one of the greatest shipping disasters off the Canadian coast, the master of the ship was found to be drunk.  If a person who absconds had to work under such conditions, will he get an opportunity in court to say why he jumped ship?  The same law should apply to him as to everyone else.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax concessions the Minister will give to seamen.  It was unfair that people working out of the country and away from their families for long periods had no concessions, so the £5,000 personal tax allowance is a welcome change.  I thought it might be even more than that because there is a cost factor.  Not many people know how long people work at sea but hardly anyone on land would be willing to spend long periods under those conditions.  They are entitled to taxation and social welfare concessions.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws for ferry boats are good.  In Dingle 12 boats ply for hire every day, carrying between 12 and 50 people.  Our harbour-master is quite rigid &mdash; if the boat's licence is not in order it cannot go out.  Until such time as the inspector has examined the boat to ensure the life rafts, flares and lifejackets are in order and fire safety <Col N="1244" /> regulations are complied with, the harbour-master will not permit the ferry to operate.  On occasion the ferrymen put the equipment on board for the inspection day but may not have them two or three months later.  I have given instructions to our harbour-master to do a spot check on all boats, which he does on a regular basis to ensure all requirements are met.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions the registering of ships; the last time the Minister was here I expressed my disappointment about a large Irish company which registered its boat in Holland, because it would be a pity that an Irish owned boat would come into harbour flying a foreign flag &mdash; I thought that a ship had to fly the flag of the country where it was registered.  I asked the Minister to consider setting up a proper shipping registry in Ireland, which would give certain concessions and attract ships from other countries, along the lines of the International Financial Services Centre. I have no doubt this would be a huge gain to our economy and would be no loss to the Exchequer.  If an incentive is given nothing is lost, because the country would not have the business without it, so anything we get would be a gain. It would build up the insurance trade and would increase business for ships agents.  On the last occasion I mentioned the other island nations whose economy is almost totally based on ship registration.  With the Minister for Finance we should try to devise a scheme which would comply with EU laws but would provide an incentive such as that provided in the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>The traditional regattas such as the blessing of boats have been hard hit.  It is hard to get insurance for these events.  One of the biggest days of the year in my town is the traditional blessing of the boats.  Last year we had to curtail it when order was issued by the harbour board that the fishing boats were not allowed to take people on board for the trip out to the harbour. Now the blessing consists of the life boat coming with the clergy on board to bless the boats as they circle outside the harbour mouth so there will be another good year's fishing.  There used to be up to 100 people on board the fishing boats.  We have had to curtail that because they were not covered by insurance.  A way to exempt this tradition from insurance through legislation should be found so that we can enjoy that day.  There are similar activities throughout the State but the cost of insurance for a regatta is now so high that you take a chance or forget about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned forthcoming discussions with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  I remind the Minister of the predicament in which the Blasket Island ferrymen find themselves.  The men invested in two ferries and they now find that the landing facilities will not be built because of a court case. I would like to see the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands provide some funding to alleviate the problems these men have regarding landing facilities on the mainland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> The <i>Granuaile</i> is a grand old ship &mdash; I thought she was older.  I often watched in awe as she anchored off the Tearach lighthouse in heavy seas, landing fuel and supplies and I admired the expertise of those on board as they unloaded heavy material to be hooked onto a lift to the lighthouse.  The weather never stopped them.  I welcome the fact that a new boat has been provided. We are an island nation and these facilities should be provided by the EU to help us to look after these matters with modern vessels.  The <i>Granuaile</i> still receives 35 per cent funding from the Exchequer.  The EU was not overly generous in granting £1 million.  It should have given much more than that.  Not alone is the service provided by the <i>Granuaile</i> and the Commissioners of Irish Lights of benefit to our country, it is of benefit to all of the EU.  The EU should help out.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that many of the redundant lighthouses would probably be offered for sale.  There is history attached to these buildings. I ask the Minister to ensure that it is stipulated that the lighthouses should not be sold to speculators.  Local community groups should be approached to see if they could buy them to keep them as part of the culture and heritage of the island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the general tenor of the Bill.  Most of the sections are welcome improvements to existing legislation, such as those dealing with seamen and trade disputes, registering of ships and the removal of the Victorian offences of desertion and wilful disobedience.</P>
      <P>I am, however, a cynic as far as Bills dealing with merchant shipping are concerned.  It struck a note of panic that the Bill allows the Commissioners of Irish Lights to raise £25 million.  The Minister made a convincing presentation and one could be lulled into a sense of false security.  I am not prepared to fall for that.  I would like the Minister to clarify the Loran C issue.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights may require a new ship but I do not understand why when in the past the commissioners had facilities which required the provision of finance.  The finance was secured and there was no need for legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may argue that because of the increased cost of ships, £25 million is a realistic figure.  That is so if you deal with the situation as the Minister presents it, but I would like a categorical assurance from the Minister that this Bill will not be used to enable the Commissioners of Irish Lights to raise funding to proceed with an £8 million development on Loop Head in the form of the Loran C mast.  That is my fundamental concern.  The Minister may classify the Loran C mast as a navigation aid and this Bill would enable the Commissioners of Irish Lights to raise money for it.  I would like an assurance that the Bill will not be used to empower the commissioners to seek permission from the Minister for Finance to raise funding through any mechanism for the building of a Loran C mast on Loop <Col N="1246" /> Head.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to give that assurance before the conclusion of the debate in this House this evening.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this Bill will benefit employers and employees under its PRSI regulations.  It is welcome that PRSI returns can be made to employers to the tune of £2 million.  That is laudable and I commend the Minister for it.  There are aspects of this Bill which are highly commendable and most welcome.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that this Bill will not be used to raise £8 million for Loran C.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister responded to the concerns expressed by Senator Bonner and I about the heritage value of our lighthouses when we spoke on the Merchant Shipping Act, 1997.  I commend the Minister for raising this matter with the Commissioners of Irish Lights and I appreciate the response he has given us today.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned leisure craft.  Last Monday Clare County Council was advised that it was not legally empowered to introduce by-laws to deal with the use of jet skis on beaches in County Clare.  They are one of the biggest dangers along the coast.  I hope the Minister will urgently consider this matter, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, with a view to introducing legislation so that local authorities can introduce the necessary by-laws to protect people using the beaches and waters around our coasts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that ferries will be registered and brought within the control net.  Many ferry companies have operated successfully in this country for over 25 years. They have an extremely fine record of service and safety with no reported accidents or dangerous activities.  These ferry companies and operators must be commended for the tremendous work they have done.</P>
    <P>I know of one ferry company which was recently approached for £40,000 or £50,000 a year.  This is serious because these ferry companies provide a living for people and they operate without any State assistance as they are privately owned.  Government agencies now regard it as appropriate to seek to extract money from them in the form of a licence or taxation.  This is extremely wrong and short-sighted.  Successful ferry companies have generated considerable money but they have reinvested it in improving the quality of service, vessels and landing facilities they provide.  They have continued to improve their immediate infrastructure and to provide an excellent service to the user.  They are a wonderful example to the State sector.  I ask the Minister to ensure that these companies are not looked upon as another source of money but as companies which are providing a service in deprived and disadvantaged areas.  They are of great benefit to communities in tourist areas.</P>
    <P>It is unwise that people can hire a boat and sail up the Shannon without having to show proof of their experience, expertise or knowledge of seafaring <Col N="1247" /> or of handling a leisure craft.  This situation must be reviewed because it could lead to serious accidents.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister has made an exemption for small islands and islands which do not have an official ferry service. I am delighted the Minister said he was in contact with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands with a view to providing better infrastructural facilities on the islands because they are necessary.  The sooner there is a proper infrastructure on these inhabited islands, whether it is a slipway or a pier, the better.  The Minister can then introduce more stringent rules and regulations. Tragedies have occurred in the past as people traversed between the islands and the mainland.  There is an onus on the State to give priority to disadvantaged areas.  The last Government appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for the islands who focused on this area with a view to providing a proper service.  I hope the Minister ensures that work is successfully continued.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which gives great power to the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  While the Commissioners of Irish Lights are an all-island body, their headquarters is in Trinity House in London.  The Government gave a subvention to the Commissioners of Irish Lights to conduct their business in this country which they have successfully done.  The way they maintain their properties is a credit to them.  However, given that their headquarters is in London, where there are many commercial banks, and that Trinity House is providing the initial payment for this vessel, it is surprising that they need this power in our legislation to raise funding.  Perhaps I am being cynical when I suggest that the section of the Bill which relates to the powers to be conferred on them will enable them to raise £8 million to construct Loran C.  I hope the Minister will reassure the House that that will not happen.  His case for the boat was well presented and highly convincing.  However, one cannot help but think there is another agenda.  I ask the Minister to confirm that there is not another agenda, that this funding is only for the boat and that the Department officials will ensure that this section of the legislation is not used to raise funding to build a Loran C mast at Loop Head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which seeks to regulate some aspects of the fishing industry.  All the guidelines in the surveys office in the Department of the Marine are only in draft form.  It is up to each surveyor to interpret the draft guidelines for the fishing fleet.  The Central Fisheries Board has asked on a number of occasions since 1992 that the Department clarify the safety regulations for the sea angling charter fleet because these regulations are also in draft form.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position.  Will he be introducing licensing for the sea angling charter boats? <Col N="1248" /> The previous Minister, the late Deputy Coveney, promised that he would do so.  I ask this Minister to give us the up to date position in this regard. At present it is up to the surveyor in the surveys office to interpret it and different people make different interpretations.  If the guidelines are only in draft form, different surveyors will take different interpretations from them.  That is unfair to the surveyors also.  I am only asking for what the Central Fisheries Boards have sought already &mdash; that the Minister clarify the safety regulations for the sea angling charter fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for a broad ranging debate covering many of the areas in the Bill and a few other issues.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey welcomed the updating measures in the Bill.  He was concerned with the shipping industry generally and felt that it needed support, and I would agree with him.  We are trying to tackle those issues.  He was also concerned that vessels using Irish ports had safety standards similar to those we are discussing here.  More needs to be done in that area but there is a procedure for what is called port state control.  In other words, once a vessel comes into the port of a state, the state has control over it.  If the state is not happy with something, it can insist that certain things are changed.  Obviously that relates to serious matters.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's point that we should try to have similar standards around Europe for anybody using the seas and the ports.  This might come down to things like the degree of training for the people who are operating the vessels because many vessels are now using staff who have very little training and would not be up to the standard to which we would be accustomed. There is much to be done in that area.  However, I want to make it clear that we have control over vessels if we are unhappy about the safety measures on board or about their seaworthiness. Staffing matters are fairly loose still from the point of view of third countries and that is something which needs to be developed.</P>
      <P>Various questions were raised about the smaller vessels carrying fewer than 12 passengers and the vessels carrying more than 12 passengers. The passenger vessels carrying more than 12 passengers are already covered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  They are required to be surveyed and to have a passenger ship safety certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of boats used by employers, etc., I do not propose to exempt regular passenger boats carrying passengers to and from their place of work.  Instead, with regard to vessels owned by the passengers' employer where separate special arrangements apply &mdash; I am thinking here of special instances, such as pilot boats used by the harbour authorities and vessels used by the Commissioners of Irish Lights &mdash; we had to make <Col N="1249" /> provision that the Minister could introduce specific regulations to deal with those cases.  Since these are specialists, trained people, and there is no need to be concerned about that aspect.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey also raised issues relating to the exemptions, such as the exemption for dredgers and other work boats.  That is a practical measure and it will, of course, be subject to conditions, such as those which ensure that the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, are complied with.  I can guarantee that there will be no diminution of safety, which will be assured through the imposition of regulations specifying safety equipment to be carried, etc. There are specific strict penalties in this Bill for any breach of the existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey raised an important issue, that is training.  Training is one of the key issues.  The introduction of the £5,000 tax incentive for young people to enter the merchant navy is one of the incentives offered.  There is also the need to provide good training courses.  This needs much attention.  This is something which the industry takes seriously and about which it is concerned. The Director of the Irish Chamber of Shipping, Mr. Brian Kerr is chairman of the Task Force on Seafarer Training and Employment.  The task force is tackling this issue now as a matter of urgency.  Later in the year we will have its views and recommendations and we will be anxious to pursue them.  I agree with the Senator that the vocational education committees could play an important part in this regard.  I have a high regard for the work they have done over the years but they just did not get the necessary support.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey also raised the issue of the crowded roads.  That will become a more prominent issue not just here but all over Europe.  As our roads are becoming very crowded, one can only imagine what the roads are like around Europe.  That is a major problem there.  Coastal delivery and access to ports will become more important there as it is here.  The Senator's two solutions were commercial transport at night and transport by sea.  Transport by sea will become increasingly important.</P>
    <P>Between 80 per cent and 85 per cent of the volume of goods are transported by sea.  If one takes into account the island of Ireland, the volume of goods transported by sea increases to 99 per cent.  When one looks at the whole island one sees the impact the airports have on this area.  A huge volume of our exports is transported by sea &mdash; this is not really recognised &mdash; and the volume will increase.</P>
    <P>Senators Bonner and Taylor-Quinn raised the question of some inclusions which I have kept in mind and have included and I have, as promised, done something about the question of Burtonport. Senator Bonner also expressed concern about the ban on drift net fishing.  This situation is quite difficult.  An overall decision was taken by the Council of Minsters in March to ban drift <Col N="1250" /> nets.  At that time I persuaded the Council of Ministers to delay the measure to allow us to have discussions with the Commission with a view to finding measures which might be helpful to Ireland's position.  The matter was, therefore, postponed until the June meeting.  At the June meeting a two year transitional period was proposed. This was not very helpful to us because the two years would include 1998 and 1999 and the 1998 season is already well under way.  A majority of 23 opposed our point of view.  Ireland, with France and Italy, was in a minority of three. We did not even have enough support to constitute a blocking minority.  If we had we could have delayed the decision until some satisfactory arrangement could be arrived at.  We did manage, through long discussion, to have the two years transition extended to three and finally to four years.  Our Spanish colleagues were particularly upset by this because they have been pressing for this development and felt that the overall majority in favour of a two year transitional period should have stood.  However, the European Union must recognise that the livelihoods of fishermen are more important than simple overall majorities.  Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom were, in fairness, prepared to look at compromise measures.</P>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations we succeeded in including an addendum providing for money for technology transfer and research to be given priority in the funds which the Commission has at its disposal.  We have committed all our own European funding for fisheries and the marine for this period.  We needed a commitment of funding for the period after 1999 to cover the later stages of the four year transitional period.</P>
    <P>From those points of view our negotiations were quite successful but we were trying to solve a problem which should not have arisen in the first place.  There is no scientific evidence to support a claim against Irish fishermen in this situation. As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, Irish people &mdash; and particularly in Dingle &mdash; are very friendly with dolphins and they with us.  Senator Bonner may be interested to hear that when I visited north Donegal at the recent bank holiday weekend I saw 20 dolphins leaping in the sea outside my window.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they follow the Minister around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have been communicating a message to me that they are quite happy and not at all worried.  The fishing vessels were alongside the dolphins and not causing them any concern.  We conform to the UN resolution in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having gained some concessions from colleagues on the Council of Ministers it was difficult for me to vote against them on this question, but the Irish position continues to be that the decision is wrong in principle.  Money should have been <Col N="1251" /> provided by the EU for this purpose.  Countries were merely given approval to use their own funds.  This method suits France and Italy but it does not suit Ireland in our current situation.  I think we have achieved a manageable position.  I am sorry to digress but the matter is current and I wished to deal with it.  As Senator Bonner said, a dangerous precedent has been set.  I pointed this out to the Council.  The decision was a political rather than a scientific or practical one.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner also pointed out the opportunities for oil and gas exploration and development off the west and north west coasts.  This question is topical.  An unprecedented number of licences for exploration in that area has been granted and there will be much exploration.  We hope there will be finds.  The waters are deep and new technology is needed.</P>
    <P>Irish technologists, especially from universities like Galway, are learning these new technologies. They are being developed at the Marine Institute. Harland and Wolff are pleased with the deep water research which is being done on their behalf and which will help them in their designs for the world market.  Even though no oil has been found in Ireland, Irish technologists and engineers are being asked to advise on installations in the North Sea and in the seas off Norway. There will be extensive exploration.  A drilling by Enterprise Oil will commence in the middle of June off Slyne Head.  We are hopeful that something will result from that.  The Statoil exploration found resources, but of a nature not suitable with present technology.  Statoil were disappointed because the resources were quite substantial but there may be further developments.  I agree with Senator Bonner that there is a potential for development in the Killybegs area.  Killybegs is not only our largest fishing port, but it also has potential as a centre of the oil industry.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole expressed his satisfaction at the initiatives taken with regard to old lighthouses. I mentioned my concerns regarding the marine emergency services.  I will be making sure that some of these facilities are used for the marine emergency services, which is timely.  Senator O'Toole also recognised the Government's concern for islanders.  He also wishes to see more development on islands.  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, is paying particular attention to that area.  He is seeking to allocate the funds as fairly as possible to develop facilities there and we keep in contact with him on that issue.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about international co-operation for the Commissioners of Irish Lights. It is a member of the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities which deals with navigation issues on a worldwide basis.  Buoys in and around harbours are provided by the relevant harbour authorities.  However, the commissioners have an overall supervisory role.  With regard to <Col N="1252" /> the colour of buoys, the commissioners would be experts.  They regularly liaise with seafarers in matters related to aids to navigation which they provide.</P>
    <P>I noted that at one point the Senator found himself adrift and his navigation system was not doing what he required, so to speak.  He suddenly admitted that he might need Loran C after all he had said in debates on that issue.  Fortunately, he overcame his difficulties.  With regard to Loran C we had hoped matters might have developed differently but they have not.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also expressed concern about the River Shannon.  Matters related to it are in the remit of the Office of Public Works and I suspect the Shannon River Council legislation will be introduced by another Department.  My Department has an interest in the matter and related expertise.  We provide the marine emergency service for the country and it would be better if it also covered the rivers and lakes.  We provide a 24 hour system which is almost second to none.  It would not be difficult for the marine emergency service to cover the major rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also expressed concern about the desertion and absence without leave issues. Employers of seafarers consider absence without leave a breach of contract of employment.  We are not removing it at this stage because there are so many international conventions and other instruments and if we remove it willy-nilly we may cause difficulties.  The matter needs careful consideration and we will follow it up.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to recent events in Brussels but the meeting took place in Luxembourg. I admit that at times I am unsure where I was &mdash; I arrive by plane and go by car to a meeting for the day and when it is over I return by car to the airport to leave for home.  It really does not matter where the debate takes place.  The presence of the fishermen from Dingle and Castletownbere was of help to us because it allowed me to point out during the negotiations that the only fishermen present were those from the south-west whose livelihoods were at stake.  Their representations were appreciated greatly.  An extraordinary Dingle <i>versus</i> Greenpeace conflict arose, but I am sure that, on reflection, the Greenpeace protesters may have felt out of place. Dingle is the home of the dolphin and the species faces no threat there.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the issue of regularising fines.  We are examining the case of Dingle in particular and I appreciate the general point.  With regard to desertion and returning to the UK, the matter is covered by the Act of 1894, at which time Ireland was included.  The Senator welcomed the tax concessions and raised the problem of the cost of insurance.  He also referred to the heritage value of lighthouses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Senator Taylor-Quinn welcomed the Bill, but as ever the cynic in these matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>She need not be concerned.  The commissioners must have the powers to borrow the money needed and the Bill provides such a facility.  The Loran C is a separate issue.  It involves Exchequer funds which are included in the Estimates.  I would not worry about anything precipitate happening with regard to Loran C because, as I have indicated, there will be a consultation process.  I had hoped that other technological developments would have changed the scene positively in the interim.  However, that has not been the case.  The Americans were considering a commercialisation of their system and we had hoped they would make it widely available on a commercial basis.  However, they have backed away from so doing.  There had been suggestions that the Decca system might have received investment and been improved but that has not happened.</P>
      <P>We have had contractual obligations in this regard since 1992 and we must pursue those matters. We will also pursue the consultation process &mdash; one element will be an expert consultation and another will be consultation with people in the area involved and both processes will be public.  I have given a firm undertaking that if we decide to go ahead with the project the matter will come back to the Oireachtas for discussion.  The money for that project is provided by the Exchequer.  It was on advice from the Attorney General that it was found that borrowing powers were not available to the Commissioner of Irish Lights.</P>
      <P>I was in the Department of the Marine for a short period in 1992 and brought in regulations regarding jet skis and these regulations were challenged. Our advice is that those regulations are not secure and that something will have to be done about them.  We had hoped the local authorities would bring them in for their own areas, but they have run into the same difficulties.  It is extraordinary but that is the nature of life nowadays. People challenge everything for every sort of reason.  We can control these vessels and those travelling on them, but the real danger in this case relates to people swimming.  I am very concerned about this situation, which we are working to put on a regulated basis.  People have had their shoulders partly removed by jet skis.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that sea fishing is a tough job and should be recognised.  We had great difficulty getting this measure through, and one problem relates to the potential for its being extended subsequently.  We will look at it again for the future.  One obvious short term situation is that of servicing offshore rigs, where vessels are at sea long for continuous periods.  The Bill refers to those at sea for 169 days, including continuous periods of 14 days.  Those rules apply generally in Europe and we are in compliance with them, though they would not generally apply to the fishing situation.  We will look at this matter as we go forward.</P>

      <P>Should the criteria for the determination of a licence be based on the number of cash paying passengers as distinct from the condition <Col N="1256" /> of a boat?  I raised this matter on Second Stage as well because there is an ambiguity here that should be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect it depends on both.  First, a boat must be licensed and passed by the surveyors. It then depends on the number of passengers beyond that.  However, the regulations the Minister is now empowered to make refer only to specific and limited exemptions, such as the practical ones which were raised when the Bill was published and people saw what its effects would be for islanders, pilot boats and so on. There need not be any fear about that.</P>
      <P>I hope to have time during the Dáil recess to work comprehensively on the whole question of surveying and licensing.  We want to extend and simplify surveying.  For example, if Harland and Wolff survey a fishing vessel we must survey it again when it comes to the South.  We should agree to have one technology and sort out any lack of conformity.  We should not have to survey vessels twice.  If we can rationalise these matters we can free up resources to do a more comprehensive job, especially on ports around the country. I am very anxious to address any gaps in our port services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated on Second Stage that the regulations for sea angling charter fleet are with the Attorney General.  The guidelines are only in draft form.  Therefore, it is up to surveyors to interpret draft regulations in regard to the type of equipment which goes on to boats. As we know, different surveyors will have different interpretations for similar boats.  If the new regulations are with the Attorney General for his advice, will the Minister give an undertaking that he will bring them before the House as a matter of urgency so that they can be implemented?  As I pointed out, the Central Fisheries Board has called on numerous occasions for new regulations to be put in place so that surveyors will not have to rely on draft regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, in my opinion, a shortage of surveyors because there are delays in the examining of boats, particularly ferries and passenger boats.  Will the Department appoint extra surveyors, which would make everyone's job much easier?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised recently to be told by the Minister's Department that a boat owner does not need a licence to carry passengers for angling purposes as long as he does not go outside the three mile limit.  Will the Minister confirm that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to Senator Fitzgerald, I am glad I was not standing on the pier in Dingle with no ferry available to me because I would never have got to one of the offshore islands.  The Minister stated that unlicensed boats could be used for such purposes, but how many passengers could they take?  For example, sometimes when we <Col N="1257" /> want to go to cumann meetings on Aranmore island the ferry is not in operation at that stage of the evening and we must use a local boatman to take two or three of us across.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we had to recompense him with some reward.  Is there a limit to the number of passengers below 12?  Will the regulations be adhered to stringently?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated this relates to transport to inhabited islands.  However, the boatman to whom I referred takes numerous people to a variety of islands in Burtonport bay, involving very little danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We took a decision not to cover people going to uninhabited islands.  The exemption is essentially for islanders.  We are making arrangements with the Minister of State with responsibility for the islands to ensure facilities are provided and that we can tighten up that situation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the shortage of surveyors, there are two ways to approach such a problem &mdash; one either sorts out the work or takes on more people.  If a boat is purchased in Scotland, for example, one receives a surveyor's report from reputable people in Scotland who have been in the business for a long time and one then gets a report from Harland and Wolff.  Harland and Wolff have been in existence for a long time and were at the centre of the international merchant shipping business at one time.  We must then certify the ship for a third time.  That is unnecessary duplication of work.  We must ensure things are equal and that everything is right in that regard.</P>

      <P>There were all sorts of reasons for that.  Some of the best oil vessels in the world are being produced by Harland and Wolff &mdash; for example, the <i>Schiehallion,</i> which is an FPSO, a floating, production, storage and offloading vessel. It can take the oil on board, sort it and then offload it.  Harland and Wolff is way ahead in terms of new developments.  However, I know this area needs attention.</P>
      <P>In regard to angling, the regulations made under the 1992 Act must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after they are made.  If a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by either House within the next 21 days, they must be debated.  It is a question of changing existing guidelines into statutory regulations which will be laid before the House.  That is what the Act will provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they then become statutory. One then moves to the new situation of statutory provisions.  There are situations in any legislation where a great deal of detail must be gone into before regulations are ready.  Therefore, regulations may be introduced initially as guidelines. With their having operated as guidelines for some time, what should be included in statute becomes obvious.  There is no need to deal with an issue by means of new legislation because any problems will have been resolved in the interim.</P>
      <P>The Dáil and the Seanad inform Ministers that they want them to take a particular course of action in addition to what is being done elsewhere and develop the regulations into statutory form. There is no need to ask the Houses if this should be done because they have already indicated their wishes.  The statutory regulations are laid before the Houses and Members who do not agree with them have 21 days to indicate their opposition. On the other hand, if they require modification at a later stage, draft legislation or proposals for change can be introduced.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to honour its pre-election promises to provide funding for the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) A new Control of Farmyard Pollution Scheme;</P>
      <P>(b) A Dairy Hygiene Scheme;</P>
      <P>(c) Introduction of a new Farm Installation Grant Scheme for Young Farmers;</P>
      <P>(d) To reopen the live cattle trade to Egypt and Libya.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to introduce an efficient farmer-friendly Animal Traceability Scheme;</P>
      <P>(b) to introduce a comprehensive Quality Assurance Scheme at farm level which is not excessively costly to farmers;</P>
      <P>(c) to reorganise the Area Aid Unit;</P>
      <P>(d) to guarantee farmers that the results of the 30 Day Blood Tests be made available inside a 10 day period; and</P>
      <P>(e) to use its influence to provide for a live cattle shipping service to the Continent.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is here given that a similar debate is taking place in the other House.  I hope the debate will be constructive and of interest to the agricultural community.  My reasons for tabling the motion are many and varied but, above all, on the anniversary of the formation of the Government, it is important to look at the promises it made and how many were brought to fruition.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of weeks I examined those promises and listed the different aspects of the Government's proposals which were not implemented.  During the general election campaign the agricultural community swayed in which way it cast its vote on election day.  The proposals contained in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and, indeed, the Programme for Government held out new hope for many farmers.  They fell for, and believed, some of the proposals would be implemented and because of that hope many voted in favour of the current Administration.  I was shocked when I looked at the Programme for Government and compared it to what had been done.  That is why I tabled this motion.  The Government's most disastrous and dismal failure was not to reopen the live cattle trade to Egypt and Libya.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a previous debate on agriculture, we, on this side of the House, welcomed the introduction of the 30 day blood test, but the disastrous way in which that scheme has been operated has caused major hardship over the past few months. During one week, people were in contact with <Col N="1261" /> politicians daily to get back results of their 30 day blood tests.</P>
    <P>The Government promised to restore the control of farmyard pollution scheme which in its words is important &ldquo;to ensure the sustainability of agriculture&rdquo;.  It is disgraceful that 12 months after the formation of this Government, and despite all the commitments given during the election, this scheme has not been reintroduced. Pollution of the environment is a serious problem in rural Ireland.  Every summer we read reports in newspapers about many streams and rivers which have been polluted.  It is virtually impossible for any medium or small farmer to put in place control measures which would be environmentally friendly without Government aid.  It is a huge cost to many farmers, something which they cannot afford given the current prices in the industry. The success and drawing down of the previous scheme signalled its importance.  The number of people who want to get involved in this scheme and REPS is growing daily.  Both schemes go hand in hand and REPS is having a major effect on our farms.  It is important the Minister makes an effort and tries to shake up the Cabinet to get it to respond by putting money into the reintroduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The same could apply to the dairy hygiene scheme.  Throughout the country, particularly in the dairying regions in the south, more people are leaving the industry simply because the new guidelines and regulations being imposed by the Department through those involved in the processing industry are driving them out of existence. This is having a devastating effect on rural Ireland because small dairy farmers are the backbone of the economy and many rural parishes, villages and small towns.  It is a disgrace that a sector of the agricultural community like the small dairy farmers has been let down.  We have neglected them, particularly by our failure to grant aid dairies to bring them up to EU standard. Will the Minister do something for those people who have no other income and who see no other hope in agriculture except on the family farm to which we are so committed and of which we are so proud?</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to reintroduce installation aid for young farmers is the biggest disappointment of the Programme for Government. The programme states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to the continuation of this scheme which is very important not only to the young farmers but to the general profile of agriculture.  We will seek as a matter of urgency to review the extension clause in the present scheme.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make a more unequivocal commitment, yet it has brazenly been set aside by the Government.  The Minister is an honourable politician. I cannot believe he or his party are walking away from such a clear promise to young farmers. I call on him to reverse his decision immediately <Col N="1262" /> and to honour the clear undertaking given by his party during the general election.</P>
    <P>The subsidy of £5,600 to be paid to trained young farmers is an effective and cheap way for the Government to bring people into agriculture. It compares favourably with the approximately £12,000 it costs to create a job in industry.  This is an economic and good long-term scheme because it increases the age profile of young people working on the land.  We need more young people working on farms.</P>
    <P>The failure to reopen the live cattle trade to Egypt is the Government's most damning inaction. The Minister recently visited Cairo.  What does Egypt propose?  The various farming organisations are aware of the huge commitment which the Minister gave as Opposition spokesman on Agriculture, Food and Forestry prior to the last general election.  We were told of it everywhere we canvassed during the election campaign. When we canvassed voters in Tipperary town we were told that Joe Walsh and Bertie Ahern would get the cattle exported.  Not a beast has moved. Never has the Government made such a poor attempt to honour one of its commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Tom Hayes, for the comprehensive way in which he opened this debate. He broadly outlined the major problems in agriculture and the total lack of response by the Minister and the Government to the crisis.  The BSE crisis was the watershed in the industry and has had major reverberations throughout the industry. I look back with satisfaction to the urgency the Minister's predecessor applied to the problem. By contrast, the Minister's response has been totally inadequate.  He should be ashamed that the gap between his promise and his achievement is so wide.</P>
      <P>The farm installation grant scheme for young farmers was introduced in 1987 and was moderately successful until 1990.  Approximately 5,700 young farmers benefited from it until its abolition on 7 August 1997.  There was a major and badly needed reform of the scheme in 1994 when the land worked unit requirement of not more than one and not less than 1.5 was removed.  That had a dramatic effect on the number of young farmers who could then become eligible to enter the scheme.  While by 1994 only approximately 200 farmers had benefited from the scheme because of its rather confined application, 746 young trained farmers benefited in 1995.  There was a dramatic increase in 1996 when 1,167 benefited and up to 7 August 1997, 661 new applicants had been received by the Department.  The figures would have settled down at between 1,100 and 1,200 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the scheme was abolished when the money ran out in 1994 because major cutbacks had to be made to spending under the EU Structural Funds when it became clear we would get less than £6 billion rather than the £8 billion some thought.  The major areas to suffer in agriculture <Col N="1263" /> were the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the farm installation grant scheme for young farmers and the dairy hygiene scheme.  This means the farm installation grant scheme for young farmers failed, like others, because of inadequate funding.</P>
    <P>The incorporation of young farmers to the industry is so fundamental to its success it is unforgivable that the Government, after the promise it made, should maintain the policy of not putting funding into the scheme.  The total cost of the scheme in 1997 was approximately £6.4 million, with approximately £4.9 million provided by the EU.  Some 75 per cent was provided under the EU Structural Funds while the rest was paid out of Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>Given the promises made by the Government, the minimum we could have expected from its budget was £6 million approximately that would be needed to maintain the scheme at its 1997 level.  To maintain it until the end of 1999 when the new Structural Funds will be agreed, would have cost a further £6 million approximately. According to Agenda 2000, the EU would be willing to allow the upper limit for spending on the scheme to be set at approximately 25,000 ECUs per individual entry.  While it would not all be spent in Ireland, this is a huge increase in its ceiling. What are the Minister's proposals for the régime after 2000?  What is his response to what appear to be very generous figures in terms of the Santer proposals?</P>
    <P>The importance of these matter cannot be over-emphasised.  The Central Statistics Office recently provided much information on the age profile in Irish agriculture.  For example, in 1994, 21.6 per cent of farmers in Ireland were under 35 years of age.  That figure declined to 20.9 per cent in 1995 and by 1996, the last year for which CSO figures are available, it had reduced to 18 per cent.  The number of young farmers under the age of 35 will be probably 15 per cent or less of the total by the end of 1998.  The number of people in agriculture during those critical productive years of their lives is declining because there are no incentives.</P>
    <P>In 1994 the number of farmers over the age of 65 was 32 per cent of the total nationally.  By the end of 1996 that number had increased to 33.1 per cent.  These figures eloquently make the argument that the Government should invest in the farm retirement scheme, which should be complemented by an installation scheme for young trained farmers.  The trends continue to move in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Agriculture will become less shored up by subsidies and income supports in the future and it will have to compete in the world market against such countries as New Zealand and Australia. The age profile of farmers in those countries, which will be our major competitors, is the opposite of the profile in Ireland.  An increasing number of young people are entering agriculture in New Zealand which is approximately the same <Col N="1264" /> size as Ireland and is a major exporter of food. There are no supports whatsoever in New Zealand; it must survive in the marketplace.  This also applies to Australia.</P>
    <P>A similar position obtains in other European countries but the comparisons are not as relevant because of the lack of dependence on agriculture on the part of most of our European partners. Agricultural economies have been closed and countries consume almost everything they produce.</P>
    <P>There is a need for investment in this area. Ireland should not wait for the EU to come to its assistance.  Despite the booming economy, it costs the Government approximately £12,000 to create a job outside the agriculture sector and an investment of half that amount was required, three-quarters of which was paid by the EU.  When the money ran out, the Government did not put anything in its place.  The figures from the Central Statistics Office are damning in view of the importance of agriculture to the economy on which the Minister pronounces frequently.  I ask the Minister to take note of the views expressed in the debate.  These points are not being made for political reasons, rather in the national interest.  Members who live in rural Ireland and who must try to survive politically and otherwise see what is happening around them.</P>

      <P>(b) The Dairy Hygiene Scheme;</P>
      <P>(c) The introduction of a new Farm Installation Grant Scheme for Young Farmers;</P>
      <P>(d) The re-opening of the live cattle trade to Egypt and Libya.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Seanad Éireann commends the Government for its work on:</P>
      <P>(a) the introduction of an efficient farmer-friendly Animal Traceability Scheme;</P>
      <P>(b) the introduction of a comprehensive Quality Assurance Scheme at farm level which is not excessively costly to farmers;</P>
      <P>(c) the reorganisation of the Area Aid Unit;</P>
      <P>(d) the guaranteeing to farmers that the results of the 30 Day Blood Tests be made available inside a 10 day period; and</P>
      <P>(e) the provision of a live cattle shipping service to the Continent.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> I commend the Minister on his efforts since he came into office.  In spite of the comments of the Opposition Members, the farming community is pleased with the way he is administering the agriculture brief.</P>
    <P>Under the current operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, £100 million was made available for the control of farmyard pollution scheme in 1994.  Due to the high level of demand relative to the funding provided, the acceptance of new applications was suspended on 27 April 1995.  In the context of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds, in which the European Commission was involved, additional funding of £20 million was made available for the scheme in July 1997.  In spite of Senator Connor's comments, a further £9.5 million was allocated from Exchequer funds in the 1997 Supplementary Estimates.  This considerable extra funding has helped meet existing commitments.</P>
    <P>In addition, the capital allowance for necessary pollution control works was increased from £20,000 to £30,000 in this year's Finance Bill. Farmers have invested almost £1 billion in improved pollution control on their farms in recent years and they deserve a great deal of credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer I appreciate that investment.</P>
      <P>Last July an additional £8.5 million was made available for the dairy hygiene scheme in the mid-term review.  This was an acknowledgement of the critical importance of the scheme to small farmers. It also fulfilled existing commitments.  The funding for both schemes is continually monitored and will be considered in the event of additional funding becoming available as a result of the decommitment of projects under the Community Support Framework.  The Government will ensure that the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme are given priority in the distribution of funds.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Funds for installation aid ran out because of the strong uptake of the scheme.  However, I am pleased to note that a new revised scheme, targeted at small farmers, will be introduced.  This will be 100 per cent financed by the Exchequer. In spite of the Opposition's comments, the Exchequer is providing funds for these important schemes.  The terms of the new scheme, on which the farming organisations have been consulted, are currently being finalised.  They will be then submitted to the Department of Finance for approval.  In addition, the approval of the EU Commission will be required before the measure can come into operation.  In stressing the importance of this scheme to young farmers, I congratulate the Minister on the progress he has made in drawing up a new installation aid package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the live cattle trade, it is imperative that every effort is made to ensure the maximum <Col N="1266" /> possible number of markets are open to Irish beef and cattle this autumn.  Already this year the UK, French and Dutch markets have been the focus of the Minister's attention.  Recently a delegation led by the Minister for Agriculture and Food returned from a successful visit to Egypt and the Lebanon.  These visits are undertaken to underscore Ireland's presence in those markets.</P>
    <P>In 1997 Egypt imported 80,000 tonnes of Irish beef, which was equivalent to 250,000 cattle and worth in excess of £150 million.  The Opposition criticised the Minister for not ensuring the resumption of live exports to Egypt.  However, prior to the election, the previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry deliberately misled the Dáil when he said, regarding the Russian ban on beef because of BSE in certain counties, that a gun had been put to his head in the VIP lounge in Dublin Airport.  However, at that time the former Minister was holding a clinic in Wexford.</P>

      <P>I remind the Senators that the former Minister, Deputy Yates, prior to the election also announced that the ban on live cattle exports to Egypt had been lifted and they would resume the next day.  The Deputy misled farmers on that occasion because they thought everything was rosy.  The Opposition is now criticising the Minister because live cattle exports to Egypt have not resumed.  However, 45,000 live cattle were exported this year, 11,000 of which went to the Lebanon.  This was due to the great efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.  The Lebanon has emerged as a new market for Irish cattle.  In this context the Department and the Minister are in regular contact with various bodies which represent people who have an interest in developing the live trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This weekend the Irish Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Joseph Small, and Mr. David Behan of the Department of Agriculture and Food will travel to Tripoli for further discussions with the Libyan authorities on live cattle exports.  The importance of this trade to Irish farmers cannot be underestimated. The Department is involved on an ongoing basis in the development of this trade by maintaining existing outlets, seeking to ensure the resumption of supply to traditional markets and encouraging the opening of new ones.  On the specific issue of the transport of live animals to the continent, the Department has made available £1 million in State aid to assist the establishment of a ferry service between Cork and Cherbourg <Col N="1267" /> to facilitate animal exports to continental European markets.  This service was of great value during the critical winter months.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the area aid unit is now complete and it now comprises five sections, each dealing with a number of counties.  I welcome this change and compliment the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>As requested by the area aid unit, a large number of farmers have been in contact with them in recent days to clear up outstanding problems with their applications.  Nonetheless there is still a considerable number from whom replies have not been received.  The unit asks these farmers and others who have received lower than expected payments to consult them if the payment statement indicates that an area aid penalty has been applied.  The delay in receiving brucellosis information was mentioned &mdash; that was a result of the backlog of blood samples in the Cork area.  This time last year, farming was in a depressed state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address Seanad Éireann.  I like to make occasional, brief revisits to this House as a former Member and I hope I will not trouble anyone with a more permanent stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased to respond to this motion.  It is important that agriculture, our primary industry, is debated and discussed in both Houses, so I express my appreciation to Senators for putting this motion before the House.  I reject in the strongest possible terms the Opposition's suggestions <Col N="1268" /> about the specific issues raised.  It has chosen to ignore the progress that has been made on a broad range of measures since this Government came to office.  We are totally committed to the advancement of agriculture and have a clear programme for the development of a sector which is still vital to the overall national economy. While numbers in the sector may have declined with the trend in all industrialised countries, agriculture is still three times more significant to Ireland than in the EU generally.  The role of the agri-food sector, for example, continues to be of vital importance in the Irish economy.  It accounts for an estimated 14.2 per cent of GDP, 13.4 per cent of employment and 13.2 per cent of exports.</P>
    <P>The farm family remains the cornerstone of Irish agriculture and as well as its economic importance, the wellbeing of agriculture is important for the fabric of rural society and rural development.  Some important changes have taken place, including a greater dependence on direct payments and a growing trend towards part-time farming.  The most recent household budget survey carried out by Teagasc shows that almost half of total farm household income now derives from non-farming activity and 47 per cent of income is made up of direct payments.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to deal with the areas down for debate under this motion it is important to set in context the level of support provided for agriculture.  The total expenditure of my Department in 1997 in support of this industry exceeded £2 billion.  All this was spent on supporting farmers and the agri-food sector &mdash; £941 million was spent on direct payments to farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be a reasonable degree of decorum and courtesy, such as the Government side showed when Senator Hayes and Senator Connor spoke.  The Department is committed to expeditious payment in all instances and this is a key element of the customer service action plan I launched last month. Under the plan, delivery targets are established for the payment of EU and national direct payments to farmers including headage, premia, grants and compensation packages.  In relation to EU funded schemes these targets provide for the most expeditious payment service of any member state in the EU and are considerably shorter than the eligible period allowed under the relevant regulations.  We pay well ahead of deadlines and almost 90 per cent of payments are made by target date in respect of all relevant schemes.  Most cases where the payment target is not met relate to instances where the applicant is either ineligible or further information is required to determine entitlement.  As recently as today in discussion with the area aid unit, I heard that 600 applications for a recent scheme were unsigned. That creates problems because the form has to be sent back for signature and resubmitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should now tell us about the inaccurate information the Department sent out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These schemes are subject to control measures such as national audit by the Committee of Public Accounts and EU audit. When there is such a scale of payment we have a responsibility to ensure the applications and payments are correct.</P>
      <P>On 24 April revised arrangements were introduced for the operation of the area aid unit.  This involved the division of the unit's work into five sections on a county basis.  To enable the staff in the unit to clear up a backlog of 19,700 cases, it was necessary to close the office to the public for a month.  Having cleared the backlog, the office reopened in the last week of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the large number of farmers who have responded to the unit's request for further material, in particular maps in support of applications.  I also urge <Col N="1270" /> any remaining farmers who have not responded or any farmers who have received lower than expected payments to contact the unit immediately if the payment statement indicates that an area aid penalty has been applied.  There has been a degree of chaos in that office over the past few years.  I was surprised that there was a backlog of in excess of 20,000 payments when I entered office last year.  That backlog has now been cleared making it easier for the Department to deal with applications for 1998.  I thank the staff in the local livestock offices and in Teagasc who have helped complete the applications.  I am confident that the area aid unit, starting its work without an overhang, will be able to ensure that we do not encounter area aid payment delays in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme is important because pollution can be a scar on the countryside.  We pride ourselves on having a green, clean island.  It is important to encourage farmers to ensure that they have the best possible farm practices, the tidiest farmyards and that there should be no spillage of silage or slurry effluent into streams or on to roadways.  The high standard at the farmyard should continue through the process to the customer.</P>
    <P>This scheme was introduced in 1994.  One hundred million pounds was made available to encourage farmers to introduce the most up to date methods and best levels of housing and slurry disposal.  Too much of the money, however, was spent in the early years of the 1994-9 programme and the scheme was suspended in April 1995.  I was not in office when this happened.</P>

      <P>An extra £32 million was allocated under the scheme since last June bringing the total to £148 million whereas the original allocation was £100 million.  In the Finance Bill, 1998, farmers were allowed a £30,000 write-off for eligible expenditure under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the dairy hygiene scheme.  This scheme was suspended in October 1996.  Again, I was not in office at that time.  I am disappointed to see that there is no reaction to that fact.  I made additional funds available for this scheme during the year and there is a grant commitment of £36.7 million for it.  In line with the Action Programme for the Millennium, I regard on-farm investment as essential.  It is a high priority and in that context I am examining funding possibilities for more focused schemes in both farm pollution and dairy hygiene.  Even in a more focused forum these schemes require hundreds of millions of pounds in funding.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the scheme of installation Aid for young farmers which has been very successful in assisting young farmers to embark on their careers.  Since its inception almost 6,478 farmers have availed of the scheme and £22 million has been paid out under it.

As late as last week I discussed the issue with both Ministers.

    <P>I reiterate that every possible effort is being made at all levels to reopen the markets.  I pay tribute to Ambassador Hugh Swift who did a great job, not only looking after cultural, diplomatic and political matters but spending an inordinate amount of time dealing with trade matters &mdash; beef and cattle in particular.  He is leaving Egypt for Pretoria and I wish him well in his new assignment.  Bord Bia also has a good officer in Egypt, Mr. James O'Donnell, who operates out <Col N="1273" /> of the Embassy.  He is doing a very efficient and effective job.</P>
    <P>We have satisfied the Libyans in every possible way in relation to live cattle.  They have no problem with our cattle, the problem is political.  They are more interested in furthering their international status than they are in the quality of their live cattle imports.  Contacts are continuing with Ambassador Small in Rome who has also spent a tremendous amount of time and effort on this.  Libya is not an easy country to make contact with; he has to go overland through Tunisia.  I hope progress will be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have opened up a number of areas for live cattle on continental Europe and in the Lebanon. Last winter cattle were exported to the European Union and the UK and in the first five months of this year 55,000 head of live cattle have been exported from Ireland.  Not one live animal had left our ports this time last year.</P>

      <P>Access of our livestock exports to the Continent is vital.  There is a difficulty in the ferry service from the island of Ireland.  I recognise the importance of an island economy and of having a ferry service.  I pay tribute to the Government for providing £1 million for the <i>MV Purbeck</i> last October because we did not have a ferry service when I came into office.  That provided a tremendous boost to the cattle trade during the winter.  Unfortunately, that has now ceased but I am pleased that Irish Ferries has been approved to take trucks on its ferry service. An air service is also operational.  There were seven flights to the Netherlands in the past couple of weeks with further flights every day this week. That is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Quinn is in the House because I called to his supermarket some time ago and I was impressed by the meat counter.  Not alone was the meat impressive and of superb quality but I was able to see where it was produced because the name, address and telephone number of the farmer who supplied it was provided. I recall that it was produced by a Donegal farmer so I am sure it was of excellent quality. That meant I could go back to the source if there was any complaint.  That is what the owners and management of better and more sophisticated supermarkets are demanding not alone in Ireland but in the EU.  We must have traceability and quality systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad an Irish supermarket is leading the way in the area of quality because that is the only thing which will make a difference. Irish food products will get a return from the most remunerative markets if there is consistent high quality supply.</P>
      <P>I was pleased that in the budget last year I was able to get £6.5 million for the provision of a full traceability and quality assurance scheme.  That means all cattle will be tagged at birth and each animal will have its own identity.  It will then be possible to trace every movement of that animal from farm to farm, farm to mart, mart to factory and on to the supermarket shelf.  That is a huge task because there are 150,000 farmers in the country, 7.4 million cattle and ten million movements every year.  I am satisfied that the maximum use of modern technology and electronic systems of tracing animals will ensure the scheme will be in place by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Animal disease is another important area.  We had brucellosis difficulties over the past year or 18 months.  A new more comprehensive scheme was put in place with the unanimous support of the farmers and the farming organisations.  That brought about some degree of hardship to farmers and everyone in the trade but it was necessary to attain the highest possible animal health status if we wanted the highest possible return for our products.  Additional blood testing was introduced and the 30 day pre-movement test and a revamped scheme were put in place.</P>
      <P>The introduction of additional blood testing put enormous pressure on our blood testing laboratories. There was an increase of one million samples over the past seven or eight weeks.  The laboratories in Cork and Sligo dealt with the brunt of this additional sampling and this caused delays.  However, the staff coped well.  New staff were employed which caused teething troubles but I am glad the decks have been cleared and there is now a fast turnaround.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were also difficulties outside the laboratories. An Post, for example, did not crown itself in glory.  It was supposed to have sorted the samples so that they were in the laboratories at 8 a.m. However, it was often midday before they arrived and sometimes it took ten days or more to deliver them.  We have a new contract arrangement with An Post where it not only sorts the samples but ensures they are in the laboratories at 8 a.m. so that staff can start work as soon as they arrive.  I pay tribute to the staff who were lambasted in recent weeks.  There were delays and hardship was caused but the staff did not take <Col N="1275" /> holidays during the week of fine weather and they worked late at night and over the bank holiday weekend to clear the backlog.  All credit is due to them.  I do not expect any more difficulties or problems.</P>
    <P>When all these developments are taken into account, individually and collectively, this House cannot but accept that the Government and I have fulfilled our central role of providing the necessary leadership, policy direction, regulatory framework and operational support to ensure that the farm and food industries maximise their potential and contribute fully to the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office and in addition to the steps outlined above, I have taken significant action on a general level to underpin the farm and food industries and to lay the foundations for future growth.  Farmers and the economy have benefited.  In the past year agri-food exports exceeded £4 billion and this was an all-time record.  For a relatively small economy that is a tremendous level of exports from our indigenous and primary industry.  With the low level of imports, it makes a huge contribution to the economy. It is driven by our indigenous co-operatives. Two of the star performers are prepared consumer foods, with Green Isle in Portumna and Naas and Goodfellas which have approximately 80 to 85 per cent of the Irish market, and food ingredients, which is mainly driven by the Kerry Group.  It is the largest food ingredients company in the world.  Great credit is due to the leadership shown by the senior management of these companies.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that Ireland's vital national interests are fully reflected in the hugely important negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals which are currently being conducted in Brussels. I will have the full weight of the Taoiseach and the Government behind me in these negotiations which will continue for the remainder of this year.  The terms of the Opposition's rather confused motion is out of touch with reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind words about my company.  I remind the House that Deputy Walsh is the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The reason I am speaking on this motion is that I think it does not recognise that the Minister is the Minister for Food.  I am concerned at an attitude concentrated in the second part of the motion, which states:</P>
      <P>. Furthermore, Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to introduce an efficient farmer-friendly Animal Traceability Scheme;</P>
      <P>(b) to introduce a comprehensive Quality Assurance Scheme at farm level which is not excessively costly to farmers; .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The motion has got it wrong.  It does not mention food or customers.  It states that the scheme should be farmer-friendly.  It is essential that this country has a traceability scheme even if it is not farmer-friendly.  It is essential that there is a quality assurance scheme even if it is costly to farmers. We have no chance of succeeding in world markets if we take the attitude of the motion, which ignores the customer and food and concentrates on the supplier.  We, as a nation, must change our attitude if we are to succeed in that area.</P>
    <P>The tone of the motion expects the Government, not the agricultural community, to solve the problem, and that is a serious concern.  There is little doubt that the cause of problems in the past was that we expected somebody else to do it.  One does not want to take responsibility, so one calls on somebody else.  When there is a Government to call upon, the view is that it is wonderful because one does not have to worry about it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am critical of the motion.  I can understand the sense of the motion and how well intended Senators are tonight.  I could not get a copy of the Minister's speech because it was not anticipated that there would be so many Senators present and there were not enough copies issued yet.  I am not complaining about that.  I compliment the Members of the House for attending and congratulate those who tabled a motion which has attracted such attention that it is so well attended.</P>
    <P>On the question of responsibility, we are calling on the Government to do everything.  We are calling on the Government rather than asking the farming community to take the responsibility and take the monkey off its own back.  This attitude is what has got us into problems in the past and it will continue to get us into problems in the future.</P>
    <P>For instance, I do not know how long the TB eradication scheme has existed but I think I heard about it 40 years ago.  Over that period continued efforts have been made to try to solve that problem and it has not been solved.  The Minister mentioned the continuing problem of brucellosis in the past year.  These issues must be grasped by those involved in the farming community rather than asking somebody else to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am not quite old enough to remember World War II, but I remember my father talking about Lord Haw Haw, the Galway man who was hanged by the British after the war, who used to jeer and tease the British night after night in his broadcasts from Berlin.  He teased the British about the enemy within, who were those spies acting for Germany in Britain, and the British had a policy to avoid the enemy within.</P>
    <P>I believe the farmers have enemies within.  The farming community in Ireland is not doing anything, as far as I can see, to get rid of the enemies within.  These are the members of their own community who are cheating, breaking the law and <Col N="1277" /> doing untold damage to our ability as a nation to export food.  These are the people who are using illegal substances, damaging the reputation of Ireland and giving our competitors selling to European supermarkets the opportunity to draw attention to the fact that in Ireland there are cases of BSE, clenbuterol is used and people have been breaking the law with angeldust, etc. Just because it does not hit the headlines one must not think that the attention of our customers in Europe will not be drawn to it because our competitors are drawing their attention to it.  I sit around the table in different parts of Europe and meet supermarket buyers from other parts of Europe.  I know that they are up to date on what is happening in Ireland because the attention is being drawn by our competitors.  In this case, unless we as a nation decide we will do something about this ourselves, I do not think the Government can do it on its own.  The farming community in particular must tell those involved that it knows they are cheating and that it knows the damage they are doing.  It must tell them that it will not allow them to do it anymore.  If there is a danger of being accused of snitching on our colleagues, then let us snitch on our colleagues. There is too much at stake.  Therefore, we must find some way of getting the farming community to accept responsibility, a way of having them say &ldquo;We can do it ourselves.  It is in our own hands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked a Japanese visitor how he succeeded so well.  He thought over it for a while and then answered with a useful phrase.  He said: &ldquo;Whether you believe you can or whether you believe you cannot, you are right&rdquo;.  It is a good message, because if you are going into a football match and thinking you have no chance of winning, then you will not win.  If you go into it thinking you can win, you will win.  We as a nation and the farming community in particular have not said that we can conquer this ourselves.  The farming community has said that it is asking the Government to do something for it.  The Minister told the House tonight that there have been grants of almost £1 billion and that £2 billion in total has been spent.  We have not solved this problem because we are asking somebody else to do so.  Let us as a nation take this responsibility. Let us not call on somebody else to solve it for us.  When we make that determined effort we have some chance of solving this problem.</P>

      <P>I formally second the amendment to the motion.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn outlined my attitude to the negative approach of the Fine Gael Party motion. There are difficulties in agriculture at present and they need to be addressed, but a motion such as this one will not help in any way.  We need a positive and not a negative attitude to deal with the problems which confront us.</P>

    <P>It is interesting that in the past couple of days the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, in a fairly interesting paper, gave his views on where agriculture <Col N="1278" /> may be going in the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address one major issue in the motion, that is, installation aid and aid to young farmers in general.  There are problems at present in trying to encourage people to see a future for themselves in agriculture.  The figures with regard to the numbers of people taking up places in agricultural colleges are worrying, but we must look at the situation to try to understand the problem.  At present young farmers do not see a great future for themselves in agriculture when compared to the opportunities which exist in the rest of the economy.  I would question whether we should be thinking in terms of installation aid. What is really important is what we can do for young farmers.  It is far more important that we try to address the existing problems in agriculture. An interested young person is confined to a great extent in what he or she can do because of existing quotas and restrictions on production. Conventional agriculture is a closed shop and unless they can get their hands on a quota, they cannot get involved.  Therefore, we need to look at alternatives.</P>
      <P>To do this we need to focus on research.  Like the Minister, I have a research background. There have been many indications in the past few years of the benefits that can accrue from research.  These are not being highlighted in the way they should.  Senator Quinn is, I am sure, aware that one of the benefits of research and its dissemination to farm level has been the development of producer groups and group discussion meetings headed by Teagasc.  These bring together people who are genuinely interested, particularly in the dairy industry where we are using our natural comparative advantage to produce high quality grass.  In two years the top dairy producers have maintained or increased yields while reducing their input of grain and concentrates by as much as 30 per cent.  This sort of activity shows young people the value of research and its dissemination to farmers.</P>
      <P>Teagasc recently introduced a voluntary early retirement scheme for staff.  Unfortunately, it has resulted in research officers only being replaced on a one in three basis.  I would like to see far more young people involved in research because it is a young person's game.  They have fire in their bellies.  They will do the work and agriculture will benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is tremendous potential for the development of seed potato production.  This area has been neglected for many years.  For many years seed potato production has been concentrated in <Col N="1279" /> Donegal.  There are historical reasons for this, principally concerned with the problem of viral diseases.  These problems no longer exist.  We need to rationalise our seed potato production and to have bigger growers on lower land.  The main seed potato market, the Mediterranean region, has been declining even though we are producing the varieties which are in demand.  We must ask why and what we can do to prevent further decline.  There is no quota on seed potato production.  There is a demand in the Mediterranean area for approximately 800,000 tonnes of seed potatoes per annum.  We get our seed potatoes on to the market in time for planting in January and February.  There is a bigger market for November planting but in order for this country to get into that market we need to make some changes.  We must focus more attention on the production of seed in traditional tillage areas.  If we do, we can hit the markets earlier and increase our exports.  We must offer these opportunities to young farmers and producers.  Certain structures in the Department of Agriculture and Food must be reviewed in relation to seed potato production. For example, a seed potato crop cannot be certified unless the producer requests that the crop be certified before it is lifted.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>There are great opportunities in agriculture for young people but we must give them the back-up of proper research and the dissemination of its results and focus on areas that have not been regarded as traditional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Gibbons on the points he made about research and seed potato production.  I fully support his views.</P>
      <P>I have some difficulty with the points made by Senator Quinn.  He refers to the need to encourage farmers to help themselves instead of looking for other people to resolve their problems.  He also referred to the area of the food industry.  The Department is the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I have been saying for some time that the Minister cannot serve two customers.  There is a conflict of interests.  I am sure Senator Quinn, if he thinks about the matter, will agree with me. The best interests of the food industry cannot be served by the Minister for Agriculture.  If he is doing his job right by the farmers he cannot be doing the job in the way consumers of the food industry would like.  As a result he is falling between all stools and is not impacting on agricultural policy as we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what my colleagues said about young farmers' installation aid, not because we should be increasing the dependency culture which has been fostered so well over the past decade or two. However, a Minister who announces and introduces a scheme for five years but only provides the funds for five months deserves to be chided. When the Minister introduced the scheme he said it would last for five years and after five months <Col N="1280" /> the rug was pulled from under it.  Then, to buy as many votes as possible from the agricultural community in the last general election, he promised to restore it.  We are waiting for the Minister to deliver on that promise.  That is why we are critical of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the amount of paper involved in farming today.  I appeal to the Minister to rationalise the bureaucratic form-filling machine which has been created through our involvement with the Common Agricultural Policy. On my own family's farm we are involved in ten or 11 schemes.  There are about 30 or 40 EU sponsored schemes, all with different closing dates, application dates, references, mapping systems and criteria.  Farmers have been confused to such an extent that mistakes are being made. Farmers are then penalised for genuine mistakes when the bureaucracy goes wrong.  Of course, those who deliberately try to defraud the system must be caught, but there are hundreds of decent farmers who miss deadlines because one comes on top of another and none comes together.  The Minister has buried the system under paper.  We have office workers, not farmers.  Older farmers in particular are frustrated by the volume of paper work that has evolved in recent times.</P>
    <P>I keep hearing about the improvements in the Department with regard to brucellosis testing.  I have been writing to the Department in relation to this issue for some time.  Could the Minister allow 30 days from when the results of the blood test are returned to the farmer until the animal is sold?  That is not a great relaxation of the present system but it would put an end to quibbling about whether there was a seven, a 14 or a 21 day turnaround in the blood sample.  The enormous pressure being put on laboratory workers would also be eased.  So long as the farmer has 30 days in which to sell the cattle once he gets the result of the blood test we would be meeting all the criteria. We need the blood test because there has been an increase in brucellosis in recent years but a farmer could be allowed 30 days to get his stock sold after he gets the result of the blood test.</P>
    <P>The Leader of my party made an extensive statement on agriculture at the weekend and I suggest the Minister might look at it if he has not had an opportunity to do so.  It is in the nature of the job for Ministers to be involved in fire brigade action.  The Minister is shoring up the crises as they arise, so to speak.  Has he had any time for rational strategic thought on agricultural policy, particularly with regard to the situation post-Agenda 2000 and the next WTO round?  We should focus on those matters.  The debate should concentrate on the medium-term and long-term prospects for farming.  All parties in the House can play the political card when it suits them, but we do not have debates on long-term strategic policy for agriculture.  It is a frustration for me. We do farmers no service unless we consider the longer term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> We cannot continue to act in a fire brigade manner, as the Minister has done since taking office.  I must criticise him for that.  He may have to act in such a fashion because that is all he has time for given that so much fire brigade action is needed.  However, he and the Department must be criticised for the lack of medium-term and long-term planning.</P>
    <P>I have great problems with the changes in EU agriculture policy, especially the issue of concentrating production in areas of comparative natural advantage.  We joined the EEC in 1973 primarily because of the benefits it offered for agricultural exports and the farming and food industries.  The reform of the CAP took away or curtailed greatly most of the benefits with quotas, production controls and price reductions and with direct payments to compensate for the reductions in production.  Agenda 2000 and the next WTO round will lead to a major liberalisation of agricultural trade.  Irish farmers will be put on a level with Japanese and New Zealand farmers.  I worry that we are not prepared and that we are being dishonest with the farming community by not pointing out the inevitability of developments.</P>
    <P>However, if we can survive the next few years and reach the point of open market prices, those farmers who survive will have a good future ahead of them, although their numbers will be nothing like the present.  There will be a demand for what they produce, not only the basic food commodities but also the niche markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been a disappointment.  I expected more from him in terms of strategic planning and serious thought and investment in the future of agriculture.  He has acted as a fireman for the past year.  Basic issues, such as the scale of form filling required and the turnaround time in the brucellosis tests, have not been attended to by the Department.  He cannot have responsibility for food and agriculture at the same time &mdash; indeed, his is failing on both counts because he is falling between two stools.  If he has responsibility for agriculture he should look after the farmers and responsibility for food should be transferred to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The agriculture industry is important to the economy.  Most rural towns and villages are dependent on it for their survival.  As <Col N="1282" /> the economy continues to grow and the Government continues to provide such excellent leadership it is unfortunate that farmers are not experiencing the boom in the rest of the economy, especially in the beef sector where margins remain tight despite improvements in the spring. The continuing flight from the land and rural areas and the lack of young people who take up farming as a career should be of concern to all. These events will have a negative effect on farming in the future because farmers will be older and will find it more difficult to face the challenges of a changing industry.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and the ministerial team at the Department for the job they are doing for Irish farmers.  We wish prices would improve more quickly but were it not for the Government's actions since taking office we would be in a far more difficult position.  This time last year steer beef was 79p per pound at the factory; thankfully, it is now 92p per pound.  Had it not been for the intervention of the Government and the Minister in the past year in reopening the live cattle export trade and if the 55,000 cattle exported had not been exported, we would not have experienced the increase in the price of beef.  Live exports increase competition which is positive for the farming community.</P>
      <P>In rebuilding the beef markets we must ensure consumer confidence in the product.  The Government's work on animal traceability and the quality assurance scheme is a major step in assuring customers of the quality of Irish beef. The establishment of the Food Safety Authority as a statutory agency will ensure food safety, hygiene and the promotion of good practice through all stages of food production, distribution and sale.</P>
      <P>I welcome a number of measures the Minister has taken which are of great assistance to farmers, including the recent announcement with regard to the increase in the overall value of the REP scheme to £205 million per year from 2000. The Minister is to be complimented for his swift action to speed up blood test results.  It will be welcomed by farmers who are testing heifers for sale.  It was unacceptable that they had to wait 21 days for a result; that must not happen again.  The Minister announced the satisfactory conclusion reached on the blood testing issue and I compliment him and the Department on it.  It was important to resolve the issue.  Undoubtedly the major agricultural challenge to this Government is CAP reform.  I am confident the Minister and his colleagues will ensure our national interests are protected in these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small number of young people taking up farming as a career is a major concern.  The young farmers' insulation aid scheme was of great assistance to young people entering farming as it helped to create pollution control facilities or much needed farm buildings.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to this scheme.  In my area of Cavan and Monaghan the uptake of the pollution <Col N="1283" /> control and dairy hygiene schemes was very good, but much work remains to be done.  Reintroducing these schemes would create many jobs as the economic activity that accompanies those schemes is of great benefit to the whole area.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his efforts to reopen the live trade to Egypt, Libya and wherever he can sell our cattle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand where Senator Quinn is coming from.  He is in the food and grocery business.  There are many agencies in the food sector, such as Forbairt and the IDA, which are doing a good job.  However, the Minister must take huge responsibility for the entire agricultural industry.  He plays a big role in the lives of small farmers, as the majority of those farmers depend on cheques in the post.</P>
      <P>While Senator Quinn would not be familiar with the complexities of some aspects of farming, the Minister should be aware of them.  The majority of 30 day blood test cases I have encountered recently have taken up to 29 days to resolve.  This allows the farmer one day to sell his stock and is most unfair.  I urge the Minister to take whatever immediate steps are necessary to rectify this.</P>
      <P>Regarding the REP scheme, if a farmer is unlucky enough to be inspected, there is a four month delay in payment as a result.  This is an unfair burden and the Minister should examine it.  The Minister mentioned the area aid scheme. To enable Department staff to clear a backlog of 19,700 cases, it was necessary for the Minister to close the offices.  Much of that backlog arose due to mistakes made by the Department, and the Department should take the blame where it is due.  Not all of the backlog was due to mistakes made by farmers.</P>
      <P>When the Minister took office in 1992 he said the control of farmyard pollution scheme would last five years.  It only lasted for five months; and the Minister should have budgeted, as other Departments did in introducing multi-annual budgets, in order to cover all applicants over a five year period.  He could have used a combination of Exchequer funding and European grant aid to make allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairy hygiene scheme should also have been funded from the Exchequer where shortfalls occurred.  As Senator Doyle said, the Government has a lot of ground to make up.  Farmers are worried and the Minister has much to do to restore their confidence in him.  He should consider <Col N="1284" /> the problems I have raised and rectify them as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister because, by common consent, he is a decent fellow. However, by equally common consent he and the Government have been totally ineffective and have not honoured the pre-election promises to fund the matters referred to in this motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be proactive in co-ordinating the necessary efforts to obtain a shipping service for the live trade.  There is a huge crisis as a result of the failure to reopen the live cattle export market.  What happened to the Government's commitment to farmers when in Opposition that it would reopen and expand live export markets such as Egypt and Libya?  We were promised a high powered offensive, but it did not happen.  The Government's efforts have been ineffective, and beef producers have been left to the mercies of the factories.  Farmers in other EU countries are getting much better prices.  Live exports are much needed and it is the only way farmers will get better prices from factories.</P>
      <P>Kerry has approximately 60,000 suckler cows and within two months 30,000 to 40,000 weanlings will be available, but the farmer-producers will be without proper outlets.  The Department's advice about the importance of the environment rings very hollow when the Minister has done nothing about the farmyard pollution scheme.  The Government made a pre-election promise to restart and expand the farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes and also promised to continue installation aid for young farmers.  Apart from funding existing applications, why has this scheme been abandoned?  No long term commitment has been made in that regard.  There have been huge delays in all categories of payments to farmers, and under the charter of rights farmers are entitled to payment on time.  Many farmers awaiting payment have had to make arrangements with banks for extra borrowings on which interest had to be paid, though the delays were the responsibility of the Department.  Will the Minister give a firm commitment that payment schedules will be met in 1998?</P>
      <P>There is a drift out of milk production which will accelerate if the Minister continues to do nothing about the dairy hygiene scheme.  It is extremely urgent as farmers must comply with regulations on parlour hygiene by 1 January 1999. The Minister must fight the draconian Santer proposals; failure in this regard would cause devastation in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of proposals in the sheep sector is a major omission, as sheep are vital to Irish agriculture. We have 47,000 sheep farmers and the income generated by them in disadvantaged areas is critical.  If the Agenda 2000 proposals are carried, consumption of sheep meat would be significantly affected by the 30 per cent reduction in beef price support that is being sought.  Sheep farmers are going through a very difficult time <Col N="1285" /> and must be protected.  The small hill sheep farmer has a severe income problem because the payment of ewe premia and sheep headage account for almost 100 per cent of his net income. These farmers have no alternative to sheep farming.</P>

      <P>There is a Minister of State in this Government with responsibility for food &mdash; Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.  That office was discontinued by the last Government.  On the day of the general election, 6 June 1997, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced in Wexford that he had succeeded in opening the live cattle trade to Libya and the Middle East.  However, that did not materialise.  The present Minister does not try to practice the art of bilocation, unlike the former Minister.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The control of farmyard pollution scheme was suspended by the last Government on 27 April 1995.  We look forward to the Minister reintroducing it in a form which will benefit agriculture and the environment.</P>

      <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme is very important for the protection of the environment as well as ensuring high standards on our farms.  I look forward to the Minister's reintroduction of the scheme which he announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairy hygiene scheme was suspended by the previous Government on 4 October 1996. When Fine Gael tabled the motion it should have realised its Government suspended or did away with these schemes.  When that scheme was suspended 7,900 applications were on hand.  Up to <Col N="1286" /> the end of May 1998 some 7,500 applications had been fully processed and approvals had issued in respect of 6,800 applications, representing a grant commitment of £40.5 million.  By the end of 1997 a total of £22.9 million had been paid, with some 3,640 applicants.  In the mid-term review of the Structural Funds the Minister had an additional £8.5 million made available, which brought the overall indicative allocation to the scheme up to £37.5 million.  In addition, a further £2.7 million in national Exchequer funding was made available in the 1997 Supplementary Estimate.  I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the new farm installation grant scheme for young farmers, I must congratulate a Minister in this House for the second time today. I congratulated the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, this morning and I am now congratulating the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  I want to specifically congratulate the Minister on the changes he has brought about in the farm retirement scheme. That change, which he has almost finished negotiating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The change, which does away with the additionality and the need to give up employment to satisfy the income qualification, is much more beneficial to young farmers.  When the negotiations are completed they will not have to spend money on purchasing or leasing additional land or give up their employment.  The changes being made in the retirement scheme should be contrasted with young farmers receiving a grant of £5,600.  The changes in the retirement scheme are much more beneficial.  The removal of the need to purchase land is worth at least £40,000 and the retention of employment is worth £15,000 or £20,000 if one has a reasonable job.  The benefit of that is self evident.</P>
      <P>The Opposition forgot about the farm retirement scheme, which has been in operation for a number of years.  The maximum amount available under that scheme is £9,700, which was set a number of years ago.  Will the Minister consider updating that maximum amount substantially?  I urge him to take that on board.</P>
      <P>We congratulate the Minister on his efforts to reopen the live cattle trade to Libya, Egypt and elsewhere.  He has succeeded in getting live exports of 55,000 cattle this year, while, as he said himself, not one beast was exported last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone accepts what the Minister is doing in relation to animal traceability, which is extremely important to the industry.  I hope he will look kindly on a suggestion in that regard.  At the moment beef cattle are being offered through the factories on a flat pay basis.  Grading is not taking place in our plants.  Senator Quinn referred to quality but we cannot have quality without grading. The flat price for our cattle is not a satisfactory <Col N="1287" /> way of ensuring we have quality bred, quality fed and quality produced cattle for the consumer. Farmers would appreciate the linking the payment of premia with the quality of the animal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great progress in regard to area aid, on which I congratulate him.  If the Opposition were to speak honestly they would recognise that.</P>

      <P>No. In 1981 220,655 people left the land and 152,909 left in 1998.  There has been no reference to that reality.  I spent time yesterday on the mid west regional submission.  The most contentious issue when discussing the submission was not the urban problems one finds in cities such as Limerick which have blackspot areas of unemployment; instead, the debate which caused most angst and concern was among councillors representing farmers in Counties Tipperary, Clare and Limerick, which are major areas in dairying and agriculture generally.  They were quite alarmed by the impact of farming problems on the rural environment and the decline in the number of young people taking up farming.  They were also concerned about people over 45 years of age who had to abandon farming and who did not have the skills to make themselves employable in other areas.</P>
      <P>I will confine my comments to two areas, namely, the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme.  However, that does not mean that the other issues to which the motion refers are not equally worthy of debate.  I noted a number of discrepancies in terms of the figures I received from farming organisations and those put forward by the Minister.  I presume the 18,000 farmers who were suspended in 1995 have been reinstated.  One of the organisations to which I referred supplied me with a figure of £25 million in respect of the control of farmyard pollution scheme but I estimate the Minister made available £32 million in this regard.  The ICMSA informs me that the grants paid out by the last day of January 1998 amounted to £20.3 million whereas the Minister stated that £40.5 million was paid out.  Perhaps this is because the Minister's estimate represents a cumulative total from January to June but I am not sure about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that he is currently examining funding possibilities for more focused schemes in respect of farm pollution and dairy hygiene.  What does the term &ldquo;focused&rdquo; mean? Why have we waited until now to focus on the problems in these areas?  I do not like words such as &ldquo;focused&rdquo; because they have little value.  The Minister also stated that even where they are focused these schemes require significant levels <Col N="1288" /> of funding.  I would have expected that such schemes would always be focused.</P>
    <P>I understand that 20,000 farmers would like to become involved in the control of farmyard pollution schemes.  In County Limerick alone, 2,000 farmers want to be included in these schemes. What will these people who have been left bereft because of lack of funding do now?  I hope the Minister will request Exchequer funding if it is not possible to obtain EU funding in this regard.</P>
    <P>The figures given to me by the farming organisations show that between 10,000 and 15,000 farmers would like to be involved in the dairy hygiene schemes which are essential to enable them to remain on the land.  If their premises are not registered by 1999, a doomsday scenario awaits them.  Hygiene affects the entire food chain and ancillary areas such as value added products and quality milk and dairy products.  If stringent controls are not implemented, farmers will be put out of business.  It is time the issue of hygiene was addressed.</P>
    <P>I was provided with other statistics &mdash; I admit I am relying on the opinion of experts but I presume their findings are correct because they have been published &mdash; in respect of farm building specialists.  In that context, we are not discussing the loss of jobs in farming alone.  The Irish Concrete Society estimates that 6,000 jobs have been affected by a decline in farm related construction spending.  Teagasc estimates there has been a decline of £60 million in farm related construction spending but the ICMSA estimates there will be an £80 million decline in 1998, which is equivalent to a loss of 1,500 jobs.  If these figures are correct, not only will people involved in farming be affected but those providing ancillary services in rural areas where farmers tend to employ local construction firms that specialise in farm construction will also suffer.</P>
    <P>Specific figures from the public capital programme show that spending in this area will increase by 19 per cent in 1998 to £4.324 billion whereas public capital expenditure on food will decrease by 21 per cent.  The Minister must take that into account in addition to the fact that total public and private spending on agriculture will decrease by 30 per cent.  He must realise that these are sizeable percentages.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with part-time farming, an area about which I have strong views, which seems to represent the way forward.  To a degree, that is good for young farmers who want to work in a city such as Limerick where job opportunities are offered in the computer industry by Dell and AST.  However, I shudder to think what will happen in Counties Roscommon and Leitrim where there is no alternative employment for farmers living in remote areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the early retirement scheme for farmers, the only hope for small farmers with incomes of £5,000 is to obtain another job which will net them a further £5,000.  Will the Minister consider increasing the provision in this regard to between £15,000 to £20,000?  I accept that a limit may have been placed on this money in the past <Col N="1289" /> at a time when business interests took control of farms, but there is a need to review the situation.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, in light of the partnership in Government, that Senator Gibbons waited until now to suggest to the Minister that action be taken in respect of seed potatoes.  That issue has been discussed at length over the past four to five years and we should not have had to wait for Senator Gibbons to progress it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Four to five main issues were addressed. Before dealing with them I must reply to inquiries why this motion was put down.  It was put down because of widespread concerns in the farming community that the Government's promises have <Col N="1290" /> not been honoured 12 months after the general election.  My party took a unanimous decision to put down the motion for that reason and no other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with the main issues raised.  Many Members referred to the area aid payments.  In my opinion, regardless of what the Minister said, events in the past number of months and the level of payments received by farmers are an utter disgrace.  To state that the area aid unit could not be contacted by telephone is the most disgraceful message to issue from Agriculture House in many years.  Politicians, not to mention farmers, could not contact the unit; that was disgraceful.  The Minster cannot say the situation has improved.</P>
      <P>The payments since Christmas were worse than during the previous 12 months.  In 1994 the Minister announced the control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes which were to last five years.  Those schemes lasted five months as he announced schemes for which there was no money.  There is huge concern, particularly among dairy farmers who have to upgrade their dairy units under EU regulations.  They do not have the money and cannot afford to update their milking parlours and this is an utter disgrace.  A few months ago the Government did not want the European money it was getting for Luas.  At that stage the Government should have made a proper presentation highlighting the importance of agriculture to this country and that money should have been channelled into agriculture.</P>
      <P>There was much debate earlier about the live cattle trade and in particular over the past 12 months.  No live cattle have been exported to Egypt or Libya since the Government came to power.  A commitment had been sought and received by Deputy Yates to open the live cattle trade.  It was genuine and backed up by Department officials.  Since the Government came to power no animal has left for those countries.  In a few months we will reach the October cattle glut and prices will reduce by £100 per head.  With regard to the export of cattle to the European market, agents are trawling the country wishing to pay £65 per cwt.  Cattle are making £55 per cwt in marts but they are willing to pay more if only there was a proper transportation system in place. Export trade has been an unmitigated disaster and that is where the Government has totally fallen down.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to respond to this Adjournment matter.  Whether we like it or not, the Government's policy on refugees and asylum seekers is widely perceived as being one dimensional. Increasingly the country is seen as erecting a stop sign to all the different categories of immigrants who reach our shores.</P>
      <P>We must take account of the criminal gangs who, it seems, are accumulating ill-gotten gains through the trafficking of immigrants to Ireland. We have heard the reports of immigrants who, it is believed, not only are forced to pay a huge premium for their entry to this country but are also forced to continue to pay to these criminals a portion of any income they receive here, whether it be in the form of State payments or otherwise.  However, it is wrong to bracket all those seeking asylum and refugee status in a single category.</P>
      <P>It is a new experience for this country to have to deal with such a huge inflow of immigrants. While Irish people for a century and more have sought and secured refuge in every country, we are entering unknown territory as a recipient country.  At present it is estimated there are over 5,000 applications to be processed.  I note the recruitment by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of an additional 72 staff to clear the backlog and fully accept the need for a strict regime in the vetting of applications. However, it is vital that the process is underpinned by fairness and non-discrimination.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is considering legislation in an effort to deal with abuses of Irish citizenship law, particularly in regard to post-nuptial citizenship and the deliberate arrangement of births to non-nationals. The Minister also wants to introduce legislation which would criminalise trafficking in illegal immigrants and penalise persons who employ such immigrants.  These measures are necessary, but of equal importance is a wide ranging Government initiative to put in place policies to accommodate ethnic minorities in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there have been signs recently of a growing intolerance of refugees.  Racism is raising its ugly head and an impression is being formed in the public mind that refugees are an intolerable burden and this should be lifted swiftly through their mass deportation.  However, we cannot allow such views to develop in Ireland which considers itself a modern democracy. There is no room for the oppression of ethnic minorities in modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government has a duty to lead by example and put in place a balanced programme which applies the rules firmly and fairly on the one hand but which fully respects and upholds the rights and dignity of all refugees on the other.  The Refugee Agency, which comes within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is only one vehicle through which this more balanced and considered approach to the refugee issue can be pursued.  An expanded role for the agency is vital if we are to fulfil our range of obligations under international human rights conventions.</P>
      <P>The often heard tourism slogan, &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo;, has taken a battering recently.  I do not underestimate the pressure placed on the social services by the arrival of a record number of refugees from all parts of the world.  However, I appeal to the Government to display more creative thinking and generosity of spirit in dealing with the issue.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I agree with many of the points she made.  The increased number of asylum seekers coming to this country in recent years has led to different responses.  Sadly, much of the comment, as Senator Keogh indicated, has been negative. Some commentators focus on the high cost of supporting the asylum seekers while others speak of the dangers of concentrating or ghettoising them in inner city communities, thus fermenting difficulties in areas where people already feel marginalised through poverty.</P>
      <P>Up to the mid-1990s, the numbers seeking asylum in Ireland were not significant.  This position has changed and, in my view, there will continue to be a regular flow of asylum applicants here for the foreseeable future.  There will continue to be conflicts in many countries forcing large numbers of people to leave their homes and seek protection elsewhere.  While the vast majority have and will continue to find protection in countries near their country of origin, there will always be some who will travel long distances, often at great physical risk, in search of protection and safety.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with designated responsibility for human rights, I am concerned, as is Senator Keogh, at the growing level of racism and public intolerance of refugees and foreigners in Ireland.  It is vital that measures are taken to counteract this trend and that the Government plays a strong, proactive role.  Government policy in this area needs to be balanced, fair and above all mindful of our human rights obligations internationally. For this reason I am anxious that the procedures in place to deal with asylum applications are efficient and effective and, at the same time, respect the diversity and ethnicity of the asylum seekers concerned.</P>
      <P>Many people fleeing political persecution will face death or torture if returned by EU countries. However, I also want Ireland to apply in a flexible and humane way our right under the Dublin Convention to transfer asylum seekers who are held to have entered Ireland via another member state, even where that state agrees to accept the transfer.  There are almost certainly cases where people fleeing political persecution will face death or torture if they are then returned by EU countries to their country of origin.</P>
      <P>My Department is closely liaising with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that Government policy on this issue is fully consistent with our international obligations. We are consulting the UNHCR on the technical challenge of putting in place fair procedures in this regard.  In the longer term we must develop proper policies for accommodating ethnic minorities generally in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of us must promote a generous and positive welcome for the refugee community in Ireland and see it for what it is, an opportunity for Ireland to develop its diversity and tolerance <Col N="1294" /> of difference as is fitting in a true Republic.  In the same way as Irish emigrants for generations have enriched the countries in which they have settled and been welcomed, society can be enriched through the diverse experiences, contributions and talents of other cultures who wish to live among us.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Agency, under the aegis of my Department, is responsible for the co-ordination of reception and resettlement services for programme refugees, that is, those refugees invited to Ireland following a Government decision.  Such decisions are usually made on foot of an appeal from the UNHCR.  The main groups of programme refugees in Ireland are Bosnian and Vietnamese.  There are at present 826 Bosnians and 603 Vietnamese in this country, including a number born here.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Agency is managed by a board which comprises an independent chairperson and representatives of the Departments most involved with refugee issues.  The Irish Refugee Council, the Irish Red Cross and the Irish Episcopal</P>
    <P>Commission for Emigrants are also represented on the board as are a number of observer members, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The agency is funded solely by way of grant-in-aid from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The staff of the agency consists of a director, a small resettlement team and administrative support.  They do valuable and much appreciated work with their clients.</P>
    <P>The main work of the resettlement team involves initial support for families, including assistance in accessing entitlements such as health, social welfare, language training etc. and in helping the individual or family find suitable accommodation usually in the private rented sector. Follow up support is provided mainly in relation to accessing education, training and employment opportunities and in dealing with applications for family reunification where close family members may be given permission to come to Ireland to join families here.</P>
    <P>The agency also has a role in relation to the development of policy and services for refugees. With its expertise in this area it has been able to offer assistance and advice to Departments and agencies in relation to the development of specialist services for refugees.  In this way the agency has sought to ensure that policies, such as English language and training, are developed which enable refugees to build an independent life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Reviews of the Refugee Agency have been undertaken in recent years.  A review last year suggested that in the absence of a major conflict or crisis which might prompt further intakes of programme refugees, the agency would have fulfilled its purpose in the near future if its mandate was not altered.  I am determined that there will be no more procrastination on this matter.  The <Col N="1295" /> need for an agency with a wider remit is now urgent and I am liaising with the relevant Ministers to expedite the matter.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Refugee Agency has provided a high standard of service to programme refugees.  It has taken a lead role in assessing the special needs of these groups, such as accommodation, special psychological services, language training, skills training and retraining.  The agency has a skilled resettlement team which has been supporting refugees in their task of integrating into society.  They have been extremely successful in that most programme refugees are happily integrated.  Many of them are citizens and many more are anxious to become citizens.</P>
    <P>In my view, any decision on a future role for the Refugee Agency &mdash; this decision would be taken by the Government &mdash; must be in the context of the need for such a service for others apart from programme refugees.  My view is that it would make sense from a number of perspectives to bring under one organisation the co-ordination of State services for programme refugees and those asylum seekers recognised as refugees under the Geneva Convention.  We must start strategising now on the basis that a certain percentage of the thousands of asylum seekers currently being processed will be determined as convention refugees and, therefore, allowed to stay. We need to have support services ready to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>However, it is vital that any consideration on broadening the remit of the agency is seen as part of an overall policy on asylum and immigration. As policy develops and procedures are put in place to deal quickly with asylum applications, there will be a real need to provide, in a skilled and efficient way, the relevant support and assistance to facilitate the integration into Irish society of all those given refugee status or leave to remain in Ireland on humanitarian grounds.  Any change in the role and functions of the Refugee Agency would necessitate adjustments in its structure and operations.  The present status of the agency is cumbersome and the review undertaken in 1997 recommends, for example, that it should have the status of a limited liability company with authority to employ its own staff.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the agency in its revised form also take a lead role on public awareness on issues surrounding racism.  I believe strong advocacy is required by public officials and leaders in society against racism and in favour of generosity and courtesy towards those who are fleeing persecution and conflict.  The agency, along with all sectors of the community &mdash; including the media, NGOs, community groups, trade unions, schools and parents' organisations &mdash; should be central in informing Irish society and helping us adjust to the changes within our communities.</P>
    <P>Ireland is changing &mdash; we are becoming a society of different nationalities, cultures and languages. The Government has a responsibility to <Col N="1296" /> give leadership to our people in adapting to this changing environment.  As Senator Keogh said, our history is one of mass emigration; but, thankfully, that is no longer the case.  We must not allow xenophobic tendencies to proliferate among us, tendencies which would be historically inconsistent and morally wrong.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Woods for coming back to the House to respond to this motion.  I have put this matter down for discussion because of its extreme importance to the economic life and wellbeing of the people along the western seaboard.  The timing is right for the Minister, through his semi-State body Arramara Teoranta, to bring forward the strategic development plan for the development of our seaweed resources in coastal regions.</P>
      <P>I refer specifically to the lack of development in the seaweed resources of County Mayo.  I served as a director of Arramara Teoranta for five years, from 1991 to 1995, during which period the board of the company developed a plan and made two attempts to receive grant aid from the IDA to build a seaweed processing plant in County Mayo.  On each occasion the board was denied the opportunity of developing that resource in the interests of the people in rural Ireland.  The company had devised a substantial plan and the interests of the people were not properly served by the IDA's refusal of grant aid. The letter from the IDA stated that it could not support the Arramara Teoranta application because, and I quote:</P>
      <P>. the Clew Bay project is now proceeding without IDA grants and there does not appear to be sufficient seaweed resources to support two plants.</P>
      <P>Currently and for the past 15 years there has been no substantial seaweed production in County Mayo by any company.  There is a business opportunity to develop this natural resource and I have put down this matter to indicate how important it is to make a decision in the best interests of the people.</P>
      <P>The IDA's deplorable decision not to grant aid Arramara Teoranta on two occasions &mdash; for which I blame the board of the authority and its chief executive, Mr. Ciarán McGowan &mdash; has resulted in a substantial depopulation of young people from the rural and coastal parts of County Mayo and has hit small villages, towns, churches and schools.  It has affected the income of over 200 families and caused substantial emigration. The reduction in population has led to a decrease in political strength in the county &mdash; our Dáil representation has been reduced from six to five seats.  It has also led to further depopulation of our larger towns and along the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have this matter addressed immediately and not to entertain any more interference <Col N="1297" /> with the development of the seaweed industry in County Mayo.  This would be in line with Government policy and in the interest of sustaining rural population and providing income necessary for the long term sustainability of our villages and parishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Seaweed has been harvested along the western seaboard since at least the 12th century. Our indented coastline with mild temperatures, varying wave exposures and rock types is conducive to the growth of rich deposits of seaweed. Most seaweed harvesting is carried out in remote areas and, together with salmon farming and shellfish mariculture, contributes to the economic sustainability in areas where few alternative sources of employment exist.  I agree totally with Senator Chambers in that regard.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, over six million tonnes of seaweed are processed commercially each year, generating more than US$4 billion.  Ireland produced almost 40,000 tonnes during 1997.  The seaweed industry currently comprises 17 processing companies with a combined sales value worth in the region of IR£5 million.  This constitutes a major increase in sales value over the past number of years, with 80 per cent of current sales being won on export markets.  In excess of 500 workers are currently involved in seaweed harvesting and processing on a seasonal basis along the western seaboard.  With the general consumer preference towards products manufactured from natural resources, an increasing number of commodities such as healthcare products, horticultural products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are made from seaweed. There is undoubted scope to increase the economic contribution of the sector through enhanced exploitation, product diversification and added value.  I am again in agreement with the Senator here.</P>
      <P>We have seen a positive increase in recent years in the realisation of the potential and opportunities of the seaweed resource.  Arramara Teoranta, which is 51 percent owned by the State, is the major player in the sector and has been responsible for the large scale development of this resource to date.  The company has an annual turnover of over £2 million, employing 30 people full time at its two production facilities in Connemara and Donegal.  As part of its ongoing strategy Arramara Teoranta has increased its present seaweed drying capacity by 20 per cent through ongoing investment in infrastructure.  The company is currently updating its corporate strategy plan and intends, as part this strategic review, to put greater emphasis on the development of its research and technology capabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of a number of other seaweed processing companies on the western and south-western seaboard has also contributed to the unprecedented growth recorded for the industry in recent years.  Compared with the extent of development in other seaweed producing countries, <Col N="1298" /> the overall potential of the seaweed resource in Ireland has been insufficiently acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The welcome and growing increase in entrepreneurial activity in recent years has led to the establishment of the Irish Seaweed Industry Organisation &mdash; ISIO &mdash; which is pursuing further development opportunities for the industry. Investment in research and development in the industry has risen since 1994, with the ISIO participating and leading some of the projects.  Future sustainable development of the resource will depend primarily on the extent and nature of that resource and to that end a comprehensive national scientific survey around the coast is under way.</P>
    <P>A research and development strategy for the seaweed sector is essential to identify and realise the potential opportunities for growth.  The key objective of seaweed R and D is to maximise the use of the national resource in a manner consistent with sustainable development and with appropriate husbandry.  Quantification of the resource is the first priority and in that context I have approved funding totalling £427,400 in respect of seven seaweed related projects under the marine research measure of the operational programme for fisheries 1994-9.  The investment in these surveys represents a clear vote of confidence in the ability of the various participants &mdash; the colleges, industries and individuals &mdash; to pursue research and development activities leading to future economic development in the seaweed sector.</P>
    <P>The first project, the results of which will critically inform future sustainable development strategies for the sector throughout coastal regions, covers the mapping and assessment of exploitable algal biomass off the west coast of Ireland.  This project was a joint initiative by Arramara Teoranta, the Irish Seaweed Industry Organisation, University College Galway and University College Cork.  The results of this survey, which has already led to capital investment in the sector, will be published later this month.  The remaining projects which are progressing satisfactorily include the investigation of the distribution of maërl beds around Ireland and their potential for sustainable extraction; processing systems for commercially utilised sea vegetables; strain selection of edible brown seaweed as a key dietary component of high value shellfish; development of new seaweed based hydroseeding process for soil stabilisation and vegetation; strain hybridisation field experiments and genetic fingerprinting of the edible brown seaweed and, finally, determining the impact of hand and mechanical harvesting of knotted wrack on regeneration and biodiversity.</P>
    <P>To take matters forward I recently announced the establishment of a seaweed forum to examine and report on the potential for development of the market for seaweed and seaweed extracts.  I expect the forum to evaluate the current state of <Col N="1299" /> knowledge of the seaweed resource and its economic contribution, to consult with the relevant participants and industry players; to investigate the potential uses of seaweed, taking into account future research needs and market opportunities, to examine any impediments to realising the sector's potential and to make recommendations to overcome these.  The findings of the forum will inform future policy decisions required to foster enterprise and innovation in the seaweed sector. <Col N="1300" /> I expect the forum to convene early next month and to report their findings to me within nine months.  I am convinced that there are several opportunities for new initiatives in the seaweed industry particularly along the west coast and I believe that circumstances favouring the development of seaweed enterprises in Ireland have never been better than they are at present.</P>
