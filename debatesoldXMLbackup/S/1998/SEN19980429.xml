      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take into account the serious situation arising from the fact that in the case of the review of sentences of various offenders, including those convicted of murder, the criteria used by the sentencing review group does not include any consideration of the views of the family of the victim of that offender.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to sanction immediately the employment of a resource teacher for St. John the Baptist National School, Cashel, County Tipperary, which was applied for last year and still remains outstanding.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that maintenance grants are paid to post leaving certificate students from the beginning of the school year in the autumn of 1998.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators O'Meara's and Hayes' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 13, motion 18.  For item 1, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, contributions of spokespersons should not exceed 20 minutes with <Col N="358" /> 15 minutes for other Senators.  Senators may share time.  Item 13, motion 18, will be taken at 6 p.m. I suggest that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Order 42, the time for debating this motion be extended to four hours, namely, two hours tonight and two hours next Wednesday night.  Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business and thank the Leader for providing an extra two hours to debate motion 18.  I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on the sale of State assets.  The public are demanding a debate in the House on ICC, ACC and TSB.  The staffs of these institutions are in limbo as they do not know what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business. In thanking the Leader for extending the time for the debate on motion 18, the House should recognise that the additional two hours are of Government Private Members' time from next week.  Therefore, the rota of time for different groups is not changed.</P>
      <P>The Leader gave me a clear undertaking before the recess that the issue of industrial relations, which has been raised on a number of occasions in the House, would be dealt with by means of an extensive debate sometime in April.  I ask the Leader to outline the arrangements for a debate as there is increasing demand for it in the context of the direction of Partnership 2000 &mdash; a huge issue &mdash; and what might replace it, the Ryanair dispute and union recognition, the report on a minimum wage and the action being taken by the Garda.  There are a variety of issues which need to be discussed and we need an opportunity to hear the views of Government and express our own views.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the leader of Fine Gael, Senator Manning, raised the Shannon Council Bill, something I have also raised.  I know this issue is close to the Cathaoirleach's heart and that the Leader of the House, who may be somewhat embarrassed by the Government's position, is committed to the legislation.  The Leader should clear the air and establish the position of the Government parties <i>vis-à-vis</i> their position a year ago.  I want a clear indication from the Leader as to which Minister will deal with this issue and when it will be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business and am glad the Leader has tabled Second Stage of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998, as promised and that it is being initially taken in this House.  I also support the extension of the debate on local government as everybody will wish to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it possible for the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House later today or tomorrow even for a short debate on the efforts being made to resolve the GRA dispute and, perhaps more <Col N="359" /> urgently, the contingency measures being put in place to deal with what could be a major disruption if the threatened action by the gardaí takes place on Friday?  In the other House the Minister seemed to deprecate the efforts being made by a Member of this House on behalf of the gardaí, saying it was wrong to state that a Senator could speak for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Perhaps the Minister will come before the House to allay fears among the public over the security situation which might arise on Friday if the action goes ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity being provided to discuss the problem of travellers. There is a problem akin to this concerning traders and I am not sure whether the time can be extended to include discussion of them.  This problem is similar in nature to the problems of travellers as traders set up anywhere in the country and demand local authorities to provide hard stands or trading sites, the principal case being put forward by travellers.  The local authority of which I am a member has spent £500,000 providing a car park and environmental improvements, but a trader has set up in the middle of it &mdash; I will pass a photograph to the Leader which will help him understand the seriousness of the problem. Will the Leader clarify the possibility of extending the debate to include casual traders or, alternatively, facilitate a separate debate on the issue?  It is an urgent matter as casual trading is big business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may not discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but is it difficult for me to put the merit of my case without infringing in this manner, and I am sorry for doing so.  I want clarification from the Leader to see if both issues can be debated together or whether he will provide time on another occasion to discuss casual trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Independent Senators have tabled a motion concerning Luas.  I raised this matter yesterday and got a general indication from the Leader that the issue would be debated.  Will the Leader advance this indication by providing a timetable for a debate?  I understand the consultants' report has been made available.  Very wisely, the Cabinet has delayed making a decision for one week.  Is it possible to have a debate in the House during that period, as it is important debates take place before rather than after decisions have been taken?  Reasoned argument in this House could help influence Cabinet decisions.  Almost every criteria evaluated resulted in favouring the underground option, but the report recommended the overground option, apparently on some economic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister with responsibility for sport to take an active interest in the <Col N="360" /> case of Michelle Smith, particularly in light of the fact that the officials of her sport appear to have a malign attitude towards her?  They compelled her to attend drug testing procedures at the international meeting in Spain last summer and then criticised her for not attending a press conference having frustrated her attendance.  It is impossible to understand how somebody in that position can win.  I ask the Minister to keep a close eye on the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Leader to facilitate a debate on future funding for disadvantaged areas in the context of continuing Objective One status and I believe he will give consideration to such a debate.  I am sure the House will welcome the announcement by the EU Commission that it intends recognising the significance of the Good Friday Agreement by continuing funding, on an increased basis, for the Border counties, both North and South.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House unreservedly condemns the callous and vicious killing of the 20 year old student in Crumlin earlier this week.  In the context of the ongoing peace process and the call for a debate, the Nationalist community in the North has been lectured by successive Unionist politicians over the past 30 years to contact the RUC to reveal the names of those, allegedly within their community, who have been carrying out murders.  Over the past 12 months the vast majority of those killed have come from the Catholic community.  I suggest Unionist politicians should now be encouraging those in their community to contact the police.  The people involved are known.  No guerrilla army can operate successfully without at least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a civilised society that this can go on.  I hope that an opportunity will arise in the context of the debate on the ongoing benefits of the peace Agreement to raise this matter again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Gallagher in urging the greater involvement of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform in resolving the ongoing dispute with the GRA, whose members have been loyal servants of the State down the years.  Thankfully, many of them disagree with the &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo; idea.  We should not be putting them in this position for want of meaningful discussions.  I earnestly plead with the Leader for the deeper <Col N="361" /> involvement of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke called again for a debate on the State-sponsored bodies, the ICC, the TSB and the ACC.  I have agreed to this debate and hope to have it at the earliest possible opportunity, maybe within the next two or three weeks.</P>
      <P>I can confirm to Senator O'Toole that next week's Private Members' time is in the name of the Fianna Fáil Party so the Independents need not worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking after our electorate as the Independents always have done.</P>
      <P>On the Senator's call for a debate on industrial relations, I have agreed to have this debate.  If we cannot make time available for it next week, we will have it the following week.</P>
      <P>On his query about the Shannon River Council Bill, I passed on his request on the Order of Business yesterday to the Minister's office.  I hope to be able to inform the House of the up to date position tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>On the requests of Senator Gallagher and Senator Coghlan for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to attend the House for Statements on the GRA dispute, I will contact the Minister's office after the Order of Business and see how we can facilitate the Senators' requests.</P>
      <P>On Senator McGowan's point about travelling traders, there is an ideal opportunity for the Senator to make his point on the Travellers' Bill when the Minister is in the House today.  I am sure the Chair will bear in mind the senior position which the Senator holds in this House and facilitate him.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris requested a debate on Luas.  I spoke to the Minister yesterday evening.  Following the request here yesterday morning for the report to be published, I am sure the Senators are pleased that they all received copies of it yesterday evening.  I thank the Minister for that.  I asked the Minister to make time available to discuss the matter here this week if possible before the matter goes back to the Cabinet next week.  I will inform the House in the morning of the progress there.</P>
      <P>On Senator Norris's points regarding the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, I am sure the Minister has been following closely what is happening to Ms Michelle Smith.  Ms Smith has brought this country tremendous honour.  Not in our wildest dreams did we ever think we would have an athlete who would win three gold medals and another medal at the Olympic Games.  People throughout the country are in total support of Ms Smith in her efforts to bring further honour to the country.  I concur with the sentiments of Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Mooney's call for a debate on increased funding for Border counties and for the <Col N="362" /> retention by many regions of Objective One status, I have agreed to a debate on this at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm a bheith anseo ar an ócáid seo chun an Bille a chur ós comhair an Tí.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh fáilte ag gach uile daoine roimh na rudaí atá beartaithe ins an mBille.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide a legislative framework within which housing authorities will meet the accommodation needs of travellers.  The Bill will ensure implementation of the Government's commitment, set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium to create a new deal for travellers.  This Bill is a key element of the Government's efforts, on foot of the commitments in that programme and Partnership 2000 to promote social inclusion and equality and to counter discrimination.  It is also central to the full implementation of the National Strategy for Traveller Accommodation, which was adopted by the previous Government in 1996. Indeed, at the outset I acknowledge the significant contribution of my predecessor, Deputy McManus, who chaired the Task Force on the Travelling Community up to her appointment as Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for legislation to ensure more concerted efforts on the part of housing authorities to meeting the accommodation needs of travellers was recognised by the Task Force on the Travelling Community which reported to Government in July 1995.  The task force examined a wide range of issues affecting travellers and made a large number of recommendations. On foot of that report, the then Government adopted a national strategy for traveller accommodation <Col N="363" /> in March 1996.  The strategy provided for the establishment of a traveller accommodation unit within the housing division of my Department, the establishment of a National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group and the introduction of amendments to the housing, planning and development, and local government legislative codes to clarify the responsibilities and powers of housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The need for this Bill is highlighted by the current accommodation position of travellers and an examination of developments in recent years. Local authorities carry out an annual count of traveller families to ascertain the accommodation position in their functional area.  The most recent count, carried out at the end of November 1997, reveals a worrying increase in the number of traveller families on the roadside or in unofficial encampments, from 1,040 at end November 1996 to 1,127 a year later.  This increase has occurred despite the efforts of housing authorities to provide more accommodation.  Over the past few years, capital funding for the provision of group housing and halting sites for travellers has been increased and housing authorities have been given every encouragement by my Department to bring forward suitable traveller accommodation proposals.  The general local authority housing construction programme has also been expanded and maintained at a high level in recent years. Indeed, over the last five years, an additional 849 traveller families have been provided with accommodation with the assistance of housing authorities. Yet, over the same period, the number of traveller families on the roadside or without official accommodation has fallen by only 53, from 1,180 to 1,127 families.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the response of housing authorities to the accommodation needs of travellers has been somewhat uneven.  While some authorities have made significant progress in reducing the backlog of families awaiting accommodation, the number of traveller families on the roadside continues to increase in other areas.  Several factors influence the number of families seeking accommodation in a particular area, including the provision of traveller accommodation, the rate of household formation and changes in migration patterns of travellers, both within Ireland and between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Many housing authorities have encountered strenuous opposition to proposals for traveller accommodation and it appears that this opposition is increasing in some areas.  This Bill will ensure a comprehensive and planned response by housing authorities which will be underpinned by a consultative process.</P>
    <P>This Bill will form part of the housing code and it reflects the approach set out in the main provisions of the Housing Acts from the Principal Act of 1996 onwards.  The Bill takes account, where appropriate, of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  In <Col N="364" /> drawing up the Bill, my Department availed of the advice of the Attorney General, other Departments, local authorities and traveller organisations.  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group, established by my predecessor in December 1996, has also been consulted about the principal provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill will require local authorities, in consultation with travellers, to prepare and adopt by a date to be specified five year programmes to meet the existing and projected accommodation needs of travellers in their areas; allow for public input to the preparation and amendment of such programmes; oblige local authorities to take the appropriate steps to secure implementation of the programmes, establish on a statutory basis a national traveller accommodation consultative committee, require local authorities to set up local accommodation consultative committees on which local authority members, officials and travellers will be represented, amend planning legislation to require planning authorities to include objectives concerning traveller accommodation in their county or city development plans; improve powers for local authorities to deal with unauthorised temporary dwellings where alternative serviced accommodation is available or within one mile of existing accommodation regardless of whether alternative accommodation is available; and apply relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, in respect of the control of antisocial behaviour, to halting sites provided by local authorities or voluntary bodies with the assistance of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill sets out a number of preliminary and general matters, including, in particular, definitions of terms used throughout the Bill.  As the Bill, other than sections 25 and 26, is being construed with the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1997, definitions in those Acts also apply, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill gives an assessment of needs. It sets out the provisions concerning the preparation, adoption and implementation of local traveller accommodation programmes.  Section 5 is the interpretation section for Part II.  It provides that the 29 county councils, five county boroughs, five borough corporations and Bray and Dundalk Urban District Councils are defined as relevant housing authorities for the purposes of this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the five year accommodation programmes are adequate to meet the needs of travellers, it will be necessary to have accurate and reliable information on the needs of each family.  Section 6 amends and extends the existing provisions in relation to the assessment of housing needs under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, to require that the periodic statutory assessment of needs carried out by relevant housing authorities, that is, those authorities obliged to adopt and implement five year accommodation <Col N="365" /> programmes, take account of the specific needs of travellers and in consultation with travellers.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions under the 1988 Act relate to an assessment of housing needs only and do not require assessment of the need for halting sites.  There is provision for directions to be issued by the Minister in relation to the conduct of an assessment and the practice has been to issue directions to extend the assessment of needs to include accommodation on halting sites.  The proposed amendments, therefore, put current practice on a proper statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The amendments also require that regard be had to the need for transient halting sites to facilitate the nomadic lifestyle of travellers on a basis which takes account of the rights and concerns of the whole community.  Another important change in this area is the new requirement to assess the needs to accommodate the future growth in traveller families in respect of a period to be defined by the Minister.  It is likely that this period will be five years, that is, the period of the first programme. The legislation, therefore, is designed not only to eliminate the current backlog in accommodation but also to prevent a reoccurrence of this situation in a few years' time.  Information on the housing needs of travellers held by urban district councils other than Bray and Dundalk Urban District Councils must be supplied to the authority preparing the accommodation programme for that area.  Participation and consultation with travellers on the assessment of their accommodation needs is assured as a result of the requirement to notify the local traveller accommodation consultative committee and to have regard to their views.</P>
    <P>The information and needs upon which the first five year programme is to be based is provided for at section 10 of this Bill.  Because of the time lapse between the periodic statutory assessments, the section enables the Minister to give directions on how the information from a previous assessment is to be used or updated before a draft of the five year programme is prepared.  The last assessment of needs was carried out in March 1996 and the next assessment is due in March 1999.  As much of the preliminary work in preparing programmes will be carried out in advance of the next triannual assessment, housing authorities will have to update the 1996 assessment, for example, by using information obtained in connection with the returns submitted to my Department in relation to the accommodation situation generally of travellers.</P>
    <P>The next significant step in the process is the preparation of a draft of a local five year programme by each relevant housing authority.  The requirement to adopt and implement five year programmes represents a significant change from the existing discretionary powers.  This change reflects the gravity with which the Government views the current situation.  With 1,127 families on the roadside and an estimated further 300 families in temporary accommodation seeking permanent accommodation, it is clear that reliance <Col N="366" /> on discretionary powers, given the difficulties in providing accommodation, cannot be expected to deliver sufficient progress.  Moreover, these figures do not take account of the number of years that many families have been in these situations seeking to have living conditions improved to an acceptable standard or the likely increase in the number of households in the years ahead.  The need for local programmes was identified by the Task Force on the Travelling Community and supported by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 14 of the Bill set out in detail the various procedures to be followed before a programme is adopted.  The procedures provided for are designed to ensure that the process is comprehensive, co-ordinated, integrated and transparent and is carried out by each relevant housing authority at the same time and in respect of the same period.</P>
    <P>Section 7 requires that a five year programme be adopted by resolution of the members by a date to be specified by the Minister.  The date to be specified will have to allow sufficient time for the statutory procedures and requirements to be complied with.  Should members of an authority fail to exercise their duty within the specified period, allowing for the adjournment of any meeting up to a maximum of 21 days as provided for in section 13, the manager will be required to step in and ensure adoption within a further month. At this stage I estimate that in order to allow significant time for each step a minimum period of 12 months would be required to complete the process.  Housing authorities are being given the flexibility to combine with one or more authorities to adopt joint programmes.  I envisage that this option may facilitate improved co-ordination between neighbouring authorities.  The same statutory procedures will apply to preparation and adoption of joint programmes.</P>
    <P>It is critical to the success of the proposed legislation that every housing authority concerned address the same issues at the same time and in respect of the same period.  Power to ensure that this happens is provided for in section 10.  Section 7 already provides for the completion of the drafting process by a date to be specified.  I also intend under the power which will be available to me to specify the dates in respect of the period for which the first five year programme is to be drawn up.  Section l0 also sets out the matters which must be included in a programme &mdash; for example, information on the accommodation needs of travellers, a statement of the policy of the relevant housing authority in relation to how it proposes to meet these needs and a strategy for implementing the programme.  These provisions are necessary in the interests of ensuring an adequate response to the statutory requirements under the Bill and of consistency and clarity of approach.  There is provision for further directions to be issued by the Minister on matters of detail relating to the form and content of five year programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> There is a strong commitment throughout the Bill to consultation with the various interests concerned. The format of programmes set out in section 10 is intended to facilitate meaningful consultation with travellers and the general public and subsequent evaluation of the adequacy and implementation of programmes.</P>
    <P>Prior notice of the preparation of an accommodation programme must be given under section 8 to a range of public authorities and the local traveller consultative committee to enable them to have an input to the preparation process.  There is also a flexibility for other bodies, as the housing authority consider appropriate, to be given prior notice.  These provisions take account of the long established working arrangements developed between the various bodies concerned.  Inclusion of a body at this stage in the process is significant as other consultative procedures, to which I will refer later, automatically apply to such bodies.</P>
    <P>Another important phase in the consultative process is the making available of a draft of the accommodation programme for inspection by the public.  A period of two months from the date of the publication of a newspaper notice of such availability is allowed for the making of written submissions and for having those submissions taken into account.  Bodies which received prior notice of the preparation of a draft programme under the previous section must also be given a copy of the newspaper notice and a copy of the draft programme.  Under section 10(4) it is clear that the housing authority has power to amend the draft of an accommodation programme having considered any valid submissions received. The manager is obliged to report to the elected members on the results of this consultation including the revisions, if any, made to the draft or other proposed actions.</P>
    <P>It is the intention under the Bill that all housing authorities concerned will have adopted their programmes by the specified date.  Adoption is a reserved function of the authority &mdash; it requires a resolution of the members.  Sections 11 to 14 contain further important details relating to the adoption of programmes.  The manager must submit the draft programme and the report on submissions received under the consultative process in sufficient time &mdash; not later than two months from the specified date &mdash; to enable the members to give due consideration to its contents.  It is recognised that there may be practical reasons why it would not be possible to complete consideration of the draft within two months.  In such circumstances the meeting at which the motion for adoption is being considered may be adjourned for a further period of up to 21 days. Members are being afforded every opportunity to exercise their statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Should the members fail to adopt a programme by the specified date, the county or city manager is then obliged to adopt a programme within a further period of one month.  In doing so the manager may make such amendments to the draft he <Col N="368" /> considers appropriate.  For instance, this would allow a manger to take account of the debate in the council chamber over an issue which members were unable to resolve.  These are strong measures but the House will agree that the situation on the ground, as shown in the recently published returns from housing authorities, merits such action.  There is no room in the strategy being pursued for housing authorities which shirk their responsibilities under the proposed Bill. Section 15 seeks to ensure that, once adopted, copies of the programme are circulated to specified bodies and are widely available for inspection or purchase by the public.</P>
    <P>Once adopted, an accommodation programme must be implemented.  Section 16 places an obligation on the adopting authority to take any reasonable steps necessary to secure the implementation of a programme.  It also requires other housing authorities to take such steps as are necessary for the implementation of proposals set out in an accommodation programme in respect of their functional area.  The obligations under this section extend to housing authorities within the area covered by the programme to have regard to the provisions of the programme when exercising any of their functions in relation to traveller accommodation.  A programme, or parts of a programme, may involve partnership arrangements and fall to be implemented by many other bodies and individuals &mdash; for example, other public authorities, approved voluntary housing bodies and travellers themselves. The adopting authority has overall responsibility to secure implementation of an adopted programme in accordance with the strategies and policies set out in the programme.  Such strategies may involve the provision of financial or other assistance to voluntary housing bodies to directly provide accommodation or grants to individual traveller families to assist with the acquisition of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Local accommodation programmes must be reviewed at least once in every three years.  Of course a local authority may carry out a review at any time they consider it necessary.  There is also provision under section 17 for the Minister to require more frequent reviews.  The housing authority has the power to amend a programme or replace the programme following such a review. The making of an amendment to a programme or the replacement of a programme is subject to the same consultative and other procedures as applied to the adoption of the original programme. The requirements in relation to the review of programmes are most important in terms of ensuring that a programme is dynamic and takes account of the demographic changes in the traveller population.  The formal review provisions are also an essential tool in monitoring progress in implementing the five year programmes and adjusting accommodation proposals accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is proposed under section 18 that a power be reserved for the Minister to require that programmes <Col N="369" /> be prepared or co-ordinated jointly by two or more housing authorities and that programmes be amended in such manner and by such date.  I see this latter power as a safeguard to be used only in exceptional circumstances.  To do otherwise would be contrary to the general thrust of local government reform in recent years and the principle of subsidiarity which is based on the making of decisions at the lowest practicable level.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 22 are further evidence of the commitment to consultation between the persons most directly concerned and the relevant public authorities.  New mechanisms are proposed at national and local level to ensure ongoing consultation with travellers in relation to accommodation issues.  The proposed National Traveller Accommodation Committee is the statutory replacement for the existing consultative group established by my predecessor, but with an expanded membership.  The Minister may seek the advice of the committee on any general matter relating to the accommodation of travellers. The committee will also have the discretion to advise the Minister on any such issue on its own initiative.  I consider it essential that the remit of the proposed committee is confined to issues of a general nature.  Detailed issues &mdash; those relating to specific proposals for accommodation or the needs of individual families &mdash; are more appropriate for consideration by the proposed local traveller consultative committees.  This qualification on the matters which can be considered at national level has worked well and I have no reason to change this.</P>
    <P>To date the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group has been very active and has had a valuable input to revised Guidelines on Residential Parks for Travellers which were issued in October 1997.  Further guidelines, in a series designed to raise the standards of accommodation provided, are being prepared in consultation with the group.  I recently received a copy of the group's annual report for 1997 which also sets out its comprehensive work programme for 1998.  I value greatly the work which the group is doing and I have already taken steps to expand the membership in advance of the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 requires each county council and county borough corporation to establish a local traveller accommodation consultative committee to advise on traveller accommodation.  The remit of these committees extends to any housing authority which is within the administrative county, or to an adjoining authority at that authority's request.  Advice may be provided in relation to any aspect of the accommodation issue, including details of individual needs and specific proposals for accommodation.  The local committees must be consulted or notified in respect of certain specified matters such as the making of an assessment of needs, the preparation of a draft accommodation programme, and be supplied with a <Col N="370" /> copy of the newspaper notice and draft accommodation programme.</P>
    <P>I expect that local committees will play an important consultative role in identifying the accommodation needs of individual families, the design of accommodation to meet these needs and the development of partnership arrangements to manage and maintain accommodation once it has been provided.  The committees' role in relation to monitoring the implementation of programmes will be another valuable tool in ensuring that implementation is kept high on the local political agenda.  The composition and balance of representation of the local committees is strictly defined.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the local traveller accommodation consultative committees shall comprise representatives of the members and officials for the appointing authority and representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies. The section also provides that elected representatives will not exceed one half of the membership, while traveller representatives must make up at least one quarter of the membership. The proposed parameters for the representation of each group are intended to ensure a balance of representation and reflect experience of a number of different approaches followed by some local authorities in recent years.</P>
    <P>In preparing this section I also gave careful consideration to the inclusion of representatives of other groups and authorities on the consultative committee.  I am satisfied that the composition proposed is appropriate, having regard to the role of the committees in improving the participation of travellers in the planning, design and management of their accommodation and in order to foster improved understanding between local authorities and the local travelling community.</P>
    <P>In so deciding I took into account the other channels which are available to local communities to express their views on local developments, including the opportunity to have an input to the draft of an accommodation programme and the recently announced decision to end the exemption of halting sites from the public notice procedures of Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, which apply to local authority developments in their functional areas.  I was also conscious of the proposals under the local government reform programme for the establishment by local authorities of strategic policy committees covering the major functions, including housing.  These will provide a further opportunity to consult community groups about housing issues, including traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>A wide range of services are provided to travellers at local level and it is a matter for the authorities concerned as to what arrangements may be appropriate to ensure co-ordination of those services.  Some local authorities are participating in local co-ordinating arrangements but it is not necessary to provide for this specifically in the <Col N="371" /> Bill.  Section 23 is a saver provision which is needed to ensure that existing proposals for the development of accommodation are not held up pending the completion of the statutory procedures involved in the adoption of five year accommodation programmes.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill sets out some miscellaneous but important provisions, including provision to strengthen the powers of housing authorities to control unauthorised temporary dwellings and to deal with serious anti-social behaviour on halting sites.  Certain amendments to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and the Local Government Acts are also included in this Part.  Section 24 is a saver provision in respect of a county or city manager's existing powers under the City and County Management (Amendment) Acts to take action in emergency situations, including works which are reasonable and necessary to provide a reasonable standard of accommodation for any person.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 provide for the inclusion in county and city development plans of appropriate objectives for the provision of accommodation for travellers and the use of particular areas for that purpose.  The need for inclusion of appropriate objectives emerged as a result of a number of court proceedings which stopped particular developments for traveller accommodation on the grounds that the development was contrary to the development plan.  The need for any change to existing development plans and the particular wording to be included will be a matter for each planning authority.  While appropriate guidelines and advice will issue to authorities on the matter, it is essential that such objectives, as a minimum, allow for implementation of the adopted five year accommodation programme.</P>
    <P>Any variation to an existing plan will be subject to the same statutory requirements which apply to normal variations.  A planning authority is allowed the flexibility under section 26 to delay the making of the necessary changes until the next variation in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort by scarce resources.  Section 26 also contains a transitional provision to ensure that any development under an adopted five year programme is not held up pending the processing of the necessary variation to the development plan.</P>
    <P>I wish to see the voluntary sector playing a greater role in the provision of purpose built accommodation for travellers.  That sector already has a track record in the provision of standard housing and the allocation of such units to travellers.  There is scope for becoming involved in other types of accommodation as the assistance to approved voluntary bodies under the capital assistance scheme is also available at the maximum rates in respect of halting sites.  To date, however, no proposal for such a site has been developed.  I will continue to encourage voluntary bodies to become involved in this area. The technical amendment to the Housing <Col N="372" /> (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, proposed under section 27 is intended to ensure that there is adequate statutory backing for such assistance.</P>
    <P>The powers of local authorities to provide, improve, manage and control sites for caravans are contained in section 13 of the Housing Act, 1988.  Various aspects of these powers have been raised in the courts in recent years and, as a result, further clarification of the provisions in that section is required.  Section 28 therefore provides for a revised provision under which it will be clear that a housing authority has power to provide sites with different levels of services related to the intended use, including transient halting sites, and both permanent sites and temporary sites pending the provision of permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>A definition of the term &ldquo;site with limited facilities&rdquo; has been inserted in the section to make a clear distinction between temporary or short stay sites and permanent sites.  A new provision is also being inserted which will enable the Minister to issue guidelines on the level of services and facilities to be provided.  The intention of the new provision is to ensure that accommodation of a standard appropriate to a given situation is provided.  While housing authorities will be obliged to have regard to any such guidelines issued in developing their proposals, it is not the intention that they will be applied rigidly or be seen as the only solution.  Situations will vary locally and account will be taken of this by the Department when considering applications for funding of specific proposals.</P>
    <P>Revised guidelines on permanent residential caravan parks were prepared in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group and were issued last October. Further guidelines in the series are being prepared in consultation with the group.  Due to the number of proposals for accornmodation to be developed in the coming years under local programmes, it is my intention to have the further guidelines issued as soon as possible pending the enactment of the legislation.  When the Bill is enacted I envisage that the guidelines will be reissued with the formal backing of the legislation. The extent of compliance with any guidelines issued is already a criterion applied by my Department when considering applications from housing authorities for capital funding for developments.</P>
    <P>The objective of the proposed Bill is the acceleration of the rate at which accommodation is provided.  It is important, therefore, that progress is made and is seen to be made in the implementation of local five year programmes.  Section 30 provides for a mechanism which will facilitate regular reporting on the progress made as well as the activities of the local traveller accommodation consultative committee.  The Department will also continue to seek returns from the housing authorities on the general accommodation situation of traveller families, perhaps with some <Col N="373" /> adjustments to reflect the new structures and framework.</P>
    <P>Increased powers are proposed for housing authorities under sections 31 to 34 of the Bill.  The proposed powers are in relation to two problem areas identified by the task force as requiring attention, that is, unauthorised encampments, particularly in close proximity to existing traveller specific accommodation, and anti-social behaviour on sites.  Unauthorised encampments continue to be a source of concern and complaints from the public.  I recognise and accept that the problem of unauthorised encampments is largely related to the lack of availability of suitable permanent accommodation.  The efforts of local authorities and others concerned must be concentrated on meeting the need for permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>However, there are and will continue to be situations where local authorities cannot tolerate such encampments on health, safety and environmental grounds.  Effective powers to deal with such situations must be available to the authorities. The advice of the Attorney General was sought on the scope for amending the law in this regard and the proposals contained in section 31 of the Bill reflect the advice received.  The improvements proposed in section 31 introduce a greater degree of flexibility in operating the existing controls which are set out in section 1 0 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>As a result of the amendments to the l992 Act, housing authorities will be able to take action in the following three situations: where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within five miles of a serviced site provided by any housing authority or voluntary body and if the site has been provided by a voluntary body or is outside the functional area of the authority seeking to move the dwelling, the agreement of the body or authority must be obtained; where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is in poor condition or interferes with amenities or is or is likely to be a risk to personal or public health or safety, the alternative accommodation may be on any serviced site within or without the functional area of the housing authority and where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within one mile of any traveller accommodation provided by the housing authority or approved voluntary body.</P>
    <P>No change is proposed in respect of the action to be taken, that is, a notice is served to remove the temporary dwelling followed by the towing away of the dwelling if no response to the notice is received within a specified period.  Powers of local authorities under the Planning Acts regarding unauthorised development and under the Roads Acts in connection with safety aspects and other controls under environmental and public health legislation will remain.</P>
    <P>Proper management of residential caravan parks and halting sites is necessary in the interests of the quality of life of the residents on site and in the immediate vicinity.  A number of important initiatives have already been taken to promote <Col N="374" /> the use of best practice in estate management in local authority housing schemes, including the recent establishment of housing under the auspices of the Institute of Public Administration to encourage further training and research in this area.  A scheme of financial assistance to housing authorities in respect of the management and maintenance costs for traveller specific accommodation has been introduced.  Under this scheme, the development of partnership arrangements between local authorities and travellers for the arrangement of their accommodation is encouraged.</P>
    <P>These proactive initiatives need to be underpinned by adequate statutory support in respect of problems which may arise on sites.  Therefore, I propose to extend relevant powers to housing authorities or approved voluntary bodies, under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, in respect of anti-social behaviour on housing estates or halting sites.</P>
    <P>I have set out in detail the provisions of the Bill and the background to it.  The Bill represents a comprehensive and balanced response by the Government to the difficulties we have experienced over a long period in seeking to meet the accommodation needs of travellers.  It provides housing authorities with a clear legal framework for addressing those needs, clarifies their obligations, strengthens their power as housing authorities and provides for consultations with travellers and the general public.  In addition to changes in the local government planning and development regulations, the Bill ensures that planning, design and management of traveller accommodation proposals will be the subject of extensive consultation.  This is essential if we are to address concerns on the part of travellers and the settled community and if we are to overcome the long delays experienced by housing authorities in seeking to provide accommodation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to strong support for the Bill and the objectives it seeks to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House, he is becoming a constant visitor. I thank him for his comprehensive contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with one of the most controversial issues in Irish society, namely, addressing the needs of travellers.  With more than 1,100 traveller families living by the roadside, local authorities will be required to prepare and adopt a five year programme to meet travellers' housing needs.  In drawing up this programme, housing authorities will be obliged to assess the needs of travellers.  They will also be required to assess the need for sites for caravans and, in doing so, have regard to the estimated growth in the need for accommodation in each local authority area for the duration of the five year programme.  In carrying out this assessment, the housing authorities must give notice to the local travellers' accommodation consultative committee, established <Col N="375" /> under section 21 of the Bill, to ascertain its views.</P>
    <P>When a draft of a five year programme has been prepared, the Bill also requires that a public consultation process take place.  It will be the responsibility of local authorities to place notices in newspapers stating the time and place when the draft document can be inspected and the public will have two months in which to make submissions. As the Minister of State indicated, the adoption of the five year programme is a reserved function but if the elected members fail to adopt the plan within a specified time it then becomes a management function.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of general comments in respect of the housing of travellers.  The 1996 census discovered that there were just under 11,000 travellers living in 4,300 households.  It also found that 50 per cent of traveller families lived in local authority or group housing schemes and the other 50 per cent lived in serviced roadside halting sites or on unserviced sites or encampments.</P>
    <P>The largest number of travellers in the State live in Dublin local authorities areas.  Approximately 1,000 travellers live in my local authority, the Dublin City Council, area.  A recent count of traveller families in the city indicated the following: there were 25 families in standard local authority housing, 110 families were accommodated in group housing schemes, 140 families occupied official halting sites, 13 families were living in the backyards of houses in group housing schemes, 50 families were parked illegally on official sites and 18 families were situated on roadside or unofficial sites.  The total travelling community in Dublin amounts to 357 families, of which 288 families live in official accommodation.  A further 69 families are waiting to be housed.  Of the families to which I referred, 110 are housed in group schemes at Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Finglas, Dunsink Lane, Malahide Road and Coolock. There are 118 bays on official halting sites and caravan parks at Dunsink, Belcamp Lane, Ballymun, Inchicore, Clondalkin, Grand Canal Harbour and Pigeon House Road, Ringsend, which provide accommodation for 232 caravans.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is becoming more difficult to obtain suitable accommodation for travellers in the Dublin area because of the lack of open space and the almost total objection on the part of the settled community to traveller settlement.  I note from the Bill that the Minister of State intends to establish a national consultative committee.  If it is to have a real impact, this committee must play its part in helping to educate the public in respect of the needs of the traveller community.</P>
    <P>Despite their name and popular assumptions about their lifestyle, travellers appear to travel a great deal less than we originally thought.  In the 1996 census, nine out of ten travellers said they had lived in the same place a year earlier and a further six out of ten indicated they lived in the county in which they were born.  This compares <Col N="376" /> to eight out of ten of the general population.  One of the most striking features of the survey is the young age of travellers compared with the general population.  On the day the census was taken, 50 per cent of all travellers were under 15 years of age.  This compares with a figure of 25 per cent in respect of the general population.  Travellers also marry at a younger age and almost 33 per cent of males and 39 per cent of females had married by the age of 24.  Among the general population, only 1 per cent of males and 3 per cent of females had married by that age.  Travellers also tend to have larger families than their counterparts in the settled community.  The number of children per traveller family is currently 6.5 as against 2.5 per family in the settled community.</P>
    <P>Even before the publication of this Bill, Dublin Corporation had plans to build accommodation for travellers over the next two years.  Recently, the city council approved the construction of 19 houses at Carra Park.  As stated earlier, one of the major problems facing Dublin Corporation is the lack of open space.  Major religious orders with substantial land holdings in the city should make some of that property available for traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>In meeting its two year programme to accommodate travellers, particularly the 69 families on the waiting list, my local authority has, as already stated, approved the construction of 19 houses at Carra Park and intends to provide 11 additional houses at Avila Park and 12 at Belcamp Lane.  It is also investigating the possibility of providing housing in two other areas.  My local authority will have little difficulty in complying with the provisions of the Bill because it is currently working on a two year programme which can easily be extended to five years .</P>
    <P>I wish to make passing reference to an issue which is strictly not covered by the Bill but, nevertheless, arises because of the poor and unsafe living conditions which travellers have experienced for many years.  I refer to the health problems encountered by the travelling community. Studies in recent years indicate that the life expectancy and the general health of the travelling community compares very unfavourably to that of the settled community.  Poor sanitation and poor and unsafe living conditions are a major contributory factor.  It is hard to believe that just two out every 100 travellers live to the age of 65 years.  The travelling community's infant mortality rate is nearly three times the national average, it has twice the national rate of stillbirths and it is only now reaching the life expectancy level which the settled community reached in the early 1940s.</P>
    <P>Various studies have documented the poor health status of the travelling community.  Other significant problems include low rates of immunisation, insufficient participation in ante natal and child development clinics and low birth weight babies.  With regard to notifiable diseases, such as gastro-enteritis, travellers represent a much higher percentage of notifications than <Col N="377" /> would be expected on the basis of their numbers in the population.  Unsatisfactory living conditions, including overcrowding, lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitary conditions, leave the travelling community vulnerable to infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>If we are to eliminate the health problems of the travelling community we must be prepared to improve their living conditions.  The Bill goes some way in endeavouring to achieve this objective, but its success can only be determined by the goodwill of the settled community.  When consulted the public will indicate that it is in favour of settling the travelling community but the &lsquo;not in my back yard&rsquo; syndrome will arise.  As public representatives we must address this issue courageously. If the measures outlined in the Bill are to be successful they must be adopted by courageous politicians at local level.  The travelling community has the same right to share the economic wealth the country enjoys at present and the first objective in that regard must be to provide proper housing.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire.  Molaim é as ucht an iarracht atá á dhéanamh aige chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ar son comhríocht and lucht siúil.  I welcome the sentiments behind the Bill.  Anyone familiar with the travellers' lifestyle will agree that the conditions in which they live need to addressed and improved.  As a consequence of the conditions in which many travellers live their health is affected and their life expectancy is well below that of the settled community.  This year we celebrate the bicentenary of 1798 when the leaders of the rebellion espoused the principles of the French revolution, liberty, equality and fraternity. It is appropriate, therefore, that we seek to ensure that this disadvantaged community gets equal rights and opportunities.  It is also important that we have equality before the law and some of the difficulties experienced on the traveller issue relate to a perception that this does not apply.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with accommodation.  However, the solution to this problem will not be found in accommodation alone.  In the past the issue was examined on a statistical rather than on a comprehensive basis.  The settlement of travellers is important.  Severe difficulties have arisen in the past with some local authorities attempts to do this, but we must make provision for the satisfactory integration of travellers into the settled community. Our success in this area should be gauged by that criterion rather than on a purely statistical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be proper and adequate education for traveller children so that they will have better life opportunities than their parents.  In many areas efforts are being made in this regard.  There are a number of resource centres in my constituency which play a useful role in providing training and education to equip travellers to participate fully in the settled lifestyle.  It will also be the key <Col N="378" /> to employment which will be essential to changing their lifestyle.</P>
    <P>We have based our economic development over the last decade on partnership.  Those of us who are involved in local authorities and who have grappled with the traveller issue for many years will be aware that without a partnership approach we are doomed to failure.  I welcome the provision in the Bill for a consultative process and the Minister of State's emphasis on the consultative approach.  From his ministerial and local authority experience he has wide knowledge and familiarity with what is required.  It is only a consensus approach which will yield the results we seek.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many processes for consultation. As Tip O'Neill said, all politics is local, and the solution to traveller accommodation will not be found in the Custom House.  Rather it is to be found at local level in the different local authority districts.  They will have to come up with plans and programmes and seek widespread public support for that.  Such public support can be garnered but it must be sought in an organised fashion.  In my local area there have been successful public meetings on problems which have arisen because of halting sites where travellers and the settled community had a chance to air and exchange views.  This process has assisted in generating a greater recognition on both sides of the difficulties experienced.  More importantly, it has created a coming together of the groups.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for accommodation programmes to be drawn up and information on travellers' accommodation needs to be obtained from various sources.  One aspect which in the past has given rise to some public cynicism has been the non-discriminatory allocation of local authority accommodation.  In the past I have championed the cause of travellers who were badly in need of accommodation on the basis of their living conditions. However, as soon as it was accommodated the family involved was in a position to buy two or three other houses which became available. The family did not qualify because it had the means to provide its own accommodation.</P>
    <P>We had another such instance and, although these are exceptions, it is important to recognise them.  There should be some sort of built in mechanism within the assessment of the need for local authority housing and the provision of housing sites, which are equally costly, so that they go to those who are in the greatest need and who do not have the capability to provide accommodation from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Another example concerned a tenant of ours who was involved in a court case and, according to an affidavit, had £250,000 worth of horses.  We do not normally provide houses for people in that category.  There is a need to be much more diligent in the way we approach the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a moment on the simplistic approach that emerges sometimes in dealing with the problem.  A few years ago I recall having a debate with the then Minister of State, <Col N="379" /> Deputy Stagg, about the need for traveller accommodation and plans to deal with it.  When we pointed out that an integral part of the solution was the provision of social workers to ensure proper settlement and integration of those families for whom we were providing accommodation, we received a fairly negative response, much to our disappointment.</P>
    <P>We have many travellers in County Wexford some of whom live in halting sites while others live in unofficial halting sites beside houses.  A high proportion of travellers live in private housing and that is a welcome development.  Others live in local authority housing.  We have two social workers for the county.  Everyone, including the officials, has campaigned over a long period of time for proper resources to be made available from the Department to have sufficient social workers to assist the process of integration. This is why I am critical of the traditional approach that is being taken, which is to get travellers housed so that the statistics will improve and our responsibilities appear to have been met. I do not believe for a minute, however, that is the case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision in the Bill for consultation, particularly for the report to come before the council, the Minister should re-examine sections 11 and 12 whereby a manager must bring a report before the authority at least two months before the date by which the draft must be adopted.  In my experience, given the work load that many local authorities have, that is an inadequate period of time in which to consider and consult with people and reach conclusions. There is a danger in this that if we try to impose a solution we will have opposition, perhaps from councillors but more importantly from the public at large.  In the past that has been the stumbling block to greater success in providing more accommodation.</P>
    <P>If we do not recognise that in the mechanisms we are putting in place, we will repeat the mistakes of the past.  I would like to see a six month period instead of two months.  I take the point that local authorities must address the issue and cannot have an open ended brief so that they continue talking about the matter for years.  That is different, however, than providing insufficient time.  Elected members have the responsibility to act and have a mandate from the public.  The are the only ones that are accountable &mdash; the manager is not accountable &mdash; so they must have sufficient time to fully debate and explore the various solutions.</P>
    <P>I have tremendous reservations with regard to giving a county manager any powers to overrule the council.  I can see the reason it is included in the Bill but it is undemocratic.  I would not have a difficulty if the proposed directly elected chairman of local authorities was given that power because he will be accountable to the people.</P>
    <P>My experience of county managers all over the country is that they are no different from anyone <Col N="380" /> else.  Everyone wants to see the problem solved but nobody wants it solved next door to themselves. The existing provision will ensure that in future no halting site will be located near a county manager's house.  That provision should be re-examined. Although I understand the difficulty involved, we could see if it can be improved by giving the power of decision to a directly elected chairman who would be obliged to make a decision.</P>
    <P>The consultative approach to be taken with travellers themselves runs through the Bill.  That is important.  One must have the views, opinions and support of travellers in any programme we introduce.  I have no difficulty in fully accepting that but we must not overlook the settled community nor fail to involve them.</P>
    <P>The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group and local groups must be involved.  We should have concerned people from the settled community, who will have the interests of travellers and the settled community at heart and who are conversant with the problems that have traditionally arisen between them.  It is much better to confront those difficulties at the early stages of consultation than trying to deal with them when problems subsequently arise.  If we can anticipate the problems we can make provision to avoid them.  Prevention is better than cure and that is the philosophy I suggest.</P>
    <P>When we were putting a halting site in my own area we consulted with the travellers.  There were strong local objections to one area.  We subsequently selected another area to which the travellers objected.  However, after some consultation we decided to proceed and the halting site has been filled almost from the time it was built. Councillors must have the courage of their convictions in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is a group called Meas, which means respect.  Perhaps because of how the group came about, some officials in my own county do not have the same level of rapport with it as we would like to see.  That body emerged because of problems we have in County Wexford and it now comprises a membership in different areas around the country including Dublin and Mayo.  The group's representatives have attended many local authority meetings.  While I would not agree with all their policies, many of them are laudable and provide a way forward to deal with the issues.  Without public support we cannot hope to succeed with this problem.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 29 imply that needs may well determine the size of halting sites.  I have observed halting sites in various locations and officials in my own county have now come round to thinking that the smaller a site is, the better. The optimum size is a six bay halting site.  It is up to the local authority to make that decision but such sites should be spread evenly throughout a county.  If they are concentrated in one area it will create concerted local opposition.  It will also sow the seeds that prevent integration with the local <Col N="381" /> community which should be one of the main aspirations and objectives of a Bill like this.</P>
    <P>In some instances the removal of caravans from unauthorised sites is a very contentious and difficult issue.  The law in this regard seems to be inadequate.  Generally the Judiciary tend not to provide the mechanism for moving people on from sites unless another location is available.  Much of what is in the Bill seems to be discretionary with the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, which is a more mandatory term.  I wonder will that achieve what we would like it to achieve.  I also note that temporary dwellings in poor condition can be moved.  Why the qualification of dwellings in poor condition?  Often those in the poor traveller accommodation are the ones most in need with less resources to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister well in his objective.  This is a most important Bill and I would like to have had a debate on the issue in advance of the Bill being introduced in the House.  Nonetheless, the Bill is before us and I hope certain aspects of it, particularly the settled community issue, will be included.  I believe this would be constructive and useful and do much to avoid some of the controversies of the past.  I ask that a comprehensive and consistent effort be pursued because I believe that success will depend on an absolutely common sense approach being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us this morning has been in gestation for some time.  I join with the Minister in paying tribute to his predecessor, Deputy McManus, former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, who pioneered the work to put this Bill together and worked as chairperson of the task force in that regard.  I also compliment the Minister for seeing the work through to completion.  I know when there is an election things get postponed but I do not think he has lost any time in making sure the work is completed and brought before this House for consideration.  At the outset, I would like to mention former Minister Mervyn Taylor who established the task force in 1993 which recommended in its report of 1995 the setting up of a national traveller accommodation strategy.  The legislation before us today will give effect to the recommendations and commitments made in that strategy. I would also like to mention former Senator Mary Kelly, a county councillor in West Limerick, who is doing a lot work in this area as a member of her local authority and took over the chairing of the task force following Deputy McManus's elevation to ministerial office.</P>
      <P>I have a great interest in this subject.  It may not be the best subject for attracting votes, particularly as a member of a local authority, but while still in school I was involved at local level in an after school programme for travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Offaly has the highest proportion of travellers per 1,000 of population in the country &mdash; eight per 1,000.  After Rathkeale, Tullamore <Col N="382" /> has the second highest proportion of travellers &mdash; 3 per cent of the population.  So I speak with some authority and with some experience of an extensive range of provisions in a local area for travellers. This reflects the point made by the Minister that despite all these provisions the problem seems to be growing.  This is the experience in my area where there are a range of services from a special training centre, in-school and out-of-school provisions to homework clubs, pre-schools and special efforts in the area being made by the council and the health board.</P>
    <P>Despite this the accommodation problem seems to be growing.  The Minister will notice when travelling from his constituency by train that as he enters the town of Tullamore from the western side there is an official halting site and two large unofficial halting sites beside it.  I am bringing my interest and experience in this issue at local level to bear on the proposals.  I want to mention the officials in the traveller accommodation unit of the Department who have done an excellent job in bringing this legislation before us today.  I support the thrust of the legislation but I have a number of queries and suggestions to make to the Minister in the hope that he might reply at the end of this debate or during the later Stages.</P>
    <P>The need for accommodation has been outlined by the Minister.  The census figures show that this is an area where the good record of this country in many areas of social provision is blotted to the extend that the figures regarding travellers' accommodation, education and health needs reflect more the status of one of the worst third world countries rather than a country which was recently ranked eleventh worldwide by a Swiss organisation in terms of economic performance. Now is the time to make a determined effort to solve this problem because the resources are available.  The numbers involved are not inordinate. Listening to people talk about travellers and immigrants, one would think the country was overrun with these people, but we are talking about a manageable problem.  This legislation provides the framework within which the problem can be managed.</P>
    <P>I would like elaboration from the Minister on the thinking regarding the exclusion for this purpose of urban district councils other than Bray and Dundalk.  Are these urban district councils precluded from drawing up their own plans or what arrangements will be made for councillors and residents in urban districts to have an input into countywide plans?  I have heard this matter discussed in various areas from two angles.  Some say the fact that the duty will now be on the county councillors to adopt the plan will take the burden off the urban councillors . Others say that while the duty may be on the county councillors, they will recommend that all the sites be provided in urban districts.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the procedures outlined for the adoption of the programme, this is a function <Col N="383" /> which is reserved for members; but if they fail to do so by a specified date the manager will, within one month of that date, adopt the plan.  It would be highly desirable that the plan be adopted by the elected members.  I appreciate there may be some circumstances where this will not happen, but if power is to be given to the manager to adopt the plan in the absence of consent or agreement by the elected members we must be very careful how we proceed.  The one month time limit is possibly too short.  That applies from one council meeting to the next and those of us who are members of urban or county authorities know that time passes very quickly.  Given the range and extent of matters dealt with by local authorities, this does not give much time to the manager or councillors to reconsider the position.  I suggest the time limit be extended and that if within that period the manager is allowed make alterations to the proposed plan, there be some form of further consultation in that period.</P>
    <P>I do not have any specific recommendations to make yet but it might be useful to look at an appeals procedure in the event of dissatisfaction as regards the adequacy of the plan to deal with the needs in the area, particularly if it has been adopted as an executive rather than a reserved function.  Some form of consultation should be included if amendments are to be made by the manager alone.  An appeals procedure might reduce the danger of matters being taken to court.  Despite the efforts in this legislation to clear up many of the legal ambiguities which have arisen through different court decisions, there will be court challenges and these should be prevented if possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the procedures for public consultation in drawing up the traveller accommodation programme.  The identification of sites is never an easy task.  Too often halting sites have been put in undesirable locations, for example, beside a former sewerage works in the town in which I live, or near dumps and other dangerous facilities. Often halting sites are located next to council housing estates in order to keep them out of areas where people have more social and political influence. This should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Every area in a county or urban district should play its part in helping to meet the need for halting sites.  The most undesirable sites or those which will provoke least resistance from people who, for economic or social reasons do not wield the power which others can call on, are chosen. This situation should be reversed.  In last week's discussion on planning I said that objections in my area tend to come from places where people are affluent enough to employ consultants to object on their behalf.  I do not want to see that happening here.  A great deal of effort must be put into site selection.</P>
    <P>As regards the adoption of a countywide plan, Offaly County Council, during the tenure of the last county manager, Mr. McCarthy, tried to <Col N="384" /> adopt a countywide approach in 1992-3, involving co-operation with the urban authorities.  It had limited success but fell down in its implementation. The Department has learned from that as can be seen in the proposals put forward today. The procedures for the implementation of the programme are as important as the procedures for its adoption.</P>
    <P>The consultative committees will play an important role at local and national level.  I welcome that the national committee has been put on a statutory footing.  Efforts have been made to do this at local level but they have not worked to date.  The fact that they are provided for in law is no guarantee that they will work.  A great deal of work and resources need to be put into the setting up and operation of these committees.  They cannot be seen as adjuncts to the council and the traveller organisation representatives must have a meaningful role.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the views of the Minister and the Department on how people will be selected and trained.  Councillors are discussing the need for training in councils under strategic policy committees.  Equally, if not more so, members of these consultative committees, particularly at local level, will need resources and back-up facilities to do their job properly.  Guidelines need to be issued to councils as regards selection procedures and resources must be provided to meet the needs of the members of those committees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to lift the exemption for halting sites from the provisions of Part X of the 1994 planning regulations.  Many people do not agree with the lifting of this exemption.  I understand why the exemption was introduced. However, as in the exemption of certain provisions for mobile telephone communications, which was discussed here yesterday, exemptions lead to more problems.</P>
    <P>There was a long battle to have public developments included in the planning process.  This culminated in the row about the visitors' centre in Mullaghmore, County Clare and as a result, these regulations were introduced in 1994.  Certain exemptions were permitted, including traveller halting sites.  In the interests of consistency, if one provision is included, all should be included. While people who are anxious to have speedy provision of halting sites may not agree with the lifting of this exemption, in the long term it will prove to be a good decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed changes to rules on the adoption of development plans.  Objectives for the provision of accommodation for travellers and the use of certain areas for this purpose will have to be included.  The Minister said this has arisen from court proceedings &mdash; one such case related to an area near Birr, County Offaly.  The challenge was based on an alleged inadequacy in the development plan.  This may seem to slow the process but it will help to avoid litigation and provide for better consultation.  I ask the Minister and his Department to keep an eye on consultation <Col N="385" /> to ensure it is not used to frustrate the achievement of the aims with which we all agree.</P>
    <P>There will be extensive consultation in the adoption of the traveller accommodation programme and the inclusion of the appropriate objectives in the development plan.  Some groups will see the potential to hold up the provision of accommodation for travellers.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that these provisions will be reviewed if necessary to ensure that vexatious use is not made of them.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister how provision will be made for the resolution of conflict at local level, even if these plans are implemented.  Conflict will not disappear because of legislation.  The Department needs to co-operate with the national consultative committee to see if facilitators or experts can be brought in at local level to help resolve conflicts which arise between the council, residents and travellers, even where sites have been approved and provided.</P>
    <P>There was a dangerous situation in Tullamore two years ago, when one Friday evening, knowing that council officials would have gone home, a group of travellers came from a county quite a distance away.  They pitched a tent on a green in a settled housing estate beside the official serviced halting site.  They intimidated the council and the residents and the council had to allow them onto unserviced council land beside the official halting site.  A number of councillors and I were the mediators between the manager's staff, the travellers who had arrived, the travellers on the official site and the residents on the neighbouring housing estate.  We were glad to serve our function and avoid an untoward situation which may have resulted in violence.</P>
    <P>Trained people should be available at local level to engage in conflict resolution.  Town clerks and housing officers have enough to do not alone for travellers but also for other people in the community who need accommodation while social workers dealing with travellers are already overburdened.  Special facilitators or people with special skills need to be provided to help reduce and resolve conflict.  There will be a need to increase resources for local authorities even though the Department has always provided significant capital funding for the provision of halting sites.  The position regarding maintenance costs is improving but we must look at human resources within county councils also to ensure they are beefed up to meet the task ahead.  Housing officers cannot be asked to be experts on everything.  If extra staff are necessary to put this into effect, provision should be made for them.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding the form and content of accommodation programmes are sensible.  The belief that in preparing programmes regard must be had for the accommodation needs that have been identified, including the need for transient halting sites and the distinct needs and family circumstances of travellers, is important.  I strongly agree with the provisions the Minister of State <Col N="386" /> outlined to ensure co-ordination between local authorities so that, first, they take the responsibility seriously in this regard and, second, ensure procedures regarding the adoption of programmes should be carried out nationwide at the same time.  Those are sensible suggestions warranted by experience.  The tendency has been that if one council moved ahead it was blocked at a certain stage and then decided that it would not move until everyone else did.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a review.  Where a programme is adopted for five years, changes may occur on the ground and the programme must then be modified.  Will the Minister of State respond to the fear that the provisions for amendments or replacements may be used again to hold up implementation of local plans?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions on unauthorised encampments.  I welcome the efforts being made to tackle such encampments because they have been the single biggest deterrent to the provision of further serviced halting sites.  There is one halting site in Tullamore but there are two unauthorised ones beside it.  People living in an area proposed for a further site cannot be expected to deal with the risk of unauthorised encampments also.  Will the Minister of State seriously consider two changes to the provisions he outlined?  They propose removal to a site within five miles but that is too short a distance, particularly in rural counties.  A figure of 12 to 15 miles would be more feasible because every county would then be able to meet its obligations. Perhaps, there is a case for distinguishing between urban and rural authorities.  It is not feasible to have a caravan illegally parked moved to within one mile.  Three to five miles would be an appropriate radius; but if the Minister of State does not see fit to amend these figures, I will comment further on Committee Stage in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for introducing the Bill.  There is need to review traveller accommodation and there are many misconceptions about what has happened.  Unfortunately, in many communities there can be one bad egg in the basket of travellers and it gives the entire travelling community a bad name and creates many problems. A bad egg is present in every city and county.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of amendments to previous legislation which are extremely welcome. When one examines the provisions the onus will be put firmly on local authorities to statutorily deal with the problems.  They will be given the opportunity to produce a plan within a period of two months.  If the plan is not adopted within that period there is just a further month during which the council will have the opportunity to adopt it.  Following that it becomes a managerial responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many local authorities have been hard done by through the publicity they have received.  I have <Col N="387" /> no doubt there are councils which dealt with the problems as best they could given the resources that were available, which were not sufficient over the past number of years to deal with the provision of housing and other plans.  There will be an extended role for councils in the coming years with the establishment of SPCs within them. This will give more responsibility to councillors, but with the establishment of the SPCs there will be a need to provide more resources for services and allow members of the SPCs to operate within the council framework.  This will give them the strength and teeth to do the job for which they are intended as traveller accommodation will come under the remit of SPCs.</P>
    <P>The rights of travellers within the community in general must be examined.  The Minister of State did not make reference to dealing with the responsibility of travellers other than that committees will be set up comprising members of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group or representatives of the travellers themselves at local level.  Tribute should be paid to social workers and in Kilkenny Mr. Liam Keane has worked extremely hard over the past number of years.  Every traveller in the south east knows and trusts him because he will deal with them to the best of his ability.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny traveller accommodation programme is an ongoing project.  In 1984 a decision was taken by Kilkenny County Council to provide three halting sites in the city and its environs. On average 15 families were parked around the city at that time.  In 1988 two three bay sites were built at Hebron Road and Wetlands.  I had a problem with the Wetlands area, as director of elections for Fianna Fáil on one occasion, when we handed over the addressing of envelopes to a State body and 300 families, apart from those on the halting site, received letters with Wetlands Halting Site as their address, which did not go down well with a number of people.  These sites were extended to five bays and in 1996 the Hebron Road site was extended to seven bays while two houses were provided at the Wetlands site. While there is no current demand for a third site, the need for a site for transient families is being assessed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In the late 1970s and early 1980s there were, on average, 15 roadside families in Kilkenny city, three families in Urlingford and occasional roadside parking at New Ross.  The provision of the two existing sites at Kilkenny city and the single site at Callan, as well as the ongoing provision of housing for roadside families, has greatly improved the situation.</P>
    <P>The three roadside families at Urlingford have been housed and there are now 31 traveller families housed in Kilkenny.  Of these, only one has caused any major problems and that family is creating atrocious difficulties for the social welfare system, the housing office, the Garda, the education system and so on.  A house was purchased <Col N="388" /> at a cost of £63,000 for the family by Kilkenny County Council.  The family moved out of the house into the garden, parked their caravans there and the extended family moved in. Four years later, the house is wrecked and it is expected that a further £100,000 will have to be spent to renovate it.  The Government's response to travellers is to provide a 100 per cent grant to them.  If a member of the settled community were to behave in this manner, they would probably be imprisoned.  Kilkenny County Council cannot take any action in this matter save to throw the family out on the side of the road.  If we do that, they will not be allowed into the halting sites by the halting site residents.  This family is a single bad egg and approximately £1,000 per week is being expended on it in terms of social welfare and so on.</P>
    <P>A census taken in November 1995 showed that 13 families were resident in serviced sites and 14 were in need of accommodation.  Seven of the latter group were living adjacent to their parents' houses on unofficial sites and the other seven were on the roadside.  During 1995-6 a considerable change occurred in the pattern of roadside parking by transient families in Kilkenny.  This was especially evident in the January to May and October to December periods of both years.  As sufficient accommodation is available in the two existing sites for indigenous families, a third site would cater for transient families only.</P>
    <P>During the summer, travellers come into Kilkenny and create problems.  However, if approached, they will say they are on holidays; some would have houses in other parts of the country.  People are entitled to go on holidays but one must consider the problems posed by their accommodation needs.  One must also contend with commercial travellers.  I counted 45 caravans parked on the roadside as I was travelling to Dublin from Kilkenny recently, some of which were Mercedes and BMWs and had Kerry or Limerick registration plates.  These travellers are quite wealthy and must be dealt with when they come into an area.  However, they are extremely familiar with the law as it applies to them.  It can take the patience of Job and the wisdom of God to deal with them as they know exactly what they are doing and will move away from an area when they have done their business there.</P>
    <P>When traders are excluded, 87 transient traveller families parked in Kilkenny city in 1994 compared to 36 in 1995 and 40 in 1996.  The existing sites had 25 different families as tenants in 1996. The additional two bays and two houses on the existing sites made further accommodation available to families parking in the city area.</P>
    <P>The number of traveller families parking in rural areas increased from 20 in 1994 to 44 in 1995 and 43 in 1996.  Most of these families parked for short periods in the Glenmore area which is between Waterford and New Ross.  Problems were also experienced on the Kilkenny-Wexford border at New Ross and Rosbercon.  Wexford <Col N="389" /> County Council's proposed four bay extension to the existing halting site at New Ross and the proposed ten bay transient site there will help to alleviate the problem in the Glenmore area. However, Kilkenny County Council is required to provide accommodation for a number of families indigenous to Rosbercon.</P>
    <P>Although Kilkenny County Council has accommodated two families under the shared ownership scheme, consideration has been given to the acquisition of further properties which would accommodate between two and four more families and also to the acquisition of a site to facilitate a Respond housing scheme.  The Respond scheme is one of the voluntary housing schemes which are springing up throughout the country to which more resources are being directed than to local authority housing.  The 95 per cent grant which the scheme receives may seem similar to a local authority grant but when a voluntary housing scheme is set up, £3,000 per unit is set aside for amenity development at the site.  No such provision is made for a local authority development and local authorities are at a distinct disadvantage in this regard.</P>
    <P>The voluntary schemes do not spend as much as the local authorities on land acquisition because, in many cases, the local authority provides the land and a certain level of infrastructure. Perhaps the Department of the Environment and Local Government wishes to remove responsibility for housing from the local authorities and direct it at the voluntary schemes.  The problem is that the voluntary groups will continue to use the county council lists and other council apparatus.  As I understand it, tenants under the voluntary housing schemes are not entitled to purchase their houses so the schemes offer a means through which the housing can be retained in the public domain, unlike the local authority tenant-purchase schemes.</P>
    <P>Two named indigenous Kilkenny families currently parking on the roadside are anxious to be housed and are very suitable for housing.  It is proposed to provide rural cottages for these families and to permanently house a traveller family in Stoneyford in the upcoming scheme.  The overall traveller accommodation programme to provide sufficient sites and houses is progressing well in Kilkenny.  The need for a third site for transient families in the city is being monitored in the light of changes in roadside numbers, urban to rural shifts and the continuous increase in indigenous families which require housing.  It is anticipated that the provision of a transient site would occur in tandem with neighbouring local authorities.</P>
    <P>As well as the specific plans already outlined, the council will continue to pursue its policy of housing traveller families which are deemed suitable for housing in new schemes, rural cottages or causal vacancies.  Voluntary bodies, together with local authorities, must also take responsibility for housing a certain number of traveller families. Traveller families in New Ross have been in continuous <Col N="390" /> discussion with Kilkenny County Council and the Respond voluntary housing agency in regard to accommodation and it is not necessary to set up a formal participation structure for them.</P>
    <P>Families on the two Kilkenny sites have site committees which participated in the redesigning of the sites for a recent upgrading project. Kilkenny Community Action Network will provide a community worker to work with these committees in an effort to establish a representative travellers group for Kilkenny.  These will provide representatives to join with local officials and elected representatives on the proposed traveller accommodation committee.  However, the two named families, among others, are not interested in participating in any tenancy committee and that might prove problematic.  They tend to know their rights but not their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>According to the expected directive from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government the following is the proposed five year plan for traveller accommodation in Kilkenny:</P>
    <P>1997</P>
    <P>&mdash; The provision-acquisition of 2 to 4 houses in the Rosbercon area together with the provision of 2 to 4 houses as part of the Respond Housing Scheme also in the Rosbercon area to cater for the extended . family [which is named in the plan].</P>
    <P>&mdash; The provision for the [named] family at Rosbercon together with the proposals by Wexford County Council will meet the requirements in the New Ross Area.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Ongoing monitoring of the changing pattern of transient Traveller parking and movement with regard to the need for a transient site and where it might be located.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The provision of 2 rural cottages for the 2 indigenous [named] families.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The provision of a tenancy for a traveller family as part of the Stoneyford Scheme.</P>
    <P>1998</P>
    <P>It is expected to allocate housing appropriate to what indigenous families are requesting and to house at least two families successfully in this way.  The commitment to provide in all 7 units of accommodation in 1997 will substantially reduce the roadside demand.  The provision of a transient site in Kilkenny city environs if the demand is sustained will be considered in 1998.</P>
    <P>If the considerable shift to rural parking continues, then single lettings in the relevant areas will be considered instead or a transient site elsewhere in the county.</P>
    <P>1999-2001</P>
    <P>It is hoped by 1998 the roadside demand will be by and large facilitated and the Council will <Col N="391" /> focus on the population increase in families on the site, those families parking within the curtilage of their parents' homes, etc.  The majority of these families either want houses or to live on the existing sites among relatives.  Our focus in Kilkenny will be to accommodate them accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely, in the 5 year period that the Traveller population in Kilkenny will increase sufficiently to require more than two existing sites &mdash; [I hope word of this does not reach travellers in our neighbouring counties which would bring Waterford, Tipperary and Wexford people in on top of us] &mdash; the single site in Callan and the proposed transient site to facilitate transient families.</P>
    <P>We hope to add to the 31 existing housed families, each year, with at least two successfully housed families.</P>
    <P>The Traveller Accommodation Committee can be formed with representatives from the elected members and officials of Kilkenny County Council and Travellers' Representatives. They will be involved in discussing and developing the 5 year local Traveller Accommodation Programme before presentation to the Council for consideration and adoption.</P>
    <P>Other councils are living up to their responsibility and have plans in progress which comply, in general, with what the Minister proposes in the Bill. The rights of travellers must be taken into account and their responsibilities must be addressed.  We must equally look at the rights of the settled community and their responsibility to travellers.  We must resource local authorities for the provision of educational and social programmes which could be integrated into the settled community's ongoing programmes of educational and social affairs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of the body of important legislation which is being introduced by the Government. I welcome the Bill and the Minister to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill imposes an important responsibility on local authorities.  Those Members, including myself, who are not involved in local government must pay tribute to the attempts by local authorities to address this issue. For many years I have been a supporter of travellers' rights and the development of travellers' culture in education.  My cause is often set back by so called liberal commentators in polite newspapers who address this issue with no consideration for local pressures.  I say this despite my frequent differences with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the custom for university candidates for the Seanad to list the supporters of their nomination. The lists usually consist of learned professors and serious people of high quality.  Since I first sought election to this House I have included representatives of the traveller community in my <Col N="392" /> list of supporters.  Nonetheless, I have had serious differences of opinion with members of the traveller community.  I do not, for example, accept the concept of a traveller culture.  I believe in the concept of an Irish culture and a number of sub-cultures within that.  There may be a Kerry culture, a political culture or a Gaeltacht culture. There is also a traveller culture in that sense.  The term sub-culture is not demeaning.  It is an inclusive term.  It is important that travellers see themselves as part of the Irish community and that they are seen as part of that culture and community. We must make concessions to accommodate each other.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important step forward.  There are those who do not wish to see solutions and there will be difficulties in its implementation.  It is important that local authorities are seen to have the support of the Houses of the Oireachtas in trying to address this issue.</P>
    <P>I became involved in traveller education when I read surveys of travellers' living conditions.  Figures for life expectancy, infant mortality and access to basic services such as running water and toilets, among travellers are still appalling.  The traveller community includes some who will opt for a settled life, some who will opt for a nomadic life and others who will wish to travel at certain times of the year.  It should not be too difficult to recognise and accommodate those three groups. This Bill attempts to do that.</P>
    <P>I compliment the local authorities in Galway who, for many years, have been aware of the importance of education as a bridge between the travelling life and the settled life.  In Galway, help has been provided for travellers who wish to adjust to the change from a nomadic to a settled life.  Difficulties involving travellers in Galway is no reflection on the people of Galway or on their local authorities.  Discrimination against travellers is the responsibility of the individual who perpetrates that discrimination.  To say otherwise is another form of racism.  It is important to explain to people what is required in a settled community and to help them adjust to it.  This has been done in Galway.</P>
    <P>Travellers do not like the word &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; but I use it to mean the process of people adjusting to each other with parity of esteem and not one group swallowing up another.  The assimilation of travellers into the settled community was not a problem 30 or 40 years ago but it has become a problem within the last 20 years.  This is an unfortunate reflection on wealthy modern Ireland.  When I was going to school in Dingle and the travellers set up camp in town the children came to school and sat wherever they could find an empty desk; they might sit beside me or anybody else.  I cannot imagine my mother, father or anybody in the community objecting to this.  If they did it would reflect very badly on our perception of ourselves as &ldquo;Christians&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I brought this view to teaching.  I have said to traveller communities, school authorities and <Col N="393" /> teachers that they are entitled to demand that traveller children arrive in school clean and ready to learn.  If they cannot do this because of a lack of accommodation in the halting site, the school should provide facilities where they can wash and prepare so that they do not look or feel different from other children.  I have come across much objection to this idea.  Many &ldquo;do good&rdquo; liberals feel that traveller children should not be told that they have to be clean and hygienic like everybody else.  However, we must provide &mdash; in schools, if necessary &mdash; washing and showering facilities for traveller children.  This should be part of the assimilation process.</P>
    <P>I realise I have strayed from the core of the Bill which has been brought forward because of the problems being experienced by local authorities in dealing with the issue of accommodation.  Local authorities either have not had the courage to deal with the issue, have had the courage but no support, or have had to fight in both directions at once.  The necessity of introducing this Bill is a reflection on the times in which we live.  We should see travellers as part of our community. They have cultural values within Irish culture which are different from everybody else in many ways.  Their language, culture, practices and celebrations are part of our celebrations and should be seen as such.  They can enrich the rest of us in the community and we can learn and gain from them.</P>
    <P>I commend the local authorities which are trying to address this difficult and thorny issue.  It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas and Members such as myself, who neither need the votes of local authority members or are members of a local authority, should compliment them on taking on a daunting, challenging and difficult task.  I wish them and the Bill well.  I presume the Minister will be open to changes if people have difficulties with the Bill.  It is a good starting point and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate this very important Bill and am glad that this urgently required legalisation has been introduced. We know this legislation follows the 1995 report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community which was established to advise and report on the needs of travellers and on Government policy in relation to them, with specific reference to the co-ordination of policy approaches by Departments and local authorities.  The report made many recommendations.  This Bill concerns the very vexed issue of accommodation, which all of us who are members of local authorities know is a critical issue which demands much sensitivity and determination.  It is distressing that legislation is required to ensure we do our duty for those in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will, sooner rather than later, have the effect of ensuring people are accommodated and that we do not <Col N="394" /> have the awful prospect of people living on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a lengthy and detailed explanation of the Bill in his speech, a number of aspects of which I want to refer to in particular. I have no difficulty in helping ensure that every housing authority has a five year programme and am glad that there is much willingness in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to cope with the problem.  I wish that willingness extended to every member of the authority &mdash; I will refer to this issue later.</P>
    <P>The explanatory and financial memorandum speaks about amendments to existing legislation which will:</P>
    <P>provide that adoption of programmes will be a reserved function. but, in the event that the members fail to adopt a programme by a date to be specified by the Minister, the manager will be required to adopt the programme, by order.</P>
    <P>This is a safeguard which should not be, but is, necessary.  Over the past number of years I have seen a programme, put in place following wide consultation, being delayed.  We know there are legal challenges mounted to decisions which are made.  It is unfortunate that in many areas this provision will have to be used, something I very much regret.</P>
    <P>Public consultation is critical in relation to accommodation programmes.  In this context I wish to refer to the Crosscare report on accommodation for travelling people.  It states that travelling people prefer accommodation which is located close to services such as shops, schools, health centres, post offices, etc.  Obviously, they are no different from settled people in this regard.  The report indicates that halting sites should have between five and 15 bays but that the ideal number appears to be around ten because anything below this causes difficulties in the provision of services.  The report concluded that halting sites have little effect on residential property values if they are secluded or isolated from residential areas.  This will come as a great surprise to many people in residential areas as one of the main arguments in relation to the provision of halting sites is that property values will fall &mdash; people whisper this.  People also talk about dirt, etc.  This argument is well rehearsed for those of us who are members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>A public consultation process is critical.  I agree with the provision of a national traveller consultative committee and that each county council should establish a committee to facilitate consultation with travellers regarding the preparation and implementation of traveller accommodation. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has already gone ahead with this.  The extent of the consultation which has taken place is remarkable and makes one realise how extensive the process can be.  For example, the group established by us included seven councillors, a cathaoirleach, five <Col N="395" /> traveller interest groups ranging from the parish for the travelling community to Crosscare, two independent travellers, three statutory bodies, namely, two vocational education committees and the Eastern Health Board, and other interests including residents' associations, which are critical, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and council officials.  An extensive process was put in train in order to consult as widely as possible.  The key to success is consultation within the community and I wonder what bodies should be included in order to ensure the greatest possible level of consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the sos I was referring to the provision in relation to public consultation.  This is absolutely essential.  It is remarkable that the recommendation of the Task Force on the Travelling Community described the importance of the improvement of relationships between the travellers and the settled communities through the development of mutual understanding and respect.  The task force report stated that that requires an adjustment of attitudes towards one another and an acceptance of each other's culture. In order to achieve this key goal, the task force recommended that every opportunity be taken to increase levels of contact between the traveller and settled communities at national level and, more particularly, at local community level.</P>
      <P>The latter would ensure that the settled population had a better understanding of the general needs of travellers, their culture and aspirations and of the contribution which cultural diversity makes to society.  It would also enable travellers to understand more about the anxieties of the settled population, which we know only too well. It would contribute to the reduction in the present levels of conflict and tension which exist between both communities by helping to eradicate misconceptions, intolerance and hostility.</P>
      <P>Where there is consultation within a community, it becomes easier and more feasible to ensure that the development of halting sites is not subject to challenge by local communities.  This relates to another provision of the Bill, to extend statutory backing for the provision of financial support to housing authorities and the voluntary sector for the provision and management of traveller accommodation, which is another issue.</P>
      <P>The revenue expenditure of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I am a member, in 1996 was £426,326 and the bulk of it involved the moving of travellers from one unauthorised site to another resulting in no tangible benefit whatever to the council or the travelling community, and the maintenance of sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of sites is a critical issue and that goes back to the respect of the parties, the <Col N="396" /> travelling and settled communities, for each other's culture.  Obviously, it is important that the settled community is reassured about the maintenance of sites once it has finally agreed to them. It begs the question of the costs to local authorities of legal challenges to the setting up of halting sites.  When one considers that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council spent nearly £500,000 with no return, I would hate to think of the cost of legal challenges on top of that and the fact that all of the money could be used to far greater benefit.  Unfortunately, we have had limited success in developing halting sites because of the pressures from within the community and people's fears.  That is why I said earlier that I believe the provision that the county manager must force a decision on people if the elected representatives cannot make it will come to pass because we all know how difficulty it is to ensure people follow through on plans.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of the type of difficulty which has been experienced as a result of not bringing forward and implementing plans. Speaking from personal experience, we, the members of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, agreed a plan.  We had seminars and consultation, and we chose sites.  Then there were challenges at council level or legal challenges which were encouraged by one or two councillors. The result was that there were 48 travelling families living at the side of the road in unauthorised locations and an emergency had to be declared under the Housing Act, 1988, for a temporary site.  Over a six month period four of the families had to move 12 times and they were living in the most appalling circumstances.  The final location was so dangerous that at 6 a.m. on Good Friday the council workmen opened up a temporary site in the Cabinteely area.  Of course, this resulted in us receiving irate telephone calls throughout Good Friday and Holy Saturday from people in the vicinity because they had not been consulted. The difficulty had been that there was nowhere else to put these people.  Therefore, a hard stand, Portaloos, etc., had to be provided for those families because one could not have the spectacle of these people with their children living on the side of the road and the children in imminent danger from traffic in that unsuitable location.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thing that will happen unless people bite the bullet and follow through on the plans which have been drawn up by the councils. In the future people will open their doors and see a temporary halting site.  People's fear is that the temporary sites will become permanent sites.  The members of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council received an undertaking that the temporary site to which I refer will last no longer than 18 months.  It is not a particularly suitable site, but at least the people are not in danger, the place can be kept clean and there is some degree of comfort for the families involved.  This is the type of action which must take place over the next short while until agreement is reached on housing <Col N="397" /> the various traveller families within the council area.  That is why I am particularly anxious that we get this legislation through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill which extends to halting sites the powers available to local authorities under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, relating to anti-social behaviour.  There must be balance. This message, that there must be give and take in this, must be given to the traveller organisations and travellers.  I was astounded at the amount of money which was spent by the housing department in cleaning up sites, but I could not put my hands on the figure last night.  Some halting sites are cleaned up every day which involves a considerable cost.  That is where the co-operation of the traveller families is necessary.  There must be give and take.  If people want to maintain a certain lifestyle, they must accept that it is not one which finds favour with a great number of people within society.  Many people are prepared to support their culture and lifestyle provided they make allowances for the fact that society has certain rules and that they must operate within its laws.  There must be give and take in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the passage of this Bill through the House and I thank the Minister for introducing it here.  I am proud that the commitment in the programme for Government is being adhered to in this regard.  This is an urgent issue because of the situation in which many families find themselves. This legislation will go a long way to alleviating the circumstances in which many of these travelling families live.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, to the House and I commend the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, for introducing this Bill in the House.  I welcome the legislation which represents the implementation of an important commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to promote social inclusion.</P>
      <P>Imposed solutions are unlikely to work in the long term, therefore, I commend the Bill's emphasis on consultation as that is the only way forward.  There must be consultation with travellers to ensure that accommodation is well planned and managed.  Local and national consultative committees must be set up to recognise and address the fears and legitimate concerns of local communities about proposals for travellers' accommodation, to advise on the provision and management of travellers' accommodation which will improve their quality of life and to facilitate access by travellers to education and health services. This process of consultation presents a challenge to local authorities, travellers and travellers' support groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local community fears about proposals for travellers' accommodation are prompted by <Col N="398" /> experience of unofficial encampments or overcrowded sites.  A comprehensive response by all local authorities would help to relieve this situation and to end the perception that some areas are asked to do more than their fair share.  It is unsightly for motorists to see these people living along the roadside.  That is why I am pleased this Bill has been introduced and I hope it has a successful passage through both Houses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of halting sites in the public consultation procedures under the planning and development regulations.  It is appropriate that such proposals should be subject to the same procedures as apply to local authority developments generally.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on improving the management of travellers' accommodation is also to be welcomed. This important factor would help to overcome the resistance of local communities to the provision of travellers' accommodation.  Evidence of successful and well managed sites is the best means of gaining acceptance of new sites.  I invite the media to play a role in this by reporting on sites, even those provided by local authorities, which are well managed.  One site in Drogheda is well managed and there are no problems with the community in that area.  We should promote this aspect rather than the unsightly scenes of caravans and travelling children along our major routes, such as the N2.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional powers for local authorities to control unauthorised temporary dwellings will facilitate the implementation of the Government's commitment to meet the accommodation needs of travellers.  Perhaps the travelling community should be divided into two sections.  Senator Lanigan mentioned the wealthy travellers, who are known as traders.  It is unfair that they are wealthier than many people who live in houses and have a number of caravans, cars, vans and jeeps parked along the roadside.</P>
    <P>A small amenity area was provided by the community at a crossroads outside my home town of Castleblayney for people who wanted to stop for a picnic.  However, it was taken over six months ago by travellers and the local authority has no power to move them.  These people know their rights.  There are ten to 15 caravans parked in a small area which must create a health risk.  Their children attend the local school.  A widow lives beside the crossroads and she is worried about this situation.  I apologise for raising local issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this initiative from the Government.  It has been long sought and should cause an improvement in the problems which have arisen regarding the accommodation of travellers.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular the fact that county councils are obliged to give annual reports.  That is important as we may set out at the beginning of the year to do good but now, at the end of the year, we will be asked exactly what was achieved in that time.</P>
      <P>With better accommodation we may be able to address the appalling health problems of the travelling community.  From the cradle to the grave travellers have lower health levels than the rest of the population.  They have higher stillbirth and infant mortality rates and the life expectancy of male and female travellers in this country is at least ten years less than the rest of the community. It is unusual to find a traveller who is over 60 years of age.</P>
      <P>Women in the travelling community have less access to health care than other women.  I remember women from the travelling community who did not deliver their babies within that community coming into the Rotunda Hospital on the crossbar of a bicycle to deliver their children and leaving almost immediately afterwards.  It is a big thing for a traveller to leave their community and enter the settled community for health care.  Anything which makes them feel more a part of the community is of help.  They do not have to be the same as everyone else but they must understand they are part of the community and we want to give them the same health care we have given to the rest of the community.</P>
      <P>It has been emphasised in the last few weeks how poor the child vaccination rate is in some areas of the State.  Has the traveller community been singled out to find out the vaccination rate in that community?  It is very important that they should be vaccinated in view of their increased risk of tetanus living so near the earth.</P>
      <P>This Bill will give better stability to the community and as a result better access to education. This is most important as no matter how much health information you give people, there is no point distributing the information unless people are well enough educated to take cognisance of this information and to use it.  It is interesting to note that the most important thing to a child under five years of age, apart from clean water, is the educational level of the child's mother.  If a child has a mother who has not had satisfactory primary education, it is difficult for that child to thrive in life.</P>
      <P>I welcome this initiative and point out that it is useful for annual reports to be introduced.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill placed before us by the Minster. My only regret is that it did not come sooner. Having read the Minister's speech, it is evident he has taken on board many of the difficulties which have been experienced in the provision of proper housing for the travelling people and that he is endeavouring to put together a consensus and to point a way forward.  I hope that all who have the opportunity and authority will take the responsibility, as outlined, on board and will make every effort to solve a great tragedy for our community.</P>
      <P>In many areas throughout the country there have been negative responses to efforts made to do justice to the travelling community in the matter of housing.  This negative reaction, which is often acrimonious, will always find its way into the columns of the papers in the functional jurisdiction of the council of that area.  That does not help as it creates further problems, increasing the perception that the travelling community are a troublesome section of our society, responsible for the plight in which they find themselves and that there is no point in endeavouring to solve the difficulties they have.  It behoves us all to appeal to local authority members, members of a community in which a family will be housed, the media or anyone in a position of influence, to act in a balanced way.</P>
      <P>I am aware that casting aspersions on any particular section which has been part of this tragic drama which we see being played out before us would serve no purpose, but anyone who travels through Ireland and encounters a road side camp is taken aback by the conditions there, conditions which are unacceptable in this century.  Think of the reaction of a visitor to the State who would not have encountered a similar situation in his or her own country.  They must regard us as a very uncaring and uncharitable people.  I have no doubt that if the situation were reversed and a similar plight existed in another country, many of the good people who take up causes here on behalf of the underprivileged and deprived would be making a great deal of noise about such a situation. That may be simplistic but it is the reality, nevertheless.  If you look at the problem from the outside it is a shocking indictment of us as a nation and as a people.</P>
      <P>That is not the whole story, however.  I compliment the voluntary groups which have tried to fill the void which others whose responsibility it was have not filled.  I pay tribute to those voluntary groups which have helped the travelling community and encouraged the families to have their children sent to school so they are given a proper opportunity in life and who have tried to relieve the difficulties of roadside living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also pay tribute to any section of the media, in fictional drama in particular, which has endeavoured to depict travellers in an understanding manner, as human beings like ourselves, <Col N="401" /> with the same feelings and sensibilities, who are entitled to the full protection of the State.  The RTÉ programme &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; is particularly worthy of mention.  I am pleased with how the traveller community is depicted in that series.  Its members are shown to be integrated into the local community and to be responsible people. Without being over-dramatic and clouding the issue, the series shows them to be industrious people who are anxious to look after their children's welfare.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the traveller and settled communities is most important.  Some of us have a romantic view of travellers.  I have many pleasing memories of travellers calling to my home and of our efforts to help them.  However, there was a particular dignity attached to travellers in those days.  Usually, they did not come seeking alms but offering their services as tradesmen or to sell goods.  As time passed, however, the trades and skills of travellers were rendered redundant.</P>
    <P>When Ireland was preparing to enter the EEC, small and large industries were prepared for the culture shock of competition and change with which they would be faced.  Subventions were provided in many cases, as were specialist services and training.  No official effort was made to prepare the traveller community for the changes they would experience in their lives, and that omission is not easy to correct at this stage.  A long period of time has elapsed and changes have taken place both in the traveller community and in the settled community in that regard.</P>
    <P>We must accept the fact that sometimes we demand too much from the traveller community when we endeavour to integrate it in the settled community.  Its members come from a base of deprivation which is not of their making and we must accept that.  When Irish people emigrated to America in the last century they, too, left a deprived situation to move into a highly developed and what was, at the time, an affluent society.  They brought with them some of the excesses of their deprivation in a social sense and otherwise.  Those emigrants depended on the understanding of the people in their new country to help them to adapt to their new home, so such transitions are not a particularly new experience for Irish people.</P>
    <P>Our perception of travellers is usually highly uninformed.  There is a tendency to generalise, for instance.  If one traveller family steps out of line, settled people who are not inclined to be careful about what they say tend to paint the entire traveller community with the same brush.  However, if a member of the settled community in a given street offends, do we blame the entire street or town?  Of course not, but the settled community seems to think it is acceptable to do it to the traveller community even though, by so doing, it aggravates the problem.</P>
    <P>I commend the consultative process proposed in the Bill.  It is particularly important that the traveller community, in partnership with the <Col N="402" /> other recommended participants in the process, has an input into its future.  We should not legislate above its head.  I have always been impressed by the spokespersons for the traveller community whom I have heard on current affairs programmes on radio and television.  They can enunciate their fears, vision, concerns and ambitions with great clarity and I wish that ability could be relayed into local areas when situations are developing.  The consultative process will succeed in doing that.</P>
    <P>One of the statistics provided by the Minister of State is dismaying.  It shows that instead of the number of families on the roadside decreasing, it has increased by 100 in one year.  Have our policies failed?  Has the traveller community not responded to them?  Have travellers opted not to take a house and returned to the roadside?  Whatever the reason, this Bill is the only way forward. However, there is little point in having it on the Statute Book unless people are prepared to accept its provisions.  In that context, I wish to make a suggestion which has probably already been made.  It is not sufficient to pass a Bill such as this and publicise it to local authorities and other concerned agencies.  There should also be a pre-consultative process with those authorities and agencies so that, in some way, the damage from negative publicity and previous failures can be undone.  We must seek goodwill, positive acceptance and the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I believe every local authority will respond positively if each is given to understand that this measure is for real, that resources will be provided and that targets will be set.  Targets are particularly important because there is little point in having an open-ended process.  We should propose that by a certain year the problem will be solved.  It is not an insurmountable problem. While the increase is frightening, the overall numbers are not.</P>
    <P>We must remember that life will not get easier for traveller families.  The more affluent the settled community becomes, the more difficult it appears to be for that community to accept the existence of the traveller family on the one hand and to find a solution to its problems on the other.  I do not wish to sound cynical in this regard but the more affluent settled people become, the less concerned they appear to be about their neighbours or about people with difficulties. Fewer courtesies are extended, particularly to travellers, even though they are more vulnerable. There are not many votes in the travelling community and not many people are prepared to put their heads above the parapet in this regard.  In fact, in a political sense it is probably dangerous to so do.  Nevertheless, we will be indicted as a nation for the fact that the accommodation problem for travellers has continued and does not appear to have been diluted to any degree.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope there will be a balanced response to it.  I also hope there will be a consultative process before its implementation <Col N="403" /> in addition to the consultative process provided for in its provisions.  However, targets are vital and must be set.  My final appeal is to the media, which has great power at its disposal.  It now has a wonderful opportunity to help solve this problem and it is incumbent on its members, like everybody else, to present the right atmosphere in which this can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a great deal to say on this occasion.  Unusually, I received no briefing from the traveller community.  It is usually effective in providing extensive briefing material but, for some reason, it has not contacted me on this occasion.  I am not sure whether I should interpret this to mean that the community is happy with the Bill, as that would be unusual for any group. Most groups in society appear to be able to find something to cavil about in legislation.</P>
      <P>However, in the absence of any briefing by or consultation with members of the traveller community, I will offer my own views on this Bill.  I make this point because in normal circumstances, even if I had not received briefing material, I would attempt to contact and consult them.</P>
      <P>It is extremely patronising to purport to speak on behalf of any group if one has not made an attempt to discover the nature of its views.  This is an important principle and I am glad it is included in the Bill in the form of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group. That is an extremely valuable and welcome development and I will return to deal with it later. A question arises in respect of the balance of numbers on that committee and I was not completely convinced by the Minister of State's comments in that regard.  However, it is extremely important that travellers are consulted and not merely dominated or patronised.  I am concerned because the Bill states that the participation of elected representatives from local authorities, etc., on the committee can be up to 50 per cent whereas traveller representation is confined to 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the sensitive approach displayed by the Minister of State when he referred to the nature of the traveller ethos and the importance of putting in place properly services transient sites. We will not be able to declare that travellers are acceptable once they stop travelling and settle down to a life of urban or city centre bliss like everyone else.  We must respect their right to travel, which is extremely important at this time of the year.</P>

      <Col N="404" /> When I first read that poem, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  I must have traveller blood in me because when I heard the lovely phrase &ldquo;I'll hoist up my sails and off I'll go&rdquo;, I thought &ldquo;What a wonderful idea&rdquo;.  We should be loath to extinguish this capacity for choice on behalf of travellers if travelling is in their blood.  From meeting travellers and reading interviews with them, I understand that, for a sizable proportion of them, part of their experience of being human and being Irish at the end of the 20th century is their continued desire to be allowed to roam freely throughout the country.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State appears to be sensitive to this desire.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the increasing complexity in Irish political life that such sensitivity exists. Between 15 to 20 years ago certain unscrupulous political figures gained political capital from bashing the travellers and calling them by unpleasant nicknames.  Early in my political career I recall fighting for the acceptance of amendments to protect two groups of people, neither of which was extremely popular, namely, the gay community and the travellers.  Those amendments were accepted and I no longer have to bother tabling similar amendments because both groups are automatically catered for, almost as a matter of course, and successive Governments have taken their concerns on board.</P>
    <P>However, discrimination continues to exist. Before a recent trip abroad, I heard an interview with Francie Barrett who represented this country at the Olympic Games.  He and his wife were invited to a function in a place of public resort in Galway but when they arrived they were refused admission.  That is extremely bruising and insulting and it appears there is considerable contradiction between the satisfaction this country showed in securing his skills as an athlete and then denying him access to a place of public resort.</P>
    <P>I accept that people should be denied access to pubs, hotels, cinemas, etc., on the basis of their behaviour alone.  I have often been asked if I would welcome the arrival of travellers &mdash; that term is not usually employed &mdash; at the bottom of my street.  I have replied that I would welcome them as long as they behaved in a way which did not disturb me.  The members of any community are entitled to require respect for their psychological and personal space.  I am disturbed almost every night of the week, not by travellers but by the drunken remnants of the middle class returning home from four well known boozing haunts in the centre of Dublin.  My house was broken into, not by a member of the traveller community but by a happily married respectable man whose profession is burglary.  The individual in question lives in the city centre, in circumstances of reasonable affluence, and even though he was arrested he managed to skip bail.  Imagine what the headlines would have been if that man had been a traveller.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> I accept a number of comments made by other Members about the mess created by travellers.  I admit that there are eyesores in some areas.  I have friends who work for various local authorities and if I mention the travellers they roll their eyes and inform me that I have no obligation to provide them with housing, deal with them, etc.  Although I have occasionally noticed untidy halting sites, I have also seen reasonably affluent areas throughout the city of Dublin in the same state.  There is no doubt that we are a profoundly dirty people.</P>
    <P>The present incumbent of the ministerial chair, the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace &mdash; I forgot to observe tradition and welcome him to the House &mdash; lives in Cork.  Anyone travelling on the train to Cork who looks out the window at Newbridge will see a development of spanking new houses, the owners of which seem to have thrown the entire contents of their domestic rubbish over their back hedges for the past six to 12 months.  That rubbish is lodged where every &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; on the train can see it.  What impression does that make?  Obviously the people in these middle class homes do not notice the dirt because it is out of sight and out of mind. However, their behaviour betrays a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; mentality. What accusations would be made if those people were travellers?</P>
    <P>I accept that people may discriminate on the basis of behaviour alone.  I recall running a discotheque for charitable purposes in the centre of the city of Dublin and I had to deal with some real beauties.  I discriminated rigorously, not on the basis of appearance, dress, accent or social background but on that of behaviour alone.  I agree that travellers should be subjected to the same rules as everyone else.</P>
    <P>A serious problem exists in respect of the traveller community.  I do not have the figures at my disposal but a recent examination of the age profile and survival rates among travellers revealed that they have a frighteningly low life expectancy which is substantially different to that of the settled population.  That should raise a number of questions in our minds.  Perhaps it has something to do with the conditions in which travellers live on the roadside or it could be the fault of a higher rate of alcoholism.  We must inquire why travellers have such a low life expectancy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that &ldquo;the response of housing authorities to the accommodation needs of travellers has been somewhat uneven&rdquo;. I hope the wise and sensible provisions in the Bill, which include the possibility of requiring neighbouring local authorities to co-operate, will obviate this difficulty.  I have heard representatives of local authorities claiming to have done as much as could be expected of them and passing the responsibility to neighbouring counties.  A local authority should not be able to get away with claiming dereliction of duty by a neighbouring <Col N="406" /> authority.  It will be useful to require local authorities to co-operate with each other.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transit halting sites to facilitate, as the Minister of State said, &ldquo;. the nomadic lifestyle of travellers on a basis which takes account of the rights and concerns of the whole community&rdquo;.  That strikes the correct balance. The Minister of State also said</P>
    <P>Another important change in this area is the new requirement to assess the needs to accommodate the future growth in traveller families in respect of a period to be defined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is sensible to have an actuarial type calculation to assess how matters are developing.  It is worrying to see that there was an increase in the number of traveller families on the roadside in unofficial encampments from 1,040 at the end of November 1996 to 1,127 a year later; despite the efforts of Government and local authorities there has been an increase.  The Minister of State pointed out that over a five year period, despite efforts to provide accommodation, the number of families on the roadside has fallen by only 53.</P>
    <P>Section 22 refers to the consultative process.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the local traveller accommodation consultative committees shall comprise representatives of the members and officials for the appointing authority and representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies.  The section also provides that elected representatives will not exceed one half of the membership, while traveller representatives must make up at least one-quarter of the membership. The proposed parameters for the representation of each group are intended to ensure a balance of representation . In preparing this section, I also gave careful consideration to the inclusion of representatives of other groups and authorities . I am satisfied that the composition proposed is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the balance, particularly with regard to the heavy loading of nearly 50 per cent of local authority representatives as against 25 per cent of traveller representatives.  In other words, there will be twice as many representatives from the settled community as from the traveller community.  The settled community has many avenues by which to make its views known to the local authorities but the traveller community has very restricted access.  Having a greater traveller representation on a body intended to consult with those who will be most closely affected would be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I echo the Minister of State's praise for the work of former Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and the task force set up to deal with the traveller community. Many people have been involved in helping the travellers over many years, yet nationally <Col N="407" /> we have done a disservice to those in State and religious institutions who have been involved with travellers.  Many priests, nuns and community groups have done great work for the travelling community and have been pioneers in educating the public about travellers.  They have put in much voluntary effort working with young travellers to help them.  I congratulate those people who have made substantial inroads into the problems facing travellers.  I have seen their work and the extent of their personal effort and dedication.  Such a community based approach will provide long-term solutions.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a commitment by the State to a national plan, setting out responsibilities which must be adopted by local authorities, county managers and elected representatives.  It provides for a five year plan which, in a monitored and consultative way and with the full support of public representatives, will lead to great improvements for travellers.</P>
      <P>Every county must become part of the National Travellers Accommodation Consultative Group. It is important that consultation will take place between travellers and local communities.  The public is fearful of travellers and there is fear in the traveller community.  In some cases positions have become very entrenched which has led to an inclination on the part of travellers to strengthen themselves in groups.  They fear parts of the settled community.  When people have to endure such circumstances they tend to act in groups, although it may not be in their own best interests or in the public interest.  There is a need for consultation, understanding and communication.</P>
      <P>The Government introduced equality legislation concerning disabled people.  We are now tackling one of the greatest national embarrassments, the way in which we have dealt with travellers. The local authority in Mayo has made solid progress.  There are about 50 families in the area at present but there are many young people who will marry and will need accommodation in the future.  Unless the plan is adopted and operated in a consultative manner in the near future, there may be a backlash from the traveller community.</P>
      <P>From my contact with the traveller community I am aware that many travellers are anxious to educate their children and to move off the roadside. I recently met an elderly couple who asked me if they would have to die on the roadside.  It is tragic that such a question should arise in this day and age.  These people lived good lives and did not cause problems for the community.  We must address such problems positively and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it puts responsibility on the elected representatives to adopt the necessary structures for its implementation in the county development plans.  From experience I know that much pressure will be exerted unless this matter is handled properly.  I am sure my colleagues have had the same experience.  We will <Col N="408" /> have to deal with this pressure in a responsible and rational way in order to make the necessary progress.</P>
    <P>It behoves everybody to carry that responsibility so that we can make the progress necessary to house people within the timeframe of this plan.  It can be done without great difficulty if the commitment is there.  In its consultative role the Department should monitor the progress of our councils.  Each council has statistics concerning people indigenous to the county so one should be able to see the progress that is being made nationally.  It is a fundamental aspect of the plan.</P>
    <P>There was never a shortage of finance from the Department to deal with travellers but, in the past, money was not spent because the issues were not faced up to.  While there was no shortage of money to deal with the issue, there was a lack of commitment, responsibility and the strength to do it.  There was no cohesion among the communities to make progress.</P>
    <P>I have seen great progress being made by individual social workers with a definite interest in examining the needs of travellers.  They consulted with the community at large, including public representatives. Such a backup service for traveller families allows them to adjust easily to a range of modern facilities.  Through the concept of equality they are encouraged to adapt to the education process.  While some difficulties remain to be overcome, progress in housing travellers is most noticeable in areas where the groundwork has been done by consultative committees.</P>
    <P>We require substantial backup services from health boards and local authority social workers in order to house the numbers of people envisaged in this plan.  That is fundamental to attaining the objective of a good settlement plan wherein people will be happy with their new accommodation.</P>
    <P>Some transient groups will not be dealt with within the framework of the Bill.  Some counties have difficult problems with such groups who would appear to be substantially well off and are not indigenous to the counties they move into. They have their own trades and are obviously good business people; one can see that from their lifestyle and accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine these transient groups whose members should have to pay rent for the facilities provided to them in the counties they visit.  If tax incentives were provided, the private sector could participate with local government in providing areas for transient groups to work from.  It would be better than having them choose their own spots without any consideration for residents and businesses in a county.</P>
    <P>They should not be a law unto themselves.</P>
    <P>They are substantial business people and are very literate.  They know exactly what they are doing and how to work the system.  We should take charge by providing places for them.  We should provide the necessary management for such <Col N="409" /> places through the private sector while charging a fee.  They should not be allowed to work along our national primary routes at will.  Many towns have this serious problem and they should deal with it.  That is one way of doing it which would help the State's resources.  It would be an attempt to manage the <i>ad lib</i> movement of transient people.</P>
    <P>I welcome this positive Bill which, I hope and believe, will make a great contribution towards people's quality of life and will bring about a change in the overall considerations of local authority members.  I hope that in the not to distant future we will see progress from this consultative approach and that we will be able to measure up to our responsibilities as public representatives.</P>

      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch ar fad de na Seanadóirí a labhair san díospóireacht seo faoi an ábhar chun áit chónaithe cheart a chur ar fáil do lucht taistil.  Táim cinnte nach bhfuil éinne sa Seanad nach bhfuil den tuairim go bhfuil sé thar am don Stáit áit chónaithe a bheith ag gach éinne sa tír agus nár chóir go mbeadh éinne ina chonaí ar thaobh an bhóthair mar atá an-chuid de lucht taistil sa tír seo.  Cé go bhfuil sáriarracht déanta ag na h-údaráis áitiúla agus ag an-chuid daoine a bhí ag obair go deonach, mar sin féin mar a thais-peán mé san oráid a thug mé ar dtús, tá níos mó 1,000 clainn fós nach bhfuil áit chónaithe sásúil acu.  Tá sé mar aidhm agam agus ag an Rialtas go ndéanfaimid gach iarracht chun a chinntiú ag deireadh thréimhse an Rialtais seo, má fhágtar ann muid le ceithre go leath nó cúig bliana, nach mbeidh aon duine de na clainn sin fágtha ar thaobh an bhóthair.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go maith na deachreachtaí atá ann.  Tá mé ag plé leis an gceist seo mar is eol do chuid de na Seanadóirí le suas le 30 bliain.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil éinne eile sa Teach go bhfuil an méid sin taithí aige ar na deacreachtaí agus ar na constaicí a chuirtear ós ar gcomhair, ag iarraidh rud éigean fiúntach a dhéanamh ar son lucht taistil sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>Bhí mé sa Roinn seo cheana ins na seachtóidí agus cé go bhfuil a lán dul chun chinn déanta ó shoin, ag an am chéanna, níl sé sásúil go bhfuil daoine ina gconaí ar thaobh na mbóithre.  Tá mé an-bhuíoch as ucht an dtachaíocht atá tugtha ag na Seanadóirí don Bhille seo san méid atá ráite go dtí seo.  Beimíd ag plé le mionphointí a tháinig amach le linn na díospóireachta nuair a thagim ar ais an tseachtain seo chugainn chun an Bille a phlé.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  In particular, I appreciate the sincere support expressed for the objectives of the Bill and the measures set out in it.  I have taken careful note of the all the issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators take a keen interest in housing issues. As the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, this is the fourth occasion on which I <Col N="410" /> have participated in debates on housing issues in Seanad Éireann since my appointment less than a year ago.  I know Members are conscious of the needs of the most disadvantaged in society and of the crucial role of Government in ensuring that public policy responds to these needs.  This Bill is a clear demonstration of the commitment of the Government, as set out in the Action Programme for the Millennium, to promote social inclusion. The measures set out in the Bill will ensure that each local authority addresses the accommodation of travellers in a planned and co-ordinated manner within a defined time frame.  It provides for consultation with travellers, other statutory and voluntary bodies and the public.  All local authorities will be required to adopt and implement five year programmes in parallel with each other.  These measures involve a change in policy from the approach adopted for many years. For over 30 years we have relied on the exercise by local authorities of discretionary powers with capital funding and encouragement from central Government.  While that approach has delivered almost 3,400 units of accommodation for traveller families, we still have the sad situation where in excess of 1,100 traveller families have no official accommodation.  The measures proposed in the Bill are necessary if we are to meet the accommodation needs of these families and ensure that their future needs are met.</P>
    <P>All the concerns of Members will be looked at before Committee Stage next week.  I come with an open mind to these debates and any reasonable and worthwhile suggestions from Senators will be considered to see if they can be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the respective roles of elected members and managers under the Bill.  I want to respond to the suggestion that managers are being empowered to override elected members.  The Bill proposes that the adoption of the programme will be a reserved function, that is, it must be adopted by resolution of the members of the authority.  However, if members fail to adopt the programme within the time allowed, the manager will be required to adopt it, subject to any modification which he or she considers necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh suggested that the proposed minimum period of two months for consideration of a draft programme was not sufficient for councillors to make the necessary decisions.  I am concerned that there is no undue delay in the adoption of a programme.  I hope members will have ample opportunity to exercise their right to adopt a programme which fulfils their statutory obligations. It should be noted that the two month period proposed is a minimum period.  When specifying the date by which programmes must be adopted I will take account of the need for adequate time to complete that stage of the process. I will also look again at the two months proposal but the six months suggested by Senator Walsh might be excessive and might be seen to <Col N="411" /> delay the process unnecessarily.  The time to be allowed should and will facilitate councillors to exercise their right to adopt a programme.  It is only if they fail to exercise their power that the manager is required to step in.  Senator Gallagher made a number of suggestions in relation to the provisions relating to the manager's powers. These will require more detailed consideration but the suggestion in relation to the period allowed to the manager to make his decision could be favourably considered.</P>
    <P>I believe local authority members will take their responsibilities seriously and the measures in the Bill will help them do so, even where there is strong or vocal opposition locally.  In particular, members will have the benefit of a thorough and structured consultation process which will ensure that all legitimate concerns can be considered before a programme is adopted.  They will also have the assurance that all local authorities are approaching traveller accommodation issues on the same basis and within the same time frame. This is especially significant because in the past there was a perception that other local authorities were not doing their bit.  That has helped to strengthen opposition to the provision of accommodation for travellers in some areas.</P>
    <P>Local authorities who were diligent and accepted they had a social responsibility to provide suitable accommodation facilities for traveller families in their area brought forward plans and had them approved and funded by the Department.  This resulted in the word going out among the traveller community that these local authorities were providing facilities for them, the result of which was an increase in the local traveller population.  Many young people moved into these areas in the expectation of benefiting from the progressive attitude of the councils, whereas other councils who were negligent in their social duty in this area had the pressures on them eased. I have experienced this problem over many years. It is important that every local authority brings forward plans based on the needs of the families in their own areas.  This will prevent doubling the traveller population in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to the inclusion of other interests on the national and local traveller accommodation consultative committees.  It was suggested that the local committees should include representatives of the local settled community on the one hand and, on the other, Senator Norris suggested there should be stronger representation for the traveller community.</P>
    <P>Regarding the national committee, I am satisfied that the composition provided for in the Bill is appropriate.  A committee has been in operation on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for many months.  The committee was set up by my predecessor and has worked successfully since then.  The Bill will put that committee on a statutory basis and will allow for the expansion of the existing membership. <Col N="412" /> The committee will bring together representatives of both elected members and management of local authorities, traveller organisations, my Department and a nominee of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has overall responsibility for monitoring the implementation of a wide range of recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  In addition, there will be an independent chairperson and there is provision for the Minister to appoint two other persons with experience as well as an interest in the welfare of travellers.  I believe the composition of the national committee is appropriate.  However, I will be happy to listen to any other suggestions Members wish to make.</P>
    <P>Regarding local committees, members of local authorities who will form part of the membership of these committees are in the best position to represent the views of the wider community.  In deciding the composition of these committees, I must take account of several considerations &mdash; the role of the committees, which is consultative in nature with decision making remaining the responsibility of the housing authorities, the particular focus of the committees on improving relations and understanding between local authorities and travellers, the fact that much of the work of the committees will involve consideration of matters of detail concerning the assessment of accommodation needs of travellers and the planning, design and management of proposals to meet those needs, the need to keep membership to manageable levels and the difficulties inherent in seeking to identify representatives of the settled community, other than the elected representatives. I have given this matter a lot of consideration and it would be very difficult to identify who should represent the settled community on a committee whose membership cannot change to suit whichever community is concerned about halting site proposals.  The best people to represent the settled community are those whom they have elected in their area.  Traveller representation, at 25 per cent, is very strong.  When something new is done, someone will always want more.  However, officials must also be included on the committee.  I am satisfied we have got the balance right but I will be happy to listen to any suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for public consultation at two points.  First, when the five year programme is drawn up, the public must be consulted and their views will be taken into consideration before the programme is adopted.  Second, because of the removal of the exemption under Part X of the Planning Acts, when the programme is implemented and a proposal for facilities in an area is made, there must be public notification of the development &mdash; whether it is a halting site or group housing.  These new measures will greatly expand public involvement and transparency.  I hope the House accepts them as worthwhile and beneficial.  They will meet many of the concerns <Col N="413" /> of people who have not been consulted in the past.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures in the Bill, I have already announced the removal of the exemption under Part X of the regulations.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has amended the regulations concerning this exemption and this will come into effect from 31 May 1998.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators queried the distinction between relevant housing authorities and housing authorities and the basis for deciding which authorities should be designated as relevant housing authorities.  The designation of the larger housing authorities as relevant housing authorities for the purposes of this Bill reflects a number of considerations. The relevant housing authorities will be required to prepare, adopt and secure the implementation of local traveller accommodation programmes.  This is a significant task which is more appropriately discharged by the larger housing authorities.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable to avoid having a multiplicity of programmes in a county.  There is no uniformity in the number of urban district councils or local housing authorities.  Some counties have a large number of sub-county council authorities while others do not.  Outside of Bray and Dundalk, which are named in the Bill because of their size, it is important that the larger councils avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for 41 relevant housing authorities. If we were to allow all housing authorities, 88 different authorities would be drawing up these programmes which would result in a multiplicity of programmes in some counties.  I am open to other suggestions but I think what we have proposed is the most sensible and reasonable way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The decision to assign certain functions to the larger housing authorities is also in line with current provisions in the Housing Acts, particularly section 23 of the 1992 Act.  These provisions allow the Minister to transfer responsibility for housing functions between different housing authorities. Section 6(2) of this Bill allows the Minister to apply those provisions in respect of the functions of relevant housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher and other Senators referred to the five mile and one mile radii provided for in section 3.  Senator Gallagher suggested these distances should be increased.  A prohibition of temporary dwellings within one mile of existing traveller accommodation takes account of the recommendations of the task force on the traveller community which considered this issue in great depth.  Unlike the other provisions, there is no requirement to provide alternative accommodation. In these circumstances, I am reluctant to extend the radius beyond one mile.</P>
    <P>As regards the power to move temporary dwellings to a site within five miles, this distance may be extended by an unspecified amount in the circumstances set out in section 31 (1)(b).  This <Col N="414" /> provision will address the concerns of Senator Gallagher, Senator O'Brien and others.  Senator Lanigan asked why the powers in section 31 are discretionary.  This provides local authorities with the flexibility to respond to problems arising from authorised temporary dwellings.</P>
    <P>All the points raised will be taken into consideration on Committee Stage.  I invite Senators to table amendments in order to have a good debate.  The widespread response to the Bill is encouraging.  There is a cross party approach to put forward effective proposals to provide accommodation for a large section of our community who are in many cases living in deplorable conditions. This cannot be justified and it is an embarrassment in a country where the economy is raging ahead and house prices have risen to such an astronomical extent that the Government had to intercede.  People are living in dire circumstances on the side of the road and this cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The cross party approach to this Bill is highlighted by the fact that a previous Government took the initiative to set up a task force.  Earlier policies were successful but did not eliminate the problem.  Although great progress was made, as highlighted by the figures I cited, one quarter of the total population has been left without adequate accommodation.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to the former Minister of Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor, who set up the task force.  My predecessor as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy McManus, was chairperson of that task force and I am honoured to carry on the work initiated by her.  I have had an interest in this area for many years and I hope the all party support for the Bill in the Seanad will be reflected in the Dáil and in the wider community, particularly in local authorities who are at the coalface of this issue.</P>
    <P>I attended many angry community representatives' and residents' meetings on dark winter nights and Sunday evenings where no official was in sight and the local authority members had to face the community about decisions made by managers implementing the then Government's policy on the provision of facilities for these unfortunate families.  This Bill involves local authority members in the drawing up of plans, with the manager only becoming involved if members fail to reach a satisfactory agreement.  That is a wise and appropriate approach because no Government can stand aside and say it cannot do anything about this problem.  Where the will exists it can move mountains and if it exists in regard to providing proper facilities for the traveller community within a specified period and that can be done within the five year programme the councils have been asked to draw up then so be it.  The Government will not lack when it comes to providing the financial resources needed to support the plans of local authorities to provide facilities on the ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I would be happier if traveller families had a greater preference for permanent housing than halting sites.  A caravan is not a satisfactory or suitable place for people to live in our climate, particularly families with large numbers of children and I am not happy about that.  However, that is their preferred choice and we should continue to encourage them to take up regular housing rather than caravans and halting sites.</P>
    <P>They have a nomadic tradition and want the freedom to move, especially at this time of the year.  That is very much part of their lifestyle and culture and they look forward to the summer when they can visit different parts of the country. If they felt constrained by a house, they might not be able to move.  They have not worked out that one can have a caravan beside a house similar to one on a halting site.  There is nothing to stop them moving whenever they want provided they do not abandon the houses.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work must be done and I hope the Bill will make a substantial contribution in achieving the Government's objective.  I thank those who worked on the Bill prior to my taking office and I look forward to the Committee Stage debate next week.</P>

    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to the House.  He has a wealth of experience in local government having served on Galway County Council and Galway Corporation where he was a colleague of mine.  I want to extend my thanks to the Leader for the extra time he is allowing for the Private Members' debate on this issue.  Hopefully, as many speakers as possible will have an opportunity to air their views on a subject close to their hearts.  That is important as a majority of the Members of this House are elected by, and representative of, local authorities. An indication of the importance of the Private Members' debate can be seen in the number of Senators who have indicated their desire <Col N="416" /> to speak on the issue.  I doubt whether, in spite of the Leader's generosity, everyone will have an opportunity to make a contribution in the time allocated.</P>
    <P>The call for the Private Members' debate and the proposal of the motion that Seanad Éireann condemn the Government for its failure to adequately consult all interested parties on its plans for the restructuring and financing of local authorities are not undertaken lightly nor with the intention of simply attacking the Government, something which is a prerogative of Opposition. I have moved this motion because I, and many of my colleagues, feel there has been inadequate consultation in regard to the proposed funding for local government.</P>
    <P>The current proposals to finance local authorities through motor taxation are much more onerous on motorists than the system advocated by the previous Government which decided, in the summer of 1996, to provide for a maximum increase of 6 per cent on motor taxation over a three year period.  The current Administration, however, proposes a mandatory increase of 6 per cent over a period of less than 21 months.  This places an unfair burden on motorists and penalises people who cannot avail of public transport and must use their private cars, something which is particularly true of rural areas.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to motor taxation is that any necessary future increase in funding will be ensured through increased sales in the car market. There is a touch of &ldquo;live horse and eat grass&rdquo; about these proposals in so far as there is no guarantee that Irish people will buy more cars in the future.  Can the Minister guarantee that the Celtic tiger economy will continue into the future?</P>
    <P>The number of cars per 1,000 of population in Ireland is 246 while the average in Europe is 428. In real terms then, car ownership in Ireland is only half the European average.  In fact, we are second from the bottom in the European league of car ownership.  This would appear to indicate that there will possibly be a rise in the number of cars sold in Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>Leaving the motor tax element aside we move to the more contentious issue which was the basis of the Fine Gael motion.  Originally called the equalisation fund it is simply called the fund in the Bill.  This contribution of £270 million will, unfortunately, not come into being until 1999. This means that local government will continue to be under-funded until then and may continue to be under-funded even subsequent to that date, in spite of index linking.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that the base line will be amended to take account of any additional functions that local authorities may take on. However, I would like the Minister to explain to this side of the House the exact basis on which these provisions will be amended.  Does he mean that local government will be taking on extra functions and will receive an increase in their contribution <Col N="417" /> or does he mean that if a local authority sees an opportunity to provide better or new services or identifies a development necessary for the local infrastructure the base line provision will be amended to allow the local authority to carry out that particular project?  In other words, if it was decided that a county such as Leitrim with a declining population was to be the location for a new city, would the local authority in Leitrim be allowed to request money from the fund which would leave other authorities denuded?  I return to the nub of the argument.  There has been a lack of consultation and we simply do not know what will be provided.</P>
    <P>In 1996, during a debate on local government reform in Dublin Castle, as chairperson of the General Council of County Councils I proposed to the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, the establishment of an independent commission to decide on the distribution of Exchequer contributions.  This proposed group would contain representatives of managers, local authorities and a member from each of the major representative bodies such as the General Council of County Councils, LAMA and the AMAI. The proposal was greeted with horror by the Minister who immediately denied the need for such a commission.  I said to him, and I say now, that local authority members should be represented. They have a wealth of experience and knowledge and a major contribution to make with regard to such funding.  Many have expressed anger at their exclusion, feeling that it is a slight upon them, almost indicating that they are incapable of carrying out such duties.</P>
    <P>I can think of no reason for the exclusion of councillors' representatives from whatever group or committee the Minister has established to decide on the distribution of the Exchequer fund particularly as local authority members are the people most affected in the distribution of funds. Can the Minister explain why councillors have been taken out of the loop?  Will he consult with representative groups so that they can ensure that equity and fairness underpins any decision made with regard to the £125 million fund?</P>
    <P>We are approaching the centenary of the establishment of local government in Ireland and it is right that we reflect on the contribution that local government, and local authority members, have made.  These contributions have largely gone unrecognised and unrewarded.  Local government has made an impressive contribution to the social and economic life of the state.  The much vaunted Celtic tiger is presented as a triumph of social partnership and enterpreneurial spirit.  There is truth in this but neither social partnership nor enterpreneurial spirit could have made any progress were it not for the foundations put in place by local authorities over many years.  It is right that we remind ourselves of the variety and vastness of this contribution in areas such as the establishment of our universities, &mdash; a little recognised fact &mdash; the development of second level <Col N="418" /> vocational education and unglamorous but essential work such as water and sewerage network provision and the building and maintenance of national and local roads.  These are just some examples of how county and city councils have put in place the solid and concrete foundations which form the bedrock of our current economic success.</P>
    <P>On a social level the provision of housing by local authorities both directly and through loans and other supports has contributed greatly to the social fabric of our urban and rural areas.  I recognise that mistakes were made in the past although the concentration of house building in large numbers at a time met a real and pressing need.  Local authorities have moved on from simply building houses and are also, in a real sense, building communities through the leadership of estate management schemes and similar social initiatives.  I trust the Minister is reminded of such management schemes.</P>
    <P>In a totally different area the cultural and artistic dimensions have been supported by local government through the provision of libraries and arts development services and through the establishment of such staff members as arts officers.  From all of this we can see that local government has influenced vast areas of Irish life for the better as befits a sector which accounts for more than 10 per cent of public spending each year.</P>
    <P>Local government, in a less tangible but very real way, has provided access to the democratic process for generations since before the foundation of the State.  The General Council of County Councils, of which I am a member and which I have the honour of representing in the House through their nomination, will mark its centenary next year in parallel with the centenary of the foundation of the network of county and city councils under the Local Government Act, 1898.  This centenary marks 100 years of democratic participation, education and the creation of a cultural service to public life which has served many people well in this House and in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>An area of concern for local authority members has been the growth of an array of partnership groups in the comparatively recent past. These groups work with little or no connection to the democratically elected statutory local bodies. While I accept that many of these groups are doing very good work and have shown an ability to be flexible in their response to the needs of their immediate areas, I am concerned that in the long term we are simply giving rise to a new network of organisations which will prove superfluous. The network or city and county councils which is already in place can carry out all of those functions.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils is the statutory representative body for Ireland's county and city councils.  It has been participating in and monitoring the process of local government <Col N="419" /> reform over the past two or three years.  It has participated in influencing such bodies as the All Party Committee on the Constitution and the Devolution Commission and, through the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the general council has left no stone unturned in influencing the process to ensure that the status and role of local authorities and their members is enhanced to the greatest possible degree.</P>
    <P>In spite of such representation and the influence which they have had in the reform of local government, local authority members are to be excluded from one of the most important aspects of local government &mdash; the distribution of funding.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils has been constructive and realistic regarding local government reform and has worked successfully to suggest to elected members that this kind of partnership is the way forward.  There was an understandable and deep seated concern among members about this development but it was assuaged to a degree by the Government's intention, spelt out in the Better Local Government Report, that there would be a full linkage between the local development groups and the local authorites through a specialised SPC to be known as the community and enterprise groups.</P>
    <P>The CEGs would link the main players in a given county in the area of local development with the local authority, cut down on overlap, improve co-operation, and make the best use of resources to deliver co-ordinated improvements to the enterprise climate of counties.  The General Council of County Councils must register mounting alarm that this concept is not being carried through with the speed that was promised.  The guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last November did not carry a single mention of CEG groups.</P>
    <P>These are some of the important, though far from all issues which councillors and representative bodies have raised with me.  Our main concerns are who will decide on how money will be distributed and why local authority members were excluded from the body or committee which will be make such decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and congratulate him on the frequency with which he appears in the House.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government seems very reluctant to come to the House to debate this issue.  The result is that we had no choice but to table this motion for discussion in Private Members' time.  I thank the Leader for his courteous concession in allowing a continuance of the debate during Private Members' time next week.  This was the only way forward as it appears the Minister would not come before the House in any other circumstances.  We have no quibble <Col N="420" /> with the Minister of State as he is a frequent attender in the House.</P>
      <P>There has been much speculation regarding what will happen in the context of the reform and financing of local government; most people are in the dark.  The motion proposed states that the Minister has failed to consult all interested groups and we condemn this failure.  The Minister has not adequately consulted all such groups, least of all this House.  The Seanad is an ideal place to debate this issue as the majority of Members are elected by local authorities.  I have no doubt that many issues will be raised in the debate and that many fine contributions will be made which will be of benefit to the Minister in bringing to a conclusion his final draft for the reform and financing of local government.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been a tried and tested tool in the building of the State over the past 75 years.  Next year the centenary of the establishment of local authorities will be celebrated.  All we need to do is build on the very good system which exists and which has been proven.  There is no doubt about the need for change in some parts of the system but on the whole it has been tried and tested.</P>
      <P>Local authorities should have more power to raise finances locally.  Receiving power necessitates the taking of decisions and I think councillors and local authorities will make the right decisions if they are given the power to do so, something they have proved in the past.  Over the past 25 years the powers of local authorities have been whittled away.  In the past number of years many powers, which have caused difficulty for successive Ministers for the Environment and Local Government, have been given back to local authorities.  These include responsibility for taxis. Giving power to local authorities in relation to this issue has proved disastrous in places such as Mayo, for example, which has four local authorities &mdash; a county council and three urban councils &mdash; and no authority can make a decision on this matter on its own.  Hackneys, for example, can apply for licences inside the urban boundary to the urban council or outside an urban boundary to the county council.  Urban councils may decide to licence taxis while the county council can grant hackney licences outside the urban boundary.  It is a complete disaster for local authorities. In Mayo, one local authority &mdash; the county council &mdash; should have been given power to make decisions for the entire county.  We have seen a number of such powers being granted to local authorities over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about the establishment of strategic policy committees and compliment him on bringing forward this initiative. These will be very useful in helping councillors and local authorities to be more deeply involved in the running of local government because there will be more transparency and openness.  This is the way forward.  The Minister has indicated that he will operate the committees on a two year <Col N="421" /> basis.  If this is the case I suggest to the Minister of State, who has vast experience of local authorities over many years, that local authority elections should take place every six rather than every two years.  This would mean there would be three strategic policy committee terms in each council period.  Otherwise the committees will only last for one year as either the first or second year will cut across an election period.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years there has been no corruption in local authorities; the system is transparent.  Over the same period there has been power sharing among all parties on local authorities. This is a great system and power sharing and strategic policy committees are the way forward. I ask the Minister to indicate the role urban councils, whose inclusion in the strategic policy committees was an afterthought, will play in the way forward.</P>
    <P>Councillors have played a very important role in the local authority system.  They have all acted in good faith; I have never seen an councillor who has acted otherwise.  They should be properly remunerated by means of an annual payment which would be useful and should be generous as they perform an excellent function in county structures.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann welcomes the initiative by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to enhance and strengthen local democracy and local government, particularly:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of £125m additional funding as recently provided for in the Local Government Bill, 1998,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the increased role of councillors through the Strategic Policy Committees,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the practical commitment to the policy of equalisation being shown by the initiative of needs and resources studies in the local authorities,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the further commitment to a major package of reform prior to local elections 1999,</P>
      <P>&mdash; and notes his commitment to dialogue and discussion with all interested parties, including local authority members and local authority representative bodies, and his open invitation to members of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government to bring forward ideas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with some surprise the motion of the Fine Gael Party because it &ldquo;condemns the Government <Col N="422" /> for its failure to adequately consult&rdquo;.  I would suggest to Senator Burke, who said that he found himself a little in the dark as to what was happening in local government, that if he consults his colleagues, Senator Coogan, Senator Jackman or Senator Ridge, who are all colleagues of mine on LAMA, they will be in a position to fill him in on many of the plans and ideas of the Minister for the improvement and enhancement of local government.  The level of consultation which has taken place is almost unprecedented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a valid reason.  It must be said in fairness to the Minister that I am a member of Wexford County Council for 18 years and I have never before seen a Minister come to a meeting of the country council to outline his thoughts and ideas for local government and invite questions, comments and contributions from the floor.  My understanding is that the Minister has done that throughout practically all of the county councils at this stage.  There are only a few exceptions which remain to be visited. That shows tremendous openness on his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan will also be familiar with the fact that the Minister attended an executive meeting of LAMA in Longford where again he outlined his ideas and participated in a question and answer session.  Only in the past two weeks he spent two and a half hours at our conference one Saturday morning in Rosslare, where there were probably between 200 and 300 councillors in attendance who questioned him on his suggestions on what was likely to emerge from the consideration of the renewal of local government. There was the national planning conference and the national conference on SPCs which were widely attended.  Therefore, the criticism of the Minister is totally unjustified.  On the contrary, he must be complimented on the level of consultation and the way he has made himself available to the practitioners who are involved in local government and who are the people who should <Col N="423" /> be listened to in framing the changes which are to take place.</P>
    <P>We have seen a major and significant change in the financing of local government this year with the Finance Act.  Senator Coogan mentioned that he was concerned about the motor tax situation, but I remind him that it was the Government of which his party was a member which introduced the utilisation of motor tax for local government and who made provision for local authorities to increase it by up to 6 per cent.  All the Minister has done is apply that 6 per cent to a fund to ensure the security of resources on an ongoing basis for local authorities around the country.  He has gone further by ensuring that the fund will keep pace with inflation and that will be underpinned by legislation.  It will be ringfenced; it cannot be removed and used for other Exchequer uses.  It is a substantial fund in that there is an increase of £125 million in the funding available to local authorities.  When it comes to 1999 the benefits and the positive step which has been taken in making this extra funding available, which amounts to some 27 per cent, will be evident to local government and to the people we serve at that level.  It ill behoves a party which participated in Government for the removal of water charges, which was an independent source of funding for local authorities, to be critical now of any steps with regard to funding and to be shedding crocodile tears in regard to the position of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local government is huge business.  It employs over 30,000 people and expends more than £2 billion annually.  The renewal programme which has been announced by the Minister, which he discussed with all of us and with which we are all familiar, includes one stop shops, strategic policy committees which will restore the position of the councillor to centre stage with regard to policy making, and will also incorporate the partnership theme which has done so much to underpin the economic improvements of the past decade.  The Minister has also introduced the system of corporate policy groups which will surely play a pivotal role in administering local government over the next decades as we enter a new century, the second century of local government in this country.</P>
    <P>The area committees will ensure the implementation of those policies.  There are ideas like the direct election of chairmen of local authorities, which is a radical suggestion from the Minister.  It is under active consideration at present in order to restore the democratic deficit.  Anybody who has participated in local government will be aware that there has been a shift to the managerial officer/board side of local authorities which is not the way local democracy should operate.</P>
    <P>All of that, the inclusive approach and the importance and significance which the Minister and the Minister of State are giving to local government, contrasts with some of the changes <Col N="424" /> made previously, particularly by the former Labour Party Minister, Deputy Quinn, where the chairs of county enterprise boards and participation on partnership boards were not available to members of county councils.  All of that, in my opinion, was highly derogatory of the excellent contribution which councillors make at local level.  The Minister deserves our compliments.</P>
    <P>Councillors have been the policy makers and directors of local government.  In many instances, they spend 30 to 40 hours per week working on a voluntary basis in the interests of their constituents. It is welcome that the Minister is also talking about recognising that contribution in a tangible way by looking at the inadequate expenses which councillors are paid, and the provision of a gratuity for those members who retire after long service at local level.  I hope there will be a payment to councillors in recognition of the long hours involved and their hard work.</P>
    <P>Rather than being critical, it would be nice to see the Opposition in a positive mode because this is the most exciting period in my term in local government.  This is the dawn of a new era for local democracy.  We can be confident that, with the experience of the Minister of State and Minister Dempsey, the changes made will be appreciative of the importance and significance which the local government system will play in the new century as we finish 100 years of service to the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local government reform has been a topical issue for some time.  The level of interest expressed on this matter reflects the importance of this sector in the life of each and every citizen, from the person applying for a local authority house, lodging a local improvement scheme application, applying for a group water scheme grant, and availing of the local authority's waste disposal service or water supply, down to the person borrowing a library book or returning it when it is long overdue.  Local government has a substantial reach and we all come into contact with it each day.  It is, therefore, in all our interests that this sector performs as well as it possibly can.</P>
      <P>The public is a powerful and exacting consumer, demanding new and improved levels of service from all sectors, not least local government. This country is changing rapidly and local government must be able to change with it if it is to survive into the next century.  However, for far too long local government in Ireland has been restricted in its ability to adapt to changing circumstances due to a number of inherent difficulties, including inadequate funding.  This Government is committed to remedying these problems and ensuring that local government assumes its rightful place, centre stage, in the future administration of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for reform and development of the <Col N="425" /> local government sector is not new; some of us have been advocating it for years.  The publication of the Green Paper on local government reform when I was in the Department in the early 1970s is a key example, as is the Barrington report in the early 1990s when my party was in coalition.  The question of local government funding is a critical element of any reforms in this area.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium we clearly outlined our commitment to restoring real power and decision-making to local authorities and local people through a range of measures.  However, I emphasise that these commitments are not being pursued in a vacuum or an ivory tower.  Since his appointment as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey has used every available opportunity to inform the Oireachtas and the local authorities of the problems facing local authorities and the reform measures required.  From the outset last July, he clearly and unambiguously set out the Government's policy on local government renewal to the annual conference of the General Council of County Councils.  He outlined to councillors, the people at the heart of local government, what the Government hoped to achieve in partnership with them, their authorities and representative associations.  I am aware that Members from all sides of this House were there and heard him on that occasion.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has met each of the three local authority associations on a number of occasions and submissions on the renewal of local government have been received from all the associations.  Furthermore, all local authorities were invited to the launch of the new funding system in Athlone last January.  The Minister has also travelled to the majority of county councils and borough corporations and on these occasions has engaged in lengthy and informative discussions with elected members.</P>
    <P>Councillors are continuously being requested for their views.  For example, less than two weeks ago the Minister was present at a conference attended by approximately 500 local public representatives. In an open forum he asked councillors to let him know their views on how they felt the local government system should be renewed. On an ongoing basis the representative associations continue to meet and liaise with the Department on a range of local government matters of mutual interest.  The Minister has also given an open invitation to members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government to let him have their views on how our local government system can best be renewed.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in a substantial, far-reaching and radical programme of local government renewal.  Action is taking place on a number of fronts in areas such as human resources, customer care, efficiency, effectiveness and so on.  We are building on initiatives introduced by the previous <Col N="426" /> Government and bringing forward our own proposals where we feel these are worthwhile and needed.  We did not say we were not prepared to run with ideas just because someone else thought of them first.  We took the view that local government renewal is far too important to us all to become a mere political football.  That is why we wasted no time in developing the strategic policy committees which were proposed by our predecessors. The SPCs will enable councillors to develop council policy in a more meaningful way than heretofore.  It will enable councillors to stand back and see the big picture, the major issues, and they will have the administrative backup to do the job.</P>
    <P>We have also consulted widely in relation to SPCs.  Councillors and a range of interests were represented on a working group which laid the groundwork for guidelines on the establishment and operation of the SPCs.  We issued comprehensive guidance based on the working group's work.  In addition, the Minister held a useful and informative seminar on the SPCs for the cathaoirligh and leas-chathaoirligh of city and county councils.  The seminar was highly participative and resulted in further guidance being issued to local authorities on the operation of these committees. The SPCs are now being set up at local level and consultation will continue.  Later this year a group involving the relevant interests will be established to review and monitor experience of the operation of the SPC system.</P>
    <P>The Minister will soon be bringing forward other elements of the programme of renewal for consideration and approval by the Government. The views of councillors, their associations, authorities and other interested parties will be taken into account.  At the end of the day the Government will have to make its decisions in the light of all the factors and, ultimately, with regard to what it considers can best bring about the renewal which all of us who value local government want.</P>
    <P>The programme will be underpinned by legislation which will consolidate and modernise local government law.  This legislation will be substantial and will, once and for all, end the piecemeal approach of previous decades.  The Bill I am speaking of will be designed not only to draw existing relevant local government legislation together but also to provide for the reform initiatives and to put in place the legislative framework for the local government system of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>One of the major challenges in relation to local government renewal is the provision of a proper funding system.  It is universally accepted that reform of this area is long overdue.  For far too long local government has been denied the resources it needed to do its job properly.  This problem has manifested itself in the current scenario where local authorities are struggling to maintain their existing level of services, to say nothing about expanding or improving the range of services provided.  Another critical drawback <Col N="427" /> with the current funding system is the excessive control which the centre holds on how local authorities spend their money.  This is the result of the way in which the system has evolved over time. A further difficulty is the lack of sufficient focus on value for money.  The current funding system is just not good enough.  If we are serious about local government and local democracy, then we must ensure that local authorities have enough money to get on with the job we expect of them. Otherwise, all other reform proposals will remain merely aspirational.</P>
    <P>The previous Government's proposal in relation to local government funding was not right.  While it provided some additional funding, it was not the answer.  In particular, its proposal that the general purposes expenditure of local authorities would be funded by means of motor tax proceeds was especially flawed as it is wrong in principle to expect any one sector of the community to fund local government.  This was no more than a short term stopgap exercise.  What is now needed is a long-term solution to the problems facing local government.</P>
    <P>To address the weaknesses in the current financing arrangements, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has introduced a Bill to the Dáil which will provide the legislative basis for a new funding system.  The key elements of this new system are the establishment of a statutory local government fund with effect from 1999 and financing non-national road improvements from national motor tax receipts. This statutory local government fund will comprise Exchequer funding and the proceeds of motor taxation.  This system will inject funds of almost £600 million directly into the local authorities. This is a significant achievement, amounting to an increase of £125 million over the amount available when this Government took office last year.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of this initiative.  I am particularly proud of it because I have advocated for years the necessity to put local government funding on a statutory basis.  Its absence has caused the erosion of the effectiveness and efficiency of the local government system and has resulted in its inability to maintain the level of services and to introduce necessary new services and initiatives. It was hamstrung due to lack of funding. This is a necessary and radical change.</P>
    <P>A sum of £270 million will be provided in the Department's Vote in 1999 for the general purpose requirements of local authorities.  It will be ring-fenced in legislation and used solely for local government purposes.  This sum, which will be index-linked for future years &mdash; that is a critical part of this new system &mdash; will take account of the additional expenditure needs of local authorities identified by KPMG in its report, <i>The Financing of Local Government in Ireland.</i> It will also take account of the new functions and responsibilities placed on local authorities over the years without <Col N="428" /> the necessary resources.  The legislation will contain special provisions to ensure that the baseline provision in any year can be altered to reflect any changes in the powers, functions and duties of local authorities.  This is designed to ensure that no additional demands can be placed on local authorities without the matching funding.  That is not the first time the Minister has said this.  He said it in Athlone.  I am surprised to hear Senator Coogan questioning this when the matter has already been explained in the public arena.</P>
    <P>Income from the proceeds of motor tax will be used primarily to fund the non-national roads programme.  This will establish a link between payment and benefit and demonstrate to the motorist that motor tax is being ploughed back into the roads network.  Motoring groups will no longer be able to complain that motor tax is being swallowed up by central government.</P>
    <P>As part of the new funding package motor tax rates will be increased by 3 per cent in 1998 and by a further 3 per cent in 1999.  This proposal is designed to strike a balance between the need to address environmental issues and to recognise the necessity for many people to own cars.  The proposed increases are therefore modest.  For a 1200 cc engine car, this translates into an extra £10 in total &mdash; a minimal amount in the context of the overall cost of driving a car.  To those who say that the motorist is an easy target, it should be noted that motor tax rates have not increased since 1992.  In addition, the extra costs associated with motoring, such as air pollution and traffic management, have increased steadily every year. Furthermore, in an approach designed to reward the more environmentally friendly users of roads, tax rates for buses are being reduced significantly with rates for smaller buses being reduced proportionally more than for larger buses, which tend to emit more pollutants.  Tax rates on taxis will also be reduced.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone think that these measures are restricting local discretion and imposing too much central control, I would like to take this opportunity to refute this allegation and put on the record of this House that these new funding arrangements will do exactly the opposite.  More money means more discretion.  Lack of funding over the past few decades has meant that local authorities have had no real discretion in deciding on their spending priorities.  All they could really do was try to maintain their essential services.  By anyone's standards, this could not be regarded as local discretion or local democracy.  However, by injecting significant additional resources into the local government system, the authorities will now be empowered to extend the quality and range of services they provide.  Empowerment is the key.</P>
    <P>All this extra funding, however, does not come without a price attached.  Newfound wealth must be spent wisely.  If local authorities want to be awarded greater discretion in how they spend their money, they must make, and be seen to make, the best possible use of the resources available <Col N="429" /> to them.  In other words, as local authorities demonstrate that they are achieving greater value for money in service delivery, central control on local authorities will be loosened.</P>
    <P>While local authorities have made considerable efforts to improve their efficiency in recent years more is now needed.  Additional resources and improved efficiency must go hand in hand.  The local government system we all want is one which gives value for money, is efficient and customer oriented.  Local authorities will be required to demonstrate that they are capable of producing quality service at a competitive cost.  To underpin this objective, work is under way in developing new financial and accounting systems for local authorities so that we can measure consistently the costs of providing different services.  This will be completed as soon as possible; only then can we be confident that we are getting full value for money.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are also developing some initial performance indicators so that the efficiency of local authorities can be measured and compared with other local authorities.  We are also, working in partnership with local authorities, exploring new ways of working, eliminating outdated bureaucratic practices and making strides in utilising the best of modern technology.</P>
    <P>An important element of the new funding structure is the need to identify the needs and resources of individual local authorities so that available funds will be distributed equitably. There has long been dissatisfaction in local government about the way in which the old rate support grant system was not fine tuned to respond to changing needs and circumstances. Given the magnitude of the new funding system proposed, the need for a more logical and focused distribution of funds becomes all the more urgent.</P>
    <P>As a result, Galway County Council is currently undertaking a pilot study on its needs and resources &mdash; and those of the other local authorities in Galway &mdash; with a view to developing a model that can be applied to any local authority. It is the intention that this model will identify the various criteria which contribute to higher or lower costs across the various services and to build into the model the capacity of a local authority to raise funds locally.  Once the outline of the model has been developed other local authorities will then become involved to broaden the scope and build in flexibility.  I emphasise that this is a complex project to undertake and it will be some months before a clear picture emerges. However, it is a worthwhile exercise and will set out the parameters for the future.  We need to measure the needs and resources of the various local authorities so that funding can be distributed in a fair manner.</P>
    <P>All these measures will greatly assist local authorities in improving the way in which they do business.  The commercial sector in particular will benefit through, for example, the availability of <Col N="430" /> better infrastructure and the ability of local government to be more responsive on key business issues.  Furthermore, a proper funding system which provides local authorities with a level of resources commensurate with their requirements will enable the Government to put an end to the practice of placing an undue burden on the commercial sector through large increases in rates.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that rates will be capped from 1999.  Details of this proposal will be available later in the year in plenty of time before the authorities adopt their 1999 estimates. However, we will take care to ensure that the rates burden on the commercial sector will be neither excessive nor disproportionate to other sectors of society.  As a result there will be greater certainty in the whole area of local government funding.  The commercial sector will know what it is expected to contribute to local government so that individual businesses can map out their financial commitments and plan accordingly.  A lower rate in the pound and greater stability from year to year will also serve to increase competitiveness.</P>
    <P>To conclude, this is a very exciting time for local government as we set out on an ambitious path designed to ensure that local government reaches its full potential as we approach the new millennium.  Local government deserves ambitious plans which will be followed through.  I am confident the success of these measures will place local government in its rightful place &mdash; centre stage &mdash; in Irish society.  I assure this House that this Government will continue to listen to all those who are interested in developing local government, as it has done since before taking office last year.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly commend this motion, as amended, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am pleased the Government has taken on board some of the initiatives for change in a number of areas in local government formulated by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment in the previous Administration, Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that in this year, 1998, the centenary of the foundation of local government in Ireland, we should be preparing to examine the inadequacies in the local government system.  These inadequacies exist, not because of the people who work in, or are members of, local government but for historical and financial reasons.  I hope there will be a significant change before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, 1998, which is currently before the Oireachtas, is welcome and the area of local government being addressed by that legislation &mdash; funding &mdash; is crucial.  Without a specific designated funding base local government has no power.  The initiative was taken when the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, sought to ring fence motor tax revenue <Col N="431" /> as designated local government funding.  The Department of Finance agreed to this annual funding and even to the flexibility accorded to local authorities to increase it as required.</P>
    <P>That initiative was the key to the changes we are about to see.  I am glad the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has, by and large, accepted the principle that local authority funding be secured through taxation, albeit with the inclusion of funding from the Exchequer.  The key to successful and strong local government is that, to the greatest possible extent, it has access to separate and independent funding that is not dependent on the Exchequer, whose funding can vary with changes of Government or with changes in policy.</P>
    <P>The second major failing in local government has been the ascendancy of the managerial system: the city or county manager makes the decisions, he or she has the clout to do so and is, in effect, an executive in a body that is otherwise elected by the people.  That is not correct.  The Minister makes decisions, not his or her civil servants who advise him or her and implement those decisions.  The Minister, therefore, is responsible for those decisions.</P>
    <P>In local government, however, the majority of key decisions are made by the manager.  These decisions relate to finance, the budget and how it will be spent and critical matters such as planning. This area must be addressed because, by and large, the powers of councillors are being emasculated. They are elected to call the shots on critical issues but do not have the power to so do.  If local government is to have any meaning that problem must be addressed and it can be addressed in many ways.</P>
    <P>As a result of local authorities not having the power to implement local policies, many parallel organisations were developed and funded separately. The ADM and partnership schemes are an example.  They are funded by the Department of the Taoiseach and bypass the local authorities. European money was poured into what were, in effect, parallel organisations which were not elected by or answerable to the people.  However, their brief was to operate within local communities, parallel to the local authorities.  In many instances they were hostile to local authority members and did not welcome councillors' participation in their activities.  That is true of many of the 38 partnerships operating throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Most of them are successful and active and do a great deal of good work.  They provide employment and deal with a range of community activities and amenities.  However, those areas should be within the ambit of the local authority and its elected public represenatives who are answerable to the people and who must go before them periodically for election.  There are other similar organisations such as FÁS, the national training and employment agency, the Leader programmes <Col N="432" /> and county enterprise boards.  These operate to a lesser or greater extent parallel to local authorities in areas within the local authority's responsibility.</P>
    <P>Today I attended a meeting of the General Council of County Councils and it is most concerned that the Minister has an interdepartmental monitoring committee on which it is not represented. Indeed, to my knowledge, LAMA is not represented on the committee either.  If significant changes are to take place, the representative bodies of councillors should be represented on that committee.</P>
    <P>I would like to say more about the SPCs and area committees but there is not sufficient time. The concept of directly elected mayors is good but it was suggested subsequent to the other changes being proposed with regard to SPCs and area committees which would have semi-executive chairpersons who would receive partial remuneration, determine policy and have that policy implemented.</P>
    <P>However, what is envisaged by the Labour Government in Britain is a referendum in the London area on whether there should be a directly elected mayor who would have executive functions, stand for election on his or her manifesto and bring a team into office to implement that policy over the term of office.  The team would then leave office if the mayor was unsuccessful at the next election.  This is based on the American model.  There is a considerable conflict between that model and what is being proposed by the Minister.  The idea is good but it will have to be better researched.</P>
    <P>I am glad this issue is being debated and I hope it will be debated again before the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the debate on this particularly important subject. I support the amendment.  It is time to put on record the fine work being done to bring about necessary changes in local government.</P>
      <P>Everybody is aware of the difficulties experienced by local government over the years.  The major problem has always been funding.  Local authorities have been starved of it for many years.  In that context, I particularly welcome the provisions for extra funding in the Local Government Bill, 1998.  The fact that the extra funding of £125 million is focused on non-capital expenditure means it can be used in the areas which have generated most criticism for local authorities.  It can be used for county roads where it is badly needed.  While there have been attempts to keep national primary roads in reasonable repair, the state of secondary and county roads has been extremely poor, particularly in certain counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old system of funding did not work.  The fact that funding will now be on a statutory basis is one of the most positive moves we have seen for some time.  It is worth bearing in mind that the Leader of the Labour Party was responsible <Col N="433" /> for removing the statutory right to local authority funding, in terms of rates on houses, in 1983.  I welcome the fact that the Government is changing that and returning matters to a statutory footing, which means that local authorities can proceed with necessary work.</P>
    <P>Councillors throughout the country have be criticised in all quarters for not doing a, b or c and that is unfair.  The majority of these people want to bring about a decent system of local government.  They also want to have an input into providing a better environment.  They were not able to do this in the past because of the shortage of funding.  However, a significant increase in that funding will give them the opportunity to do so now.  I welcome the fact that the increase will be kept in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>The old rate support grant was a particular bone of contention in Carlow, the town in which I live.  In the past it suffered badly in comparison with towns of similar size.  For example, the rate support grant received by Clonmel was four to five times that given to Carlow.  The reasons for this are historic and there is no point entering into a debate on them now.  I welcome the fact that the equalisation fund will provide the authorities in smaller towns and counties &mdash; particularly those where road tax is not charged at the same level as in other counties &mdash; with the opportunity to bring about the changes required in their local areas.</P>
    <P>Another important development is the establishment of the strategic policy committees.  In the past too many decisions were made by officials at county council level and it is time we returned to a situation where such decisions take everyone's viewpoint into consideration.  The fact that professional people will have an input into the committees is a positive and worthy development, which was put in place by the previous Government, and it will make significant changes and improvements to the overall structure of local government.  Everyone will now have a say on the direction local government in their area should take.  That is as it should be because that is how local government was originally designed to work.</P>
    <P>Councillors will be able to specialise in areas in which they have a particular interest and they will also be able to draw on expertise in areas in which their knowledge is weak.  The fact that final decisions will be made not by the committees but by the councils provides a necessary safeguard. Local government involves the ability to make decisions and having access to funding to implement such decisions.  The requisite funding and control mechanisms are being put in place to allow these decisions to be made, this is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined in great detail the consultation into which he entered with the various interested bodies.  In the past eight or nine months he has openly consulted and sought the views of everyone with an interest in this area. <Col N="434" /> That is as it should be and such consultations should also be carried out at local government level so that the type of changes required can be brought about.  If we continue to do this and take these proposals on board in a positive way, progress will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I acknowledge his involvement in local government over a long period.  However, the reality is that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has had discussions with the relevant authorities but has not debated this issue in the House with Members, the majority of whom are elected by county and city councillors.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh raised a number of issues about which I do not want to be negative because I have been involved in local government for more than 20 years.  Problems with local government began in 1977.  Some Senators may say they began in 1973 while others believe the abolition of rates in 1975 was the starting point.  However, in my opinion, the elimination of car tax and rates in general in 1977 gave rise to problems with local government and rate grants were reduced accordingly. Local government did not receive the recognition it deserved and the blame for this lies mostly with Fianna Fáil.  We must admit that whether we like it or not.  Having said that, however, these events took place a long time ago.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister of State's contribution and I welcome the positive and constructive ideas it contained.  However, I wish to table a number of specific questions about, for example, the strategic policy committees.  I was privileged to serve as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1991-2.  I am involved in local government and I could speak about it and housing and other policies for the remainder of the evening.  However, I merely want to make one point in respect of local committees.</P>
      <P>I recall trying to obtain permission build a by-pass near Blackpool, County Cork.  The work began with the construction of a road from the Mallow Road to the Sunbeam.  No difficulties were encountered while building the road from the Sunbeam to the Christy Ring Bridge. However, because of the actions of the local committee in Blackpool, the by-pass has not yet reached that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be very careful about strategic policy committees and the people appointed to them. What discussions have been entered into with people who are not councillors in respect of these committees?  With whom has the Minister for the Environment and Local Government been in contact?  Did he contact the chambers of commerce, local community centres and others?  We have been given the impression that everyone must share in the power.  Is the Minister of State saying that people will be paid to sit on policy committees which may never make a decision? That could easily happen.  A perfect example of this occurred in Blackpool in 1991 when I was <Col N="435" /> Lord Mayor of Cork.  I was convinced that I could sort the matter out in six weeks but it has taken seven years for agreement to be reached because the local committee was not satisfied with the design of the road and the bridge leading into Blackpool.  The Minister of State should see the state of Blackpool at present.  It is totally dilapidated because of the actions of a certain group. The policy committees could easily take the same route.</P>
    <P>There are many individuals serving on small committees who believe themselves to be budding Taoisigh.  If they stood for election they would probably not obtain ten votes.  We must be realistic.  Elected representatives must be able to make decisions quickly and not be obliged to wait for months for policy committees to develop ideas.  Let me provide an example.  In 1974 the local authority in Cork city put in place a development plan &mdash; the Minister of State referred to recent developments in Galway but the Cork plan was the first of its kind &mdash; which was eventually implemented in 1979.  The city was allowed to develop because of that long-term plan but the local authority received no credit from central government and was obliged to wait for funding.</P>
    <P>When the strategic policy committees are established who will decide the destination of funding?  Will there be a block grant to a council or will it be an allocation on the basis of perceived performance or because the Minister comes from a certain area?  It is the case that in the past certain areas received more funds than others because Ministers hailed from there.  One can land a jumbo jet in certain parts of County Mayo and one town has a fire station bigger than any in London.  I do not make such points lightly but they are facts.</P>
    <P>Where will the money go?  Will it be allocated by certain people?  Who will it be?  Will public representatives or local representatives be on the committee?  Will the funding be on the basis of a block grant or allocations?  The responsibility should be given to local councillors and if they do not do it right they can be denied funds the next time around.  The Minister of State's address was welcome and constructive, but he did not indicate how the disbursal of funds will be arranged.  That is not fair.  I want the whole truth so that we may have a real debate.  Who will be involved?</P>
    <P>There is a landfill site in Cork city which will cost £5 million to run this year.  We take all the refuse from the county but get nothing for it.  We provide a fire service in the city which is used by the county and we get £330,000 from the county council.  The regional authorities have little authority. I accept Senator Walsh's point that a public representative cannot chair an enterprise board. However, Fianna Fáil set up the enterprise boards and made the arrangements.  The decline of local government started in 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> I welcome the Minister of State's proposals but I would like a little more openness about where the total £600 million will be spent.  Is he prepared to give all councils a block grant?  I could give many examples of how money was spent stupidly on housing in Cork and in other cities and of allocations to voluntary organisations.  That should stop.  There should be proper funding supervised properly.  The Minister of State said that we must keep a close eye on spending, but who will do so? A lot of money is to be spent and it should be spent properly.</P>
    <P>However, the people should not be wronged. Recognition for the dedication and commitment given by many councillors is long overdue.  I do say that because I am elected by them.  They deserve great credit because they have achieved much with very little resources.  However, they have not received the recognition they deserve. They are marvellous people.  The Minister of State indicated that he would like some people to retire and he may be prepared to give them an inducement not to stand for re-election.  Perhaps they may be a little elderly and slow on their feet, but there is a lot to be said for realism and &ldquo;cop on&rdquo;.  He should not be in a rush to get rid of people because their experience and expertise may prove useful.  They deserve more than they get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's address for the importance of the points he raised.  Senator Cregan referred to the events of 1977.  At that time there was a political auction and the people chose the Fianna Fáil option, not the Fine Gael one which might have left us in a far worse position.</P>
      <P>The creation of strategic policy committees is a move in the right direction.  We look forward to giving the local authorities real power.  The SPCs will make recommendations to the local authorities and we must be prepared to listen to organisations who have interests in local development. I am sure they will work with public representatives. At present they co-operate on enterprise boards and Leader groups.</P>
      <P>There are many development organisations, such as ADM, enterprise boards and Leader groups, and they should be brought together under the remit of the SPCs.  There is too much overlap in many counties and the greater part of the finance allocated to some of the groups is taken up with administration.  That does not help job creation or economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the enterprise boards. Irrespective of who introduced them, it is wrong that they cannot be chaired by an elected public representative.  That provision should be changed. I attended a committee meeting of an enterprise board recently when the chair and vice chair, among others, were absent and the four elected members who were present, three of whom were previous local authority chairpersons, were unable to chair the committee. <Col N="437" /> As outlined by the Minister of State, funds will be made available from the Department.  Car tax will increase by about 6 per cent in two years but I do not think motorists will mind paying 6 per cent more over two years given the road improvements that will be made and the funding being put to good use.  The Minister of State's point about value for money is very important.  It is an issue that must be tackled, although that may not be the most popular thing for a local authority member to say.  I compliment the Department on taking on the issue.  With training and advice many local authority employees will change.  They will improve and I have no doubt that they are well capable of giving better service and value for money.</P>
    <P>Over the years local authorities have had to take on many services involving spending outlays, including litter problems, the control of dogs, veterinary inspections and the control of horses. Charges for those services were handed down from Government to local authorities without any further funding being provided.  We were supposed to make do with our previous allocation. As the Minister has outlined, we will now receive extra funding for any further services we have to provide and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>Some local authority members are concerned about how we will work with strategic policy committees. In the past local authority members have worked well with professional people on health boards and vocational education committees.  An excellent service has been provided by such bodies. I have no doubt that elected public representatives will work well in future with the SPCs.</P>
    <P>After 100 years of service by local authorities, we are going in the right direction.  We will see major improvements and contributions by many of the voluntary bodies that will be involved in the strategic policy committees.  I hope they will be particularly relevant to the counties and the needs of bodies that represent different areas working in harmony with elected members.</P>
    <P>I commented earlier that I was annoyed and concerned about the position concerning enterprise boards and I hope the Minister will take on board my views.  If necessary, some changes may have to be made to the legislation to enable public representatives to chair enterprise boards.  It is not that public representatives want to chair such boards but I see no good reason for not allowing them do so.</P>
    <P>The provision of subventions for retiring county councillors was referred to.  Councillors who have served for many years should receive a small financial recompense should they decide not to run for re-election.  Some people may well wish to continue but, through some misfortune, may be unseated.  It would be hard luck on those people if they lose out on some payment.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and I compliment the Minister of State on his statement to the House which contained many salient points.</P>
    <Col N="438" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has been very generous in the time he has devoted to debates in this House.  As a former Minister for Local Government, he is well aware of how the system has chugged along to date, with all its inadequacies.  Now that he is at the coal face he will be in a position to right many of the wrongs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, was a brave man to put himself in the firing line in Rosslare.  I was there, as were many Members of the House.  The debate is an appropriate one because most of us are councillors and we attend functions of LAMA and the General Council of County Councils.  At the LAMA event, the Minister remained for two hours of questioning and it was interesting to see the way in which many issues were teased out there.  Whatever the differences between both sides of the House, it is healthy because we are all striving for the best and only good can come from it.  While I did not like all the answers the Minister gave to his questioners in Rosslare, I know he meant well.  He spoke with conviction about matters and gave his own point of view rather forcefully.</P>
      <P>We are talking about best practice, best structures and operating in the most efficient manner possible.  It is about projecting a new image for local government, which at present is staid and almost stale.  That image is not truly deserved but there is a need for change which both the Minister and his Department wish to bring about. Hopefully, where there are differences there will be room for manoeuvre and amendments.  We must put right the democratic deficit which exists in local government structures and we must ensure the primacy of politics.  Both sides of the House are keen to achieve that.</P>
      <P>We must get the financing right.  What the Minister is proposing is exciting.  Next year all motor taxation will be put together in one £270 million fund which will be ring fenced and index linked.  With motor tax increasing, the fund will grow &mdash; whatever the wisdom of increasing that tax by 3 per cent.  I appreciate the Minister's point that motor tax has not been touched for quite some time.</P>
      <P>We await with great interest the details of how it will be broken down but the control of money has been, and is, too centralised.  Local authorities cannot do the work they should be doing because of the way the Department operates.  It is not the Minister's fault but the system has been like that for too long.  I am glad we are addressing change. Hopefully, what emerges from this will project a much better image of the system.  More importantly, it will be better for the consumer, the customer and the ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the idea of one-stop-shops. Depending on size, population and the number of towns, counties will have to decide how many such shops are right for them.  They must provide value for money as well as being efficient and customer <Col N="439" /> oriented.  Nothing but the best will do and I hope that will be the case.</P>
    <P>The accounting systems within local government are totally antiquated.  The Minister said that new financial and accounting systems are being worked on and will be brought forward. That is an important matter if we are to be efficient and cost effective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the SPCs because they cover the main functions of the local authority.  It is a much more structured and inclusive approach to policy formulation.  This structured approach will confine the area committees to dealing with representational and maintenance issues and the SPCs to dealing with policy formulation.  I welcome the fact that councillors will be involved from the beginning in policy issues and that the director of services and other staff will have the proper back-up to do the job properly.  This has been lacking in the past.</P>
    <P>Regarding sectoral interests, I do not share the fears expressed by some of my colleagues.  They will not make up more than one-third of SPCs. We must be open to fresh ideas and the differences in approach which they will bring.  The interchange of views with electoral representatives will be a good thing because they are often impatient in not understanding the system and <i>vice versa.</i> I welcome the involvement of representatives from the farming and business groups.  I believe we are all capable of working well together.  I also welcome the capping of rates because the business community and the ratepayer, who has been the main funder of local government, has had too much uncertainty in the past.  That greater certainty will be good for business and ratepayers and result in a greater respect and understanding of the local government system, particularly the local authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest challenges will be to the county manager system and to managers and officials generally.  Managers have inherited a system whereby they are almost expected to be feudal overlords.  I welcome the fact that councillors will be in a position to initiate policy with the manager and have a good working relationship. There was a recent case where a two acre car park needed to be developed and a deputy manager got certain ideas and caused a prospectus to be issued.  However, there was no consultation with councillors, a section 83 notice with 19 conditions had to come before us and there was a unanimous decision against the development. Perhaps the situation could have been avoided if there had been consultation.</P>
    <P>Local government has an extensive spread in the community.  The councillor is intimately involved in all aspects and I welcome him moving to centre stage.  However, I believe councillors are over-worked and do not have any assistance by way of research or back-up.  I accept they will have assistance under the new system about which there has been unjustified media criticism <Col N="440" /> when councillors have tried to learn about different systems, particularly the landfill question.  I am sure the Minister will give proper consideration to the remuneration package for councillors whereby those who choose to retire after a long and dedicated service will receive a decent tax free annuity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and support the amendment to the motion.  I recognise the Minister's background and his interest in local authorities.  In the past the local government system was seen as a breeding ground for future TDs and Senators and was never given proper attention.  In 1983 the Labour Party abolished statutory financial obligations in lieu of the rates support grant.  This diminished the finances of local authorities and did not enhance the future role of local authorities.  In 1952 the national road funds were used for social welfare payments and so on.  This did not enhance the funding of local authorities.  I welcome the fact that the previous Minister and the present Minister and Government have shown a genuine interest in improving the whole concept of local government and the role of local government representatives. Decisions taken by future Ministers for Local Government will need to be extremely responsible because of the long-term financing of local government and the need to work in tandem with the development now proposed.  The role of local government can be underpinned by the recent decision to provide it with its own finances within the county while at the same time supporting it from central government.  This will provide a great opportunity to expand and improve services within each local authority.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, have played a consultative role in the area of local government development.  There has been a tremendous consultative base, with visits to each county, national seminars, county council groups being involved in discussions and openness by the Government and present Ministers in dealing with this matter. Today we debated the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill and all of this will have a bearing on how councillors take on this new role. It is fair to say that there may have been dissatisfaction with county councils and local authorities in the past but it was relative to the extent that central government respected them.  In the past local authorities were not given the respect they deserved by central government; they were allocated a certain sum of money which often fell short of their requirements, but they had to be satisfied with that.  I believe that attitude has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of county planning was discussed today at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government.  The concept of local representatives is underpinned by the SPCs, which provides a challenge.  Elected <Col N="441" /> representatives were annoyed at the legislation which underpinned the partnership boards because it undermined their prominence.  Elected representatives have no right to dominate the functions of these groups.  However, the principle of committees which did not allow the participation of elected representatives was contrary to the development of local democracy.  It is not good for local groups to work separately from elected representatives and it is not conducive to good planning.  The changes proposed are constructive &mdash; they should work well and they will be positive for partnership.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said about value for money and control.  While I support the work of county council staff and management, I believe greater value for money can be achieved.  There should be bigger yardsticks for the way money is spent on roads.  In the partnership context this will lead to strong customer satisfaction, which is the key to the success of local authorities.  If those living in villages and towns know their needs are considered in the development of the county, they will participate, knowing they are getting the service they require.</P>
    <P>The Government is right to cap rates. However, it has to allow county councils and local authorities to have the freedom to raise the necessary funds.  I welcome the statutory funding for 1999 which underpins the local authority structure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment to the motion and the Minister's statement.  The more flexibility, trust and authority county councillors and elected representatives are given, the more it will lead to greater statutory powers for county councillors and a more active role for them in the development and function of their councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  I support the reform of local government and the desire to make it more successful and more responsive to the public.  Local government has always been the poor relation in our democracy and all parties must share the blame for that.  The history books will show how certain decisions affected local democracy, from the abolition of rates in 1977 to water charges in 1997. I hope the reforms of car tax and those designed to ring fence finance for local government will work.  I look forward to renewal and regeneration of local government across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Chambers said, there is a need for a more client centred and responsive approach in local government.  Standards of responsiveness vary across the country, depending on the level of management at local authority level.  There are problems with responsiveness, as well as lack of finance.  The development of alternative structures, such as partnerships, is a reflection of a desire among people to be heard and to see the needs of their areas reflected.  To a large extent, local government has been unable to respond to <Col N="442" /> this.  As a result, we have seen the development of other layers of democracy.</P>
    <P>I hope the development of the SPCs will be successful.  I hope to see a greater level of consultation in north Tipperary and more time given to dialogue between local community groups and the local authority.  There needs to be more information and a greater level of dialogue to develop the SPCs.  The utilisation of the dynamic energy of local community and voluntary groups could transform local government.  The Minister will probably agree that this will only happen if there is a genuine exchange of views.  Councillors must listen to community groups and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>When I was on the Seanad election trail in Dublin, a member of South Dublin County Council remarked on the amount of money given to the Tallaght partnership.  The councillor was concerned that this was becoming larger than the amount of Exchequer funding given to South Dublin County Council.  The funding for South Dublin County Council was openly accounted for &mdash; although I am not suggesting the money given to the Tallaght partnership was not.  The councillor said that from an objective point of view, the members of the partnership were not elected but were managing an enormous fund on behalf of the community.  There is a certain level of tension between partnerships and struggling councils.</P>
    <P>I hope the spirit of the SPCs will energise local authorities and ensure the community plays a role in the transformation of local government.  A great deal needs to be done.  Some local authorities are good at taking the initiative in the development of their county.  The local authority in north Tipperary could do more in that regard. We have huge issues to deal with and the county council, as one of the major players, must take a leadership rather than a purely bureaucratic role. It must provide a service to the community, listen to councillors and market the county by spotting opportunities for development.</P>
    <P>County councils must listen to the public, who are their clients.  As public representatives, we know the frustration felt by people about roads, water and basic services.  They feel they are not listened to, even though this is simple to achieve. I hope the Freedom of Information Act and other initiatives designed to create greater accountability will work in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House and look forward to his response. <Col N="443" /> A constituent of mine asked me to raise this matter specifically with the Minister.  The Minister has had correspondence with the man involved.  I know he does not comment on individual cases but I will deal with an issue that arises from this case.</P>
      <P>This man's daughter was murdered in 1992.  She was a nurse, a young woman in the prime of life who was brutally taken from her family.  Their lives were shattered by this event and will never be the same again.  We cannot under-estimate or even properly describe the extent of the distress felt by them since the murder of their daughter.  I spoke to the man and I am aware of the level of suffering he endures and will continue to endure. Recently, this man has taken to telephoning the prison where his daughter's murderer is held; the offender was sentenced to life imprisonment.  The man rings every year because he feels strongly that he and his family, as victims, have a right to be consulted in the event of the release of this offender but, currently, they have no voice.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out a number of facts in a letter to my constituent earlier this year.  After seven years an offender can have his sentence reviewed by the sentence review group which advises him in regard to the administration of long-term sentences. He then set out the following factors which are taken into account when determining the length of sentence: the potential risk the offender poses to the public; the nature of the offence committed; behaviour while in prison; recommendations made by the sentence review group; the views of the Garda and the trial judge and compassionate grounds.</P>
      <P>However, there is no reference to the views of the family of the victim or to compassion for those left behind in the wake of the horrible deeds of the offender.  The letter caused considerable distress to my constituent and I know that was not the Minister's intention but he, and many others like him, are suffering life sentences silently. They, unfortunately, do not have a sentence review group to look at their cases or to restore their lives to them.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister take this man's pain, and that of many others, into account?  Is it not time we gave victims' families recognition for their suffering? Victim impact studies have been introduced in some cases.  This week we heard graphic descriptions of how one serious offender wrecked lives but we also know &mdash; and psychologists confirm this &mdash; that being included is extremely important in the healing process for victims as they feel they have been acknowledged and that the court which represents the public hears them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituent feels alienated and isolated that he is not heard.  I know the Minister does not want that situation to continue and I appeal to him to find a way in the legal system to hear the voice of the victim and, in particular, to take into account the fact this family knows the person who murdered their daughter could be released back <Col N="444" /> into the public.  A group will review that sentence at some stage and the family will not be allowed to be part of that process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sentence review group was established by the then Minister for Justice in 1989 to advise on the administration of long-term prison sentences.  It is a non-statutory body. All offenders who have served a term of seven years or more of a current sentence, including life sentences, but excluding offenders serving sentences for capital murder, may, if they so wish, apply to have their cases considered by the group.</P>
      <P>The members of the group who are all appointed by the Minister include a representative of the medical/psychiatric profession, a person with experience of supervision or aftercare of discharged persons, a senior officer of the Probation and Welfare Service and a representative of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is important to remember that the group is an advisory body only and that the Minister at all times retains the final discretion regarding the recommendations the group makes.  The Minister can accept them in their entirety, in part or reject them.</P>
      <P>I accept that serious consideration must, of course, always be given to the sensitivities and concerns of the victims of crime in all areas of the treatment of offenders.  The concerns of victims have been taken into account in the past by the group in considering cases and this has been reflected in the recommendations and the decisions that were made.  Officials of my Department have also met with victims' families on occasion and recorded their views.  This is a welcome development and one I wish to see continuing in the context of the overall question of sentence administration and management.</P>
      <P>The possible effect on victims is, as the Senator correctly pointed out, an extremely important consideration.  In certain cases where an early release might pose potential difficulties for a victim's family, such as where a serious offender is likely to come into contact with his/her victim's family in the community, efforts are made to prevent this by making it a condition of the offender's release that he or she does not reside in or go near a particular area.</P>
      <P>All cases of serious risk offenders are carefully managed and the approach to these cases is kept under continuous scrutiny and review in my Department in consultation with prison governors and the Garda.  Many victims of crime choose to try to put their unfortunate experience behind them and some move to a new area.  If the victims have moved away or not maintained contact with the prosecuting gardaí it could be difficult to contact them.  It could also be distressing for them to be reminded of an event they have tried to forget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of those convicted of murder and serving life imprisonment do, however, eventually reach the stage in their sentence where <Col N="445" /> the management of their sentence requires consideration of rehabilitative measures, including such steps as occasional temporary release to attend workshops or educational facilities outside the prison environment.  Where this happens, in the case of a person convicted of murder, special conditions may be attached which take into account the genuine concerns of the victim's family. Before authorising a prisoner's release the following factors are considered: would the release constitute a threat to the community.  Is it reasonable to grant temporary release at this stage in view of the nature of the crime committed?  Does the offender merit temporary release having regard to behaviour while in prison?  Are there any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration?</P>
    <P>Offenders who are serving an indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment would be subject to the supervision of my Department after their eventual release.  This supervision is carried out on behalf of my Department by the Probation and Welfare Service.  In all such cases, there is the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour.  In the event that he or she misbehaves or comes to the attention of the authorities for any breach of his or her temporary release conditions, he or she may be arrested without warrant and taken back into custody without the need for fresh proceedings and may be held in custody thereafter at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the needs of victims will continue to be a significant part of my agenda for improvements in the criminal justice system. An Action Programme for the Millennium indicates that the needs of victims must be central and action by the Government is ongoing in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>The conference on the victims of crime, held in Dublin Castle last December, was an initiative of mine to ensure that everybody with an interest in the area could meet in a spirit of productive co-operation to examine the best way forward in helping victims of crime.  Building on this consultative process and, in order to copperfasten high standards of support and protection for crime victims, I will be publishing a new charter for victims of crime later this year.</P>
    <P>My Department provides financial support for the Irish Association for Victim Support.  Facilities for the association are also provided in all major courthouse building projects.  The National Crime Forum, on which there is a representative of the Irish Association for Victim Support, has been sitting in public over a number of weeks since 26 February 1998.  The aim of the forum is to give interested parties, including victims and their families, an opportunity to make their views known to policy makers in the criminal justice area.  There are also plans to establish a permanent community based crime council later in the year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that while there is no formal mechanism in place to obtain <Col N="446" /> the views of a victim's family on the question of temporary release, the fact is that such views, when made known, are always taken into account.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the points made by the Senator and assure her that I will consider them carefully. I sympathise with the families of all victims, including the one referred to by the Senator.  If she wishes to discuss any particular case I would be glad to arrange a meeting for her with myself or the relevant officials.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for discussion on the Adjournment and for the fact that he selects a fair share of matters in regard to County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  My request is a simple but urgent one which requires his Department's careful consideration.  My matter refers to the need for a resource teacher to be appointed to four schools which share one complex in Cashel, County Tipperary.  The schools are very successful and teachers, parents and students alike can be very proud of their record.</P>
      <P>An assessment was carried out approximately 12 months ago in regard to the need for a resource teacher and it was pointed out that 26 pupils were badly in need of this service; the number has risen since then.  It was hoped that a resource teacher would be appointed but those hopes did not come to fruition which was a source of great disappointment.  An inspector who visited the school recently identified the fact that the need for a resource teacher still exists.</P>
      <P>It would relieve a great deal of stress for many people if a resource teacher could be appointed in Cashel.  Great hardship is being caused because some people have to travel up to 20 miles to avail of the service.  The Minister is aware that the figure of 26 students is way above that required for the appointment of one teacher.  I urge him to give this case serious consideration.</P>

      <P>In March 1997 the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation for the following school year.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-8 school year and included 26 resource teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to the allocation of resource teacher posts are made following the collection and analysis of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate. The posts are then allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to allocate a resource teacher to St. John the Baptist school last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> The Minister for Education and Science has to consider demands for improved services across a wide range of special needs.  It is unfortunately the case that he is not always in a position to meet all of these demands.  The Minister must identify priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.  He is currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource <Col N="448" /> teacher service, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource teacher allocation which may be undertaken.</P>
