      <P>I have notice from Senator Ridge that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take immediate steps to ensure that young childen are not endangered when accompanying their parents or guardians who are selling <i>The Big Issues</i> magazine at major traffic intersections in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ó Murchú of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to give favourable consideration to the request of the County Tipperary Historical Society to take into State care the listed national monument known as the Warhouse, Farrenrory, Ballingarry, Thurles, County Tipperary; 29 July 1998 marks the 150th anniversary of the Young Ireland rebellion which culminated in this building, also known as the Widow McCormack's house.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the need for additional accommodation at St.  Margaret's national school, Curracloe, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to install an upgraded sewerage system in Kilkee for environmental and public health reasons and particularly in view of the expansion currently taking place under the holiday resort scheme, and the increased population over the tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Ridge and Ó Murchú as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doyle and Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is items 2, 3 and 14, motion 17.  Item 2 is to be taken without debate.  Item 14, motion 17, will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. The debate on item 3 will resume after 8 p.m. if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I express heartfelt sympathy to the families of the two young men killed last night in County Armagh. This incident fills us with horror, outrage and anger.  Two young friends having a quiet drink were shot down by people whose only intention is to destroy the peace process.  As democrats, let us hope this terrible event will galvanise those involved in the peace process to renew their efforts not to allow small obstacles or contrived disagreements stand in the way of reaching a settlement which can be put to the people on schedule.  I express my support and solidarity for the Government's efforts at this terrible moment.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for taking item 2 today.  I look forward to having this business dispatched in a short time.  Will the Leader inquire if the advice of the Attorney General in respect of this matter could be made available to those interested in it? There is one common concern on all sides of the House with regard to this issue, namely, to have it resolved as speedily and as satisfactorily as possible.  This is not a question of scoring party political points.  It would be widely appreciated if the Attorney General's advice could be made available.  Will the Leader also give an indication of the business with which the House will be dealing in the coming weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first occasion I visited Central America I recall trying to make sense of the assassinations which took place there.  A local trade union leader explained the nature of the terrorism to me and stated that people were shot to terrorise others.  Those carrying out such acts had lost all logic and sense.  I support the comments made by Senator Manning which I am sure reflect the views of all Members.  The fact that people having a quiet drink or someone selling chips at the side of the road have become the subject of violent acts carried out by those who want or do not want to make certain political changes is extraordinary.  Everyone must be saddened by these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night's tragedy makes us realise that, even when we believe we have reached the end of what terrorists can do to cause outrage and shock, they will always do something else for which there is no logic or sense and which does not fit into any <Col N="707" /> political objective.  Two further lives have been lost due to an extraordinary method used by those who want to get their own way.  There can be no place in Ireland for those who support the view that violence can be used to attain political or other ends or improve society.  I am delighted by the unequivocal response of certain members of the northern Unionist population on this issue. The message from every quarter should be the same, namely, that such acts will always be wrong, regardless of the identity of those who carry them out and that everyone should con-demn them.  No one should have problems expressing that view clearly but if they have, they should question their involvement in the political process.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader for finally restoring the Adoption (No. 2) Bill to the Order Paper.  It is nice that I can thank him for doing this rather than arguing that it should be restored.  I would also like access to the Attorney General's view on this, if it is not written into the memorandum to Government.</P>
    <P>I take it the Bill will be reintroduced on Report Stage.  Standing Orders allow various approaches to be taken.  I have no problem with the Bill being reintroduced on Report Stage because there is only one item with which we have difficulty and it can be changed on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Manning and O'Toole in expressing strong condemnation of what took place in Poyntzpass yesterday.  It is beyond belief that two innocent people of different religions who were drinking together were gunned down in cold blood by such violent and evil people.  We will not be deflected from finding a peaceful, agreed and equitable solution which can be put to the Irish people North and South and to which we hope they will assent freely.  That must send a powerful message to these evil people.  We will not tolerate violence or its threat in the pursuit of that process.</P>
      <P>I also wish to express sympathy to Senator Hanafin on the death of his sister.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the school transport system? It faces many problems.  The debate should allow for discussion on the need for funds for the proper supervision of students.  Many students have to wait for long periods for buses on which they are often unsupervised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate at an early date on the survey of young people's views produced today by the National Youth Council? The views expressed in the report are relevant to the business of the House and we should take account of them when we consider <Col N="708" /> legislation, particularly with regard to unemployment, drug abuse and other issues affecting young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into this House in 1981 at the time of the hunger strikes and I wonder how the cycle of events has continued in the North.  It is time for everybody in Northern Ireland to move on.  There are only two ways to go &mdash; one cannot stand still and, therefore, either Northern Ireland moves on to something new or it goes backwards.  Last nights events were a deliberate attempt to attack a village which has a mixed community.  It was not an attack on Catholics or Protestants, rather it was an attack on the principle that people with different religious and political views can live in harmony.</P>
      <P>It is time for all elected representatives in Northern Ireland to talk to one another.  If that does not happen it will leave gaps in society for the people who carried out last night's attack.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for another debate on road safety and to ensure the relevant Minister is present for it? More people were killed on the roads in 1997 than any year in the preceding decade.  Road deaths per head of population here are double that of Great Britain and the Netherlands; that is not acceptable.  It is time we got together to see if new ideas can be generated to try to offset this frightening problem, which is intolerable for every right minded citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I again call for a debate on the sale of State assets &mdash; the ICC, ACC and TSB.  While I appreciate they were referred to during the debate on the Appropriation Bill, 1997, a debate is needed to specifically deal with these sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support other Senators who spoke about the atrocious double murder in the North last night, but we should try to be as positive as possible.  The most significant occurrence was the joint visit by David Trimble and Seamas Mallon who refused to allow this horrible deed to drive a wedge between them.  Speaking as a member of the Church of Ireland, I repudiate totally the right of these people to use the words &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; or &ldquo;loyalist&rdquo;.  They seem to have no concept of religion, decency or loyalty and we should not permit them to get away with using these otherwise decent and honourable terms.  I was sickened by the much smaller and less tragic but nonetheless significant bombing of an integrated school by the so-called Irish National Liberation Army.  Education was discussed during the debate on the Employment Equality Bill, 1997.  Where are these people coming from? I know where I would like them to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks on the dreadful killings in the North. Unfortunately, it is just adds to the very long list of victims since partition.  Will the Leader arrange an immediate debate on the settling of travellers? The Minister will bring a Bill before the House, but it is essential that in advance of this a debate be held on the various issues.  It is timely in view of the difficulties in which gardaí found themselves last week in Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy for Senator Hanafin on the death of this sister.  I wish also to be associated with the remarks of Senators Manning, O'Toole, Dardis, Brendan Ryan, Norris and Walsh in regard to the killings in Northern Ireland yesterday.  Everything that can be done to bring these people to justice will be done and it only increases our determination.  As Senator Ryan said, all political parties and politicians should be speaking to each other.</P>
      <P>The question of business for the coming weeks was raised.  Next Thursday we will debate the Central Bank Bill, 1997, while on Friday the Adoption (No. 2) Bill &mdash; Report and Final Stages, will be before the House.  We will not sit during St.  Patrick's week.  During the following week, the Finance and Social Welfare Bills will be discussed over four days.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and O'Toole raised the matter of seeking advice from the Attorney General in regard to item 2.  I will check if this is possible and come back to the Senators over the coming days.  Senator McDonagh called for a debate on school transport and this will be facilitated. Senator Cox sought a debate on the survey published today about national youth.  I will be only too pleased to assist the Senator in this regard. Senator Coogan called for a debate on education. I will be able to make time available, but not for at least three or four weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill asked for a debate on road safety.  I fully agree with this and since the Progressive Democrats will have Private Members' time soon we may be able to facilitate the Senator in the coming weeks.  Senator Burke called for another debate on the sale of the State banks, ACC, ICC and the TSB.  I will see what I can do in this regard.  Since the Finance Bill will be before us the week after St.  Patrick's Day and the Minister will be here for it, there will be an opportunity to discuss this.  Many views were expressed about the sale of these banks on the Appropriation Bill debate.  Senator Walsh asked for a debate on the settlement of travellers and I will be able to facilitate his request.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are linked because amendment No. 1 deals with the commencement provisions of the Bill and is drafted on the assumption that the other amendments, which insert new sections to the Bill, will be accepted.  Section 2(2) as it stands provides that the Bill when enacted or any provisions of it will come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This type of provision is standard and is intended to allow time for the necessary arrangements to be made before particular sections are brought into force.  However, a number of my amendments to insert new sections are stand alone provisions for which no time lapse is either necessary or desirable before they are brought into force, and the purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure that these provisions come into operation once the legislation is enacted.  On reviewing this matter, I also concluded that there was no reason the existing sections 30 and 31, which contain technical amendments to our extradition legislation, should not also be brought into force immediately on enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the other amendments which make substantive changes to the Bill which, as I have explained, it is desired to bring into force without the need for a commencement order to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 12 relate to the nomination of judges under particular legislation. The House will be aware that difficulties arose last year on the nomination of judges for the purpose of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  Under that Act, periods of detention <Col N="711" /> have to be approved by a judge of the District Court or of the Circuit Court.  However, a judge of the District Court was defined in the Act as the President of the District Court and any other judge of the District Court nominated for the purposes of this Act by the President of the District Court.  I mentioned on Second Stage that I proposed to amend the Act to allow all judges of the District Court to exercise powers under it.  This is being achieved by amendment No. 12 which will delete the definition of judge of the District Court contained in the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>A related issue arises in relation to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, which provided that judges of the District Court assigned to the Dublin metropolitan district and nominated by the President of the District Court for the purposes of the Extradition Act, 1965, will have jurisdiction to hear extradition matters.  I understand that the President has nominated all judges of the Metropolitan District for these purposes and in the light of experience in relation to the nomination requirement under the 1996 Act, I believe it would be appropriate to delete the nomination requirement to which I have referred.  Accordingly, under amendment No. 10, all judges of the District Court assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan District will, by law and without any nomination requirement, have jurisdiction in extradition matters.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment to tidy up a numbering defect which has come to notice in the Criminal Justice Act, 1983, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.  Section 2(b) of the 1997 Act substituted two new subsections for section 4(5) of the 1984 Act dealing with provisions in relation to detention.  However, the manner in which this was done involved substituting new subsections (5) and (6) for the old subsection (5), but there was already a subsection (6).  The net effect is that section 4 of the 1984 Act has two subsections numbered (6).  While there appears little doubt that the courts, notwithstanding this, would be able to give effect to the will of the Oireachtas in these provisions, as the matter has been brought to my attention I am taking the opportunity provided by this Bill to renumber the subsections involved as (5) and (5)(a).</P>
    <P>The final substantive amendment &mdash; amendment No. 13 &mdash; deals with the abolition of the year and a day rule.  Again, I mentioned on Second Stage that I would be bringing the amendment forward.  The effect of the common law rule involved is that for a prosecution for murder or manslaughter to be maintained, the death must take place within a year and a day of the wrong done by the accused.  As I indicated to the House previously, I regard the rule, particularly in the light of medical advances, as an anachronism and it is in this context that I am proposing its abolition.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 proposes changes in the Long Title of the Bill to take into account the <Col N="712" /> changes made by the amendments I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>In summary, these amendments relate to the commencement provisions of the Bill, the nomination requirement for judges of the District Court under particular legislation, a technical amendment in relation to the numbering of a section of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the abolition of the year and a day rule and a consequential amendment to the Long Title of the Bill.  These amendments are worthwhile and I hope the House will support them.</P>

    <P>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the value of drugs and with offences relating to the possession of drugs valued at £10,000 or more.  This poses a difficulty as to how the value of any consignment of drugs is arrived at.  The Bill states that evidence will be given in court by a person or persons with knowledge, that is, gardaí or customs officers.  That will be blown to pieces in court.  There is no market for drugs in the sense of the marketplace as we understand it.  It is regulated by supply and demand which can vary from place to place.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister did not insert value by weight and draw a distinction between soft and hard drugs.  A value by weight is objective and tangible.  Accusing someone of having a consignment of drugs worth £10,000 or more and giving them a minimum sentence of ten years will not stand up and will be open to successful challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connor that the nub of the question is mandatory sentencing as a philosophical concept.  The area has many dangers and is likely to be ineffective in reducing crime.  One is assuming these kind of criminals make a rational choice, tot up the odds and decide not to engage in an activity because the penalty is at a certain level.  This is extremely expensive.  If we want to put people away for a long period of time, we ought to bear in mind it costs £46,000 a skull to keep them in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may also have unjust complications.  My colleague, Senator Costello, asked me to move some amendments on his behalf if he is not present so I will put some preliminary markers down at this stage.  There is a manifest unfairness that somebody caught with £9,999 worth of heroin can avoid jail altogether but someone with £1 more may go to jail for ten years.  There is an enormous gap.  When a limit is set, some people will be <Col N="713" /> deemed to be treated arbitrarily and unfairly. However, this section indicates the capacity for unfairness in the system.</P>
    <P>For that reason, some of Senator Costello's amendments will propose to instil a degree of flexibility.  It is dangerous that there is no flexibility in this section.  If juries are involved in these cases, they may not want to convict because they are aware the judge has no room for manoeuvre. If there is a fluid majority-minority situation, the jury may decide it does not want to convict because the sentence is too harsh even though it has a strong inkling the person involved is guilty.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has done some good work, although I occasionally tease it.  We must recognise this and not dismiss the patient work it has done.  I refer in particular to the discussion paper it produced during the year called <i>Tackling Crime</i> which shows a more sensitive approach to the issues, expresses a commitment to basic research and places a firm emphasis on consultation, co-ordination and review.  I hope the progressive and more sensitive attitude of this document will be borne in mind and the Minister will consider the proposed amendments.</P>
    <P>I know Senator Connor opened a discussion on the section.  I made these philosophical points as a preamble to the argument which will be made either by Senator Costello or me.  I know the Minister takes rational argument on board and I hope my argument is sufficiently rational to merit his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will deal with the points raised by Senator O'Connor.  The question of values is defined in section 15A(5) as inserted by section 4.  The new section 15A(3) allows evidence on value to be given by customs and excise officers.  It is clear from the legislation that in assessing the value of drugs during a case, the court will be allowed to hear evidence on the market value of drugs from a garda or an officer of the customs and excise, whom the court is satisfied has knowledge about the unlawful sale or supply of drugs.  The court is empowered to decide what weight to give that evidence.</P>
      <P>I accept the argument that this ten year mandatory sentence is a tough one.  I do not accept the argument that because a specific value is set out in the legislation it will be open to abuse.  In the first instance, the Director of Public Prosecutions will decide whether a case should be taken, a discretion which is exclusive to him.  The DPP will not decide to charge someone under this section if he doubts whether the value of the drugs concerned is over £10,000.  The DPP will use his considerable experience in coming to a decision on prosecutions.  To be fair, it does him no credit to say he would bring cases under this section where there was some doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> The argument that the definition should be by weight does not stand up.  How can we say that X weight of one drug is worth Y weight of another?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill recognises that anyone dealing in drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more is a major player and a clear message is being sent out to people involved in this pernicious business at home or abroad that if they are caught in this jurisdiction with drugs of that value with an intent to supply, they will serve a minimum of ten years in prison.</P>
      <P>With regard to the argument that people caught with £9,999 worth of drugs will be subject to a far lower sentence than a person caught with £10,001 worth, it is already the law that a court may hand down sentences up to life imprisonment for offences such as this.  In the event of an individual being found in possession of drugs with a street value of £9,999 with intent to supply, it would be open to the courts to impose a similar sentence to the ten year mandatory sentence applicable to £10,001 worth of drugs.</P>
      <P>We are splitting hairs here.  I am satisfied that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not bring cases to court unless he is satisfied there is a good chance of a successful outcome.  A chance of success in cases such as this is that a court will hold that an individual is guilty, under the section, beyond a reasonable doubt.  For that standard of proof to be reached, it must be clear to everyone that the necessary evidence is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The change brought about by this legislation is that, for the first time in Irish history, there is a mandatory minimum sentence for serious drug dealers and people who become involved in the destruction of young people's health and lives.  I do not believe there is any sympathy in this House or in any part of civilised Irish society for such people, nor should there be.  The Government's decision to implement its pre-election promise to provide for a mandatory sentence of ten years is one which I believe will be broadly welcomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to assist the Minister in making this law watertight.  This legislation represents a continuation of three or four other major pieces of legislation introduced by the previous Minister, the last of which dealt with the Criminal Assets Bureau.  This legislation is a welcome complement to the legislation which preceded it.  Nevertheless, I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be able, on consideration of all of the evidence, to make up his mind whether the value of the drugs concerned is sufficiently accurate to warrant charging someone under the minimum ten year sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we can measure the value of drugs and the damage they could cause more accurately by their weight than by their very variable value in money.  There is no such thing as a free market <Col N="715" /> in drugs.  There is no market price for drugs in the same way as there is a market price for commodities such as tobacco, wheat and so on.  The Minister is a member of the legal profession, as is the Government spokesperson on Justice, Senator O'Donovan.  They are both aware that with that kind of uncertainty existing about the value of the commodity, the Bill will be wide open to challenge in the courts.  If value is based on money, the provisions of the Bill will never stand up in court.</P>
    <P>I understand that when a consignment of drugs is being examined, the forensic science laboratory tests one sample of the drug in order to attest to its purity in terms of its overall volume.  The forensic science laboratory is working to its limits.  I understand there are many delays involved as it is unable to deal with all the work it must do.  If we are talking about the specific values of drugs consignments, surely the laboratory will be obliged to test every gram of drugs hauls in order to determine their purity.  There is no other way to assess the value of drugs unless entire consignments are properly tested.  That aspect is not addressed in the Bill and I urge the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>We want to co-operate with the Minister and make this Bill workable.  We do not want to find that somebody with an alleged £20,000 drugs consignment has his or her case blown out of court because the State cannot prove the value in money terms of that consignment.  Value is based on the evidence of the Garda and Customs officers who may know something about the street prices of drugs.  However, the price of drugs in Hardwicke Street may be different to that in other areas of Dublin as drug prices vary.  I ask the Minister to take on board our reasoned and reasonable arguments that value must be determined in accordance with something other than money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that I do not agree with his approach to this issue.  I invite him to return to this House next year or in ten years&rsquo; time and demonstrate to us that this stern approach has worked.  The record in other countries shows it simply will not.  To a large extent, this Bill is a public relations exercise which has no chance of working.  It will only serve to drive up the price of street drugs and will concentrate huge resources of money in fewer and fewer hands.  For every person sentenced, the taxpayers will have to pay £46,000 per year.  I cannot say that would be Senator Costello's view but I think it is a reasonable position which can be logically argued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel any warmth whatsoever towards drug dealers; my position is simply a logical one towards which an increasing body of responsible legal and police opinion is moving throughout the world.  I wonder why mandatory sentences are being introduced at this point.  Do we not trust judges or are we afraid they will be suborned by <Col N="716" /> offers of money? Why do sentences become mandatory at a particular point? Does the Minister recognise any difference between marijuana, cannabis and heroin? There is a considerable difference between them; cannabis is not chemically addictive whereas heroin and other opiates are.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced of the merits of judging value by weight as opposed to money but Senator O'Connor is correct in saying that prices fluctuate. How does one prove value? Are we going to print a drugs exchange in <i>The Irish Times</i> every morning listing the street prices of drugs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>Current and future prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  They will have a futures market in hash.  It will be extremely difficult to establish a price.  Does the Minister, or his advisers, see a difference between cannabis and heroin? If people will be automatically put in jail for supplying £10,000 worth of heroin, there will be a considerable number of people in jail at any one time because the consumption of drugs is so widespread, not just in Dublin but throughout the country.  The net result of this kind of policy will be an increase in violence, which is not what the Minister envisages or wishes.  A mandatory sentence of ten years is perilously close to the kind of sentence that would be served for armed robbery or murder.  We already have the involvement of an armed element in the drugs trade and this kind of sentencing will lead to a much more cavalier attitude to the use of firearms by drug barons. That worries me.</P>
      <P>I have always argued for policies which would reduce the incidence of violence and robbery, but I do not honestly see this sort of legislation doing that.  It will only increase it while at the same time providing a sop to public opinion to make it appear that the draconian measures being taken will be effective.  Draconian measures are being taken, but I doubt strongly that they will be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris's observation that, regrettably, the country seems to be awash with drugs.  The measures being introduced by the Minister reflect the reality that a serious drugs problem exists.  Senator Norris referred to mandatory sentencing.  It is incumbent on the Minister and on any Government to stop the spiralling drug problem.  Without mandatory sentencing one will not hit the drugs barons where it hurts them most.</P>
      <P>One could argue about the financial value of drugs and Senator Connor made that point, but when is murder manslaughter? If one goes by weight, does one not have to check the purity of the drugs involved? The purity of certain drugs such as crack, cocaine and LSD depends on how they are composed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A monetary value of £10,000 is a common sense yardstick.  Anyone who dabbles in drugs with that value, whether cannabis, heroin or LSD, runs the risk of being imprisoned for a minimum of ten years.  However, most gardaí will not bother prosecuting someone driving at 43 miles an hour in a 40 mile zone &mdash; they will use a common sense approach.  Similarly, I concur with the Minister's point that the Director of Public Prosecutions will take a sensible approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>The likelihood of a successful challenge on the issue of whether the value of the drugs concerned is £9,900 or £10,100 would be most unusual.  The Minister also pointed out that we are modernising the law on drug trafficking.  As the law stands, one can be jailed for up to 21 years for possessing less than £10,000 worth of drugs and that likelihood still exists.  The £10,000 guideline is a sensible yardstick.  Perhaps in ten years&rsquo; time we will be told it was too little or too much, but we must start somewhere.</P>
      <P>I urge Senators to accept the Minister's strong comments and observations.  We will never achieve utopia, but this is a sensible and necessary approach.  The sooner we get this legislation on the Statute Book the sooner our streets will be safer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that we all wish him well in his endeavours to control drug trafficking.  In all sincerity, however, I share the concerns of Senator Norris and Senator Connor about the figure of £10,000, with which I have difficulty.  Legal precedents in our courts have been based on technicalities, which some people would see as nit-picking exercises, but that is what good lawyers do.  As far as I am aware, the value of illegal drugs in Britain is determined by weight.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the proposal to detain people for up to seven days.  I appreciate that in the war against drugs we must use all possible legal measures.  I have nothing against a seven day detention period if that time is used to further investigate the alleged crime.  However, if that time was to be used for further interrogation - history has shown us that anyone will crack under a prolonged period of questioning &mdash; I doubt that it would be a valid or just way to proceed. If we do introduce a seven day detention period we should use it constructively to make sure that justice is done.  We are on a very narrow tightrope regarding this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I note at the outset that Senator Connor did not table any amendments to the legislation, but if he does so on Report Stage in relation to the matters he has mentioned I will consider them.  I am doubtful, however, that the approach he has proposed would be an improvement on the legislation before the House.  I understand the concern of Senators Norris, Connor and Ridge about the legislation.  The fact is, however, that three times during the course of the <Col N="718" /> last Dáil, I put forward a proposal to the House for a mandatory sentence of ten years&rsquo; imprisonment for any individual found in possession of illegal drugs, with intent to supply, to the value of £10,000 or more.  Three times in the course of that Dáil the provision was voted down by the then Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor said this legislation is merely a follow on from legislation which was enacted by the previous Administration.  He referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully remind him that the Criminal Assets Bureau arose as a result of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced in the Dáil from the Opposition benches. There would be no point in having a Criminal Assets Bureau if the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced to the House, had not been enacted.</P>
      <P>In the course of the general election campaign last June, people were made quite aware that a ten year mandatory sentence for serious drug dealers and traffickers would be enacted by the Government if my party was returned to office. As it turned out, my party was returned to office with the Progressive Democrats and with the support of three Independent TDs.  In so far as I can gauge it, there was acceptance of the proposal which received a considerable amount of attention from the media.</P>
      <P>The legislation is tough, there is no denying that.  However, to say, as Senator Norris did, that it is put forward for PR reasons is a facetious argument.  There is no great PR exercise involved for an individual who will find himself sentenced to ten years imprisonment arising out of this legislation. Far from it, it will be a very clear indication of society abhorrence of this kind of offence.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asks whether we trust the judges. Yes, we do and I have the greatest respect for the Judiciary, but I maintain that society has the right, if it should deem fit, to express its absolute abhorrence of a given offence in as trenchant a manner as it would wish, and it has done so in relation to other matters.  For example, some years ago the Legislature enacted a law abolishing capital murder and replacing it with a minimum of 40 years imprisonment.  That, I respectfully submit, was not done as a PR exercise no more than this is but to reflect the abhorrence of the Legislature and society of that kind of offence.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that this particular provision has been under serious assault inside and outside this House for many months, but I remain convinced of the necessity for this legislation.  I always said this legislation would be introduced in the event that we returned to Government and I am keeping my word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear about this.  It is not as if there is not a very strong provision in Irish criminal law already relating to sentences of this nature.  As I <Col N="719" /> said earlier, Irish courts can, in certain instances, impose sentences of up to life imprisonment for offences similar to this.  The change which this legislation makes is quite simple.  If an individual is found to be dealing in drugs with a substantial value &mdash; that is £10,000 or more &mdash; then he must receive a sentence of at least ten years imprisonment as a sanction from the court.  In my view, that is a response society requires to a serious problem and which society, on reflection, will be glad that the Oireachtas took.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the victory of his party at the last election and admitted that it is in Government now with the assistance of the Progressive Democrats and three Independents. That was scarcely an overwhelming endorsement.</P>
      <P>However, he did not really address the difference between cannabis and heroin.  That is significant, so I am sure he will.  The law already acknowledges a difference in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, where a person cannot be sent to jail on a first conviction.  Therefore, the law already recognises there is a distinction between cannabis and heroin, for example, and I am interested that this distinction is preserved in law.</P>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is correct.  We should not delay too long over this section because, since none of us has tabled amendments to it, it seems slightly absurd to be discussing it to this extent. However, I propose to table, or at least suggest, an amendment which does not argue my point philosophically.  Far from it, I think it actually assists the Minister in his task of getting people convicted.  I would like to hear his response.</P>
      <P>The Bill states on page 7, between lines 20 and 25, that &ldquo;&rsquo;market value&rsquo;, in relation to a controlled drug, means the price that drug could be expected to fetch on the market for the unlawful sale or supply of controlled drugs;&rdquo;, but that is still pretty vague because there is no reference to time.  We know there are massive fluctuations in the price of drugs on a week to week, and even day to day, basis.  Therefore, I would suggest that the Minister might be well advised to insert the words &ldquo;at the time of the alleged offence&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;the price that drug could be expected to fetch on the market&rdquo;.  What happens if there is a massive drop in the price of the drug between the time the man or woman &mdash; let us be honest and non-sexist because I remember a woman in a wheelchair was convicted for possession of a massive amount of heroin &mdash; is charged and the day on which the case is heard? In terms of the vague way this is phrased, I am assuming that one could pick a date on which the price was particularly low and argue that it did not meet the provision. I am not sure if that is the case, but I am sure the Minister will have an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion that this was a PR exercise to some extent is not facetious and nothing in what the Minister said contradicted the possibility of somebody putting that construction on it.  The fact, for example, that, as he quite rightly stated, <Col N="720" /> large sections of the public might be delighted to see people receiving a ten year sentence for handling drugs &mdash; irrespective of whether they were soft drugs because when reading a headline &ldquo;Drug Pusher sent to Jail&rdquo; people do not distinguish between hard and soft drugs &mdash; but when the Minister says this kind of thing is abhorrent to the Irish people, that is not true universally. There are huge numbers of people using drugs, particularly cannabis and there is a growing lobby for the legalisation of cannabis, not just in this country but throughout Europe.  Therefore, it is not entirely true to say that it is abhorrent to everybody.  It cannot be abhorrent to the people who regularly smoke the stuff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes great play of the fact that he demanded and campaigned for a mandatory sentence of ten years during his time in Opposition.  He knows that even this legislation does not contain a mandatory sentence.  It contains a presumptive sentence of ten years because naturally he had to include circumstances in which that sentence could be reduced.  That is provided for in section 5(3).</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental principle of Irish sentencing policy that there be proportionality about all sentencing.  The Minister knows that ten years, not one minute less could not be enacted in law because the fundamental principle of proportionality must always be observed and it would be found to be unconstitutional.  It looks as if he just thought of a figure &mdash; £10,000 and ten years.</P>
      <P>The fundamental point is that drugs worth £10,000 in my county of Roscommon, for example, would have a different value in Dublin. The value varies from one part of the country to another.  Will a person found with an amount of drugs worth £10,500 in one part of the country and a person found with the same amount of drugs in another part of the country where they are worth only £5,000 be sentenced differently?</P>
      <P>The measure value must be changed.  Senator Ridge made the point that drugs are valued by weight in other jurisdictions rather than by their so-called market value.  No market exists for drugs in the accepted sense.  This must be looked at seriously.  I hope the Minister will return to this point before the passage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are serious mistakes in the legislation in terms of, first, the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence and, second, the absence of a distinction between the different categories of drug abuse.  The Minister will probably live to rue the fact he has, undoubtedly with serious and genuine intention, determined to take a strong stand on drug trafficking and to put down a marker that it will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  However, I am not satisfied the proposals in sections 4 and 5 will achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many serious problems with the mandatory ten year minimum sentence for possession of £10,000 worth of drugs.  The Minister <Col N="721" /> will find it is virtually impossible to operate the criminal justice system unless the Judiciary has some discretion in relation to sentencing.  When someone is found in possession of £10,000 worth of drugs there are many possibilities in terms of the type of drugs, the circumstances and the options for sentencing.</P>
    <P>We have a serious crisis in our prison system. As the Minister knows, our prisons are bursting at the seams, with doubling and trebling up in almost all prisons at the moment.  Regardless of what plans the Minister or future Governments have for the provision of new prisons, they will not be able to cope with the number of prisoners that will result from the imposition of mandatory sentencing.</P>
    <P>The prison population has changed over the past ten to 15 years.  Serious drug and sex offenders did not impact on the prison population profile before 1980.  It is estimated now that 80 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison were sentenced for drug related offences.  All of Arbour Hill Prison and half of Wheatfield Prison are occupied by sex offenders.  These are serious offences for which offenders should serve long sentences.  However, the result is that very little space is left in the prison system.  If we now impose a mandatory sentence for possession of £10,000 worth of drugs the prison system will be unable to function.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission strongly recommended the abolition of mandatory sentences.  I do not know why the Minister feels bound to go against its recommendations in this respect.  It is contrary to our system of justice, which has always operated on the basis of allowing some judicial discretion, which enhances the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The survey on youth drug abuse published today shows that 50 per cent of young people have abused drugs, virtually all of which were what are described as soft drugs.  Last week some of those working in the Merchants Quay project led the charge for the decriminalisation of heroin. I do not think many of us would agree with that, especially those of us from disadvantaged communities which have been destroyed by heroin. However, there is a strong lobby for the decriminalisation of cannabis.</P>
    <P>Without getting into the philosophical or pharmacological arguments about soft and hard drugs, I wish to make a point about the devastation caused by heroin.  Heroin has ruined people's lives and given rise to many drug related offences. It is an expensive drug which does not have a social component.  It is prevalent in disadvantaged communities and has given rise to crimes which enable addicts to feed their habit.  While none of us condone the misuse of any drug, the use of softer drugs, such as ecstasy and cannabis, does not give rise to the committing of ancillary crimes to feed an addiction.  Heroin addiction costs at least £100 a day, which addicts obtain by committing crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> It is necessary to distinguish between soft and hard drugs.  That distinction was made in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  I do not see why we should move from that position.  There was a greater degree of flexibility and a definition was provided.  We are now failing to make that distinction and are imposing mandatory sentencing.</P>
    <P>The effect of the legislation will be to target relatively low level operators, such as pushers who are themselves addicts and drug couriers. This will not affect the big operators and drug barons.  The proposal will target those who are victims and are supplying a small amount of drugs, which could easily have a street value of £10,000, to friends to feed their habit.  The big drug barons will keep their hands cleaner than ever.  I know the intention is genuine but this is an unfortunate provision in the Bill because it will run into so many legal, judicial and operational problems as well as physical problems in terms of the provision of space.  The Minister will rue the day he put forward this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not lose sight of the thrust of this Bill when we discuss these amendments.  I agree with Senator Costello on the major problem of heroin and what it has done to areas of Dublin but there have been millions of pounds worth of drugs smuggled into remote parts of west Cork, some of which have still to be found.  In this regard the thrust of the legislation is to teach people a lesson and to signal to the international community that we are not a soft touch for drugs.</P>
      <P>In the past 15 years we all have been touched by the effects of drugs.  It is regrettable that about 60 per cent of the children who took part in the survey mentioned by Senator Costello, ranging in ages from as young as 12 years and upwards, have experimented with drugs.  In the fight against drugs we should not forget that in the past 12 months the Garda have been extremely successful in recovering drugs.  This has had a major impact on drug barons and importers of drugs. We are not talking about people charged with possession of a few grammes of marijuana or an Ecstasy tablet.  In my experience these people are given a slap on the wrist and informed that if they come before the courts again they will be in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>This legislation must send out the message that Ireland is no longer a soft touch for drugs and that we have a highly trained and sophisticated Garda force who are able to tackle the problem. This was not the case ten years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris can argue that point.  In a Utopian society there would be no need for jails but we must live in the real world. Through the people I have met I have discovered there is a huge demand by society for us to tackle <Col N="723" /> the drug problem with tough legislation.  There is no way out of mandatory sentencing and the thrust of what the Minister is endeavouring to do has widespread support abroad.  If anyone has another answer to this problem I would like to hear it.  Do we let the people who have poisoned our young people and society get away with it? Ireland is being used by drug barons as a spring-board into the rest of Europe for their imported drugs from South America and elsewhere.  The Criminal Assets Bureau must target the profits of the drug barons.  Mandatory sentences of at least ten years for dealing in large quantities of drugs will teach drug dealers a lesson.  We are trying to be in line with the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>The gardaí are very well trained.  Ten or 15 years ago a garda would not know the difference between cocaine, cannabis or an Ecstasy tablet.  They would not have had the technology or training for that but the situation has changed. I compliment the gardaí in Munster on their recent success in recovering drugs.  Some of the finds contained huge quantities of Ecstasy and other drugs for sale on the Dublin or Cork city markets.  I wish the Garda continued success.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister for adhering to mandatory sentencing.  This is very important and must be implemented.  Already in Amsterdam and elsewhere there is a fear among drug barons that Ireland, as it enters the next century, will have clamped down on drugs.  If my colleagues take away mandatory sentencing they are taking away the power of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to Senator O'Donovan's last point.  The most significant message this House can give to the purveyors of cancer in our society &mdash; that is what they are &mdash; to the potential mass murderers, is to tell them unambiguously, and hopefully with one voice, that if they commit the crime we will make sure they do the time.  There is little point bringing forward a Bill to tackle drug barons unless we show them we are serious.  We have to prove to them beyond a shadow of a doubt that this House will not countenance the kind of massive irresponsible behaviour of which they are guilty.  Discussing other solutions apart from mandatory sentencing is dodging the issue that society is so threatened by these people that, at the very least, they believe these people should be put away. Society deserves to be rid of drug barons for a mandatory minimum period.  I am not satisfied that the minimum mandatory sentence proposed by the Minister is adequate.</P>
      <P>A hardened criminal is a hardened criminal. You can propose rehabilitation programmes, psychological reorientation programmes, etc. but, at the end of the day, these people understand one message and that is that as hardened criminals, they have to be taken out of circulation. Society has to be rid of them for a minimum period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I do not advocate that thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money be used to rehabilitate this type of prisoner.  I know that is not politically correct to say but hardened criminals rarely reform and they are invariably men.  I stand open to correction on this by anyone, especially experts on the criminal justice system.</P>

It is a core principle of this Bill that mandatory sentencing should deliver a powerful message to the community that this House takes its concerns and anxieties seriously and is acting accordingly.  The Minister is doing something significant in allaying these fears by putting these mass murderers and purveyors of social cancer out of circulation.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris and I will have to agree to differ on this point.  It is, of course, important to send a signal of society's abhorrence of such crimes.  Senator Costello does not support minimum mandatory sentences.  He is entitled to his view but I have explained that I regard them as appropriate and have set out the reasons.  Senator Costello also raised the matter of not distinguishing between different types of drugs.  I will deal with this matter when the amendment on it is being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mandatory sentencing will not worsen the problem of prison accommodation.  The effect of mandatory sentencing will not be felt until prisoners begin to serve the extra part of their sentences and that time substantial extra prison accommodation will be available.  If a person who might now be sentenced to six years were, under this legislation, sentenced to ten years, the demand for prison accommodation would not <Col N="725" /> arise until the extra years of the sentence were being served.  In other words, it will be six years before extra prison accommodation is required. I expect there will be considerable extra prison accommodation by then.  Senator Costello drew the attention of the House to the distinction made with relation to supply.  I will deal with that matter when we discuss the relevant amendment.</P>
    <P>Irish criminal law distinguishes possession of, for example, cannabis for personal use.  No distinction is made in relation to supply between various categories of drugs.  My research tells me that while possession is a criminal offence, consumption of illegal drugs, with the exception of prepared opium, is not.  When an illegal drug enters the blood stream as opposed to one's pocket, Irish criminal law loses interest in it.  This is a matter for discussion on another day but it is, nonetheless, an interesting point.</P>

      <P>I sincererly hope that the legislation has the effect which Senator Costello described and brings certain people into our prisons for a considerable period.  That is where such people should be.  Senator Costello will be more aware than many that parents are more afraid of the threat of drugs to their children than of anything else.  This measure is not the solution of the entire problem but it is a genuine attempt to apply a sanction.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the question of judicial discretion.  I thank Senators O'Donovan and Fitzgerald for their contributions.  Some objective observers might say that, in all the circumstances of the case, my proposal is a reasonable compromise.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris&rsquo; point is a very good one.  It is, however, covered in section 4 where a new section is inserted into the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Section 15A(1)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, now reads:</P>
      <P>15A.&mdash;(1) A person shall be guilty of an offence under this section where&mdash;</P>
      <P>.....</P>
      <P>(b) at any time while the drug or drugs are in the person's possession the market value of the controlled drug or the aggregate of the market values of the controlled drugs, as the case may be, amounts to £10,000 or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, while the drugs are in an accused person's possession and mindful of variations in value which might take place, their value exceeds £10,000 at any time, the person can be convicted.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3C) Subsection (3B) of this section shall apply only to such categories of controlled drug as are prescribed for the purposes of that subsection by regulations made by the Minister.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>A number of the arguments relating to section 4 overlapped into issues involving section 5.  I consider amendment No. 2 to be the most important of those put forward, particularly in the general context of the earlier debate when concerns were expressed regarding the operation of mandatory sentencing and the lack of definition in respect of soft and hard drugs.  It is important that we get it right in terms of the focus placed on us.  Everyone agrees that we must send out a strong message to criminals at large, particularly those in the drug fraternity, that we will not tolerate the trafficking or distribution of drugs in our jurisdiction and that we will be tough on those involved in this trade.  It is important that this is done not merely by bringing down the sledgehammer but by showing that we have a serious, rational and comprehensive approach to this area.</P>
      <P>Specific proposals put forward in legislation must dovetail with the overall policy on criminal justice and we must be able to apply this to the social background against which drug trafficking takes place and the pharmaceutical and chemical contexts to which drugs pertain.  There is a world of difference between heroin and cannabis.  As already stated, the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, makes a distinction between cannabis and other drugs.  As the Minister stated, that distinction relates to possession of cannabis for personal use and there is no real distinction between possession and supply of the drug.  Nevertheless, we are discussing distinctions between heroin, which is essentially a hard drug, and cannabis, which is categorised as a soft drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the argument will continue about whether abuse of soft drugs leads to abuse of hard drugs, we must recognise that there is a substantial difference between trafficking in heroin, which is the common drug among those living in disadvantaged and deprived areas of Dublin &mdash; it is not used to such an extent in other areas throughout the country &mdash; and trafficking in cannabis. Heroin has caused absolute and utter devastation and prompted the introduction of much legislation and the implementation of many policing and sentencing measures.  If we consider this <Col N="727" /> matter clearly and carefully, we know that heroin is the killer drug and we must be sure that we do not create a situation where that distinction becomes completely blurred by our failure to affirm that fact.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 suggests that provision should be made for the prescription, by regulations made by the Minister, of categories of controlled drugs.  This would leave the Minister and his successors with a degree of flexibility to consider the availability and supply of and the serious devastation and overall ripple effect caused by various categories of drugs on the community. We should also consider the possibility of future developments in pharmacology in respect of the effects of these drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a need to specify distinctions.  If we are discussing the imposition of a mandatory sentence, we must be able to state categorically that we know what we are talking about.  We must also be able to direct mandatory sentences at the heart of the problem; we do not want to spray them all over the place.  As Senator Fitzgerald stated, we want to direct such sentences at hardened criminals.</P>
    <P>Are hardened criminals the victims, these people who, because they are drug addicts, are unemployed, purvey drugs to their friends to maintain their own habits without having to commit crimes outside the drug trade? Others commit crimes such as stealing, carrying out robberies and burglarising houses to maintain their habits. The profiles of those incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison provide a great deal of information about those who commit crimes.  If the Minister considers such information carefully &mdash; I am sure the facts and figures are readily available to him &mdash; he will discover that those crimes were related not to the supply of cannabis, Ecstasy or cocaine but to the supply of heroin to themselves.  These people are heroin addicts who must find the means to maintain their addiction and they do that by either selling small amounts of drugs to their friends or by committing crime.</P>
    <P>We should leave scope in the legislation to allow for categories of controlled drugs to be prescribed by regulation from time to time by the Minister.  In this way, we will know what we are attempting to achieve and will be able to see how the legislation is functioning.  We can take action if we believe the prescription relating to a drug such as heroin is not adequate.  If another drug appears which causes the same mayhem as heroin, it can also be prescribed.  If future pharmacological developments determine that there is an absolute link between a soft drug such as cannabis and a hard drug such as heroin, cannabis can also be prescribed under the terms of the regulation for controlled drugs in the legislation and subject to the mandatory sentence.</P>
    <P>I make the point &mdash; Members comments on section 4 built up towards it &mdash; that we need to focus legislation.  If legislation is not focused it cannot be implemented.  If we cannot implement <Col N="728" /> it, it is useless and may prove counterproductive. I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 2 which will strengthen the legislation.  It will not in any way reduce his power to tackle the problem of serious drug trafficking in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello.  I have a difficulty with the minimum sentence of ten years for drug trafficking offences.  I do not wish to repeat my earlier remarks but I return to the point that the value of drugs is not to be specified by kind, weight, etc.  A notional value of £10,000 has been proposed in that regard.  It is extremely dangerous to impose a minimum sentence of ten years which, by anyone's reckoning, is harsh.  This has been stated by judges in the criminal courts in the past and many of them will not welcome the provision.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position.</P>
      <P>A minimum sentence of ten years for possession of £10,000 worth of cannabis is extremely harsh, particularly in the absence of weight or kind in the specification of the drugs.  I agree that a minimum sentence of ten years should be imposed in respect of possession of £10,000 &mdash; I believe the amount should be less &mdash; of heroin. This has not been thought out.  It is a broad brush approach without considering the effects of the various kinds of drugs.  Many people hold the view that cannabis is far less harmful than tobacco or alcohol.  These matters need to be thought through.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made great play of the sentence of ten years.  He plays to a certain tabloid element of the public saying that a ten year sentence is absolutely necessary.  However, the Bill provides a qualification in that, where the courts find there to be exceptional circumstances, the sentence can be reduced &mdash; for example, in the case of a child or young person.  As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister must think in terms of justice.  He should not go down in history as the Minister for punishment because he feels he wants to punish in all circumstances. He should reflect on the broad aspects of justice which are his brief.  I urge him to be cautious and to consider the points made and the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with the points made by Senators Costello and Connor. If I were as assured as they seem about the distinctions they draw &mdash; the minimal potential for progression from one type of drug to another and the less harmful nature of certain drugs <i>vis-a -vis</i> alcohol or nicotine &mdash; I would be more encouraged to support their approach.  With regard to the chemical compositions of drugs or the way they affect people, I cannot say whether they are correct.  If they are, why have alcohol and cigarettes not been made illegal rather than the drugs in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Alcohol and cigarette consumption are not illegal but the types of drugs regarded by some experts as less harmful than others are illegal.  I regard this provision as targeting pushers and not addicts.  Therefore, I have difficulty supporting the amendment.</P>
      <P>A sum of £10,000 is substantial, especially in the context of illegal drugs.  Illegal drugs may include growth hormones for cattle which get into the meat we consume.  In many cases those drugs are more frightening because we do not know if they have been used.  In all cases where there is a quantity of illegal drugs to the value of £10,000 or more in the possession of a person I regard it as a very serious offence, irrespective of the perceived wisdom as to the degree of addictiveness or harmfulness of the particular drug.  A person carrying a quantity of drugs of such a value is in the serious business of promoting addiction to an illegal drug and, therefore, is in the business of casting aside any moral judgment about the harm he/she is doing or is likely to do to society.  Social justice and concerns dictate that there should not be a distinction drawn at this point.</P>
      <P>Senators may say that their view will be proved to be true in time to come.  However, it may be proved that their arguments are not correct.  Since I do not know and cannot definitively state that their views are incorrect, I would prefer to err on the side of caution and state that distinctions should not drawn in the Bill in terms of the £10,000 market value of an illegal drug.  It would be difficult for the Minister to prescribe by regulation one type of drug to the value of £10,000 and refuse to prescribe by regulation another type of drug because it is deemed by some to be less harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the intention of the amendment is that a Minister would be able to specify by regulation the controlled drugs to which the mandatory ten year penalty would apply.  This envisages that it would be open to a Minister to prescribe by regulation that the mandatory penalty would apply to what are referred to as hard drugs as opposed to soft drugs. If that distinction should apply, its implications are so farreaching that it should be made by the Legislature in primary legislation rather than left to a Minister to deal with by way of regulation.  I have doubts whether this purported delegation of legislative powers to a Minister would be constitutional. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts the Minister for Health and Children has the power to specify controlled drugs by regulation. However, what is at issue in this case is a different matter.  The mandatory provisions should apply to all controlled drugs.  I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with the thinking behind the amendment to the extent that there is no doubt the availability of heroin and the activities that surround it represent the worst aspect of the drugs problem.  In bringing in this Bill I gave a great deal of thought whether a distinction might <Col N="730" /> be made with regard to various types of drug. However, for the reasons I will explain, I came to the firm conclusion that such a distinction would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to mandatory sentences is geared primarily towards those who trade in illegal drugs as part of an organised criminal enterprise.  We are not talking about a person who purchases enough cannabis for themselves and a friend and sells it to a friend.  As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, we are talking about someone involved in the possession for supply of illegal drugs to the value of £10,000 or more.  We are dealing by definition with someone playing a substantial part in the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>The nature of the organised drug trade we are dealing with is that many of those involved will trade in hard and soft drugs as part of a ruthless criminal conspiracy which has wreaked havoc in many communities.  The activities of these gangs are not confined to supplying drugs.  Their activities have involved, and continue to involve, intimidation and murder.  In those circumstances it seems right that a person whose activities are a mainstay of that criminal enterprise should face a mandatory sentence in terms of the possession for supply of £10,000 or more of illegal drugs irrespective of the type of drug involved.</P>
    <P>Even if these were not valid considerations, we would enter a quagmire trying to make a distinction in the context of this legislation on the basis of the type of drugs at issue.  Is it to be seriously suggested, for example, that a person who has £10,000 worth of Ecstasy tablets for supply to schoolchildren should not be mandatorily sentenced as provided for in the Bill simply on the basis that Ecstasy might not be regarded to be as harmful as heroin?</P>
    <P>Anther point which should not be lost sight of is that the terms of the legislation will not apply retrospectively.  When the legislation is enacted it will be clear to anyone in advance of deciding to traffick in drugs to the value of £10,000 or more that a mandatory penalty will apply.  If people have given that due consideration and go ahead anyway, then their luck is out.  It was in light of these considerations that it was decided the best approach to take on the question of mandatory penalties was to define the offence by reference to the value of the drugs involved.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that no one involved in the supply of drugs to the value of £10,000 or more is anything other than a substantial player in the organised trade in illegal drugs and Senator Fitzgerald spelt that out forcefully.  I accept a distinction needs to be made between a person involved in the supply of £10,000 worth of cannabis and one involved in the supply of £1 million worth of heroin. The best way to make such a distinction is not through &ldquo;disapplying&rdquo; the mandatory ten year penalty to the former; it is to allow even heavier penalties to be imposed on the latter and that will be the legal position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Currently, a person convicted of a drug trafficking offence can be sentenced up to life imprisonment which I explained earlier and that will remain the position under the new legislation. The fact that we are introducing a ten year mandatory or minimum sentence in this legislation does not obviate the fact that a court will still be empowered, pursuant to the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, to impose a sentence of up to life imprisonment.  In this way a court will be able to mark the gravity of the offence by applying a sentence of up to life imprisonment, or in the case of drugs with a market value of more than £10,000 applying one of a lesser period of years but, in any case, a minimum period of ten years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor was correct when he said this legislation is harsh but I cannot ascertain what precisely he wants put in the Bill for the simple reason that he has not tabled amendments, although he may table some on Report Stage.  If his bottom line is that he is against the concept of minimum sentences, then his party is making the same mistake in Opposition as it did in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response as I thought he might be forthcoming on the amendment.  It is a valuable amendment which would not water down the Minister's message or intention to stamp down on drug trafficking and would underpin it with a rational and flexible approach which is essentially what is required from legislation.  The Minister's approach of putting emphasis on the value of drugs is wrong because the price of drugs will change from month to month, year to year and, very often, day to day.  It depends, like everything else in the marketplace, on supply and demand. While demand exists, there will always be a supply but at times it will be scarce while at other times the market will be flooded.  That is not a good legislative position to take.  In a few years time, depending on inflation, £10,000 may not hold the same value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The Minister would have been better advised if he had adopted the approach of looking at the effect of drugs, particularly on the community in terms of social and economic implications rather than looking at the street value of drugs at a particular time.  He could have combined the two but his lack of distinction, good, bad or indifferent, in terms of the type and category of drugs and the effects on the community of the use and abuse of them means he has made the wrong decision and it will come home to haunt him.  This is enshrined in the Bill and if he were prepared to accept the rational amendments proposed by us, he could do what he wants in a proper, just and effective fashion and have flexibility with changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also wrong when he said, in terms of defining categories of controlled drugs to be prescribed by regulation, if such an approach were taken, it would be essential it be adopted in primary legislation.  I do not agree because primary legislation would have no bearing on what is being sought in the amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to provide the flexibility that will be required from time to time depending on medical advice, changing circumstances, the marketplace, the categorisation of drugs and the social implications.  Primary legislation will not achieve that and it is important that discretion be left with the Minister.  The Minister will exercise discretion on medical or police advice, or the advice of community leaders and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be in no danger of abusing his position if he accepted this amendment and he should not worry about enshrining it in primary legislation.  He has made two basic mistakes, first as regards the value of the drugs, second in saying he should do nothing about it now because it would not be proper for a Minister to have such broad ranging powers or that they should be enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation will not effect its intended purpose &mdash; it will not catch drug barons or big drug traffickers.  It will catch the &ldquo;mules&rdquo;, the victims and the drug addicts, but it is not a weapon in the fight against serious drug abuse and drug trafficking. The legislation will be brought into disrepute as our jails fill up with people who are already victims and are being used by the people with whom the Bill was supposed to deal.  Section 5(3)(g) provides that a court may inquire whether, at the time the offence was committed, the person was addicted to one or more controlled drugs.  If it is satisfied that the person was addicted, there may be a review at the expiry of not less than one half of the period.  The minimum sentence is ten years, so if a review is held and it is found that the person was an addict at the time and that the drugs were for personal use or for a small circle of friends, at least five years will elapse before anything can be done.  The prisons will undoubtedly be full of drug addicts on the receiving end of this legislation and the only <Col N="733" /> penalty is a custodial one, a minimum of ten years in prison.</P>
    <P>From every point of view it is difficult to see how the Minister can justify this and how the legislation can operate effectively.  Having spoken to people from communities affected by the drug problem, particularly heroin, I know they have a poor view of legislation such as this which takes a sledgehammer approach without making distinctions. It does not work and has never worked. The drug problem is complex but drug barons will laugh at this legislation and go merrily on their way.  When one &ldquo;mule&rdquo; or courier goes to prison it is not hard for them to get another.  They will not be caught and they are not even targeted by the Bill, although they are supposed to be.  Since the legislation is simply directed at drugs with a street value of over £10,000, it is not directed at those causing damage to the communities, who are the suppliers of hard drugs.  The provision is spread too wide and it will ultimately discredit not only this Bill but our whole approach to the problem.  Our prisons will be full of drug addicts and there are only limited treatment services within the prisons, but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>The amendment will undo the damage this legislation will do <i>via</i> mandatory sentencing, the lack of distinction between categories of drugs and the simple imposition of criteria for the value of drugs.  I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment because it will give him the flexibility to cope with the fall-out from the rigid approach he has adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has left. He stated that my party and I did not know what we wanted in this legislation.  What we want is that the Bill should be concerned with justice. The Minister is playing to a tabloid gallery which demands heavy sentences, etc., but what we &mdash; and above all, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; must be concerned with is the administration of justice and ensuring that all laws are just to everyone to whom they apply, be they the accused or anyone else.  The Minister should not lose sight of this but, as I said, I think he will be regarded more as a Minister for Punishment than a Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ten year sentence is not mandatory; it is presumptive &mdash; it is qualified by section 5(3)(c) &mdash; the Minister nonetheless trumpets that it is mandatory and that it proves he is taking a hard line.  If the minimum value of the drugs specified for this purpose was much higher, or if they were specified by weight or kind, as any sane Minister would do, there might be some justification for a ten year sentence.  I said that this is a heavy sentence and the Court of Criminal Appeal has also indicated on many occasions that it is severe.  It is certainly disproportionate as a minimum sentence for possession of £10,000 worth of cannabis.  Five years would be much more appropriate as a minimum sentence and we should remember that, under this Bill, a court would be fully entitled to impose any sentence up to life imprisonment if a <Col N="734" /> large quantity of drugs is involved and if there are other aggravating circumstances.</P>
    <P>We see this mandatory ten year sentence for an offence based on a notional money value of the drug with no reference to weight, kind or purity, as seriously flawed.  When these cases come to trial, as many no doubt will, it will be a nightmare for the DPP to decide whether the value of the drugs is greater than £10,000 because the directions in the Bill are so vague.  When the cases reach court and the State must prove the drugs are worth more than £10,000, the defence lawyers will argue there is no specification in the Bill as regards the type, weight or purity of the drug, it is simply a monetary or street value.  That is why we are trying, in the name of justice, to make good law which will catch these people.  As Senator Costello said, this will not reach the big barons and pushers because they will make their parcels of drugs smaller so that they are worth less than £10,000.  If we had something more specific related to the true value of the drug in terms of its purity, weight and type, this side of the House would have no difficulty supporting the Minister.  That is why we are appealing to him. Perhaps the Minister of State will be more reasonable and will accept the amendment.</P>

If the Senator has a clear amendment he wishes to table he should do so, but he has not tabled one here. The Senator still has the opportunity to table an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone to great detail explaining why he came to the conclusion that there should be no distinction between types of drug.  He spoke clearly in terms of those trading <Col N="735" /> in illegal drugs.  They are part of an organised criminal enterprise and the Minister has laid out that he believes that supplying this amount of drugs means you are a major player in the drugs market and not just an ordinary drug user.  The penalty is there and if that means the Minister is called the Minister for Punishment, then so be it. The people in Senator Costello's constituency, the people we are all trying to help, will thank Minister O'Donoghue even if he does go down in history as the Minister for Punishment.</P>

      <P>The Minister remarked that I am opposed to the approach here.  I am not opposed <Col N="736" /> to the legislation; I am opposed to the manner in which the Minister is taking this section of the legislation.  We are all anxious to stamp out drugs. I have experience of an area with a major drug problem.  We want to see the legislation targeted but I cannot see why the Minister would go against the approach enunciated in the Misuse of Drugs Act, providing a distinction between hard and soft drugs, and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister has not even bothered to explain why he decided to take a stance against those firm positions.  My amendment would assist the Minister in the work he is attempting to do.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5(3E) refers to the earning of remission of sentence through industry and good conduct.  We spoke earlier about the effects of this legislation arising from the minimum mandatory ten year sentence and other sentences in excess of that.  The Minister did not seem to envisage any problem with prison places as he said that, by the time the effects of this legislation would seep through the system, the prison programme would ensure that sufficient prison places would be available.  We know that sufficient places do not exist at present and that there is, in fact, a 50 per cent shortage of places. The effect of that shortage is that prisoners are doubling and trebling up in cells which were built 150 years ago and intended for only one person. Cells were built with minimum space and maximum supervision in mind.  The Minister is proceeding from a bad starting point.</P>
      <P>In comparison with the EU and Britain, Ireland has a very low remission rate at 25 per cent. Britain has a one-third remission rate, Northern Ireland has a 50 per cent rate and the rest of Europe generally follows the British model. Would the Minister consider &mdash; in terms of rehabilitation as well as prison places &mdash; looking afresh at the remission which can be earned and bringing the system more into line with that which operates in other countries? Perhaps the remission rate could be set at one third rather than at a quarter.  If that were the case, there would be an automatic 8.33 per cent improvement in the number of prison places available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentences being imposed through this Bill are custodial.  We are not talking about a range of rehabilitative or sentencing models.  This will undoubtedly be reflected very quickly in the profile of the prison population because of the absence of a different range of models from which the Judiciary can choose.  If we did put a premium on industry, good conduct and rehabilitation, we could at least move towards improving the remission rate and that would be worthwhile. <Col N="737" /> The very fact that there is an absence of other sentencing options in this legislation makes it difficult to emphasise rehabilitation and good conduct or promote prison reform.  Perhaps the Minister could take that issue on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the seriousness of the crime concerned it is necessary to impose custodial sentences through this Bill.  With regard to the difference in remission rates between Ireland and the UK, sentences in the UK seem to be longer on average.  The drug issue is very serious and it is very difficult to speak about its seriousness on the one hand while speaking about improving remission rates on the other.  I think Senator Costello was referring to improving remission rates across the board and not particularly in relation to the serious crimes dealt with by this Bill.  It is necessary to impose custodial sentences on crimes relating to drugs.  While I do not think it is appropriate to talk about remission in this context, I will take the general point on board.</P>

      <P>A key section of the Bill, which deals with the abolition of preliminary examinations, requires the substitution in section 9 of a new section 4A in the 1967 Act.  As the Bill stands, that section provides that where an accused person is before the District Court charged with an indictable offence, the court shall send the accused forward for trial to the court before which the person is to stand trial.  In practice, this would mean sending the person forward to the Circuit Court, the Central Criminal Court or the Special Criminal Court.  It will be noted that the court will do this without having conducted any preliminary examination.  However, the new section 4A provides that a person shall not be sent forward for trial in the following circumstances, namely, where a case is being tried summarily, where an accused pleads guilty or where an accused is unfit to plead.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 relates to the consent of the DPP and substitutes a new section 13(2) to the Criminal Justice Act, 1967.  The net effect of this change is that an accused shall not be sent forward for sentencing under that section without the consent of the DPP or the Attorney General. This could be seen as a corollary to the provision that the person cannot be sent forward for trial without the consent of the DPP.  It would deal in practice with a situation where the DPP did not wish particular charges to be dealt with by the court because he wished to proffer more serious charges.  I accept these provisions are highly technical but I believe the proposed changes will improve the Bill and I hope the House will support the amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) This section shall not affect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the operation of any other enactment that imposes further restrictions on the extent to which information relating to court proceedings may be published or broadcast, or</P>
      <P>(b) any power conferred on a court by such an enactment to make an order authorising the publication or broadcast of such information.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some criticisms on Second Stage of the provisions of section 9 of the Bill which proposes to insert a new section 4J in the Criminal Procedures Act, 1967, dealing with the question of proceedings not to be published or broadcast.  Some of the comments then could be taken to suggest that what is at issue here is the imposition of a new draconian prohibition on the reporting of court proceedings but <Col N="739" /> that is not the case.  All that is being proposed is to include in the Bill a provision which mirrors virtually exactly the existing section 17 of the Criminal Procedures Act which deals with the reporting of preliminary hearings.  The new section deals with the reporting of the proceedings which will take place under the new procedures.</P>
      <P>I trust that explanation will allay any fears which have arisen in this regard.  In any event, one of the effects of amendment No. 4 will be to make it clear that the new section 4J will not affect any power conferred on a court by any other enactment to make an order authorising the publication or broadcast of information relating to the proceedings.  On the other hand, there are other statutory provisions which impose more severe restrictions on the publication or broadcast of information relating to court proceedings, for example, sections 7 and 8 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, preserved the anonymity of rape victims and persons accused of that offence. A further purpose of this amendment is to remove any doubt that might arise in relation to the operation of the provisions in those other Acts.  Subsection (4)(a) of the new section 4J will state that any Act which imposes further restrictions on the extent to which information may be published or broadcast will not be affected by the provisions of section 4J.  There is nothing sinister afoot in the proposed provisions and I hope the House can accept the amendment as an improvement to the proposed new section 4J.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises in the context of provisions of Part IV of the Bill which essentially introduce automatic court inquiries in the case of a person convicted of a drug trafficking offence.  The amendment proposes to add a provision to section 11 as a counterbalance to the proposed criminal sanctions to the effect that any information given to the court under this section will not be admissible in any proceedings from an offence.  This is to ensure that the amended section 11 is not left open to criticism that it imposes an obligation of self incrimination on an offender.  I believe this amendment will strengthen the provisions of Part IV.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (1), lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;, if it considers it appropriate to do so,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that we take into consideration guilty pleas and that they should not be excluded, as seems possible in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Section 28(1) reads:</P>
    <P>In determining what sentence to pass on a person who has pleaded guilty to an offence, other than an offence for which the sentence is fixed by law, a court, if it considers it appropriate to do so, shall take into account&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the stage in the proceedings for the offence at which the person indicated an intention to plead guilty, and</P>
    <P>(b) the circumstances in which this indication was given.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;if it considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo; on the basis that there is a time honoured practice that a guilty plea is always taken into consideration along with the stage in the proceedings at which an intention to plead guilty is indicated.  It is not a case of whether the court considers it appropriate to take a guilty plea into account; this should be enshrined in law as a right and the circumstances should be taken into consideration as well.</P>
    <P>It is strange that there should be any consideration of appropriateness in this respect.  A guilty plea saves the court much time and normally results in a sentence being reduced.  It is in the interests of justice that the court should at all times consider a guilty plea as well as the stage at which such a plea is made along with the circumstances and context.  It is a simple amendment which would ensure that a court would take these matters into consideration.  It also ensures that both the court's time and taxpayers&rsquo; money will be saved.  It is in line with existing practice, which is accepted by members of the Judiciary in terms of court procedures.  The Legislature is anxious to ensure that as many cases as possible can be fasttracked through the courts, particularly drug related cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the nature of Senator Costello's amendment, but I do not feel it should be accepted.  The section gives a certain discretion to the courts, which is important.  We should take into consideration Senator Costello's point that the amendment would save money and effort, as well as the time both of the courts and the Garda Síochána in trying to prove cases. However, each case must stand or fall on its merits. We cannot agree that just because somebody pleads guilty <i>per se,</i> there should be automatic sentence reductions because that will depend on the circumstances, for example, it could be the person's second or third conviction.  I am certain that when counsel argues on behalf of the accused in a case where there is a guilty plea, all these circumstances will be put before the court which, in its humanity and discretion, will consider each case on its merits.  Even though I see much merit in what Senator Costello said, there would be a greater danger in accepting his amendment that injustices would occur in the long term.  It is prudent to allow the discretion of the court which the <Col N="743" /> legislation covers both significantly and appropriately. The matter should be left in the hands of the court while taking all aspects of individual cases into consideration.  Every case differs and consequently I feel that, while Senator Costello is sincere, to delete these words might be a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection in the Bill overrules a decision of the Supreme Court in the <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v G,</i> 1993, that it is wrong in principle to impose the maximum sentence in response to a guilty plea.  One High Court judge, Mr. Justice Carney, has repeatedly criticised this ruling and the Minister appears to have taken this criticism on board.  What the Minister has blithely ignored, however, are the important justifications for granting mitigation in response to a guilty plea.  Guilty pleas save a great deal of court time and they will often be a strong indication of remorse.  Most important of all, however, a guilty plea saves the victim from the trauma of having to give evidence and undergo cross examination.  This is very important in rape and sexual assault cases, as the Supreme Court emphasised in the leading case on rape sentence, <i>DPP v Tiernan,</i> back in 1988.</P>
      <P>In cases involving sexual and other forms of violence, it is primarily in the interests of the victim that a reduction is given for a guilty plea.  The Minister is showing very scant consideration of the needs of victims who are at their most vulnerable in a criminal trial.  If the section is enacted as it is now written it will prove to be a strong disincentive to defendants to plead guilty as there is no longer any guarantee that they will be rewarded with a reduction in sentence.</P>
      <P>There may be some exceptional circumstances when an offender is deemed to be so dangerous to the public that he or she should be given an indeterminate life sentence, or other maximum sentence, notwithstanding the fact that he or she has pleaded guilty.  This should only happen, however, in truly exceptional cases when both the circumstances of the offence and those of the offender are specifically identified by the sentencing judge as meriting such a course of action.  This is what Senator Costello's amendment will achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of the words &ldquo;if it considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo; is considered desirable so as not to make it an absolute requirement on all courts to take such matters into account in relation to all offences.  This is for the very practical reason that the provision relates to all offences.  For example, it would hardly be necessary or desirable for a court to look into these matters as regards routine road traffic offences.  There is in existence case law in relation to when it is appropriate for the courts to take guilty pleas into account.  While the proposed <Col N="744" /> section places aspects of that law on a statutory basis, I do not believe it will supplant that case law to the extent that the law already deals with when it is appropriate to take into account guilty pleas.  In that sense, the point of the amendment is already met under our law.</P>
      <P>As I have explained, the amendment would require a court to take into account guilty pleas and, in particular, the circumstances in which they were made in the most routine of cases, and there would clearly be no benefit to be gained from that.  On the contrary, it might needlessly clog up the operation of the courts and, in the circumstances, I would not be disposed to accepting amendment No. 8.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 in the name of Senator Costello relates to section 28(2), which, for avoidance of doubt, makes it clear that a court is not precluded from passing the maximum sentence notwithstanding a guilty plea where it is satisfied that the circumstances of the offence warrant the maximum sentence.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to provide that where there is a guilty plea, the maximum penalty could only be applied in exceptional circumstances.  That probably reflects case law as it stands and I am not sure that the amendment is necessary.  I understand the thinking behind it and I ask Senator Costello if he would allow me further time to reflect on the matter addressed in amendment No. 9 between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think the Minister should reconsider both amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  I am delighted to hear that she will have a look at amendment No. 9 &mdash; I presume it will be a positive fresh look at the matter.</P>
      <P>If there is no indication that at the stage of the proceedings in which a guilty plea is entered and the circumstances of it there will be any effect on the sentence, obviously nobody will enter a guilty plea.  The legislation needs to indicate more strongly that the time at which a guilty plea is entered and the circumstances in which it is entered will have a bearing on the outcome of the sentence, as it does largely in legislation to date and in practice.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt it would have an enormous effect on the operation of the courts in addition to it undoubtedly saving victims from the undue and unnecessary emotional and psychological hardship and suffering to which Senator Connor referred.  From a practical point of view, it would seem that amendment No. 8 would have a most beneficial effect on the operation of the courts and on the effect on persons involved in a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28(2) states that anything in section 28(1) will &ldquo;not preclude a court from passing the maximum sentence prescribed by law&rdquo; so there is a double take on that.  Having taken those into consideration, the court can still impose the maximum sentence.  That is included in the legislation. <Col N="745" /> Therefore, the Minister need not worry that anybody will get off lightly if she accepts amendment No. 8.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 refers to a practice which largely operates at present.  I am satisfied that there is a need to state &ldquo;the exceptional circumstances of the offence&rdquo;, and the Minister said she will consider that further.</P>

      <P>With regard to the judgment to which Senator Connor referred, this was discussed in detail in the Law Reform Commission report on sentencing. The point is made clear that it is not required by law always to reduce the sentence where there is a guilty plea.  It is implicit in what the Law Reform Commission said that it would regard the provision as consistent with the Supreme Court judgment to which Senator Connor referred.</P>
      <P>In any event, we will look at adding the word &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to make a correction to the title to Part VI of the Bill which does not require a formal amendment.  Arising out of the House's acceptance of amendments Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, the title to Part VI of the Bill, which currently refers only to extradition, will be changed to refer to extradition and other matters. This change, which does not require a formal amendment, will be taken into account when the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, is printed.</P>

    <Title>Passports for Investment: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the need to maintain Ireland's standing in the international community, calls on the Government to introduce legislation to outlaw the issue of Irish passports as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for investment in Irish enterprises.</P>
      <P>I move the motion against the background of two events.  I feel strongly about this matter and my view on it is different from that which I would have expressed five years ago.  Those two events were partially responsible for my change of view and I would like to convince the Government to change its view also.</P>
      <P>The first event is our imminent acceptance as a founding member of Economic and Monetary Union.  That should remind us very forcefully we are now playing in the big league.  From now on, our behaviour must reflect our new status and we must accept our responsibilities as a nation.</P>
      <P>There was a time when we could use our economic condition as an excuse to do anything we liked.  We used to beg funds from Europe and get derogations from any European regulations which did not suit us.  We used our condition to set up a tax regime for inward investment which gave us a competitive edge over our EU partners. Our mindset has been that nothing should stand in the way of the creation of even one job.  That was an appropriate attitude ten years ago but I want to convince the Minister and the Government that is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> We have the fastest growing economy in the world.  We create 50,000 jobs every year and we are already having problems filling some of them. We can no longer justify bending any rules or engaging in any dubious or devious practices to create jobs.  We must continue to create jobs, of course, but we must also live up to our responsibilities as a prosperous member of the European Union and EMU.  We should make the selling of Irish nationality illegal because the time has passed when we could behave as a cowboy state, like some Latin American banana republics.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is the recent controversy concerning Irish registered non resident companies. The public was shocked recently to find these vehicles are being used by money launderers and drug barons from around the world.  Similar to the sale of Irish passports, these non-resident companies are a threat to our international standing. Selling passports is one side of the coin and allowing letter box companies to use our good name is another.  The widespread public concern about the recent revelations concerning non-resident companies extends also to the sale of passports. The same issues are at stake in both areas.</P>
    <P>The motion calls specifically for legislation to ban the sale of passports.  I wish to explain why we must take the extreme step of making this practice illegal, with no exceptions whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We have had a passports for investment scheme since 1988.  It was a very different world then.  Our economic recovery was just beginning and it may have seemed reasonable to look for any way to bring in outside investment and create jobs.  In addition, there were many rich people in Hong Kong who knew its days as a British colony were coming to a close and were beginning to look for another base.  It may have seemed reasonable at that time to try to attract some of that wealth.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, the world has changed in the past ten years.  Our recovery took off and we soon passed the point of needing last ditch measures, such as the sale of passports.  The rich Chinese chose, for the most part, to go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>However, two other things also happened.  The international drugs trade continued to grow but had to work harder and harder to launder its money, as governments worldwide started to make life tough for it.  At the same time the collapse of the Soviet Union created a tidal wave of crime and corruption that soon spilled over into the rest of the world.  The result was that there was a whole new class of customers for schemes like selling passports and offering facilities for dummy companies.  Some of those came to Ireland.  I do not suggest that everybody who got an Irish passport in return for a promise of investment was a dubious character.  I am sure some of them are quite genuine and have become upstanding Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>One of the problems, however, is that the vetting system &mdash; such as it was &mdash; was apparently <Col N="749" /> unable to distinguish between the desirable and the undesirable.  The upshot is the horror stories we have all seen from time to time in the papers and, more importantly, which the rest of the world has seen as well.  We should all be worried about this fact.  The exploits of a few highly colourful characters have created a widespread impression abroad that Irish passports are easy to come by if you have enough cash to put up front. The damage that this does to our international reputation is incalculable.</P>
    <P>This bad publicity happens despite some efforts by successive Irish Governments to keep the scheme as quiet as possible.  Nobody was very happy with it from the start, especially the Civil Service.  But still it continued, giving rise on the way to one or two highly publicised scandals that no doubt we will hear more about in the course of this debate.  Eventually, in September 1996, the scheme was suspended pending a review of all the ramifications of the scheme.  The review seems to be still going on.  The general expectation is that there will be proposals for a more tightly regulated scheme that will be enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>However, despite the fact that the scheme was meant to be suspended, some passports continue to be issued in return for the promise of investment. The circumstances appear to be that, in the run up to the last general election, some passports were issued because they carried the promise of job creation or job retention in some key constituencies. Whether this is true or not, the Cabinet of the time did overturn the suspension of the scheme and allowed a number of passports to be issued.</P>
    <P>I want to be realistic about this, particularly as there are local elections coming up.  Elections put tremendous pressures on politicians and they tend to reach for whatever means are available to them.  Giving Ministers and Governments the power to issue Irish passports in this way is putting too strong a temptation in their way.  In the short life of this scheme there have been questionable incidents involving two Taoisigh and a Tánaiste.  That clearly shows this is a temptation that can go right to the top.  Any legislation that regulated the sale of passports, however tightly, while still leaving it open as a last resort for decisions to be made at the discretion of individual Ministers or even the Government as a whole should be unacceptable.  We can cast the net even wider than that, bypassing the political problem altogether.</P>
    <P>The key issue here is Ireland's international standing.  A reputation is something you either have or you have not.  It is a question of absolutes. The outside world will perceive us as either selling passports or not.  The outside world has no time to spare for a complicated concept like &ldquo;Ireland does sell passports but it controls the sale very carefully.&rdquo; Even if true, it is not a believable stance.  Therefore, we should legislate <Col N="750" /> and legislate promptly to outlaw the sale of Irish nationality altogether.</P>
    <P>I conclude by considering a possible objection to this forthright approach.  Over the past number of years the IDA has done a wonderful job in attracting business to Ireland and I congratulate them for it.  But the IDA will object to such a ban and say it may inhibit inward investment into Ireland.  They are already saying that about the non-resident companies, even though they do not have a leg to stand on.  We have to be able to say to the IDA in a forceful manner that we are not prepared to buy inward investment at any price.</P>
    <P>Just as we are not prepared to compromise our environment in order to attract undesirable investment, we should be prepared to tell them that we are not prepared to compromise our nationality either.  In any case, the number of jobs that could be created by selling passports is tiny in the context of the overall flow of inward investment.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to stop compromising our principles.  In Ireland, of all places, we should be more proud of our nationality than this scheme suggests.  We should reserve the privilege of Irish citizenship strictly for those who pursue the traditional naturalisation route.  We should award citizenship solely on a proven record of commitment to this country, as demonstrated by a history of residence here.</P>
    <P>In turning our backs definitively against this cowboy practice we will be making a choice.  Do we want to be seen as a full mature member of the European Community, ready to live up to all the responsibilities that implies; or do we want to be seen as a fly-by-night State that is prepared to sell even the symbols of its sovereignty to anyone who turns up on its doorstep with a big cheque? I believe we have no choice in this debate and commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Quinn for moving this motion.  Many people are concerned with this issue.  I have never understood how this system works.  How does the passport for jobs system work? Are people being persuaded by the IDA to invest in Ireland because they have been offered a passport? Have we reached the situation where we are now attempting to give the impression of a modern, mature democracy which has found its place in economic growth and development? Is this image being brought forward by handing out passports to people investing in this country? I believe we will be facilitating, by the continuation of the passports for sale regime, a bona fide, money laundering system for hot money from various parts of the world.  I do not like the fact that this money is finding its way into the Irish economy and is untraceable.  We should be walking away from such a situation as there is no longer any need for it.  We should be dealing with the needs of today, <Col N="751" /> the image we are trying to project and the future we are trying to give our young people.</P>
      <P>Passports have to be a symbol of independence, nationhood, nationality and something about which we can pride ourselves.  This cannot be the case if passports are being bought and sold, if passports are being made available to foreign nationals who have no commitment to the country, if passports are being made available to people who have not gone through a process of naturalisation or have not shown a commitment to being Irish citizens and all that that entails.</P>
      <P>When I think of passports being bought and sold I conjure up an image of a B movie of the 1950s where people in shady circumstances are trading with each other and finding a sheaf of passports to use.  What is the European position on all of this? How many European passports may one person hold? Is there any limit on the number of passports which an individual who is a citizen of the European Union can hold? Is there any limit on the number of other passports from outside the EU jurisdiction that such a person can hold? What does European citizenship mean when we provide Irish passports to people who have the money? What kind of people are we attracting with this scheme? Do we have to give a passport to the head of IBM? Do we have to give a passport to the head of blue chip companies who want to invest in this country? Did we give passports to the major computer firms located in this country? I think not.</P>
      <P>This scheme is being made available to people who are less than appropriate for this type of involvement.  What does it all mean? Does it mean that these people who were not born in Ireland, and whose parents and grandparents were not born here either, can get a passport if they have £1 million for investment in this country? When this question was previously discussed it was not clear that the commitments given by applicants for passports were honoured.</P>
      <P>Senators and Deputies from all parties have expressed their misgivings about this scheme.  We cannot prostitute our citizenship, our nationhood or our passports in an unnecessary attempt to attract investment.  We have allowed our passports to become a flag of convenience for people who wish to establish international reputations for themselves and who find it convenient to wave an Irish passort.  There are corners of the world where holders of Irish passports receive a welcome which would not otherwise be there for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain aura and magic attaches to Irish citizenship. If word goes out that this can be bought, the integrity of Irish citizenship will be diminished. An ordinary Irish citizen is required to jump through more hoops in order to receive a passport than a foreigner with a large amount of money.  An Irish citizen must have forms signed by a member of the Garda and furnish proof of <Col N="752" /> identity.  This scheme makes a nonsense of equality in the eyes of the law.  Citizenship is a birthright.  One cannot put a monetary value on citizenship.  It cannot be traded.  Since the foundation of the State judges have stated that one cannot put a price on a constitutional right.  Neither can we put a price on citizenship.  This is what the passports for sale scheme seeks to do.  It must be ended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substituted the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) Welcomes the contribution made to the Irish economy by non-nationals who have invested in Ireland, many of whom were subsequently naturalised.</P>
      <P>(b) Notes and welcomes the fact that, since his appointment, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has suspended the operation of the scheme for naturalisation arising from investment pending a review which will be determined by Government shortly. </P>
      <P>I concur with many of the views expressed by my colleagues across the floor.  I am not privy to the Minister's mind nor to the deliberations at the Cabinet table but it is my understanding that this matter is under review and that a decision will be taken by the Government when that review has been completed.  Each application for naturalisation will be examined individually.  Applications for naturalisation must be fully scrutinised and I would not accept that money acquired by illegal activity, whether from drug trafficking or not, should be brought into this country.</P>
      <P>There are, however, parts of the country which would be disadvantaged by the abolition of the scheme.  I would caution that all aspects of the question be looked at.  I see huge potential for job creation and development in the mariculture and aquaculture industries throughout rural Ireland. If such an industry in the west of Ireland could be kick-started by a considerable foreign investment and if the source of the investment was properly scrutinised and controlled it might be a good thing.  A fish processing factory in my own area requires an investment of £8 million.  This factory would provide 200 jobs.  We are told that European money is fast disappearing and there are parts of rural Ireland where the Celtic tiger has never been seen.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that tourism is our fastest growing industry and that it will soon supersede agriculture it still requires considerable investment in peripheral areas far from the Pale.  My constituency, which runs from Cork city to Castletownbeare, does not have a single mile of national primary route.  The late John L. O'Sullivan fought for this for many decades without success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> I have been involved for many years in a national monuments committee.  Our budget from Cork County Council is less than £100,000 per annum.  Throughout our county there are archaeological sites and buildings of historical and architectural interest which could be protected and restored.  Hundreds of such projects in County Cork alone fight for a share of the paltry budget.  Foreign investment could be channelled into these areas which have been neglected by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I urge caution.  The Government proposes that the operation of the scheme in the period 1988-96 be examined.  In a written answer to Deputy O'Keeffe in the other House, the Minister stated that from 1988 to 1994 an annual average of 250 applications for naturalisation were reported and logged in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Excluding the passports for sale scenarios, how many Irish passports have been issued to rich people from abroad? How many jobs, if any, were these people responsible for creating? If jobs were not created, why is that the case? The notion of issuing a person from China or Hong Kong who invests £2 million in Ireland with a passport and wishing them good luck makes Senator Quinn's case.  That is not adequate or sufficient and I do not condone such behaviour.</P>
    <P>There is merit in reconsidering the scheme and carefully reviewing how it has worked to date.  As Senator Quinn stated, in 1988 the Celtic tiger had not yet been born.  I accept his point but who can say whether the situation which prevailed in 1988 will not revisit us during the next ten years? Do we close off and totally abolish the scheme <i>per se</i> or do we appraise the matter and consider how many passports were issued, how many jobs were created and identify the areas of the country which benefited? No millionaires have settled in my area and created employment.</P>
    <P>The scheme should be reconsidered.  If it can be maintained in a strict fashion and if, in conjunction with the IDA which probably backed its initial introduction, it promotes the creation of jobs, the scheme should not be completely abolished. As already stated, the amendment to the motion indicates that the Government is reviewing the matter and the issue of seized passports has been put on ice.  Consequently, we should wait until the report is made available by the Minister to the Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Quinn on proposing this motion.  The case he made is persuasive, all the more so for the restrained way in which he put forward his views.  It would have been easy for the Senator to court headlines by quoting some of the more lurid examples of what occurred under the provisions of this scheme.  He chose instead to adhere to the level of principle and international best practice and his case was all the stronger for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> Senator Quinn was honest enough to state that his views on this issue have changed diametrically in recent years.  There is no doubt that the scheme was popular with business people when it first came to public notice which is the way it should have been.  The scheme represented free money, interest free loans and investment without any strings attached.  It was perceived as manna from heaven and welcomed, particularly by those with good ideas who could not find funding elsewhere, those with businesses going through sticky periods and those, as Senator O'Donovan stated, in areas where investment was needed.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that many honest people availed of the scheme over the years.  I have no doubt that inward investment provided through the scheme came at a time when such investment was scarce.  I do not doubt that jobs have been created and saved through the scheme, that shaky companies have been propped up and stabilised and that financial aid not otherwise available was made available during difficult periods.  I accept that the scheme was conceived in good faith at a bleak time in the country's economic history.  I also accept that it was in no way unique to Ireland because other countries sought to attract valuable capital investment, particularly from Arab and Pacific Rim countries and Hong Kong, which was facing an uncertain future.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the level of political pressure exerted when a scheme of this sort is in operation.  Perhaps he has less experience of that than those of us who belong to political parties. All Members have experience of being lobbied by often desperate people whose only chance to save their businesses and jobs depended on the availability of finance through this scheme.  Enormous pressure was exerted on Governments by Deputies, Senators and community groups.  At times it was almost heartbreaking when one could see the consequences of an investment which would save real jobs for real people as against the consequences of that investment not being made available.  From my experience and that of others, I have no doubt that the greater part of the pressure from Deputies and Senators in respect of passports came in the context of saving real jobs for real people.</P>
    <P>That said, however, I believe there is no continuing justification for the scheme.  I say this for two reasons.  First, from a national point of view, it is demeaning.  A passport is a badge of identity and nationhood, it is not a single transferable option or something to be bought or sold.  It is something which demands loyalty and commitment from its holder and, most emphatically, it is not something which can become part of trade and barter.  At this stage of our economic development, whatever reasons there may have been for this scheme in the past &mdash; Senator Quinn outlined these earlier &mdash; are no more.  In our present economic prosperity and state of development, we should and must be able to <Col N="755" /> stand on our own and we should have no need for schemes of this nature.</P>
    <P>The second reason I oppose this scheme involves its history.  Between 1988 and 1994, the scheme was virtually a State secret and was operated personally by the Taoisigh of the day, Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Albert Reynolds. We know of some of the things that happened during that period.  That we know is no thanks to those who operated the scheme.  It was not one of the secrets they chose to share with us.  In those days, the scheme was the antithesis of openness and transparency.  It led to justified public suspicion which was accentuated by the obvious lack of accountability.  Apart from short and obscure notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> there was no mechanism to inform the public of what was happening. There was no way of assuring the public that the people being granted the privilege of an Irish passport and all that goes with it were honest. There was no guarantee that these people did not have criminal or unsavoury connections, that there was a rigorous vetting of applications or that, in the process of granting passports, bribes were not offered or received.</P>
    <P>The operation of the scheme may have been as pure as the driven snow but, if it was, why the secrecy? Why hide what went on? There is no doubt that in the minds of most ordinary people a cloud of suspicion hangs over the scheme. There is also no doubt that the widespread publicity which the abuses and excesses of the scheme have attracted worldwide have done our reputation for fiscal probity considerable harm.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, the circumstances in which the scheme operates have been changed and tightened up.  The level of scrutiny of schemes and applicants has been placed on a formal and multidepartmental basis.  The level of scrutiny and vetting is now much more intense and the number of applications granted has decreased dramatically. However, no amount of tinkering with the scheme will make it acceptable because it is fundamentally and intrinsically unsound.  The scheme is open to misunderstanding, misrepresentation and corruption.  There is something about it of the huckster prepared to sell a birthright for a doubtful gain.  I want to see the end of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, as Senator O'Donovan suggested &mdash; although in my opinion he shares the concerns of Members on this side of the House &mdash; that a better, safer form of the scheme is possible. The Government has had enough time to consider the scheme and reach a conclusion.  As I understand it, Senator Dardis's party had serious doubts about the scheme when in Opposition. What I am saying now, he could have said from this side of the House a year ago.  I will be interested to hear if he shares the views I have expressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> We have gone too far to tinker around with the scheme.  The principle of the scheme is unsound and, as Senator Quinn said rightly, we cannot afford to be viewed internationally as less than 100 per cent honest in the way in which we conduct our financial business.  The scheme is a source of scandal for many.  It demeans public life and is beyond redemption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental question posed is the price of citizenship, the right to vote and to carry a passport.  What price would the founding fathers of the State have paid? In many cases they paid with their lives to ensure that we have the right of citizenship and our own sovereignty.  In such circumstances, is it appropriate that anybody should be able to inject a large sum of money into the economy and be granted a passport and citizenship as a result? My party's view is that such a facility should not be afforded.</P>
      <P>There is another issue at the heart of this matter. Do we apply one standard to a person fleeing from persecution who arrives seeking asylum or as a refugee who is granted the right to stay? Should they get a passport without going through the due process and without having to fulfil the residency requirements? On the other hand, do we turn a blind eye when a lot of money is involved? At a time when much inward investment was required one could understand the background to and the reasoning behind the scheme's introduction.  However, it is a bad scheme and it should be ended.</P>
      <P>As I understand it the Government is conducting a review of the scheme and I hope that review will be concluded rapidly, that we will be made aware of the results and that the scheme will be ended.  There is a category of persons in a somewhat anomalous position.  Some people may have applied for citizenship or a passport but because of the suspension of the scheme those applications have not been processed.  They should be adjudicated upon, one way or the other, before the scheme is ended.  The people involved applied on the understanding that the scheme was in place and they would be able to avail of it.  We await the review and hope it will end the practice.</P>
      <P>I do not believe legislation would be required to end the scheme.  It should simply be brought to an end.  There is no legislative basis for the present scheme as I understand it, although I am open to correction on that point and I am sure the Minister will clarify the matter.  I accept Senator Quinn's points about the responsibilities which EU membership imposes on us and the citizenship of the EU which is additional to Irish citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other fundamental point at issue is why the applicants under this scheme need the passports. What is it that makes a US citizen, for example, want an Irish passport? I do not understand the reasoning for it.  It has been suggested that if they <Col N="757" /> were travelling in the Middle East they would not want to produce an American passport in certain countries and that an Irish passport would be more acceptable.  If that is the case it is a strong reason they should not be granted a passport.  If an Irish passport has that credibility in certain states, which I believe it has, it is a precious commodity and must be protected in the interests of the wider society of legitimate Irish citizens carrying Irish passports.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to vetting.  I wonder if in the past the vetting was as rigorous as it might have been in the context of large sums of money being involved.  It is easy to fill in the forms.  We have heard of cases in which it is alleged that people bought homes in which they never lived but which were just a means of complying with the technicalities of the scheme.  Some did not even do that and that there was not the degree of control or vetting there should have been.</P>
    <P>It is easy to dangle the carrot, so to speak, and to defend doing so on the basis of the jobs created by the money brought into the country.  However, that is not a good enough reason for the scheme. Senator Manning is right to say that there were community activities and industries on a knife edge and the money was badly needed.  In such circumstances it was surely the State's obligation to provide funds under schemes exercised by it, rather than getting money under this scheme. Thankfully, because of our economic buoyancy, we have resources to intervene to help such companies. That is how it should be done rather than by the sale of passports.  It is as if there were a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and it did not matter how we got to it as long as we did so.</P>
    <P>It would appear that there was a degree of secrecy involved.  I am sure there were commercial confidentialities involved.  However, there should have been transparency, if only to the extent of publishing widely the names of those who had made applications.  This might have alerted someone in the police, for example, who might have known if something was wrong.  For example, the scheme might have been a means of routing money into the country, paying a commission on it and routing it out again on an illegal basis.  Such activity would undermine our international financial reputation.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme will end.  I am prepared to wait for the review to be conducted.  In the meantime the applications which are outstanding, in some cases for a considerable time, should be adjudicated upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is about the need to maintain Ireland's standing in the international community and it calls on the Government to introduce legislation to outlaw the issue of passports as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for investment in Irish enterprises.  This practice does not help to maintain our international standing.  There have been <Col N="758" /> many articles about apparent abuses of this scheme and, more recently, there have been articles about the Irish registered non-resident companies which are also damaging.</P>
      <P>This is a dubious practice.  It should not be necessary to legislate to end it because the right to a passport is the right of every Irish citizen.  It is first mentioned in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, where part of the business of the then Department of External Affairs is stated to include the granting of passports and visas.  In the normal course passports are not issued to nonIrish citizens.  Therefore, citizenship is a precondition to obtaining a passport.  There is something basically wrong with selling citizenship.  Apart from being wrong, it is not needed in a practical sense because the so-called Celtic tiger is bounding, leaping and roaring ahead and there is no need to compromise with regard to citizenship. As Senator Manning and others said, a passport is a badge of identity, a symbol of nationality.  We do not have to allow people in overnight without being naturalised and provide them with Irish passports.  Equally, we should not allow citizens of other states to adopt a flag of convenience as it suits them simply because they are in a position to buy it under this so-called investment for naturalisation scheme.</P>
      <P>There have been abuses and excesses, and big names within and without the State have been involved.  The scheme has been brought into disrepute and it has damaged the country.  For example, on 4 September 1992 <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> listed 11 Saudi Arabian and Pakistani nationals who were granted certificates of naturalisation on 8 December 1990.  All gave an address in County Meath and apparently no one has lived there since 1990.  The awarding of a passport is supposed to be directly linked under the scheme to specific job creation projects.  The supposed project in this case was linked, according to the IDA, to investment in an equestrian centre.  When did the IDA become involved in the horse business? Yet, four years later Meath County Council was in a position to confirm no application has been made to it for such a development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application for naturalisation must be accompanied by character references from three Irish citizens.  In this instance, the Department of Justice, when asked afterwards to provide the names of those who proposed the 11 individuals or the group in question for naturalisation, either collectively or individually, refused to supply the information.  It was also asked how much investment was made and where and when it was made. Again it refused to supply the information.  Two of the 11 people to whom Irish citizenship was granted together with the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia were sued by the liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in regard to its collapse.  This was a huge banking scam and scandal involving two principals who were accorded Irish citizenship on <Col N="759" /> foot of references from three Irish citizens, who presumably testified to the effect that they had an intimate acquaintance with the applicants and could vouch for their good characters.  However, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform still refuses to divulge the who, when and where surrounding the applications.</P>
    <P>An applicant apparently is required to provide on the application form particulars of any proceedings, civil or criminal, taken against him or her in courts of law in this State or elsewhere. Was this information supplied and, if so, was it accurate? The normal procedure for the issuance of certificates of naturalisation is that they are signed by an appropriate official at Secretary level in the Department, yet in these cases the certificates were signed by the then Minister for Justice.  The granting of these passports was made in highly unusual circumstances and apparently in breach of statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>A number of questions remain unanswered. Why was such an extra special interest taken in these passport applications? Who oversaw the details and arrangements leading to the granting of those passports? Who were the three people who provided character references in the case of each of the applicants? Given the manifest wealth of the individuals in question and the apparent hands on involvement in the issuance of the passports, what level of investment were the individuals to make in return for them? Was the investment to be a global figure for all, or was each to make an individual investment? Was there ultimately any figure invested in a project? If so, what was the figure and with what was the project concerned? Did the individuals whose names were listed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> ever visit the country or live here and, if they did, how long did they stay?</P>
    <P>These are legitimate questions which should be answered.  The refusal to answer them not only shows a brazen defiance, but a contempt of the legitimate right to know proper procedures were in place and if they were followed.  It also leads to a justifiable suspicion that something serious was amiss.  The questions will not go away.  At what stage did responsibility for the issuance of the passports transfer to the then Taoiseach and who was the official in his Department with responsibility for the issue?</P>
    <P>In the past, former Deputy Michael McDowell, was scathing in his criticism of the scheme and enunciated eloquently on the matter.  How does the Tánaiste stand on the issue? A number of other passports were issued at various times involving big names in this State.  We have seen by virtue of self-evident abuses that it was a foolish exercise for us ever to be involved and it has proved rather demeaning.  How can we sell a constitutional right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment but I have reservations about the operation of the scheme.  The perception abroad in regard to it tends to underline that the investment based naturalisation scheme is being hogged by international shysters and shady businessmen to launder their ill gotten gains among an unsuspecting Irish business community.  Given recent controversies and the difficulties experienced in making the scheme more effective, less controversial and more transparent, the view has gained currency that successive Governments in a clandestine manner &mdash; Senator Manning probably does not agree &mdash; conspired to promote the continuation of the scheme at serious risk to the integrity and international status of the Irish passport.</P>
      <P>While I reject these allegations and assertions, there are fundamental difficulties with the operation of the scheme.  Obviously, the Minister agrees because he saw fit to suspend its operation pending a review.  One of the main difficulties in regard to the operation of the scheme is an effort to strike a balance in a pragmatic way between the need to encourage inward investment on the one hand, and, on the other, to ensure the operation of the scheme in promoting such funding does not in any way damage our reputation internationally and the status of the Irish passport.  It is extremely difficult to strike such a balance, but nevertheless to advocate, as the motion does, that the scheme be scrapped and outlawed is not founded on a great degree of pragmatism and, as politicians, we must be pragmatic.</P>
      <P>However, that is not to take away from the merits of many of the views expressed by Senator Quinn, Senator O'Toole and Senator Manning about the need to uphold at all times the highest integrity with regard to our passport in the international arena. Our passport has a good status and is held in high regard internationally, which is one of the primary reasons for the high level of interest among foreign entrepreneurs in investing in Ireland &mdash; they are anxious to avail of an Irish passport.  In the past the process was too simple.  As Senator Manning said, we do not have much information about the operation of this scheme, which seems to be the position internationally also.</P>
      <P>We are not alone in operating such schemes &mdash; the Canadians operate one which is highly successful. I do not have the full history of the scheme, but some years ago Canada identified a problem with inward investment and this scheme was extremely successful in attracting investment from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must strike the pragmatic balance referred to at the outset.  The scheme can continue but significant reforms must be made.  One way in which <Col N="761" /> public confidence can be won and maintained is by making the scheme more transparent.  It cannot be reduced to the point where one discloses details of the applicants because an individual has the right to privacy until his or her application is processed by a Government Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That right applies across the board.  However, an annual report should of necessity, be laid before the Dáil on an ongoing basis, outlining the operation of the scheme.  This report should ensure on the basis of published criteria that the scheme as it operates is beyond reproach.  If that pragmatic balance can be in struck I am in favour of its continuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Táim in aghaidh an rún agus aontaím leis an leasú.  I agree with much of what Senator Fitzgerald said.  A number of speakers said the present system is open to abuse, that an element of bribery and corruption is attached to it as a result of maladministration and that people of ill-repute have availed of it.  Such problems must be corrected because the efficacy of our financial system and the reputation of our country is at issue.  Passports must be protected and valued and the administration of the scheme should reflect that.</P>
      <P>However, there is another side to the coin.  We do not have sufficient information to evaluate everyone who participated but I am aware of companies fortunate enough to have availed of finance as a result of the passport scheme, some of which could have gone into liquidation with the loss of a considerable number of jobs.  The challenge to us is to devise a system which eradicates the failures of the present scheme but preserves what is of value.  The economic climate is good at present but we do not have to cast our minds back too far, only a decade, to find different economic conditions where inward investment was critical to generate economic activity and address unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach is to suspend the operation of the present scheme pending analysis and review.  I hope that from this will emerge a new, streamlined scheme which will ensure that bona fide investments will be preserved and that only people of good repute will qualify.  It is essential that we do not become too self-righteous; there is a danger that we react to the latest headline and throw out the baby with the bathwater, so I urge caution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Shame on Senator Dardis for drawing attention to his absence.  I referred to him as the flying column but the Senator has revealed him in all his political nakedness.  Senator Fitzgerald said that no information should be divulged about these people in advance of being granted passports.  Why not? What about freedom of information? Why should we not know? I understand the argument for concealing someone's identity when he or she is accused of a crime but has anyone suggested that the possession of or the desire to possess an Irish passport is itself criminal? No one here would want to sustain that argument.  If they are bona fide applicants why should we not know who they are and why they want an Irish passport? I want to know why people of such eminence want our passport.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the opening of a division on the other side of the House.  I honour Senator Dardis for his honest examination of the subject, although I regret he took one of the points I intended to make.  However, I will elaborate on it because he has isolated the principal moral dilemma.  Some of these people are pretty unsavoury but one thing they all have in common is enormous amounts of cash and a belief that they can purchase an Irish identity, or at least an Irish passport, for this money.  They are handled with great deference, courtesy and considerable rapidity.  We also know of a large number of people who undoubtedly have cast iron cases for asylum &mdash; I have half a dozen on file.  They are members of prominent families in, for example, north African countries.  They are professional, highly skilled people, many of whose relatives have been butchered because of their political opposition and there is no doubt that they will be killed if they return home.  But they continue to wait for a determination on their asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, we cavalierly dole out passports to people like Mr. Kozeny, who caught the attention of no less a newspaper than the <i>Sunday World.</i>  The paper's story is headlined &ldquo;Pirate of Prague buys Irish passport&rdquo; and appears in the issue of 15 February.  The <i>Sunday World</i> probably followed up a story about this man in <i>The Guardian,</i> which shows he is of considerable interest to both Irish and British newspapers.  He recently bought a house formerly owned by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, calmly paying £12.5 million for it. He is an obscure person who cashed in on the distress of his country, the Czech Republic.  He is an asset stripper who made £300 million and spends it with vulgar ostentation.  He recently went to the La Givroche restaurant in Mayfair, where he started off with a £560 bottle of Krug champagne, followed with lobster mousse, accompanied by a white Burgundy costing £1,400, then a bottle of Romanée Conti costing £5,000, a Chateau Haut-Brion costing £2,100, and a Chateau d'Yquem costing £1,070, at which point <Col N="763" /> he was obviously going downmarket.  He spent £13,000 on one meal.  He is perfectly entitled to do that, but this is money he obtained from pensioners by means of dubious advertisements in Czech newspapers.  He got hold of the miserable little bit of investment that was allowed after the deregulation in Czechoslovakia, £25 for each certificate and this man hoovered them all up and then managed to get away with the proceeds.  He is afraid to go back.  Apparently he makes little hit and run expeditions to Prague and conducts business meetings on the tarmac at Prague airport. He has been accused of using insider information to make these enormous amounts of money.  He is currently speculating in those other distressed countries, Russia and China.  This is someone to whom we are quite happy to give citizenship.</P>
    <P>It was noted in <i>The Guardian</i> that three years ago he traded his Czech nationality for an Irish passport and bought a house in Ireland.  Are we proud of that? Is that the kind of person we want? What has he done in this country? The Government side have no idea of the schemes he has been involved in.  I have not heard of any of them.  I have heard generalised vague talk about some businesses being supported by my colleague from Wexford but he did not specify them.  Businesses were saved because of a last minute £1 million intervention.  They will not last long.  Why does the Government not intervene? Why are we waiting for these fly-by-night speculators to come in and prop up Irish jobs? If those jobs are capable of sustained development then the Government should prop them up.  There is a stink about the whole thing.</P>
    <P>Even when there is investment, we all know perfectly well that it is attracted by politicians.  It is as perks for their international playboy friends and they direct the investment into their own constituencies for personal electoral advantage.  They are not that worried about the welfare of the country.  James Joyce had it right when he said there were people who would not only sell their country for fourpence, but they would get down on their bended knee and they would thank the almighty Christ that they had a country to sell. That is exactly what is happening in this passports for sale scheme.  At least the various Governments who have indulged in it have commanded a reasonably appropriate price of £1 million, which is a good deal better than when they were flogging them out of the basement of the Irish Embassy in London for £10.  That is the difference between the gentleman amateur and the professional.  The various Governments have been professional sellers of their own birthright.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked the question why do people want these passports.  This is a good question to ask, particularly if they are so almighty wealthy.  What is in it for them? Presumably they have already citizenship of some other country.  I was not aware of Americans but I was aware of <Col N="764" /> people from the Middle East and behind the Iron Curtain looking for Irish passports.  If they already have a passport and an identity why do they want it? I suppose they want it for the respectability conferred on them by Irish citizenship. I believe being an Irish citizen is something to be proud of.  Why should we give it to these people without the most scrupulous examination and why should it be bought? This is tantamount to simony.  It is an attempt to project a specific material equivalence for things that should not have a monetary value.  It is like selling something spiritual in which you believe.  It is bad to be involved in that.  They also want it because it is good for travelling.  I travel a good deal and I am very grateful to have an Irish passport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as inserted by section 5 of the lrish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice can waive the usual conditions for naturalisation provided the applicant has &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;.  It is under this provision that applications for citizenship in exchange for investment are approved.  The provision has, since the 1980s, been interpreted as meaning that investments made in this context by non-nationals can be regarded, for the purposes of the section, as establishing &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The concept of granting citizenship to persons making investments in the State was raised initially in the 1980s.  The thinking was that it would assist in attracting foreign industrialists to set up large manufacturing concerns by offering Irish nationality to key personnel resident here. This would assist them in travelling on business in Europe where they would otherwise be subject to visa requirements.  The first applications were approved in April 1989.</P>
    <P>A practice commenced of sending applicants a Statement of Intent setting out how, in return for investments, the Minister would exercise the discretionary powers in section 16 of the Act.  Essentially, this required applicants to acquire a residence in the State, to have been resident in the State for two years and to spend a reasonable amount time here over the two years &mdash; 60 days.  Also they must have satisfied the Minister, on the advice of a Minister of the Government, that a viable manufacturing, international services or other acceptable wealth and job creating project with substantial investment by the applicant had been established here.  Finally, they must have complied with the statutory requirements relating to good character, apart from the five year residence requirement, in relation to the grant of citizenship.</P>
    <P>The level of investments was to be in the order of £500,000 per person.  This Statement of Intent clearly required applicants to reside in the State prior to the grant of naturalisation.</P>
    <P>The practice of issuing the Statement of Intent and requiring residency here prior to naturalisation was not followed in all cases.  Until April 1994, Ministers operated on the basis that investments of the order of £500,000 together with an intention to reside here for a reasonable period, evidenced by the purchase of a residence, were required before naturalisation was granted.  In 1995, the practice of seeking £1 million in investment was adopted, though this varied from case to case and while many applicants were required to invest £1 million others were naturalised on the basis of an investment of £500,000.</P>
    <P>In the period 1992-4, there was an expansion in the demand for citizenship for investment and the Government decided in April 1994 to set up an advisory group consisting of representatives of the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Enterprise and Employment, and Forbairt. Essentially, the group was given the task of <Col N="766" /> assessing the investment proposals of individual applicants and making a recommendation to the Minister on foot of that assessment as to whether the normal pre-conditions for naturalisation should be waived.  The terms of reference of the advisory group were agreed by the Government in July 1994, the main provisions of which are that a substantial residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least five years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the two years following naturalisation; the level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant; if the investment was in the form of a loan, it should be for at least seven years&rsquo; duration and subject to a certain maximum interest rate; as ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period, at the very least five years; and a police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in the country of origin and, if required, from the police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments, together with express permission to the authorities here to inquire behind it.  Other requirements in the terms of reference related to procedures for verifying the investment and conditions associated with the related naturalisation.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice of Ministers to accept applications for naturalisation of spouses and minor children of investors once an interval has elapsed following the investor's naturalisation.  In addition, the Government also decided in 1994 that the scheme should be put on a statutory basis and that priority should be given to the preparation of the necessary legislation.  In the meantime, the Minister for Justice was to continue to make decisions on investment based naturalisation applications acting on the recommendations of the advisory group which would operate on the basis of its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>In September 1996, the then Government decided that no new applications should be accepted under the scheme pending the introduction of specific legislation but the processing of existing applications could continue.  At a later stage, the Government decided that, of the 69 instances in which the Department had been aware of interest in securing naturalisation by way of investment, 19 were to be regarded as cases in which commitments had been made and should be finalised, while the remaining 50 in which no binding commitments had been made should be left over until the new legislation was in place.  The Government subsequently added a small number of additional applications to the 19 I have mentioned.  Some of these cases and some of the 19 have been finalised.  Others are at various stages of processing.</P>
    <P>Last September, the Government asked me to do a thorough review of the scheme and, as I have indicated in the past, I will not be processing the applications which are on hand any further nor <Col N="767" /> will I be entertaining any new applications until the Government decides what course of action to take based on the review I have undertaken.  This is referred to in the proposed Government amendment to this motion.  I have naturalised only two people under the scheme and these cases were ones which had been accepted for processing by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Overall, 143 persons, 48 of whom are spouses and minor children of investors, have been naturalised on foot of the scheme, with investment in excess of £90 million made in return.  It is difficult to say precisely how many jobs have been created or preserved as a result but it is safe to say that the figure is in thousands.</P>
    <P>As Senators will appreciate, there are difficulties associated with regulation of a scheme of this kind.  For example, it is difficult to check character references of persons who have never lived here or to verify if residence commitments are being honoured.  The scheme has been operated by Ministers of different political allegiances.  I receive correspondence from politicians of different parties seeking to have the scheme used in particular situations.  I also receive significant correspondence from business people who see the scheme as a useful vehicle through which they can obtain the investment necessary to develop their enterprises or to prevent their contraction or closure.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the motion in the names of Senators Quinn and O'Toole at a stage when the Government has yet to take decisions on a review which has been made of the scheme.  To accept the motion in the form in which it has been tabled would be premature to say the least.  I prefer to await the Government's consideration of this matter without attempting to prejudge the outcome.</P>
    <P>If the Government decides, in due course, that the scheme is not to be operated in future, I would still see no need for legislation to implement such a decision.  Instead, I would be confident that the Minister holding office would abide by that decision.  In common with my colleagues in Government, I am answerable to the Dáil for the discharge of my duties and I am also available in this House to participate in all business relating to my area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment calls on the House to welcome the contribution made to the economy by non-nationals who have invested in Ireland, many of whom were subsequently naturalised. This refers to the practice of granting permission to remain in the State to persons who wish to establish a business, subject to certain conditions.  Such people are making an important contribution to our community which should not go unacknowledged.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the need to maintain Ireland's standing in the international community. Naturally I share this objective.  It is often said that Ireland is one of the few countries to <Col N="768" /> operate a scheme of this nature and that other European or North American states do not have any counterpart to it.  Ireland is one of the few states to openly operate such a scheme.  I have never considered that Ireland's international reputation has been harmed by the scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, I commend the motion to the House subject to the amendment proposed on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  When the Minister took office, he acknowledged that this scheme needed to be reviewed.  He suspended all applications and is reviewing the scheme.  I welcome this as it is indicative of his approach to his brief.</P>
      <P>The scheme was introduced by Deputy John Bruton when he was Minister of Industry and Commerce.  The idea of giving passports to people prepared to make substantial investment in the country was mooted when he was on a trade mission to Hong Kong.  A number of highly successful business people invested in Canada and were subsequently rewarded with Canadian passports.</P>
      <P>I wonder about the populist purity of the Fine Gael and Opposition parties.  Are they making a political point? It is not fair to spurn significant opportunities for investment in the country and I do not know any Senator or Deputy who would reject investment which might save jobs in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris said the scheme seems to be cloaked in secrecy.  I know from running a business that if one has difficulties, the last thing one wants to do is make them public.  If someone is dependent on credit lines from suppliers and they hear that person is relying on outside investment to pay bills, they may withdraw their line of credit and competitors can use it to their advantage.  I understand why companies who may have benefited from outside investment are reluctant to plaster this information all over the newspapers. The individuals concerned may not, for the same reason, want their private affairs publicised prior to the event.  We need to respect a certain level of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme must be operated and managed properly and be above reproach.  As Senator Norris said, anyone involved in any dealings with this country is entitled to respect and a certain level of privacy.  There is a need to make the system more transparent so that people do not think we are giving passports to people of ill repute. We must be realistic.  If people with the necessary bona fides are prepared to give something to this country, perhaps we should consider giving them something in return.  It is not a question of selling passports but of acknowledging the contribution made by certain people to this country.  Nobody wants to see passports being given out on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis in return for investments.  I believe substantial evidence of investment and commitment <Col N="769" /> to the Irish economy and people should be available.</P>
    <P>If the scheme is to continue it must be improved and its value must be assessed.  The Minister is doing that in his review.  The Government has a responsibility to the country and if there is a possibility of attracting major investment to Ireland which would help to secure jobs here, perhaps we should take it.  We are all happy in the current boom period but there have been times when we needed investment and it was not always easy to secure.  If, in order to secure investment, we must operate a system which would acknowledge the contribution of foreign investors in a transparent and open manner, I do not see anything wrong with that.  A similar scheme is in operation in many other countries.  It is certainly operating in the US.  Although it may not be publicised, there are certain situations where, if sufficient money is invested and a sufficient contribution made to the economy, it is possible to apply for a US passport.</P>
    <P>Everybody is entitled to be treated respectfully whether they are foreign or not or whether they are applying for a passport or not.  Senator Norris stated that there are people holding Irish passports of whom we would not be overly proud.  We are not always able to be proud of everyone who holds an Irish passport; sometimes Irish citizens do many things about which we might not be too happy.  The fact that we might not be proud of everything people do is not a sufficiently good reason to throw the baby out with the bath water.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the scheme must be reviewed and a decision may be made not to continue with the it.  However, the scheme must be reviewed in a transparent manner and the Minister should come back to the Dáil and Seanad and outline proposals in this area.  The Minister stated that 143 people, 48 of whom were spouses and minors, were awarded passports.  That is not a huge figure so I am not sure that all of the concern about this issue is justified at this stage.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of the scheme have been acknowledged and while I realise it is policy for the Opposition to oppose Government initiatives, it is necessary to examine the scheme in a constructive manner.  It is possible that the scheme could be operated and properly managed and that we could ensure it was above reproach.  It may be of benefit to our country, economy, citizens and children who may be seeking jobs in the future.  For those reasons I do not believe it is appropriate at this stage to support the original motion.  I do, however, support the amendment and acknowledge the contributions made by foreign nationals to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I am glad the Minister has come into the House to provide some background on the Government's present position in this area.  It was interesting that he provided a detailed background of the events which led to <Col N="770" /> the major changes brought about in 1994. However, he failed to provide details of the events which led up to that.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox introduced a lot of politics into the debate this evening and was the first Member to approach the issue from a very political standpoint. One is tempted to respond in like manner. I agree that the principle behind this scheme, when it was established in 1986 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy John Bruton, was a good one.  However, lest the House forgets, the scheme's reputation was sullied by the revelations in 1994 that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in the interregnum between the changes of Government in December 1992 was responsible for signing naturalisation papers for a certain Mr. Masri.</P>
      <P>Mr. Masri invested in none other than former Deputy Reynold's pet food company at Edgeworthstown in County Longford.  I am very surprised at the attitude of the Progressive Democrats here this evening as the issue was initially exposed in the Dáil by former Deputy Michael McDowell in April 1994.  I recall Deputy McDowell putting some very leading questions to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  Deputy Reynolds&rsquo; response to him was that the Dáil was not a court of law and as such he was not obliged to answer the questions.  Former Deputy McDowell responded that the Dáil was certainly not a court of law but that if it were, the jury would not have to retire to make its judgment.  That summed up the case.  That was the first revelation responsible for giving this scheme a bad reputation.</P>
      <P>On 11 September 1997, Deputy Jim Higgins, contributing to the debate on the setting up of the Moriarty tribunal, referred to the granting of 11 passports to Saudi Arabian and Pakistani nationals in 1990.  All of the procedures then in place for the granting of passports were set aside in the case of these 11 people.  The normal procedure was that at the very least the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would sign the order for the granting of a passport.  In these cases, however, it appears the order was signed by the then Minister for Justice, former Deputy Raphael P. Burke. Former Deputy Burke has never fully explained his interest in that matter.  I realise he is no longer a Member of this House but he was a Minister for Foreign Affairs in this Government.  There were also rumours, which were not denied, that the passports were personally delivered by then Taoiseach, former Deputy Charles J. Haughey, to the 11 people at the Shelbourne Hotel.  I quote from Deputy Jim Higgin's contribution to the debate on 11 September last year:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the 11 people to whom Irish citizenship was granted were involved in the biggest banking scandal in history.  Sultan Khalid S Bin Mahfooz and Haroon Rashid Kahlon, together <Col N="771" /> with the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, were sued by liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in relation to the BCCI collapse.  In July 1992, both men faced charges in the United States that they conspired to steal more than $300 million from the BCCI depositors.  These charges were dropped in late 1993 following a plea bargaining settlement for $225 million. Haroon Khaloon pleaded guilty to the charge that he failed to register as a broker for which it was agreed by the US authorities that he would not be jailed.</P>
    <P>The normal procedures for the issuing of naturalisation papers to these people would have been that they would have been signed by the Assistant Secretary of the Department at the very least. Instead, they were signed by the then Minister for Justice, who never explained why he stepped outside normal procedures and signed them.  Files relating to this matter are still in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I put it to the Minister that he should answer the questions his predecessor failed to answer.  The Minister must know the explanation and I ask him to inform the House of what he knows.</P>

      <P>This scheme was a good one but its reputation has been sullied and destroyed by the actions I outlined here this evening.  Some of them, no doubt, may be dealt with by the tribunals of inquiry which are currently proceeding. It is a great pity, however, that the scheme has been destroyed, not necessarily by the foreign nationals whose investment we have been trying to attract &mdash; and, God knows, we need more investment &mdash; but by the very Governments and Ministers who have been operating it.  That is the unacceptable scandal which has motivated the wording of Senator Quinn's motion and with which I reluctantly agree.  I basically agree with the scheme, but because it has been so badly abused we now see that the only way forward is to abolish it completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards some of the issues that have been raised in relation to passports, it is easy to see things in hindsight.  The proposal before the House is being looked at against a background of dressing something up in order to say that the scheme when introduced was undertaken in the best interests of the people and the State.  Recently I read an article written by the <Col N="772" /> Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton. While I do not wish to misquote him, the article stated that in the region of 69 to 71 per cent of money belonging to wealthy people is contained in offshore accounts throughout the world.  The magnitude of that, in itself, indicates the overall difficulties of dealing with the ownership and management of finances.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that questionable things have occurred in Government in the past, but Senator Connor's party has been in Government and has held the Justice portfolio.  At the time the previous Fine Gael Minister had an opportunity to examine what had been undertaken by Governments in the past.  This House is not the place to raise that issue <i>vis-a -vis</i> the importance of the overall proposal.  We can certainly question the judgment of many past Ministers.  I agree mistakes have been made which were not in the best interest of the people, but some positive decisions were taken also.</P>
      <P>On my way to attend the Seanad I can see some of the work achieved by that money, for example, in the number of people employed in the meat canning factory in Edgeworthstown, as well as the number of cars there.  It is easy for politicians to express opinions on matters when they were not at the receiving end of decisions that were made at the time and which may have been considered to have been in people's best interests.  It is said that a week is a long time in politics, and so is a week in financial circles.</P>
      <P>When we talk about cancelling the scheme, we must look at the overall picture from a positive perspective.  I agree that the Government should re-examine the scheme on the basis of a careful assessment.  Decisions should be made in the best interests of both the people and the country.  It is something we should retain.  If one is to shoot the messenger as a result of this passports proposal, one will kill off an attractive opportunity which can do well if it is handled properly.  In the light of the proposal, the Government should review it and, with the development agencies, use it for the benefit of the people and the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that a substantial number of people regard Irish citizenship as an important thing to have.  It runs deeper than the financial implications involved.  There is a certain feeling towards Irish nationality and the quality of having an Irish passport that is not sought to the same extent in other countries, for whatever reason. Perhaps it is because of our great international presence as expressed through our culture, people and nationality.  The way we are regarded abroad is an important aspect in attracting people who want to make a genuine national contribution. We are in the throes of business and political life.  Many of the decisions concerning Irish passports were taken on the basis of recommendations from State development agencies such as the IDA.  It is difficult for Ministers to make decisions without the full support of State agencies <Col N="773" /> who are at the coal face of development in attracting industrial investment.</P>
    <P>The Government should review the scheme and it should be carefully monitored in future.  If mistakes were made and things were badly handled, we should, nonetheless, avoid damaging ourselves internationally through public criticism.  If we have to legislate against ourselves for the decisions we made, we will have gone too far in taking on the responsibility that Government and Ministers are entitled to bear in the best interests of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a particular appropriateness about this motion being moved by Senator Quinn.  Who in this House is better qualified to speak about the needs of business and the way business should operate? There is a lesson in what he had to say, although it is not often that I would say this about business people.  The ethical tone running through what Senator Quinn said is an important statement that perhaps our State agencies should also recognise.  The ethical tone concerns where money comes from, the conditions attached to investment, the source of those investments and the individuals through which they are channelled.</P>
      <P>A variety of issues can arise and the one Senator Quinn adverted to is the perception of this country abroad.  We are fortunate in having a booming economy, at least in overall terms.  We are also fortunate that because our booming economy is creating a favourable image of us, a number of the unsavoury episodes about this country that have surfaced in recent years &mdash; of which the sale of passports, although people do not like to use this phrase, is one &mdash; have not really damaged the country to the degree they would have if we were not seen to be the most successful economy in the OECD.  Because we are successful all the other things are being forgiven, but they are there and we need to look at them.</P>
      <P>I thought we worked in a market economy, which is based on the appraisal of business opportunities by individuals who then make a judgment as to where they can get a decent return on their money.  We are not talking about people making investments in social infrastructure such as education, but in business out of which it is assumed they will make money.  We would want to get away from this perception of the international investor as a global version of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, handing out munificence to those countries which are particularly deserving of it; they are people who want to make money. That is fair enough as it is the nature of business in the market economy, but they are not coming here to do us a favour; they are coming here because they make, in the parlance of economics, a judgment that their marginal utility is best advanced by investing in Irish companies in return for an Irish passport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> I think a fundamental question which would have to be asked is: why do they want an Irish passport? It is not because they are living here because one must remember that the substantial period of time which they are required to spend here after they are given an Irish passport is at least 60 days in the two years subsequent to the issuing of an Irish passport to them.  Let us put that in context.  On that basis I am entitled to be a Kerryman because I spend 30 days a year in the kingdom of Kerry and I have done so for the past 14 years.  That is not a substantial part of my time. Perhaps it is one of the best parts of every year, but it is not substantial.</P>
    <P>Talking about substantial periods of time, the Government amendment is, to be even generous to it, disingenuous.  We are not talking here about foreign nationals who come here, settle down, set up a business, get permission to stay because they are setting up a business and then, in the fullness of time, apply for naturalisation.  Such people have been going through a normal process of naturalisation for years and we all know about them.  They are people who have set up small businesses which have become larger businesses. Ultimately, they apply for naturalisation as they intend to stay here for the rest of their lives.  This is the giving away of our passports as a sort of flag of convenience for international playboys in some cases so that they can have a passport which is more convenient for their lifestyle than the passport which they would have otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is no condition in this which states that these people must be involved in Ireland.  If these people have as much money as they appear to have, the purchase or lack of purchase of a substantial residence will be of no great concern to them.  It is yet another thing into which they can put their money and, with Irish capital gains tax as it is at present, they would probably be as well off to put it into Irish property as anywhere else. Therefore, the residency requirement is trivial.  It means a short holiday of one month here for two years and there are no further conditions.</P>
    <P>What do we get in return? We get a maximum of £90 million in return for which the good name of the country is drawn through the mud increasingly.  The procedure by which people get Irish passports is perceived by ordinary people to be at least potentially rotten.  There is a feeling abroad that this is yet another scheme under which the ruling elite look after themselves by handing out things which are essentially the property of the State and behave as if they were their own personal property.  It is just not worth it anymore.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not address the issue.  It is yet again an attempt to postpone a decision. The honest answer to all of this and what we need to do is end the scheme once and for all, as Senator Quinn suggests, and return to a situation where if people want to set up businesses, let them come here, live here, build up the business and then of course they will be welcome to be naturalised as Irish people, having made their <Col N="775" /> contribution and demonstrated their intention to stay.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment to the motion.</P>
      <P>I listened to previous Senators refer to the inadequacies of the scheme &mdash; Senator Brendan Ryan stated that maximum to be derived from an investment was £90 million &mdash; and I might have reservations about it, but I would measure the benefits not in terms of money but in terms of jobs.  The jobs which this scheme saved and procured are more important than money, and that is why I support the amendment to the motion which notes and welcomes the fact that, since his appointment, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has suspended the operation of the scheme for naturalisation arising from investment pending a review which will be determined by Government shortly.  We should wait for the result of that review before we make any half-baked decisions such as that demanded by the motion of Senators Feargal Quinn, Joe O'Toole, David Norris and Brendan Ryan.</P>
      <P>I had reservations about the scheme until about four or five years ago.  I listened to the Fine Gael Senators tonight, but at that time they were more enthusiastic in securing passports for foreign investors to save a company in my area.  That company employed 100 people.  It would have gone into liquidation but for an investment by a foreigner as a result of the issue of an Irish passport. I was involved in making presentations at the time and the company succeeded in getting the investor a passport.  It was widely welcomed, especially in the local newspaper, by Deputy Finucane, the Fine Gael Deputy for Limerick West. I know other members of Fine Gael who used this scheme to ensure other businesses were kept going.  The scheme definitely saved jobs.  What would have happened to the 100 people employed in the company to which I referred? Deputy Finucane, other Members of the Oireachtas in that area and I made representations to ensure that the investment would be provided for the company under the scheme.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that Deputy Albert Reynolds got passports for investors in a company in which his son had interests, but he did not sanction these investments for that company because he was never Minister for Justice and, therefore, could not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also acknowledged by the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, some time ago that former Deputy Ray Burke had not administered the scheme incorrectly.  Senator Connor requested this evening that the Minister open the files on the matter.  What about the previous Minister who was in office for two years? She had <Col N="776" /> an opportunity to open the files relating to the cases in which he thinks there may have been wrongdoing and she did not do so.</P>
    <P>In addition, the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, granted passports to the Masri family the day before she left office.  I am sure all these things were done in the best interests of Ireland.  She knew she was doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>If we come along at this stage and outlaw the issuing of Irish passports to investors, it might be damaging to future investment which would ensure the continued success of Irish industry.  I had reservations about the scheme at one stage, but I changed my mind when I saw how useful it was in ensuring an industry in my area was saved. The scheme needs reform.  I suggest that we await the findings of the review committee set up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and make a judgment on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to conclude the debate.  I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House.</P>
      <P>It was a very good debate and I welcome what I heard.  Senator Chambers stated that it is easy to talk about things in hindsight.  I am the very one who would acknowledge that I am talking in hindsight.  I would not have spoken in this way five years ago.  I now believe it was an error and something we should address.</P>
      <P>What concerns me is the thought of walking through immigration control in a European airport and seeing a sign saying &ldquo;European passports to the right&rdquo; with a sign underneath saying &ldquo;Irish passports to the left&rdquo;.  I tabled the motion because I am concerned we are in danger of damaging a priceless asset &mdash; our reputation.  I am looking back at the matter with hindsight and with concern.</P>
      <P>Passports are being offered for sale.  There were five advertisements for passports in <i>The Economist</i> last week, some of which I imagine were European passports.  My son showed me on the Internet the website of a company called Burlington Foundation Company which offers EU passports for sale, which I fear might be Irish passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This a question of principle versus expediency. We had expediency in the past but it is now a matter of principle.  It is not a question of tinkering with the scheme and seeing how we can improve it.  Senator Ryan and others have said very clearly that we must not damage our traditional route for naturalisation, which is to look at someone's history and behaviour and examine whether they are worthy of gaining the priceless asset of citizenship.  We can then say we are happy to accede to the request of someone who invested and worked in Ireland and played a part as a citizen.  However, that is a long way from putting a price on a passport and deciding on certain rules for citizenship.  The traditional route of <Col N="777" /> examining how people have lived and behaved in Ireland should not be damaged. I have a serious problem with what the Minister said tonight.  I am disappointed he has not understood the principle of the points we have made.  The Minister has been reviewing the situation for nine months and the previous Government also looked at it for nine months, 18 months in total.  The Minister said he will shortly have the answers to that review.  I suggest he puts the advisers conducting this review around a table tomorrow afternoon and gives them 25 minutes to make a decision on whether we should take the route of expediency or principle.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of principle and not one of finding the best deal.  The Minister must stand his ground and say we should not tinker with the scheme because we cannot risk our nation's reputation any longer.  Senator Manning used the word &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo;.  That is a very mild word to <Col N="778" /> describe the danger we are likely to do to the priceless asset of our nation's reputation.  Nothing should damage that reputation.</P>
    <P>The steps suggested by the Minister do not go nearly far enough.  I will keep a very close eye for one month on what the Minister comes up with to solve this question of principle.  We should consider a Private Member's Bill, if necessary, to put into operation the suggestion in the motion.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his attention and for discussing the matter.  I am disappointed he has not listened carefully enough to the very strong case which is being made by the nation as a whole.  I speak on the matter with hindsight as I have changed my mind over the past five years.  I now believe we must never demean ourselves or do anything which will damage the reputation of the priceless asset of our sovereignty and nationality.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to hear this motion which I have tabled with great concern.  There is an escalating problem of children begging and a new practice of adults begging and selling the magazine <i>The Big Issues</i> at major traffic intersections.  Some adults, unfortunately, have very small babies tied by means of a blanket as they run from one side of the road to the other in an attempt to beg from motorists.  It is difficult to believe that mothers would put their small children at risk in this manner. More than 60,000 cars per day travel along the Naas Road where I have seen this practice and the very real possibility of a tragic accident is ever present.  My concern is that this practice is increasing and it appears that the adults concerned are non-nationals.  Perhaps in their home countries the weather is kinder and the traffic is lighter but in Ireland it is not acceptable that an adult's or child's life should be put at risk in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Begging has got completely out of hand.  It is an offence and while I do not want to see either children or their parents detained, it is time that some workable sanctions were introduced against adults who force or persuade their children to <Col N="779" /> beg.  I refer also to the practice of some of the travelling fraternity of driving a van load of children to the centre of Dublin city early in the morning, giving them their allocated pitch for the day and collecting them in the evening.  This is an escalating practice.  The Garda can arrest these children but they cannot be expected to babysit them in a Garda station.  I do not want to sound Dickensian or draconian but I try to imagine what it is like for a small child to beg on the streets in the weather we have today.  I am sure, even today, one would find small children sitting on a street with a shoe box in front of them doing their stint on the begging rota.</P>
    <P>Have the refugee agencies advised refugees and asylum seekers that this practice is unacceptable in Ireland? I am not racist or anti-traveller. I include in my condemnation all members of the public who force or persuade their children to beg.  I accept that it is difficult to enforce the law in this area but can we tolerate the escalation of this problem until Dublin is known as a city of beggars? If one walks down Grafton Street one will be approached, perhaps three times, by beggars, not always but too frequently by children.  We must have an intervention mechanism so that these children can be saved from such a horrible life.  The parents must be advised and monitored to ensure that they do not abuse their children.  A liaison procedure with the Garda and school attendance officers must be established.</P>
    <P>We speak of cherishing children.  These are perishing children.  I saw the same woman begging at the intersection on the Naas road in the freezing weather again today.  This is a tragic and dreadful circumstance which must not be ignored. I will continue to raise this issue and I will not allow it to be ignored.  We owe these young citizens a fair chance and they are not getting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Ridge for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to express my concern about the dangerous practice to which she has drawn attention. I acknowledge and respect the humanitarian motives which underly Senator Ridge's concern in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that when incidents of this nature come to their attention or are reported to them they take appropriate action.  This may, in the first instance, involve the provision of advice or a warning about the dangers involved.  If necessary, the Garda may avail of the relevant provisions of the Casual Trading Act, 1995, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, or the Child Care Act, 1991.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that if persons persist in these activities, despite having being the subject of Garda attention by way of advice or warning, they may also be dealt with under the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1995, and under general by-laws <Col N="780" /> which place an obligation on pedestrians to exercise care, and to avoid danger or inconvenience to themselves or to other road users.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that the primary onus is on an individual to ensure that a child in their care is not placed in any situation which could be injurious to their health and well being. Nevertheless, I assure her that the Garda authorities take all necessary measures &mdash; and will continue to do so &mdash; to ensure that no child remains at risk, whether by way of advice or caution and, if necessary, the appropriate legislation to which I referred.  In the final analysis, however, the responsibility is on the parent or guardian to ensure the safety on the roads of his or her child.</P>
    <P>There is possibly no need for me say so but it is important that people who see children endangered in the manner described by Senator Ridge should report it to the appropriate authorities in the interests of the children concerned. It is a matter of grave concern that children should be placed in danger in this way.  I thank Senator Ridge for raising this matter in the House and giving it the profile it deserves.  I am sure good will come of her actions.</P>

      <P>Chuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim mo bhuíochas pearsanta leí toisc gur chuir sí an stro uirthi fhéin teacht isteach chun éisteacht leis an rún seo.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for making herself available to reply to this matter.  It came to my notice that the Tipperary Historical Society recently passed a resolution requesting the Government to take a building in Farrenrory, Ballingarry, Thurles, County Tipperary, into State care.  The building in question is known as the Warhouse and also the Widow McCormack's house.  It is already a listed building but that is no guarantee of survival.  The building is important because it is one of the key sites related to the failed Young Ireland rebellion in 1848.  Many illustrious names were connected with the battle which took place there, including William Smith O'Brien, Thomas Francis Meagher, Charles Gavin Duffy, John Blake Dillon and others.  The battle, if one could call it that because it had no impact in terms of military history, was really a minor scuffle and it was as much concerned with the Irish psyche as it was with military achievement.</P>
      <P>This year is the 150th anniversary of the Young Ireland rebellion which occurred during a particularly sad period in Irish history that witnessed the end of the repeal movement and the Young Irelanders themselves.  To provide some background information, these fine intellectuals were not aggressive in any sense of the word.  One could say that they were exceptionally romantic figures and they are still seen in that way by history and folklore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The Young Irelanders converged on the part of County Tipperary to which I referred with the intention of creating a rebellion and promoting the concept of national independence.  This occurred at a time when new legislation had been introduced to allow the authorities arrest and imprison people for a period of six months without trial.  The Young Irelanders said they opposed that but it was obvious they were dedicated to starting a rising.  The security forces travelled out from Callan to the area in question and took the Young Irelanders by surprise.  Various scuffles ensued but the main site of the battle was a relatively new house owned by the Widow McCormack in which she and her family were living at the time.  No member of the security forces was killed during the battle but two Young Ireland supporters died.</P>
    <P>After the rebellion, many of the Young Irelanders, who were fine intellectuals, either left Ireland or were transported and many of them made a major impact on public life in the Australian state of Tasmania.  I recall reading that a large number of them rose to positions as governors, heads of police, etc.  This underlines the ability, vision and intellectual capacity that was lost to Ireland because of our unfortunate history.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in certain parts of the country about the 1798 Rebellion.  It is right that we should commemorate that event. However, a small community in the Slieve Ardagh area, which runs from Kilkenny towards Cashel and Killenaul, has decided to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Young Ireland rebellion.  I understand the Taoiseach will attend the commemoration and 250 people are to travel from Tasmania because of the connection of the Young Irelanders with that state.  An extensive event has been planned and I compliment the organising committee in that regard.  A huge pageant involving 200 participants will take place, major lecturers from around the country will attend and there will be many musical events.</P>
    <P>It would be nice to think that the Warhouse could, in conjunction with the commemoration, be taken into State care.  We must remember that it is not always the major battles that are of great importance, the significance of events is often more important.  When one bears in mind that at the time of the Young Ireland rebellion &mdash; which occurred during the Famine &mdash; people's spirits would have been exceptionally low.  This group of men, who held respectable positions and stations in life, were not seeking anything for themselves. The Young Irelanders remotivated and inspired the Irish people and helped them rise from the dungeon of depression imposed by the Famine.  It is for that reason that the Young Ireland movement is significant.</P>
    <P>The risings of 1867 and 1916 would never have taken place but for the Young Irelanders&rsquo; deep intellectual assessment of the Irish psyche and their right to full sovereignty.  It was they who established the agenda and set down the parameters of nationhood.  It is sad to think of the <Col N="782" /> Warhouse, or the Widow McCormack's House as it is known locally, empty and forlorn.  I regard it as being as important a national monument as any other.</P>
    <P>When the Cathaoirleach read out this matter and mentioned the Widow McCormack's house I saw many Senators wondering who was the Widow McCormack.  In local history and folklore the Warhouse is regarded as being as important as Bodenstown or any other shrine to Irish nationalism.  I recommend to the Minister that she considers the request from the Tipperary Historical Society.  I compliment the local newspapers &mdash;<i>The Nationalist Clonmel,</i> the <i>Tipperary</i>Star and the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i>&mdash; which have been to the fore in presenting this case.  I was glad to see today's <i>The Irish Times</i> feature the 150th anniversary and the forthcoming festival at Slieveardagh. I ask the Minister to consider this matter. There may be difficulties but we must find a way to overcome them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to speak on it.  It is no surprise to hear the Senator expound eloquently on this period of Irish history. I agree that had there not been the Young Ireland movement we would not have had the Fenians of 1867 and the 1916 Rising.</P>
      <P>The dwelling known as the Warhouse at Farrenrory Upper, Ballingarry, County Tipperary, was placed on the register of historic monuments in April 1989 in accordance with the provisions of section 5(5) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.  One of the purposes of this order was to give legal recognition to the historical significance of the building as the location where, in July 1848, the Young Ireland rebellion culminated in a physical conflict between a party of police who occupied the house and a group of local miners and farmers led by William Smith O'Brien, James Stephens, Terence Bellew McManus, Patrick O'Donoghue and John Kavanagh. The effect of this order is to make it obligatory for an individual wishing to carry out works to the monument to give two months notice in writing to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.</P>
      <P>Two of the leaders of the Young Ireland movement, William Smith O'Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher were taken to Kilmainham Gaol while awaiting trial for their roles in the rebellion of 1848.  The historical and cultural significance of the Young Ireland movement is commemorated appropriately in the new award winning exhibition in Kilmainham.  There is a formal portrait of William Smith O'Brien, signed by him while a prisoner in Kilmainham on 31 August 1848, on display as part of the commemorative tribute to the Young Ireland movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another equally important purpose of including the Warhouse on the register of historic monuments was to facilitate the Ballingarry Young Ireland 1848 committee in its aim of <Col N="783" /> acquiring the property with a view to establishing a proposed international centre for national research and a heritage and genealogical centre. The group considered that such an order would improve its chances of securing funding for its project.  While the building is of historical significance and has, accordingly, been afforded adequate legal protection and recognition by my Department, it is not considered to be significant from an architectural perspective.</P>
    <P>In the overall context of commitments and responsibilities which my Department has in relation to taking monuments into State care, it would not be appropriate for Dúchas to become either guardian or owner of the Warhouse in Ballingarry.  Any development of or commemorations at the Warhouse would be best undertaken by the historical society and/or the Young Ireland committee.  I recognise and congratulate the historical society and the committee on their great work in the local area.  I understand that the Young Ireland committee did at one stage consider <Col N="784" /> approaching the Heritage Council regarding a possible allocation of funding for the purchase and development of the Warhouse, but I understand the committee did not subsequently make a formal application to the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator will appreciate the wide variety of demands made on my Department in relation to increasing the already overburdened portfolio of monuments in its care.  This necessitates a process of demarcation, especially in light of the more formal remit of the service in granting legal protection to monuments dating from pre-1700.  As in the case of the Warhouse in Ballingarry, the service will use its powers under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, to grant recognition and facilitate the protection of historic sites.  In such circumstances it is hoped that local community initiatives can be instrumental in copperfastening the place of such sites in both local and national history.</P>
