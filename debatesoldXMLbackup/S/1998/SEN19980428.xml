      <P>I have notice from Senator Gallagher that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to set up a special task force to combat the serious decline in industrial employment in County Offaly.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the loss of jobs at Herdmans in Ballybofey, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2 with item 2 to be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. The contributions of spokespersons on both items are not to exceed 15 minutes while those for all other Senators are not to exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Will the Leader ensure all Members will have access to copies of the consultants' report upon which the Government's final decision on Luas is to be based today?  It is essential that at least Senators from Dublin have an opportunity to debate Luas within the next week, but it will be difficult to hold such a debate if we do not have access to the report.  In the first week of the accession of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, it is appropriate that it be made available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to item 11 on the Order Paper, the Shannon River Council Bill.  We meet three days <Col N="286" /> per week and there are windows of opportunity when that Bill could be taken &mdash; for example, last Thursday and Friday.  There should be no difficulty with this Bill as it was originally promoted by Senators on the other side of the House and has the full support of all Members.  A short debate on Second Stage would allow us to get to Committee Stage and I see no reason why the Leader should not accede to this request in the interest of all Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Manning.  I asked the Leader last month to at least establish what the Government's position is on the Bill.  It is an opportunity for the Minister for the Marine to take the Bill as it has the support of all sides and it should be moved forward.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago this week I was privileged to be part of a Seanad delegation which visited Guatemala where we met representatives of trade unions, Churches, civil liberties' groups and the Government in Guatemala city.  Conditions have improved in the meantime, but there was the horrific murder of Bishop José Juan Gerardi in the city recently.  Will the Leader raise this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the European Union should take an interest in it?  What is going on in that country is disgraceful.  It is small and beautiful, with lovely people who were oppressed for many years.  The Government should convey its abhorrence because this act was state directed, if not implemented.  There is not doubt it was a state execution of an individual who fought for human rights.  It is also a low point for civil rights in Central America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed, but I wish to move item 14 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Senator can do at this stage is move an amendment to the Order of Business that this item be included in the business of the House.  Are you moving an amendment that item 14 be taken before item 1?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That item 14 be taken before item 1.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Manning's view that all Members be given a copy of the consultants' report and that an early debate be held on it. Time is running out for this project.  It seems to me that the delay is being caused purely on the south side as there is great willingness on the north side for the project to proceed.  There was no dispute good, bad or indifferent there as the route has been well identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to item 9, I want to reiterate my call for a debate on industrial relations.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that there has been an escalation in industrial relations problems in recent months, currently evidenced by the constant presence of representatives of the Garda outside the gates of the Oireachtas and who have threatened <Col N="287" /> to escalate their dispute.  We should have a full scale debate on the protection of workers' rights and we should include in that the whole area of trade union recognition and the threats currently being posed to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider asking the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science to come into this House to discuss the proposals being made in regard to the increased cost of public school transport, particularly in light of the report published by the school transport committee in January?  The Minister does not seem to be adhering to the contents of the report.  It is only proper that the House would discuss an issue which costs £42 million per annum and any changes which are due to occur in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Luas, an issue I have raised myself on a number of occasions.  The Leader has agreed this is an issue which should be considered and I would like him to give us some idea as to when a debate might take place.  A motion has been tabled on the Order Paper in regard to the Atkins report and it is very important that we discuss it.  Newspaper reports have already been published which have come down on each side of the debate.  This is a complex issue which must be debated in the light of the Atkins report in order that we can arrive at a proper decision in regard to the transport system for the capital city.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to debate the issue of asylum seekers in the House again?  I am sure Members will be concerned at the reports published in all newspapers concerning Garda advice to asylum seekers not to go out into the city at night.  Mr. Mohammed Haji of the Association of Refugees and Asylum-seekers in Ireland, is quoted in today's <i>Irish Times</i> as saying: &ldquo;We lost our freedom in our countries and now we are going to lose it here in Ireland&rdquo;.  I note that £20,000 has been made available by the Government to monitor the situation.  I hope someone in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is monitoring newspaper headlines in the tabloid press with a view to identifying any infringements under the Incitement to Hatred Act.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on the murder of the bishop in Guatemala which was clearly a punishment for the publication of the report on human rights.  There is a human rights desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs and I support Senator O'Toole's suggestion that the Minister should make his feelings and those of the Irish people clearly known to the Guatemalan Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the media, particularly in view of the fact that some of them are now rattling the bones of the very brave in the grave towards commercial <Col N="288" /> ends?  It is scandalous that the dead journalist's next of kin have no redress to stop the publication of the book.  It is time some law was introduced to prohibit such action which is grossly unfair to the family of the bravest and best journalist this country has ever known.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow, the Garda will have been picketing outside the Dáil for one week. The protest is an unprecedented and regrettable step and I wish to put on record my amazement that the Minister can continue to dither on this issue and fail to reach agreement with the Garda on it.  It is not acceptable that this dispute be allowed to continue.  Will the Leader advise the Minister of the huge support among the public for the gardaí in this dispute and report to the House on the situation?</P>
      <P>In relation to the Child Pornography Bill, 1998, will the Leader also ask the Minister to consider the introduction of an obscene publications Bill? I have personal experience of shops in this city where it is possible to buy <i>Hustler</i> magazine at the same counter as a bar of chocolate.  This magazine would not be passed by our censor but we have no mechanism for the seizure of such gross periodicals.  I am convinced that an obscene publications Act could control the growing trade which is robbing children of their innocence.  We may need to tolerate a top shelf society but it should not be possible to buy such publications openly in shops selling stationery and sweets.</P>

      <P>Senator, you may not debate this matter now.  You have made a very good case for the introduction of such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Overseas Development Co-operation, I recently attended a seminar in Europe on poverty. Will the Leader allow the House to address this matter in the near future?  There are people in Ireland who live below the poverty line.  Some would not accept that we have poverty in Ireland. We have relative poverty which must be addressed urgently.  Poverty is expanding throughout Europe.  More that three million people are homeless in Europe and 40 million are living on the poverty line or below.  It would be appropriate to have an early debate on this matter and, as we approach the year 2000, to plan to eliminate relative and absolute poverty from our country.  This problem should be addressed now when the economy is booming.  .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader allow time for an early debate on the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission?  The question of a minimum wage is of grave concern to thousands of people.  The Small Firms Association has suggested that the implementation of a minimum wage of £4.40, as suggested in that report, would cause a loss of more than 150,000 jobs.  A minumum wage of £4.40 would be the second highest minimum wage in the world.  The next highest minimum wage in OECD countries would be £3.70. If even 50,000 <Col N="289" /> jobs are lost as a result of this measure, it will be a matter of great concern.  There is a need for a minimum wage but it must be tied to the tax situation and implemented without loss of jobs and to the best advantage of the poorer sections of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Costello.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the television service.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has appointed a regulator for television channels.  It is widely accepted that the reception of the two RTÉ channels, RTÉ 1 and Network 2, has been of very poor quality for a number of weeks.  I hope the Leader will ask the Minister to explain to the House why the signal from RTÉ is of such poor quality, particularly in County Mayo.  It is unacceptable that our national television channel should be broadcast on such a poor signal and that the Minister should abdicate her responsibility in this matter by the appointment of a regulator. She has passed the buck in relation to this issue by appointing a regulator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am chairman of a voluntary hospital in the Cork region which is very involved in the training of student nurses.  Students are under the impression they have been given no recognition in terms of their general allowance. Over the years their allowances have decreased. Many years ago we created a situation which ensured benefits were decreased in comparison with previous levels.  In the meantime, benefits have become extremely low and there should be a debate in the House on general allowances for student nurses as we may not be getting the best out of them.  Will the Leader bring the Minister for Health and Children or one of the Junior Ministers in the Department before the House to explain what is being done on this issue?</P>
      <P>Regarding the point raised by Senator Burke, is it now the case that since the appointment of the telecommunications regulators, the Minister no longer has responsibility to the House for the licensing of groups such as South Coast Television, about which there has much argument for many years?  How can the regulator explain to the House exactly what is happening?  Will the Minister provide an explanation on behalf of the regulator? The issue is very confusing and should be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of recent discussion in the Dáil on the licensed trade and the request from vintners for extended opening hours, it is important that the Minister comes before the House to outline the Government's intentions on this issue.  On the radio this morning the Assistant Commissioner of the Garda indicated that responsibility lay with legislators in the application of the law and that it was not the responsibility of the Garda.  The common view of the public, notwithstanding the necessity for caution in <Col N="290" /> dealing with the problems of drink, is that legislation should be introduced which meets the needs of people and the protection of the young. The House should play its part in making a contribution to the debate before decisions are made.</P>

      <P>I will convey Senators Manning's, Costello's and Norris's calls for a copy of the consultant's report on Luas to the Minister immediately following the Order of Business.  I will facilitate a debate in the House on the matter as soon as possible.  As soon as Senator Manning made his request I asked the Government Chief Whip to contact the Minister's office and am awaiting a reply.  The Leaders of the groups will meet at 3.30 p.m. and I hope at that stage to know when this issue will be discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>I will contact the Minister's office today regarding Senators Manning's and O'Toole's request regarding the Shannon River Council Bill and will inform the House about developments in the morning.  I will convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the request of Senators Norris and O'Toole to bring him into the House to discuss the murder of the bishop in Guatemala and the serious concerns over human rights in that region.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business.  Regarding Senator Ridge's and Costello's call for a debate on industrial relations, I have agreed to take this at the earliest possible opportunity after consultation with the Minister.  It is a matter of getting a date which suits the Minister and the Order of Business of the House.  Senator Coogan asked that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science be asked to clarify his position regarding school transport and I will endeavour to have this done.  I agree to Senator Norris's call for a debate on asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan asked for a debate on poverty and on the national minimum wage.  I will afford time to have this request facilitated.  Senator Farrell asked for a debate on the media and in particular the forthcoming publication of a certain book.  I will make time available at the earliest opportunity for a debate on the media.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge voiced serious concerns regarding the forthcoming child pornography Bill, an issue she has raised on many occasions on the Order of Business.  She has serious concerns about certain publications being available to young children in many stores.  I agree with her and I will do anything I can to facilitate her request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke and Senator Cregan called on the Minister for Public Enterprise to come into the House to debate television in general and the poor reception in many parts of the country, and in particular, from Senator Burke's point of view, the reception of RTÉ 1 and Network 2 in County Mayo.  I will relay the message to the Minister. <Col N="291" /> As the Minister is in the House this evening, perhaps we can see when this can be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan called on the Minister for Health and Children to make provision for a general allowance for student nurses.  I will pass that on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle asked that copies of the Bacon report be brought before us and that the matter be discussed in the House.  I certainly can agree to this request.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers called for a debate on the licensing hours.  As the Senator will be aware, this afternoon we are discussing the licensing hours, the selling of alcoholic drink to young boys and girls and the fatalities on the road stemming from these abuses.  I welcome the contributions of Senators on the matter.  If more time is needed, I will facilitate the House in this regard.  The number of fatalities on the roads over the past month has been alarming to say the least.  While I am listening to those in favour of longer drinking hours, I know there is a massive silent majority which has not been heard.  Today I am affording Senators the opportunity to express their views in this House on behalf of some of these people too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is increased public and political concern about road safety.  Ireland, in common with most European Union countries, has greatly improved its road safety performance over the past 20 years but economic growth, which is increasing road travel and driver and vehicle numbers, is now threatening to erode these gains and to re-establish adverse trends.  Already in 1998, 129 people have died in road accidents.  We need intensified action for road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago the high level group on road safety was mandated to develop and submit to <Col N="292" /> Government a national road safety strategy.  I spoke in the House last November about this strategic approach to road safety policy.  It is a new and critically important initiative.  It will provide better co-ordination and prioritisation of existing road safety activities and a platform for new initiatives.</P>
    <P>The development of the strategy has provided full opportunity for assessing our efforts and has highlighted the need to reinforce and, where appropriate, redirect those efforts.  All aspects of existing arrangements, measures and approaches have been reviewed in this context.  This is the first time a structured and systematic approach has been taken to road safety policy in Ireland.  A similar strategic approach has been adopted by some of the countries in Europe with the best road safety records, including the Netherlands and Sweden.  I am confident that it will benefit Irish performance considerably.  Work on the strategy will shortly be completed and it will be presented to Government prior to its publication. I look forward to the support of the House for measures to be taken in the context of the strategy to improve Ireland's road safety performance and reduce the high toll of death and injury on our roads.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the State and its agencies have continued to be active in relation to road safety.  A substantially increased grant has been provided to the National Safety Council in 1998 for the purpose of improving road safety and promoting road accident prevention.  The National Roads Authority has increased its provision in 1998 for its low cost safety measures programme and for other road safety related measures.  Garda enforcement of road traffic law continues to be given a high priority under the direction of the National Traffic Policy Bureau.  The Garda Operation Lifesaver is continuing through 1998 and its effectiveness is constantly reviewed and improvements made to enhance enforcement as necessary.</P>
    <P>It is a cause for grave concern that despite more frequent reminders from the National Safety Council of the risks and consequences and despite improved enforcement by the Garda, which serves as a further reminder and seeks to punish offenders, we are still experiencing a high incidence of death and injuries from road accidents.</P>
    <P>The causes of road accidents are many and are generally well known to us &mdash; excessive and inappropriate speeding and drink driving are the primary contributory factors to road accidents in Ireland.  These so called &ldquo;driver actions&rdquo;, combined with a significant percentage of drivers and passengers not wearing seat belts, are the primary causes of the high levels of death and injury resulting from road accidents here as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Today we are considering just one of those accident causes or contributory factors.  This debate is focusing on the implications for road safety of alcohol abuse.  There is significant data <Col N="293" /> available from other countries and international organisations about the effects of alcohol and the extent to which it is a factor in road accidents.</P>
    <P>Small quantities of alcohol can impair a driver's concentration.  Factors such as fatigue, illness, stress and drugs can exacerbate the effects and can cause severe concentration loss even when a small quantity of alcohol is consumed.  When the blood/alcohol level exceeds 80 milligrammes, the normal reaction is over-estimation of ability, impairment of peripheral vision and of the eye's reaction to lights and dark.  Judgment of distance and speed of oncoming vehicles, impairment of ability to react and a tendency to take risks can actually set in at lower levels.  It is important, therefore, that all drivers should heed the message of the National Safety Council, to never drink and drive.  This is the safest approach.</P>
    <P>It is estimated in this country that alcohol is a factor in 25 per cent of all road accidents and in 33 per cent of fatal accidents.  The blame lies with irresponsible drivers and pedestrians.  One third of pedestrians killed have very high blood alcohol levels and most of these accidents occur during the hours of darkness.</P>
    <P>These figures are a serious indictment of Irish social practices.  We must question whether we should be willing in this country to accept a level of death and injury caused by drivers and pedestrians who have consumed alcohol, in order to maintain a certain lifestyle.  It is clear from the accident statistics that behavioural changes are necessary to effect a reduction in the number of fatalities and injuries on our roads where alcohol is a contributory factor.  Every single drink related accident is a totally avoidable and unnecessary waste of life and limb.</P>
    <P>Drink driving law in Ireland has been recently and comprehensively reviewed.  The Road Traffic Acts, 1994 and 1995 reduced the maximum permissible blood alcohol limit to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and put in place one of the most stringent penalty systems in the EU.  We all recall the protracted public and political discussion engaged in at the time of the introduction of that legislation.  It is now incumbent upon us as legislators to support the implementation of the new limits so as to contribute to a reduction in accident and injury numbers.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission's Road Safety Programme for 1997 to 2000 suggests that there would be between 5 per cent and 40 per cent less fatalities if by legislation, enforcement, telematics or education, the estimated one in 20 of the driver population that sometimes drives under the influence of alcohol could be convinced or compelled not to drive with a blood alcohol content over 50 milligrammes.  That programme includes the reexamination of a proposal for a directive to harmonise blood alcohol limits across the EU at 50 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>When the Road Traffic Act, 1994, was passed into law Ireland joined a majority of EU member states in operating an 80 milligramme limit.  The priority for us since that has been to enforce that <Col N="294" /> limit and to gain good public support for it rather than to embark on further legislative change.  A number of EU countries have since moved down or are planning to move down to the lower 50 milligramme limit.  We will monitor and assess the effectiveness of such moves.</P>
    <P>The question of driving while under the influence of drugs is also an issue of concern.  It is illegal, under the Road Traffic Acts, to drive while under the influence of drugs, whether they be medicinal or illicit.  The law is directed at the behaviour of drivers.  However, testing methods are not as developed as those for alcohol.  I look forward to the outcome of work being done in this area as part of the EU Commission's road safety programme which includes the development of methodologies for roadside checks and consideration of warning labels on medicines.</P>
    <P>The success of the Christmas drink driving campaign in this country since the beginning of the 1990s supports the concept of combined multi-agency campaigns, in which education and enforcement are used concurrently, to influence public attitude and behaviour.  Those campaigns were strengthened by the legislative changes in 1994 and we can now confidently say that a certain level of social unacceptability of drink driving has been achieved in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, more remains to be done.  This is further evidenced in the results of analyses carried out by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. In 1997, 62 per cent of the more than 6,500 cases analysed were over twice the legal limit.  In the first three months of 1998, 64 per cent of the 1,750 samples analysed were over twice the legal limit. These are frightening statistics and serve to remind us that we still face a huge challenge in changing drink driving behaviour in this country. The road safety agencies must, therefore, continue to encourage and canvass public support against drink driving.</P>
    <P>Conscious of this need, the National Safety Council and the Garda Síochána have, since 1996, operated a summer drink driving campaign to remind people that drinking and driving is not just a Christmas phenomenon.  The risk exists all year round.  The summer campaign will run again this year and will, I hope, further contribute to our efforts to change not just attitudes but behaviour.</P>
    <P>Public support is vital to the success of these campaigns.  This support needs to be nurtured and encouraged on a continuous basis as we face the challenge of reducing the numbers and effects of road accidents.  I welcome the support of business interests for last year's Christmas campaign where some companies undertook promotions and advertising against drink driving.  In 1996, the AA launched a drink driving video for young people which was made with the support of the international drinks industry group.  We need more of this type of activity to spread the message, to encourage peer support for not drinking and driving and to develop further the social unacceptability of drinking and driving.</P>

      <Col N="295" /> Public support will be critical also to the successful implementation of measures in the forthcoming national road safety strategy.  While it would be premature to try to detail these measures, one area for action will certainly involve the harnessing of technology to improve enforcement of the law.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, stated recently at the launch of his Department's national alcohol awareness campaign, it is the Government's intention to encourage responsible and safe behaviour in regard to alcohol use.  If that means changing behaviour patterns to save lives, we must accept the challenge and face up to the reality of the implications for road safety of alcohol misuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the Seanad debated the implications of speeding on road safety and I am pleased today to have the opportunity to speak on the implications of alcohol abuse for road safety.  The high toll of deaths and injuries on our roads is the cause of these debates.</P>
      <P>Alcohol plays an important role in accidents, particularly in severe accidents.  Although I found it difficult to obtain precise figures for the role of alcohol in road accidents, I am surprised and horrified by the figures quoted by the Minister of State.  He said that alcohol is a factor in 25 per cent of accidents causing injury and in 35 per cent of serious and fatal accidents.  These figures demonstrate that we have a serious problem in this regard.</P>
      <P>Despite the advice of Government and road safety organisations that the safest option is not to drink and drive, many drivers still look to the legal limit for guidance on safe drinking and driving levels.  Currently, five different levels are operated in EU countries.  In Ireland the legal limit is set at 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and I am glad to hear that the level might be further reduced.</P>
      <P>Most people consider their consumption of alcohol to be social drinking.  Responsible and moderate drinking of alcohol removes inhibitions, helps people to talk more freely and makes them feel relaxed.  Negative reasons for drinking include consuming alcohol to escape from unwanted talk and feelings or merely to comply with the expectations of other people.</P>
      <P>A rough guide is sometimes given to drivers in respect of alcohol consumption.  For example, an average male weighing 11st will reach the legal limit following the rapid consumption of two pints of beer after a recent meal.  However, the major variability in the quantity of alcohol in different beverages and the way in which individuals are affected by alcohol makes it unwise to rely on counting units as a way to remain below the legal limit for driving.  The initial effects of consuming a small amount of alcohol dictate that people should not use any form of machinery let alone be in control of a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Alcohol has a dehydrating effect, that is, it removes water and reduces the ability of cells to function correctly.  It provides a feeling of warmth by widening blood cells near the surface of the skin, thus increasing the flow of blood to them. This is usually caused by a loss of body heat. More importantly, however, alcohol acts as a powerful depressant of the central nervous system. It has the initial effect of impairing the most complex brain functions, such as the impairment of behavioural inhibitions and self-criticism. When driving, these effects alone increase the risk of accidents.  Under the influence of alcohol drivers take greater risks and they believe they are driving better than they would under normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>Enforcement procedures differ throughout the European Union.  In Ireland, breathalysing equipment is used to detect the presence of alcohol in the system.  However, blood and urine tests remain the only form of evidence which is legally admissible in respect of drink driving offences.  At present, gardaí usually ask drivers to take a breathalyser test when alcohol is detected on their breath or if they have been observed driving in a dangerous or erratic manner.  I would like to see random breathalyser tests introduced so that any driver could be stopped and asked to take such a test.  I make this point because there is wide agreement in international scientific literature that increasing drivers' perception of the risks of being detected for excess alcohol is an important element in any package of measures designed to reduce alcohol related accidents.  There is strong evidence that a high level of breath testing reinforced by publicity campaigns is a key to achieving the goal of deterrence.  It might be necessary to continue publicity campaigns to encourage a climate of opinion that drinking and driving is a socially unacceptable activity.</P>
    <P>Many drink driving offences occur following visits to pubs and restaurants.  Social events are often held far from residential areas in places which are difficult or impossible to reach other than by private car.  Additional public transport and changing the location of discos and other social events might help to decrease the level of drink driving.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that in recent years a variety of low alcohol and alcohol free drinks has been introduced to the market.  These can prove popular when combining social activities with the need to drive a car.  A more enthusiastic marketing approach should be put in place to illustrate the positive image of low alcohol and alcohol free drinks.  In addition, a price advantage should be introduced, for example, through the reduction of taxation levels, in respect of these beverages which would have the effect of increasing their market share.  The Minister for Finance might consider this option in his next budget.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate to conclude without referring to Dr. Michael Loftus, the north Mayo coroner who has campaigned against drink driving for most of his life.  Referring recently to <Col N="297" /> the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, he stated that this tragedy had focused international attention on the role of alcohol in accidents.  He further stated that similar accidents occur in this country and the real tragedy is that we continue to turn a blind eye to them.  He issued a challenge to politicians, law makers and law enforcers to address this ongoing national tragedy and publish yearly detailed statistics to provide a more realistic picture.  These figures should show the number of road deaths, the level of alcohol in victims and details in respect of victims hospitalised as a result of road accidents with the level of alcohol provided in each case.  He went on to say that every statistic meant the avoidable end of a life and the loss of a partner or family member.  He appealed for action so that living people would not become such statistics by the negligence of those who have the power to bring about change. I concur with his views and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on this issue in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Farrell for allowing me to speak before him.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on alcohol abuse, particularly by young people, and fatalities on the roads.  In 1997, 7,000 people were admitted to psychiatric hospitals for treatment for alcohol abuse.  Of these, 400 were under 21 years of age. Alcohol is acceptable in moderation but its abuse is a problem, especially when one considers that 20 per cent of admissions to hospital last year were related to it.  Such statistics are alarming given that one in five of the population does not drink and is a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>
      <P>Nowadays it may be thought great to drink but when I was at school and representing my county we were taught that a fit body would give a fit brain, a fit brain would give confidence and confidence could move mountains.  That is how clubs and colleges won championships in sport.  Sports people accepted that what was good for the body was good for the brain and that confidence would follow.</P>
      <P>As legislators we allow too much advertising and promotion of alcohol which can lead to abuse.  We do not need extended drinking hours in pubs.  Over 30 per cent of road accidents happen after dark and in my estimation 40 per cent of road accidents are drink related.  There were eight fatalities last week, eight the week before that and 14 the week before that again.  These are alarming figures.  The vast majority of publicans and hoteliers do all they can to run proper establishments and are concerned for their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main abuse of alcohol is among teenagers. The under age drinking that takes place in Ireland is disgraceful, appalling and out of control. It is for this reason that as Leader of the House I agreed to have this issue discussed as a matter of urgency.  About half our population is under 30 years of age and it is of the utmost importance to protect young people.  Bar extensions <Col N="298" /> are commonplace in discos, hotels and other establishments and nobody under the age of 21 years should be admitted to them.</P>
    <P>When we were young we were more responsible because the temptation to drink was not as strong.  At that time one had to have time and money if one wanted to drink and most people had neither.  However, society has progressed. The economy is buoyant and everyone has money in their pockets, but it seems that the only way to enjoy one's evening is to get stone drunk out of one's mind.  That is an insult to the intelligence of any human being in any country.</P>
    <P>The demand for after hours opening is coming from the drinks business but tourists do not want it.  I am familiar with the tourist trade.  Most tourists are in bed early and they get up early.  Most tour coaches leave hotels before 8.30 a.m. and the tourists are in bed by 12.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>For whom are we being asked to provide longer opening hours?  There is a belief that longer hours would create a small amount of extra tourism business for the likes of Temple Bar.  It will be a poor day, however, if we amend the licensing laws to provide longer opening hours for bars across the country just to facilitate one small part of the capital city,</P>
    <P>We should look at the issue from the point of view of employees and employers.  A good friend of mine had 37 people working on a construction site but the morning after St. Patrick's Day only two turned up for work.  These are alarming statistics.  How many people are going to work on construction sites on Monday mornings?</P>
    <P>People should hear the other side of the story because for the last three or four weeks in the media I have only heard one side of the argument from the drinks industry, which is seeking longer opening hours.  We should see what our European counterparts are doing.  We should also examine our productivity.  I do not think too many EU countries support longer opening hours, particularly if one takes productivity into account.</P>
    <P>Next year, with the advent of the new single currency, we will be participating in one of the world's three major currencies, which are the euro, the dollar and the yen.  If we do not live up to that role in relation to productivity we will not be able to compete.  As a previous speaker said on today's Order of Business, a minimum wage must be related to productivity.  The minimum wage being discussed at present would be the second highest in the world.</P>
    <P>I agree with the control of alcohol concerning road fatalities and there is an urgent need for liquor laws to be changed on Saturday night, which has become the new social night out.  Since 68 per cent of people attending Mass now do so on a Saturday evening, the old objection the Church had to extending Saturday licensing hours is no longer valid.</P>
    <P>Closing a pub or hotel at 12 o'clock on a Saturday night is not socially in line with the requirements of the general public.  As people do not have to work on Sunday I would support a <Col N="299" /> change in Saturday night opening hours.  I also support the 2 to 4 o'clock opening hours on Sunday afternoons.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendations before us, Dr. Michael Loftus has spent his entire life dealing with this issue as a county coroner.  He has enormous experience in this area.  I congratulate him and assure him of my personal support in his fight to make the Government react to what is happening with regard to alcohol abuse.  It is not pleasant to have to report that 7,000 people were admitted to psychiatric hospitals for treatment for alcohol abuse in 1997.  Twenty per cent of admissions to general hospitals were alcohol related; this speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's contribution which was down to earth, meaningful and answered some of our questions.  The licensing laws are being considered by Government.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to it the responsibility of parents and teachers to teach the next generation to respect rather than abuse alcohol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on some of the steps already taken to address this problem.  I agree that a certain level of social unacceptability of drink driving has been achieved and that five years ago many more teenagers may have considered drinking and driving.  I hope Senator Cassidy's proposals will be considered.  He spoke from the heart and conveyed his concern and anxiety.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat unnerving to be debating road safety just a week after this House discussed the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland.  There is a massive ground swell of public support for the peace process, driven, in large measure, by revulsion against the thousands of unnecessary deaths in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years. However, despite this attitude we tolerate even more people being killed every year and the deaths on our roads are as unnecessary and as avoidable as the deaths in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that, even during the worst year of the Troubles, the number of deaths resulting from violence was less than the number of deaths in traffic accidents in Ireland, North and South. In more recent years, Irish road deaths have massively outnumbered deaths through violence. However, road deaths do not get the same dramatic headlines.  I welcome this debate because I hope it will remind us of the tragedy of the statistics mentioned by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Every year, in this jurisdiction alone, more than the number of people on a jumbo jet are killed on our roads.  It is easy to say that road deaths are inevitable &mdash; wherever there is traffic, there are road deaths.  However, the number of road deaths in Ireland is higher than in the US, higher than the average for the EU, and much higher than Britain, which has a higher density of road traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcohol and speeding are major causes of road accidents but problems with roads and vehicles <Col N="300" /> also contribute.  However, our national attitude to death on the roads overrides all these causes.  The carnage on the roads is high because we allow it to be so.  That is the real and unforgivable scandal. Our national attitude towards death on the roads is part of the problem.  We need to concentrate on this because we can do something about it.  As a nation which is so revolted by political violence and so elated by the prospect that we may have seen an end to it, how can we tolerate an even higher level of death from road accidents?</P>
    <P>The reason for our attitude is that we do not believe anything can be done about it.  We have a fatalistic approach to road deaths.  We wrongly believe they are an inevitable side effect of traffic &mdash; the more traffic there is the more cars there are, and the more deaths there will be.  So, we just wring our hands every Monday morning when we read about the latest weekend toll.  We just nod in agreement when people rail against drunk driving or excessive speeding.  However, deep down we do not believe anything will ever change.</P>
    <P>This attitude is profoundly wrong.  We can change things, and I will suggest a way to do it.  If my analysis of this problem is correct, the main barrier to change is our conviction that road deaths on the present scale are inevitable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we can prove to ourselves that it is within our power, as a nation, to control that level of death.  I have made the following suggestion in this House previously, and I will go on making it until someone decides to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We should choose one weekend and decide there will be no fatal road accidents.  We could do this by mobilising the community as we do for an event such as the People in Need Telethon.  The nation focused on that for the weekend and everyone knew it was taking place.  For just one weekend, we could focus everyone's attention and behaviour on one issue.</P>
    <P>One weekend is not too much too ask for.  It is hard to ask people never to drink and drive again. However, asking them not to do it for one weekend is an objective much easier to achieve.  We could ask them not to speed and to ensure their cars are in good condition for one weekend.  This is a far more practical approach than sighing every Monday morning and asking why someone does not do something.  This single weekend could change the national attitude.</P>
    <P>If we can prove that, by individual effort, we can cut out road deaths then, for the first time, we will start to change things.  We cannot eliminate road deaths overnight.  However, we can make a radical change in our attitude in a single weekend.  I get excited at that prospect, especially when I see what the telethon can achieve.  A great deal of publicity and focusing of attention would be needed for the Minister to galvanise the nation for one weekend.  However, it would be possible to achieve as nobody would exceed the speed limit for that weekend, whatever the urgency, because they would identify with the campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The cost of such a campaign would be minuscule compared to the hardship and tragedy the current carnage creates.  Astronomical sums are not involved and I would not be surprised if large numbers of people and companies supported it financially.  However, the money could be found in existing budgets.  How many more times will I have to put forward practical proposals before we wake up to the truth that road deaths on this scale are not inevitable?  We can control our destiny, it is in our hands to be able to do something about this.  I would love to see the Minister focus attention on that and fix a date.  It could be done and everybody would wake up and decide to behave themselves for that weekend.</P>
    <P>There is a concern between two different arms of the State.  Local authorities do not always respond to the directions given to them by the Garda and National Safety Council with the speed and commitment they should.  I refer to road signage and markings, particularly in blackspots identified by the Garda.  Financial constraints on local authorities sometimes mean they are put on the long finger rather than being dealt with immediately.  The Government can knock heads together and remind people to work together.  This is a tragedy as big as that in the North.  If one thinks of the efforts galvanised into making sure a solution was found to the problems of the North, the same commitment should put into solving the problem of death on our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important subject and I thank the Minister of State for his attendance. Approximately 450 people were killed on the roads in 1997 of whom 150 were over the drink drive limit.  As a result of the abuse of alcohol there are 150 one parent families today.  Can anyone imagine anything else in society could cause such mayhem?  How much of an outcry would there be from the public?  One need only look at the outcry about BSE and telephone masts and yet not one death was properly linked to them.</P>
      <P>We also know that pedestrians who were killed had a high alcohol content in their blood.  In last Friday's newspapers, the National Road Safety Council told us drink driving, speeding and failure to wear seat belts are the three main causes of road fatalities.  Is it not time we did something serious about it and stopped the glamorisation of drink and advertising by drinks people who are multimillionaires?  Anyone who has observed the Guinness family knows how many millions it made selling a drug.  Alcohol is a drug and anything that affects a person's mind is a drug and yet we are prepared to accept it and allow it to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may not agree, but the drink problem is alarming.  If on a Friday evening one walks around any city or town which has a college, groups of students are to be seen with six packs and carry outs.  Pubs are not the problem because all one will get in them is three or four glasses at the most, but alcohol can be bought in bottles in supermarkets and off licences.  There should be <Col N="302" /> some curtailment on to whom such drink is given. For example, all &ldquo;soaps&rdquo; are set in pubs and all the characters have drinks cabinets in their homes.  When they go home, the first thing they do is go for a bottle.  This is more glamorisation of the drink culture.  Yet this substance caused one third of road deaths in 1997, has killed 43 people this year and over the past 30 years has killed more people than the problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>People were brought in from America and Europe to sit down in the North to bring peace and stop killing.  We have a similar killing machine in the South in the form of alcohol and nobody says a word about it only that it is great stuff and is good for you.  When will we get our priorities right?  70 per cent of our social problems are a result of the abuse of alcohol.  Pubs always control the use of it and will not give drink to teenagers, but they can get as much as they want in off licences.  Many people get drunk at home before they go to pub and only go out at 11 p.m. to meet the boys or girls.</P>
    <P>This is a major source of alcohol abuse.  All pubs should be left open until midnight and there should be no extensions for hotels or otherwise. I have said this at health board meetings for years.  In rural Ireland people go out at 11 p.m. on a summer's evening and if there is an extension in a nearby town they will drive there.  However, they must make the same journey home, but if the pub in the local village was open until midnight people would stay in their locality.  It would be better for the community as people would not travel late at night.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for publicans and spent my time as a garsún around one and that old publican used to say &ldquo;go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.&rdquo; If one puts people out of a pub at midnight and sends them home, they are able to go to work the next day but they are not able if they are kept later.  They become a nuisance at home and to everybody else.  That was a great system that should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister take action on the glamorising and advertising of drink?  Cigarette advertising was stopped and a danger notice put on boxes.  There is a huge campaign against cigarette smoking, but not only smokers die.  Drink kills innocent people and leaves innocent children without a mother or father.  Recent statistics show that a majority of teenage pregnancies resulted from over-indulgence in alcohol.</P>
    <P>I would like to see drink being less glamorised and a return to the old type of pub culture which is a very important part of our society.  However, I am not in favour of drink being served at dances and discos.  I grew up in an age where, if one showed the least sign of having taken a drink, one was not allowed into a dancehall.  The halls were packed to capacity and we danced until 2 a.m. Everyone went home sober, having had an enjoyable night.  The idea that one has to drink or get drunk to enjoy life is nonsense.  I never took a <Col N="303" /> drink and I am a reasonably active and involved man.  One can enjoy oneself without drink.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a speed of 75 miles per hour on a dual carriageway or a good primary route constitutes speeding.  However, a speed of 40 miles per hour on narrow country roads is dangerous.  I have been driving for more than 50 years and driving was my livelihood at one stage. When people attempt to pass out a line of cars, irrespective of the fact that they may be travelling at less than 60 miles per hour, they pose a threat to everyone in the line.  I do not know how that can be policed but I do not believe travelling at 75 miles per hour on a good road or 50 miles an hour leaving a 40 mile zone poses any danger.  We must reconsider this issue in a more mature way.</P>
    <P>I believe that the majority of drivers wear seat belts and, in my opinion, the number of drivers killed as a result of not wearing them is very few. I saw a statistic some time ago that prescribed drugs are responsible for many accidents.  Doctors should warn people who are taking medication that they should not drive.  Many people are obliged to take tablets every three to four hours for health reasons but are they capable of driving after taking them?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House. Drink should no longer be glamorised, we should return to the local pub culture, extend pub opening hours and abolish extensions for discos and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the comments made by previous speakers, particularly Senator Farrell.  I am a former publican, even though I never drank in my life and I was always a very strict publican.  Senator Farrell was correct when he said that the stricter one is as a publican, the more respected one is.  The reason for that is that the people waiting at home for someone to return from the pub expect the publican to ensure that he or she does not have too much to drink.</P>
      <P>I was a publican in Cork city and its suburbs. The situation in regard to drink is a frightening one and one which is not easily resolved.  Intensified action must be taken on road safety and the general safety of the innocent people who are killed.  The levels of affluence today are totally different to what prevailed 20 years ago.  Today's students have access to their fathers', mothers', sisters' or brothers' cars.  Having seven children myself, I am aware of the difficulties in slowing people down and making them aware of the dangers of drink.</P>
      <P>Although I have never taken a drink in my life, I cannot wear the pioneer badge as publicans are prevented from doing so according to the rules of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  I find that totally illogical.  I addressed a group of 1,300 pioneers during the Cork 800 celebrations during which I served as Deputy Lord Mayor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most contented men I have ever met are men who drink a pint.  I have no doubt about that. I have observed men coming into a pub at ten <Col N="304" /> o'clock at night, one of whom might have been a solicitor's clerk, another a fitter and another a general operative.  They sat down and played a game of cards together, drank a couple of pints each and went home very contented.  On a Friday or Saturday night, I might ask their wives what they thought of their men having a pint.  Their view was that if the men were not to go to the pub for a pint, they would be getting very odd indeed.  It is very important for the average person to be content.  One must remember the significance of pub culture to life in Ireland.  Irish pub culture is unique throughout the world and that is why our visitors like it so much.</P>
    <P>Pub opening times do not pose problems. People will always rush to get drink in the hour prior to closing time.  However, under no circumstances should drink be available somewhere else if it is not available where one is drinking.  That practice should be ended.</P>
    <P>We should have a proper, regulated transport authority in this country.  We should not expect the Garda to police this situation.  A proper transport authority should be set up to monitor safety on our roads.  The Garda are expected to police drink driving at Christmas and during the summer season.</P>
    <P>The figures outlined by the Minister show that 64 per cent of the 1,750 samples analysed registered more than twice the legal limit of alcohol. How many were over the limit at all?  What percentage of them were 10 per cent over the limit? Those are the questions we should be asking. People are showing no common sense at all by driving machines which could kill all before them after they have consumed alcohol.  People may not even drive their own car; the car may belong to a person's mother or father although they may be well covered by the insurance.  We must be very stringent in this area.</P>
    <P>Senatorl Quinn referred to students.  Are we prepared to organise information programmes at third level?  Can we not explain to young people what the repercussions of their actions will be?  I do not agree with people under the age of 21 years being served drink and I make no apologies to anyone for that.  I do not think people under 21 years of age have a responsible attitude, particularly boys.  One cannot compare an 18 year old boy and girl.  I have four sons and three daughters myself.  One may be able to compare a 24 year old boy and girl but an 18 year old boy and girl are two different people entirely.  In the main, it is boys who are drinking and showing off to their friends.</P>
    <P>The fruit drinks, now popular in bars, have a 4 per cent alcohol content.  Wine, which has become very popular, often contains 14 per cent alcohol.  This is much more than four pints of Guinness.  The average boy would have difficulty drinking four pints of beer or lager.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice, Gerard Collins, once accepted an amendment to a Liquor Licensing Bill which stipulated that all spirits had to be sold over a counter.  In supermarkets and <Col N="305" /> off-licences they could not be bought off a shelf and the practice of young people serving themselves in supermarkets was stopped.</P>
    <P>Distillers are now selling spirits with fruit flavourings and in beautifully coloured bottles. These coloured bottles contain liquor, one third of which has an alcohol content of 4.4 per cent.  Such a bottle, coloured like orange juice, could contain the equivalent of two glasses of vodka.  Such an quantity of spirits would have a great effect on a young person.</P>
    <P>I served drink for many years and I know what I am talking about.  I once asked a young woman to give me proof of age.  I thought she was under 18 and I made no apologies for questioning her. She was the mother of three children and was in her late twenties.  I was simply enforcing the law. I applied the law strictly in this regard and I know that the vast majority of publicans do likewise.  I know every publican in the Cork region and many throughout the country.  The best person to serve drink is someone who must have his licence renewed every year and who has a responsibility to his licence.  Young people, however, can buy drink in supermarkets.  This is not the fault of the supermarkets but of the legislators.  It is our fault.</P>
    <P>Many of our roads are deadly.  I learned a very useful lesson when the road system was restructured on the east side of Cork city.  Councillors complained about traffic lights but our city traffic engineer explained that if we travelled from Douglas at 22 miles per hour we would meet green lights but if we travelled at 28 or 30 miles per hour we would be stopped at every red light. By driving faster we would not reach our destination any sooner.  I tried this and it worked.  A constant flow of traffic, as has been found in America, is better than going and jamming.  An authority with overall responsibility for transport which could regulate traffic in this way is called for.  That authority would be answerable to the relevant Minister.  Regulations must be applied strictly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister again to discuss road safety.  The Minister has come to the House on many occasions in the past six months to discuss this subject.  In November he outlined figures which opened my eyes.  They related to the huge increase in traffic over the past 20 years. In the late 1970s, in the region of 18 billion kilometres were travelled in Ireland while in 1996 the figure was in the region of 35 billion kilometres. In the same period the number of road deaths fell.  We must be careful when we try to make associations concerning the causes of road deaths.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the use of alcohol is a huge cause of road deaths and injuries.  The level of accidents, whether associated with drink or not, is far too high and must be reduced.  In the United Kingdom the volume of traffic is greater than here but the level of fatalities is half.  This is a lesson for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> The condition of the roads, standards of driving instruction and the enforcement of the law can all play a part in reducing the level of road accidents. Considerable strides have been made in the last few years in improving our primary roads.  Our other roads, however, still need attention. Senator Farrell pointed out that the speed limit on minor roads is the same as on major roads.  It is far more dangerous to travel on minor roads because of the size of vehicles, the speed at which they travel and even the various forms of agricultural and industrial equipment which one meets on them.</P>
    <P>A higher standard of driving instruction would help enormously in raising our awareness of the dangers involved in travelling on the roads.  We need to raise our driving standards.  If I were to take a driving test today I am not sure I would pass it.  Perhaps we should consider a periodic driving test for all drivers.  This might not be popular but such a measure must be considered if we intend seriously to address the problem.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the present laws would help.  I applaud the efforts of the Garda in reducing the level of speeding and their efforts need to be increased and supported.  The advertising campaign against speeding is to be applauded because we need to reduce the level of speeding.</P>
    <P>Education and publicity campaigns can make us aware of the number of accidents, the level of fatalities and of serious injuries and the damage done to families by road accidents.  We blame the Garda Síochaná, local authorites and other bodies but we, the drivers, have the ultimate control over what happens on the roads.  The problems all stem from speeding.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably drink plays a major part in road accidents.  The past four or five years have seen a change in people's attitudes to drinking and driving.  Regularly, people going out at night ensure that one person has responsibility for driving and does not drink.  This is to be applauded. The figures provided by the Minister indicate that far too many people killed or injured in road accidents have very high levels of alcohol in their systems. We must take this on board and address it in a much more serious manner.  We must also consider what Senator Quinn said concerning the culture of drinking and driving and the need to change the mind set.  There is merit in his suggestion that we focus on trying to attain an accident or fatalities free weekend.  Success in doing so would show that huge improvements can be made.  This, rather than tinkering with various things, will bring about the mind set required to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I recognise the point made by the Minister regarding the legal limit for blood alcohol limits and that the situation in other EU countries will be monitored to see the effect of the reduction to 50 mgs.  We should consider a reduction in this area.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that we examine speed limits, particularly on minor roads.  We must also address road signage.  How often are road signs, <Col N="307" /> particularly in rural areas, dirty and unreadable? Often they are hidden by hedgerows, not visible or completely absent.</P>
    <P>The Punchestown festival is on this week.  Like all festivals, this is an event to which many people go to enjoy themselves and during which alcohol will be consumed.  I am not suggesting this should be stopped, but a contributing part in reducing the level of road accidents could be the provision of facilities, with the aid of the Garda, for people leaving to quickly find out whether they are over the legal limit.  It they are, they should be stopped and not allowed travel rather than being allowed proceed and being subsequently stopped on the road.  Technology is such that there must be some relatively simple, if not totally accurate, indicator of whether people are near the legal limit.  It would be helpful if such facilities were provided at major festivals.</P>
    <P>We need a total change in culture in terms of drinking and driving.  We must all be stringent about our own way of life and our approach to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I abhor drinking and driving, as do most people.  However, it is not the only factor in causing accidents &mdash; there are many other factors which do not involve drink.  One factor, mentioned by Senator Quinn, is the number of new cars on the roads.  One only needs look at registration numbers to realise that thousands of new cars are coming on the roads in the first few months of each year.  Obviously this adds to the number of accidents.</P>
      <P>Regarding alcohol and licensing hours, I do not agree with my colleague, Senator Cassidy, that there is no need for a review of the licensing laws in the context of opening hours.  The hours of trading set down in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, are in need of urgent change, taking into account current drinking and eating patterns. Over the past eight years or so social drinking, particularly in Dublin, has undergone major change.  Dublin is a cosmopolitan European city and yet the licensing hours are totally out of line with the flexible trading hours elsewhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>It is an acknowledged fact that customers frequenting licensed premises wish to stay later than in the past.  This widespread practice places greater pressure on publicans and staff to clear premises on time.  The licensed trade is a central part of the hospitality industry and, understandably, publicans do not wish to force customers to leave their premises after closing time by resorting to practices used in the past.  The vast majority of the trade's customers would not accept such treatment.  By extending closing hours to 12.30 a.m. with an additional 30 minutes drinking up time, the law would be simply acknowledging what is happening in many circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current hours are complicated and confusing for locals and tourists alike.  The &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; on <Col N="308" /> Sunday is a prime issue.  It has no relevance to either rural or urban populations and should be abolished.  Similarly, the trading hours from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. are not being followed.  Sunday is a family day, with families of all categories eating out.  Over the past 15 years or so the licensed trade, particularly in Dublin, has developed a very significant presence in the sale of reasonably priced food.  This aspect of business suits customers extremely well.  There is no doubt that our members' trade in food could expand considerably on Sundays if restrictive closings between 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock were removed.  In addition, there is a growing volume of televised sport on Sundays between these hours which also places our members under pressure from the public. Critics argue that removal of this restrictive closing would result in alcohol abuse but the response is clear.  Removal under the 1988 Act of the 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. closing on Mondays to Saturdays had no such effect.</P>
    <P>Current hours of trading have their historical roots in Victorian times when the conventional wisdom was that alcohol abuse could in large measure be reduced or at least curtailed by limiting opening hours.  This concept is unacceptable in present day society.  Today's customers are, on the whole, more mature, better nourished and far more educated than their Victorian ancestors. Allowing for a small minority of the population, most people are better equipped to make sensible decisions for themselves regarding their drinking habits.  Extending hours of trading for the on licence trade, the most controlled environment in which to drink, will do much to further the objective of promoting sensible drinking.  It certainly will do nothing to set it back.</P>
    <P>For many years members states of the EU have had complete flexibility on premises hours of trading.  None of these countries sees control of hours of trading as a means of limiting alcohol abuse, which is a much more complex issue and falls outside the scope of this debate.  Recent experience in a number of societies which have drinking habits similar to ours, notably Scotland and New Zealand, has shown that longer hours of trading promote a generally more responsible approach to drinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister Deputy Molloy, to the House and congratulate him on the frequency of his visits to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should set up a system so that drivers are more courteous.  There should be a code of conduct on the road to which drivers would adhere because, as Senator Bohan said, the volume of traffic has increased considerably over the past three to four years in particular.  I remember looking at a survey about three years ago which stated that the average number of cars per 100 of population was about 25 whereas the European and British averages were about 55.  I would presume that our average has now increased to nearer 50 compared to the 25 per 100 of just three to four years ago.  Every household now has two <Col N="309" /> cars, so the volume of traffic on our roads has increased significantly.</P>
    <P>However, there is no code of conduct on the roads.  One will invariably see a slow driver driving on the white line rather than on the hard shoulder.  This can be very frustrating for people travelling behind them, particularly if the person in front is travelling at 25 or 30 miles per hour. There is an obligation on the Garda traffic corps to bring to the attention of those people that they are doing more harm driving slowly on the centre of the road than if they were driving quickly because they are impeding the people behind who may be in a hurry.  Such driving excites drivers in traffic which has backed up as a result and leads them to take driving decisions which they would not normally consider if there was nobody in front of them.  This is one of the reasons for many offences and crashes on the roads.</P>
    <P>The 60 miles per hour speed limit on motorways, dual-carriageways and many good roads which have been built over the past five or six years should be increased to 80 miles per hour. The present speed limit of 60 miles per hour on county roads is too high in most cases.  Speed limits of 30, 40 or 50 miles per hour would be more appropriate.  We should change the speed limits to suit the stretch of road concerned.  If it is a bad stretch of road the limit should be 30 or 40 miles per hour, but on motorways we should be able to travel at 80 miles per hour.  The Minister should look at this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons said that road signage and road markings are not adequate and I would agree wholeheartedly with him.  I know the National Roads Authority has assumed responsibility for the signage on national primary and secondary routes, but surely there is a need for better markings on these routes particularly for traffic signalling to turn right.  Such cars invariably pull over in the middle of the road at the white line.  If there is a line of following traffic, there is no safe place for that vehicle to pull in.  It often happens that a car two or three cars back will try to pass all the preceding cars.  Such behaviour has caused a number of accidents, many of which were fatal.  Therefore, road markings along national primary and secondary routes would need to be upgraded immediately.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking and alcohol abuse are serious problems in this country.  While the matter has been debated adequately here and many explanations have been given for it, I think we should look to the example in Boston.  In Boston there is a law which states that nobody under 21 is allowed drink alcohol in a public place.  If one wants to take the family out for a meal, one cannot go to a place which sells alcohol.  It is a good law and the Minister should consider implementing it here.</P>
    <P>I have seen young people between the ages of 12 and 14 at discos in my home town walking around with cans of Coke laced with vodka or other spirits.  They are buying this drink somewhere, whether it is in off licences, supermarkets <Col N="310" /> or public houses, and they are walking around the streets with it disguised in Coke cans.  The law must be adhered to more strictly because somebody is selling it or else somebody is buying it for them.  The penalties for such offences must be more severe.</P>
    <P>Anxiety has been expressed, particularly in the western counties, about the licensing laws over the past number of months.  Drinking time should be extended, particularly in tourist areas, and the law should be changed.  Any public house of a certain standard should be able to apply for an exemption.  If the owner does not wish to have an exemption, then there is no obligation on him or her to have one.  The owner should be able to go to the court to get an exemption and he or she should not have to employ a solicitor unless the authorities object to the application.  This is costing publicans millions of pounds annually.</P>
    <P>A radical change is needed.  There are too many regulations.  It should be simplified.  There should be set opening and closing times.  Anybody who requires an exemption should be able to go to the court to get it.  Sunday closing time between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. should be abolished. If public houses wish to trade on Sunday afternoons, they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we feel we must discuss this subject once again but it is appropriate considering there have been 128 fatalities this year. As previous speakers stated, there are a number of factors which have increased fatalities on the roads, including the improvements to the roads.  I think the improvements to cars and the fact that they are faster cars have also led to the increase in fatalities.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the implications of alcohol abuse on road safety.  This is something which is particularly close to my heart.  I feel so strongly about it that I think anybody who drinks and drives is a potential murderer.  Nobody goes out to kill somebody after a night of drinking of course, but why does anybody drink and drive? Even in rural areas like my own, there is always somebody who will not drink on a night out.  As far as I am concerned, it is irresponsible not to organise that a non-drinker drives when going out for the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about drink driving, young people always come out worst in that they are made to feel responsible for it.  I would feel that the opposite is the case in that younger people who pay dearly for cars and more dearly for car insurance are more responsible as regards drink driving.  I know from meeting them when I am out for the night that they are extremely responsible in that regard.  However, the same cannot be said for our older generation who often claim that they know the roads well or that they were driving long before we were born.  We must change that attitude.  Many pedestrians who have taken too much to drink often walk along the white line <Col N="311" /> in the middle of the road.  I am not sure if they do this for guidance but it is extremely dangerous, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>As someone who does not drink when socialising, I know that some of our public houses frown on people who ask for non-alcoholic drinks. Many public houses have &ldquo;happy hours&rdquo; to encourage people into their premises, yet a non-drinker is made to feel they should not be there. This is wrong.  It has got to the stage where I and a number of my friends who do not drink feel bad about asking for non-alcoholic drinks.  We have such an alcoholic culture that it is almost unacceptable to drink non-alcoholic drinks.  Many non-drinkers often have to leave people home after a night's drinking.  We must change the attitudes of people who own public houses.</P>
    <P>A number of things could be done to tackle the problem of drink driving.  As people who go out for one drink often end up drinking two or more, they should make plans for someone to drive them home.  No one takes only one drink.  As the Minister said, a number of European countries have reduced the legal limit from 80 milligrammes to 50 milligrammes.  However, I am in favour of banning drink driving because there is no point going out for one drink.  I also support greater penalties for those caught drink driving. Other Senators mentioned the extended opening hours as a factor in the equation.  That is not an issue because people who drink and drive will do so regardless of whether the pub closes at 11 p.m. or 4 a.m.</P>
    <P>When quoting insurance premiums, insurance companies do not tell people that there is an extra bonus for people who are members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  That would considerably reduce the cost of car insurance, particularly for young people.  This should be more extensively advertised because I am sure young people who do not drink, but who may not be pioneers, do not realise that is the case.</P>
    <P>No one would dispute that speed is the greatest problem on our roads.  The gardaí must be commended for setting up so many checkpoints throughout my county.  Anyone who exceeds the speed limit or drinks and drives is, therefore, foolish. Last night when I was driving home at midnight I stopped at a Garda checkpoint a half a mile outside one of the main towns.  Approximately two miles further down the road a 1998 Monaghan registered car sped past me.  At the time I thought they were lucky because they had missed the checkpoint two miles back.  However, as I drove on I was delighted to see that he had been pulled in by the Garda Síochána.  As I approached my home town five or ten miles further on, the same car sped past me again.  I was sorry the Garda had not set up another checkpoint. Their attitude was that they had met the gardaí in one town and were caught two miles further down the road so they would not meet them a third time.  This person was driving at 80 <Col N="312" /> or 90 miles per hour on roads which are not made for such speed.</P>

      <P>I would love to say the roads in Monaghan are so good that people could travel safely at such speeds but, unfortunately, I cannot.</P>
      <P>We must change the mindset of our citizens.  I fully endorse giving the Garda Síochána greater powers to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Leonard.  I am sure we all approve of the measures which must be taken and condemn what has been happening on our roads.  It would be better to concentrate on practical recommendations which can be implemented rather than repeating our horror at what is happening.  Our campaign to retain our duty free status and my party's request for more flexible drinking hours suggest that drinking will not be banned in the foreseeable future.  Drink will be with us for a long time so we must ensure it does not have a detrimental effect on the lives of our citizens.</P>
      <P>It is alarming that already this year 129 people have been killed on our roads.  I have no doubt we are on our way to equalling the record number of people who died last year despite Operation Lifesaver and the measures adopted by the National Safety Council.  There are an increasing number of deaths and injuries on our roads. Factors such as the growing economy, more disposable incomes and more cars on the roads must be taken into account as well as speeding, drink driving, under-age drinking, driving without insurance and a lack of awareness of the horror of causing a fatal accident.  All are interconnected, but it all boils down to one major factor &mdash; we have a pub culture in this country.  We are a gregarious people who like to meet over a pint or glass of wine.  We use this as a tourist attraction. Any tourist brochure about Ireland will mention Guinness and Irish pub life as one of the major attractions.  We must recognise that is the type of society in which we live and will continue to live.  We are not going to change.</P>
      <P>We need practical measures.  My colleague in the other House, Deputy Upton, suggested that we should have more flexible licensing hours.  The pubs close at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. While we read in the papers that there are problems in country areas with the implementation of the law, trade union pubs in Dublin close at the correct time. People are coming out of the pubs in large numbers after drinking to a deadline.  It is the same deadline every night, whether it is the middle of the week, the weekend, a holiday or Christmas. There is panic drinking and a number of rounds are bought as closing time approaches.  If you go into any pub, at the weekends in particular, you will see people with four or five pints in front of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> People then leave the pub and at the same time public transport is finishing for the night.  There are no buses, the DART is not running and the only way to get home is by taxi.  The incentive to bring the car is enormous.  Anyone waiting two hours for a taxi in Dublin in the winter has their night ruined.</P>
    <P>We do not have a system to deal with our pub social culture.  If we had staggered hours of closing so that pubs could close depending on their clientele, as they do on the continent, there would be flexibility for the licence holder to operate in terms of his customer base.  Not every pub would close at the same time, disgorging its clientele onto the streets to queue for a taxi or go home by car.  The deadline which has to be met in every pub in the country must be removed and the public transport system must be examined in the same context.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard referred to a ban on drinking and driving.  I would not favour that as a blanket measure, but we could approach this matter by issuing many more licences in the city of Dublin. In rural areas there are pubs on every village corner, but because of the increase of population in the city of Dublin there is a very low ratio of public houses to citizenry.  There should be no excuse for anyone in the city driving to a pub and driving home afterwards.  There is a pub within easy reach of almost everyone.  We should, however, increase the number of pubs in some densely populated areas.  In parts of Ballyfermot and</P>
    <P>Finglas, areas which have sprawled out from the city, there is a small number of pubs compared to the concentration in the heart of the city.  Many people like to come in to the heart of the city because of the greater selection of pubs.  If there was a greater selection of pubs in the suburbs people would be able to select a local and there would be a number from which to choose.  I suggest we have a ban on drinking and driving in the city but not until we take these measures so that no one has the excuse that there is no pub within walking distance.  People should be able to meet their friends in a pub, socialise, have a drink and then walk home.  These are the practical measures we should take.</P>
    <P>The other major contributory factor to drink-related fatalities is speeding.  It was suggested previously by Senator Farrell that each vehicle should compulsorily have a control mechanism to determine the level of speed and which could be subject to on the spot inspection.  If that existed there would be a record of people speeding and it could be checked from time to time.  That would automatically impose a restriction on drinking and driving.</P>
    <P>In certain areas there is inadequate lighting and marking of the roads.  It is important that light is adequate and that road markings are clear and luminous.  In some areas there are no markings at all, there is no white line in the middle of the road.  Many county councils are remiss in not having markings on major roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> The insurance industry gives the quality of driving as a reason for the high insurance premium levels.  The insurance companies themselves are remiss in quoting high prices to young people irrespective of their driving ability.  There is a huge number of uninsured cars on the road because it is impossible to get insurance.  Ireland is one of the worst countries with regard to high motor insurance costs.  In most cases, despite a statutory requirement for motor insurance, the quotation is so high it is impossible for that requirement to be implemented.  We must ask insurance companies not to raise their insurance quotations to such a degree that they effectively put many people off the road.  Uninsured drivers tend to take greater chances, which appears to be a knock-on effect in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem.  Although we should not be over-optimistic about what we can do, a number of practical measures can be taken in the context of the public house culture in our society.  If they were taken, they would probably be more effective in securing a satisfactory outcome than simply introducing a drastic ban or imposing a 50 milligramme level throughout the EU.  Ireland might be better suited to the imposition of a total ban in a controlled situation.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh na hAirí Stáit, na Teachtaí O'Dea agus Molloy. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire toisc gur chuir sé ráiteas machánta díreach ós ár gcomhair inniu.  Im thuairimse, tá sé de dhualgas orainn sa tír seo áird a thabhairt ar na stataisticí atá sa ráiteas seo agus ba chóir go mbeadh poiblíocht le fáil ag an ráiteas ins na páipéirí, ar an raidió agus ar an teilifís.  De ghnáth, ní tharlaíonn sé sin ach ba chóir go dtarlódh sé im thuairimse már tá an cheist seo thar a bheith práinneach agus ba chóir dúinn rud éigean a dheanamh faoi.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement which was forthright, unambiguous and exceptionally honest.  It presented stark statistics which are worthy of serious study.  One hundred and twenty nine people have already been slaughtered on the roads this year.  If 129 or even 29 people were killed in a single accident, the nation would be numbed before being provoked into action.  However, we appear to have become immune to road death statistics even though we are reminded of them so often when driving through the country.  Roadsides are dotted with crosses at locations where people, young and old, have had their lives ended prematurely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad the Minister of State was forthright in putting before the House the interconnection between alcohol abuse and road accidents. Dr. Mick Loftus, former president of the GAA and a great crusader against the abuse of alcohol, said that most of the fatalities from road accidents which came before him in his capacity as coroner for County Mayo were the direct result of the abuse of alcohol.  He went on to say that most sporting organisations in this country are sponsored by the drinks industry, as are most <Col N="315" /> cultural organisations and festivals.  One need not be extremely bright to realise that such sponsorship gives the wrong message to the general community. One solution to this problem might be for the national lottery to provide about £2 million per year to replace the grants which those organisations receive from the drinks industry. That would serve to remove one glamorous aspect of drinking.</P>
    <P>Drink has been glamorised in many ways.  It is presented as being energy giving and is associated with success.  It has a yuppie, sometimes healthy, image.  Everybody knows this is not true and that it is fraudulent advertising.  There is no reason legislation should not be enacted to prevent such advertising.</P>
    <P>The recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on alcoholism was one of the greatest contributions for many years to alerting people to the great problem in our midst.  Dr. Patrick Nugent underlined the problem with stark statistics.  He said the abuse of alcohol is one of the greatest social and medical problems confronting society.  He said something else with which many might disagree &mdash; that the AIDS and drugs problems fade into insignificance when compared to the damage inflicted on so many people through the abuse of alcohol. More young people have died, he said, as a result of the abuse of alcohol than the total number who have died in the Northern Ireland conflict in the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>On the same programme, a young female university student openly and honestly admitted that in two nights she might drink up to 30 pints of beer.  That is almost four gallons of beer.  If one wished to be humorous one could say a calf would not drink as much liquid in two weeks.  The reason she advanced for drinking four gallons of beer, and she suggested she was speaking on behalf of most young students, was the pressures of college.  Alcohol was necessary to relieve the stress.</P>
    <P>I believe we must delve deeper to find out why this problem exists in the same way as we must delve deeper to explain why there are so many accidents on our roads.  We can devise many legislative measures but until attitude and culture are changed we will not get to the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>Courtesy is no longer part and parcel of everyday life.  Many young and not so young people no longer have regard for the rights of others.  They have no regard, for example, for older people.  If somebody from a rural area attempts to drive through Dublin city and hesitates for a moment before taking a certain road, he or she is immediately treated to the New York syndrome of other drivers hooting their car horns.  We must ask people to have manners and to show courtesy on the roads.  A new vocabulary has been spawned by our behaviour on the roads.  We now talk about joyriding and road rage instead of presenting it for what it is, the slaughter of innocent people and the use of a propelled vehicle as <Col N="316" /> a weapon.  We must point that out but we have not done so yet.</P>
    <P>The situation is not helped by being humorous about it.  Listening to many speakers who contributed to this debate one might suggest that because we are members of the Pioneers' Total Abstinence Association, this debate might be a meeting of the association.  I am a pioneer and I have been invited many times to address seminars and conferences held by the Irish Vintners Association.  I have accepted those invitations.  I do not see it as a contradiction because I have great regard and respect for publicans.  I am conscious of the service they give and of the fact that the pub has become a social focus, although that is not a good thing.  When we were young there were ballrooms and other outlets for young people.  Today, the lounge bar appears to be the main centre for social activities.  However, we should not blame publicans.  Most of them are honourable and responsible.</P>
    <P>Most publicans do not want opening hours to be extended.  One of the arguments advanced in favour of extending opening hours is that tourists have requested and require this facility.  However, in my experience, tourists, particularly those from America, tend to retire at 11 p.m. or midnight because they may have an early start the next morning.  Therefore, that argument does not stand up to scrutiny.  It would be wrong to extend the opening hours if we were doing so merely for the sake of commerce.</P>
    <P>As a result of this debate and the debate which is taking place in the public arena, I hope we will adopt a more sensible and responsible attitude.  I do not believe there is anything funny about alcohol abuse, but it forms the main part of the stock in trade of most comedians.  Worse still, international comedians use a stereotypical Irishman as part of their act.  That is not fair.  When one travels abroad one discovers that many of them refer to that stereotype.  They ask &ldquo;Do you drink?&rdquo; and when you reply in the negative they say &ldquo;I thought all Irish people drank.&rdquo; Bord Fáilte is not immune to criticism in this regard and it has not done the country any great service in terms of the development in Temple Bar.  People are travelling to Dublin in their droves to spend the weekend drinking.  That is the image which is being presented.  If a person involved in some sporting achievement is asked what they intend to do that evening they invariably reply that they will &ldquo;have a few pints&rdquo;. I do not believe we should be presenting such an image.  I understand Bord Fáilte is beginning to realise that and its advertising campaign will change to alter that image.</P>
    <P>The message we should send to the drinks and tourism industries, publicans and cultural and sporting organisations is that this is a serious matter; it is not a laughing matter and it is not solely the responsibility of legislators and the Garda Síochána.  Everyone has a responsibility and we should all make a contribution to finding solutions. <Col N="317" /> We should not continue to allow young people to ruin their lives.  These individuals begin drinking at 15 or 16 years of age, before they have an opportunity to decide if they wish to take that route through life.</P>

      <P>When I was in the Chair, Senator Farrell stated that I might have a number of comments to make from a professional point of view. I welcome the opportunity to make those comments now.</P>
      <P>Having been at the receiving end of casualties entering hospital who have been involved in fatal car accidents, I was appalled to discover the part played by alcohol in many of these tragedies; the people involved were very drunk.  It was not a question of their being slightly over the legal limit, very often they were several times over that limit.</P>
      <P>When the Road Traffic Act was debated in the House I was glad that the then Minister for the Environment accepted an amendment I tabled to the effect that those involved in accidents could have their blood alcohol level tested in accident and emergency departments.  In the past it was infuriating that people would leap into ambulances if they believed their alcohol level was high to avoid being breathalysed by the Garda and when they reached hospital we were not in a position to take their blood alcohol level.  I am extremely glad that this has been rectified and that people are becoming aware of the role alcohol plays in many accidents.</P>
      <P>An incredible number of pedestrians who have consumed alcohol have been involved in fatal accidents.  A considerable percentage of these people were not knocked down and it has been discovered that they were often lying in the road when a motor vehicle drove over them.  It is good that this has been tackled.</P>
      <P>We must give serious consideration to the fact that other drugs, particularly illegal substances, are often to blame in fatal accidents involving young people.  Lethal cocktails of illegal drugs and alcohol are often found to be present in young people involved in road accidents.  In some of the most appalling accidents, particularly those which occurred in County Louth in recent months, very high levels of illegal drugs were discovered in the bloodstream of those who caused and who died in those accidents but unfortunately, innocent people were also killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Members commented that doctors may not give sufficient warning to people about the danger of driving while taking legally prescribed drugs.  I would be anxious if that was the case because doctors and pharmacists make an effort to warn people about this and drugs are carefully labelled.  However, if the Minister of State believes the medical profession is not doing enough to warn patients about the dangers involved, I am sure members of the profession would not object to new information being issued.  Ireland has strict rules about drivers who take prescribed drugs.  For example, drivers with <Col N="318" /> epilepsy who take prescribed medication must not have had an attack for two years.  In the United Kingdom and the European Union in general, the restriction in this regard is only one year.  Therefore, Ireland is very strict about the use of prescribed drugs.</P>
    <P>People not wearing their seatbelts is an important factor in fatal accidents.  If people to not fasten their seatbelts when they are sober they are unlikely to do so when they are drunk. Perhaps we could take action to improve the compliance rate of 65 per cent in this area.  It is extraordinarily depressing that people are killed because they went through the windscreens of their vehicles.  If they had worn their seatbelts, they would only have suffered broken ribs.  That point cannot be stressed often enough.  People sitting in the rear of a vehicle rarely wear the seatbelts provided and young children are often permitted to stand unrestrained between the front seats or they are placed in baby seats which are improperly secured or allowed to sit in the front passenger seat which is illegal.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of State two resolutions tabled at the recent annual general meeting of the Irish Medical Organisation.  Both were put forward by the Kilkenny general practitioners branch.  The first, resolution No. 27, called on the Irish Medical Organisation to urgently request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to immediately arrange for the installation and use of automated alcohol analysers in Garda stations under the provisions of section 49 of the Road Traffic Act and, failing this, that members should consider the withdrawal of their services under the Act.  This was noted by the annual general meeting.  In view of the fact that the implementation of section 49 of the Act relies entirely on the medical profession, I hope the Minister of State will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because it ties in with the improvement in methodology used in roadside alcohol tests to which he referred.</P>
    <P>The other motion, No. 28, instructed the Irish Medical Organisation's executive to enter into negotiations regarding the establishment, professional training and appointment of a national network of designated Garda doctors to provide forensic medical services.  This motion was carried. There are four Garda doctors in Dublin and there are a number situated in other large urban areas.  The service they provide works well.  Most European countries have police doctors who form a special select group on which law enforcement authorities rely.  As far as I understand, there is enormous co-operation between those doctors and the medical profession.  However, general practitioners in rural areas often encounter difficulties because they must act as Garda doctors for their patients and people they know socially.  This problem must be tackled as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Professor Harbison, the State Pathologist, is anxious to become involved in establishing a proper training programme for Garda doctors.  He is willing to become directly involved if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform establishes such a structure.  There are doctors who have been trained to provide this service already but they believe they need ongoing training.  Continuing education is essential in any field of medicine. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should consider setting up a national network of Garda doctors.  That would be more satisfactory than the current scheme, which does not operate well in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue and Senators have highlighted the main problems.  We could speak at length on the problems related to alcohol consumption.  We must compliment the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the major improvements made in past years on many fronts.  We have sought improvements in road infrastructure for many years and we welcome the record investment in national and non-national roads.  However, such developments lead to other problems.  The Department must also be commended for improvements in vehicle safety, including the increased regulation tyre tread depth, the compulsory fitting of front and rear seat belts in cars and minibuses and the fitting of speed governors to large trucks and buses.  When driving one often wonders how well the latter measure is being implemented because heavy vehicles seem to travel at excessive speeds.</P>
      <P>We must welcome the introduction of new speed limit structures and the comprehensive restructuring of the drink driving laws in recent years, in particular the adoption of the 80 milligrammes alcohol per 100 millilitres blood level. The law should be that if one drinks one cannot drive so that there would no question of individuals wondering whether they were over the limit. We also welcome the empowerment of local authorities to provide traffic calming measures in built up areas to reduce the speed of traffic.  Many local authorities have taken such measures which have ensured a reduction in speeding in towns and villages and, no doubt, contributed to saving many lives.</P>
      <P>The Garda has been empowered to impound vehicles where a member of the Garda considers that a driver is too young to hold a driving licence.  That is a welcome measure which has helped save lives by ensuring that such vehicles are taken off the road.  For many years young people could buy old cars for next to nothing and drive them without having a driver's licence, tax or insurance.  There are many fatalities on the roads involving motorbikes and we welcome the compulsory wearing of crash helmets.  For too long motorcyclists and pillion passengers, in particular, did not use crash helmets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> The Department recently published a manual on low cost remedial measures for accident blackspots. The NRA has also made a major contribution of £3 million to provide proper signage of about 300 dangerous accident blackspots and I hope it will continue to make funds available for such signage.  That will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on the roads.  Both measures are welcome.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have an enhanced role in promoting road safety through co-ordinated efforts at local level.  The setting up of working groups comprising the local authorities and the Garda is a welcome development.  Schools, health boards and businesses will also be involved. About two years ago the Department published a traffic signs manual for the guidance of local authorities; this was welcome.  When we talk about road accidents there is a tendency to knock the Department and the local authorities, but much good work has been done in the past few years, although work still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The introduction of on-the-spot fines has had a positive effect.  I talked to somebody recently who travelled to Dublin from the midlands three times in a two week period and he was caught speeding each time.  It cost him £50 each time in on-the-spot fines and that made him realise the expense of speeding.</P>
    <P>The statistic the Minister of State quoted, that of more than 6,500 cases 62 per cent were two times over the legal blood alcohol limit, is frightening given that at any given time the Garda will only catch a small percentage of those driving with excess alcohol in their blood.  The only solution is to have a law whereby if one drinks one cannot drive.</P>
    <P>We are at the end of the fourth month of 1998, yet already 129 people have been killed on the roads.  A year or so ago local people from Enfield, County Meath, put white crosses along a stretch of the N4.  It may not have been right to do it and the crosses were removed, but it brought home to all of us who use that road the huge number of people who are killed on it.  Many families have lost loved ones on that road in a short number of years.  When those crosses were placed on that one mile stretch of road close to Enfield it brought the problem home to us all.  The 50 miles an hour speed limit from Enfield onto the motorway has had a major effect in reducing the number of fatalities.  I commend the county council for enabling people to drive with care.</P>
    <P>As a councillor I do not like criticising local authorities but if more money was spent on improving inside traffic lanes many trucks could pull over to allow cars to pass at a reasonable speed.  Bottlenecks are causing major problems because some drivers become frustrated when trying to make up time on their journeys.</P>
    <P>If public houses are going to close at midnight or 12.30 a.m., there is little use in enabling people to move on to clubs and discos with licensing extensions where they can consume beer until the small hours of the morning.  That problem must <Col N="321" /> be tackled immediately.  I would like to see all pubs closing early, but I understand the situation. If they are to remain open longer there is little use in being picked up by a bus and brought back to where your car is parked in a local town or village if people are tanked up.  Many people going into work the following morning would certainly not pass the breathalyser test.</P>
    <P>In addition to the cost of alcoholic drink, the cost of minerals remains high because huge taxes are involved.  We must examine the possibly of reducing the cost of minerals in order to facilitate those who choose to drink non-alcoholic beverages.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in changing the licensing laws, we will ensure the safety of road users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">

      <P>As someone with a background in the licensed vintners' trade, I fully understand the difficulties involved in the business.  I also understand the difficulties raised in the debate relating to road safety and alcohol abuse.  This serious situation needs to be addressed but many aspects are involved.  Previous speakers mentioned cultural aspects, including the focus on traditional Irish music in the pub scene and the fact that public houses are the focal point of rural communities.  Friends and foreign visitors enjoy those cultural aspects of licensed premises but, in the same context, one must take into account the horrific loss of life on our roads.</P>
      <P>As a family man, I abhor the experience of attending funerals of young people who have died as a result of the carnage on our roads.  The County Mayo coroner, Dr. Michael Loftus, has fought a campaign against alcohol abuse.  He has undertaken tremendous research into the problem and has put the Dóchas campaign together, including those involved in all aspects of community development.  Those involved in the campaign from different community spheres, such as education and family life, have outlined the problem as it stands now.</P>
      <P>We talk about the growth and improvement in the economy but the personal damage that alcohol related problems cost the State's health services must be weighed against Exchequer returns from the drinks trade.  The State should take a planned approach towards dealing with this issue. The part alcohol plays in the economy should be seriously examined.</P>
      <P>The approach by publicans, licensees and educationalists to alcohol should be similar to that taken towards cigarettes, even though it may not be as simple a matter.  We are dealing with a drug which many people cannot handle.  Many people have tremendous difficulty enjoying a few drinks and adjusting to work in a happy and responsible way.  One comes across many friends who have joined Alcoholics Anonymous and have found there an opportunity to develop a new way of life by dealing with the problems that alcohol abuse has caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last few years Governments have invested enormous sums in our nationals roads, <Col N="322" /> including signage.  The increase in traffic volumes has been enormous.  The road from the west to Dublin was extremely busy today, with trucks and articulated vehicles using it.  There is little room for any mistakes on the roads if one wishes to avoid fatalities.  The growth in our economy, including the increased purchase of cars and other vehicles, commercial aspects and service industries, has brought about this huge influx in traffic.</P>
    <P>Long ago people could get away with drinking and driving, but that time has gone because of the huge change in our laws and society.  It is important to face up to this matter, but vintners have not played a genuine and constructive part in dealing with alcohol and alcohol abuse.  There should be a planned approach by the Government, vintners, Guinness and other suppliers to buy up many of the rural licences, thus reducing the overall numbers.  There is much competition in rural towns and the viability of some of the businesses is questionable because there are not enough people living in rural areas to service existing licences.  If rural licences were limited it would bring about some order.  Laws would be controllable and manageable and pubs would not have to stay open all night trying to sustain business and competing to such an extent.  It is different in cities.  The drinks business is developing enormously in other parts of the country because they do not have the problems of rural areas.</P>
    <P>There were very few discos 15 years ago.  The disco trade is now a major one and provides support to the tourism sector as it is the mainstay of many hotels.  It also results in huge gatherings of young people at night.  The pub used to provide a balanced combination of people drinking in a responsible environment.  In the west, parents are put out of pubs at closing time but young people are drinking until 2.30 a.m. and 3 a.m and this is affecting a great number of young people.  I am not anti-alcohol and I wish to act responsibly but I believe there is a problem there.  The GAA, football teams and those involved in the education system say there is a huge problem, particularly following holiday weekends.  As a member of the trade, I know publicans and discos are serving those who are under-age.</P>
    <P>The Assistant Garda Commissioner said today that the difficulties in the west as regards licensing hours were due to legislation we put in place. He is right but there is a responsibility on the Garda to do something about under-age drinking in public or on licensed premises.  This drinking is having an adverse effect on many families and is often the cause of many accidents.</P>
    <P>Publicans justify their request for longer opening hours on the basis of comparisons with other countries which cater for tourists.  At the recent conference it was suggested that vintners should play a role in monitoring and prohibiting drug use on their premises.  It was also said that pubs should return to traditional values where families drank together and young people were educated about alcohol.  Publicans should be responsible in <Col N="323" /> working with the Government.  There should be <i>quid pro quo</i> and a balanced approach should be taken.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about young people congregating late at night and under-age drinking.  The off-licence trade is not demonstrating responsibility in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

      <P>As a constituency colleague of the Minister of State, I welcome him to the House.  It is difficult to believe that people drink and drive in this day and age and we do not expect it to happen.  However, the number of drink driving offences demonstrates it does.  As someone said, anyone who turns on the ignition in a car having taken drink is using a lethal weapon and is setting themselves up to be a killer.</P>
      <P>The anti-drinking and driving &ldquo;serial killer&rdquo; campaign on television at the moment is valuable and focused.  I hope it makes people stop and think that if they get into a car having had a couple of drinks, they may kill someone.  Speeding, added to drinking and driving, is another weapon which can be used in the destruction of innocent lives.</P>
      <P>The killing has to stop.  We cannot accept one more death on our roads because someone was foolish enough to drive after having a couple of drinks.  Zero tolerance must be enforced.  The gardaí should enforce the law stringently throughout the year.  We know how effective the Christmas anti-drink driving campaign is and how people make arrangements to get home having had a couple of drinks or they designate a driver. This must happen throughout the year.</P>
      <P>It is a question of education and a change in attitude.  Without being sexist, the wild boy syndrome must be discouraged.  We must educate people from an early age that drinking and driving is not acceptable.  People who drink must find another way to get home.  Drinking and driving must be despised, not admired.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, said recently when he launched the Government's alcohol policy, we need to control alcohol before it controls us.  If we are to reduce the number of road deaths and injuries related to alcohol abuse, we must control alcohol abuse.  We need to support whatever measures are put in place and whatever organisations are working in that area.  We need to support education programmes and we need to change our attitude.  It is not good enough that people do not drink and drive because they are afraid of being caught.  We should be afraid that we could injure ourselves or an innocent pedestrian or driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcohol consumption is set to increase in the next couple of years because of the current and projected economic growth.  Young people are earning a great deal of money in good jobs and are socialising and spending money on alcohol. That should not stop.  If people work hard during the week they have a right to spend their money on social activities which involve alcohol. <Col N="324" /> However, we must ensure that if alcohol is part of our social activity, we have a responsible attitude to it.</P>
    <P>More young people will also start to drink beer as it is less price sensitive than any other alcoholic beverage.  By the time people reach 18 years of age, they will be drinking more regularly.  They will start to drive and will think there is nothing wrong with their judgment.  I heard this many times when I argued with people late in the evening who intended to drive home.  They believed they were better and more careful drivers after a few drinks.  People must understand they are not better drivers when they have drink taken and that they are dangerous to themselves and others.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to longer opening hours.  While I do not have a view on it, longer opening hours will lead to an increase in the availability of alcohol and the opportunity for people to abuse it and, therefore, drive home. There have been 118 days in 1998 and 129 road traffic fatalities.  Peoples' views and attitudes must change.  Drink driving and the abuse of alcohol must be stopped and we need to enforce drink driving laws impartially nationwide.  Recently, various licensing laws were enforced unequally in different parts of the country and people felt that was inequitable.  If there is to be a stringent enforcement of law it must be done on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>The source of the problem must be examined. We need to try to stop people drinking at a younger age and drink driving laws must be enforced impartially nationwide.  Consideration must be given to subsidising transport, particularly in rural areas, so that there are other ways for people to get home at the end of an evening. That is a key issue because people want to go to a pub, enjoy a few drinks and get home safely. One way to reduce accidents is to make sure people in rural areas have the means to get home, whether it is through improved taxi or hackney services or otherwise.  This needs to be examined and action taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are posed with the problem of how to deal with the ill-effects of alcohol abuse.  Our predecessors for thousands of years have dealt with this because alcohol on its own has good effects.  It has definite medicinal effects taken in moderation and medical textbooks have pointed out the efficacy of moderate intakes of alcohol.  The Minister alluded to the fact that a moderate intake of alcohol reduces the risk of cardiac attacks.  The wine drinking countries of continental Europe have less problems with cardiac arrest than the more northern beer drinking countries.  Of course, the downside is that they are authorities on cirrhosis of the liver.  Wine based drinks have a bad effect on the liver and doctors wishing to specialise in liver disease should move to the continent while those specialising in cardiac diseases should go to north America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> Alcohol has a long history.  St. Paul wrote in a letter to a friend complaining of stomach problems, &ldquo;I beseech thee to take a little wine for thy stomach.&rdquo; Alcohol is lauded in Irish history and one of the most seminal books written on it dealt with the taxation of alcohol and the problems the Governments of the day in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had trying to get to grips with gathering revenue from the sale of alcohol. Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna in his poem &ldquo;An Bonnán Buí&rdquo; wrote &ldquo;Is cáin easpa bidh ach diabhal dí a fhág mé sínte ar chúl mo chinn&rdquo;.  One can imagine what the previous evening was like for him.</P>
    <P>However, the damage the abuse of alcohol does and how it wrecks families is a more serious subject.  One problem we face in Ireland is that everyone is aware of the damage it has done and we have come to accept it.  The attitude is that a person takes a few drinks or is a hard drinker but he is then absolved, thereby, contributing to the problem.  A huge education programme on the damage alcohol can do is needed without condemning ordinary drinkers or trying to close down public houses.  If one tries to close them down, one must remember the public house is the only neutral ground where people can meet friends, etc., and have a civilised discussion over a few drinks.  We could be in danger if we go too hard of throwing the baby out with the bath water.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes hard on the younger generation but there is a sea change in their attitude to drink driving.  It is unusual to find young people drinking and driving when they are out, especially in Dublin.  It is not just the fact that they are afraid of being caught.  They are beginning to realise it is anti-social behaviour to get behind the wheel of a car following a large intake alcohol and become a danger to friends and foe alike. However, politicians and Ministers must deal with financial facts which colour their thinking. The economics of alcohol are staggering.  Tens of thousands of people are employed in the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcohol and Exchequer income is £550 million annually.  We will have to approach the financial, social and medical problems associated with alcohol in a balanced manner.  We cannot condone the abuse of alcohol nor can we spoil the enjoyment of the majority of the people or put the finances of the nation at risk.</P>
    <P>Other contributions focused on young people as if only they abused alcohol.  My age group has a higher consistent intake of alcohol.  Young people tend to drink at weekends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address Senators on this important issue <Col N="326" /> this evening and, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, I thank Senators for their forthcoming contributions.</P>
      <P>The need for this debate is obvious.  It has arisen as a result of concerns being expressed by a number of elected representatives, community groups and individuals in regard to the possible effects on health of the erection of mobile phone towers, MMDS masts and other communications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to ensure that the underlying health and safety issues relating to these technologies are debated and that the genuine concerns being felt in the community are expressed openly and responded to meaningfully by the authorities involved.  To this end, the Minister recently co-hosted a conference in Dublin Castle on the health aspects of mobile telecommunications technology in the community.  The conference represented a joint effort by my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I assure Senators that the three Departments and the Government as a whole are aware of the very real concerns being expressed by people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's opening address to the conference, she made it clear that the Government is open to further suggestions in regard to any action which may need to be taken, the manner in which it should move forward on the issues outlined and the objectives which may need to be set out.</P>
      <P>Senators will also be aware of recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise where detailed submissions were received from all interest groups, including a wide range of community interests, on the issue.  All interested Departments, including my own, participated fully in these sessions.  The committee will be reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the matter in the short term.  I understand that it will be including in its report recommendations on how the Government should deal with the issue. I want to assure the House that the Government will take very careful note of the committee's recommendations in this area.</P>
      <P>In my address to the House this evening, I want to highlight the background to the current debate as well as the major issues of concern.  The growth of the mobile telecommunications sector in Ireland is directly related to the liberalisation of the sector across the EU as a whole.  In Ireland, Eircell commenced its analogue service in 1985 and began the provision of GSM services in 1993. The process of issuing a licence to a second mobile operator was begun in 1995 in the light of a decision by the EU Commission that the provisions of the Treaty required the liberalisation of the markets for mobile telephony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the transposition into Irish law of EU Directive 96/2 as SI 123 provided for licensing of a second operator in Ireland.  The directive provides that the number of licences for mobile services can only be limited by the availability <Col N="327" /> of radio frequency spectrum.  Today, the radio frequency spectrum set aside for mobile telephony in Ireland can accommodate at least one, and possibly two, additional operators in addition to Eircell and Esat Digifone.</P>
    <P>At the end of March, the Eircell analogue service has 189,000 customers and its GSM service had 231,000 customers.  Esat Digifone launched its GSM service in March 1997 and now has 113,000 subscribers.  This gives a total for the Irish market of 533,000 subscribers which represents just under 15 per cent of the total population.  The leading market in the EU in terms of overall subscriber numbers is Italy with a total of more than 12 million subscribers or 21 per cent of the population. The leading EU market in terms of penetration is Finland with a penetration of more than 40 per cent.  Other penetration figures include Sweden at 37 per cent while the UK is at the same level as Ireland.  The total number of subscribers in the EU currently stands at approximately 53 million people.</P>
    <P>Much attention has focused on the planning issues related to mast construction and operation. I must emphasise that responsibility for planning matters lies with local authorities, with An Bord Pleanála on appeal and, at the policy level, with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>At the time of the commencement of the roll-out of their network for the provision of digital GSM services, Eircell enjoyed an exemption from a requirement to obtain planning permission for the erection of new masts for a period of six months from May to November 1994.  My information is that approximately 200 Eircell sites have been erected on foot of this exemption.</P>
    <P>The erection of a telecommunications mast is considered to be development within the meaning of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and therefore, requires planning permission unless specifically exempted under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997.  The decision to grant or not grant planning permission in any particular case is a matter for the planning authority and, in the event of a appeal, An Bord Pleanála. The Department of the Environment and Local Government issued guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures in 1996 following a public consultation process.  The guidelines are intended to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and support structures.</P>
    <P>The visual impact of masts is acknowledged in the guidelines as being among the more important of the considerations that a planning authority will have to take into account in deciding on a planning application.  The guidelines point to the need to have due regard to sensitive landscape and sites.  In order to reduce the number of masts, the guidelines advocate the sharing <Col N="328" /> of masts.  Planning authorities need to be satisfied that applicants for planning permission have explored this possibility.  In order to support the policy of mast sharing, the provisions on exempted development were clarified.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997, amend the existing exempted development regulations by including two new classes of exempted development &mdash; the attachment to an existing radio mast of antennae for mobile telephony and the replacement of an existing mast.  These provisions are confined to operators licensed under Section 111 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and are subject to a number of important restrictions on size, number and type of antennae.</P>
    <P>The licences granted to both Eircell and Esat Digifone are very similar in content and set out specific conditions relating to the development of the operator's network.  They also provide that the licensee must ensure a minimum level of coverage.</P>
    <P>The issue of the health effects of communications masts has already been the subject of much research internationally.  A 1996 review which was carried out by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection, who are advisers to the World Health Organisation on these matters, concluded that there is no substantive evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to levels of non-ionising radiation at levels at or below those set in the 1988 guidelines issued by the International Radiation Protection Association.  Compliance with the IRPA guidelines is a condition attached to all telecommunications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Further research in the area has been proposed recently in a report commissioned by the European Commission.  The Department of Public Enterprise will be monitoring developments to ensure that the most up to date standards are applied to emissions in this country.</P>
    <P>The licences issued to Esat and Eircell also include a range of provisions specifying technical and safety standards to be observed in the provision of their service.  These licence provisions conform with the best international practice. Specifically, the licensee is obliged to take all reasonable measures in relation to the provision of the service to ensure the safety of its employees, its customers and the public, and to ensure that non-ionising radiation emissions from the network are within the limits specified by the guidelines published by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána operates a telecommunications network for the purpose of its own internal communications that comprises some 700 masts located at Garda stations around the country.</P>
    <P>In the second half of 1996, Esat Digifone identified the strategic value of using the network for siting some of its own telecommunications antennae.  At the time Digifone was trying to <Col N="329" /> complete the roll out of its network to the extent required by its licence obligations.  The Esat Digifone/Garda deal was eventually signed in April 1997 covering a total of 459 sites of which about 200 will be covered by the planning exemption brought into effect in early 1997.  The remainder will require planning permission.</P>
    <P>I want to turn briefly to two issues which have been the cause of particular debate and comment. In relation to the monitoring of emissions from masts there has been some concern expressed at the absence of a comprehensive system for emissions monitoring.  The legal position is that a provision relating to emission levels is contained in the licences issued to mobile phone companies and MMDS operators.  In the future I understand that such a provision will be included in all licences for communication services which make use of radio frequency spectrum.  These provisions are based on the most up to date international standards and can be adjusted over time if that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for telecommunications licences lies with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation appointed under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.  The director is an independent body and carries out a range of important functions in relation to the regulation of the communications sector.  I note from the director's recent appearance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise that she is aware of the concerns felt by many in relation to this issue and has taken the first steps in putting such a system in place.  The director has recently published details on the monitoring system to be employed together with the results of an initial study.</P>
    <P>The smooth operation of the planning process necessitates that the operators take a more proactive role in disseminating information in relation to proposed developments for the benefit both of planners and local communities.  This principle should, in my view, also apply in the case of developments which are exempt from the legal requirements for planning permission.</P>
    <P>A number of issues may need to be looked at in terms of the relationship between the communications companies and the local communities, such as the provision of clear and timely information to local communities by communications companies, the ensuring of adequate consultation at a local level and the implementation by operators of arrangements in relation to monitoring of emissions.  The Government will be keeping a very close eye on these developments.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank Senators for their attention. It is intended that their views will feed into the Government's consideration of the issue.  I can assure Senators that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, intends to address their concerns with Government in the light of the report which both Houses will soon receive from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is always a pleasure to have him in the House and I hope the debate will be as civilised as I heard him tell his civil servants Seanad debates usually are.  I hope it will, at least, throw some light on what has become an increasingly heated subject in recent times; I have a suspicion that I may find myself in a minority position on this issue.</P>
      <P>This issue calls, most of all, for information and for hard factual analysis.  It is clear that there is a great deal of concern, some of it expressed emotionally, throughout the country.  I live in an area which probably has more masts per square foot than any other part of the country so I cannot be accused of saying &ldquo;not in my back yard.&rdquo; I will share whatever dangers may or may not come from masts.</P>
      <P>It is important to place this debate in context. We have lived through a revolution in telephonic methodology and there is no going back.  Mobile phones are one of the main methods of communication in the modern world.  We all remember with a degree of amusement how, when programme managers first made their appearance in Leinster House, one of their distinguishing characteristics was the mobile phone.  Stories were told of programme managers phoning each other from different ends of the restaurant so that they would be seen to have mobile phones.</P>
      <P>In a few years we have moved to a position where there are 500,000 mobile phones in use. People find them extremely useful in looking after teenagers going out at night and for keeping in touch.  They have almost become an indispensable tool.  Thankfully it is still possible to tell somebody with whom one does not want a conversation that the line is breaking down or that the reception in the area is bad.  They have become an integral part of everyday life in a way that none of us could have foreseen a couple of years ago.  Before long there will be more mobile than fixed line phone users.</P>
      <P>The fact that mobile phones are a worldwide phenomenon should, in some ways, provide reassurance that what is happening here is not unique.  We have a chance to learn from the experience of other countries and to measure our best practice against what is expected elsewhere. Worldwide there are approximately 250 GSM network operators in 109 countries, most of which are using technology to a common standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the better results of the arrival of mobile phones was the introduction of competition. All of us have benefited from the fact that Telecom Éireann, hitherto a protected monopoly, has been obliged to face the reality of competition. It did not do so with much good grace. Those of us who dealt with Telecom Éireann in the past over excessive charges, etc., often came up against a great deal of arrogance.  We knew people had been overcharged but it was very difficult to get Telecom to admit it.  Telecom has moved into the real world, partly because of competition, and the consumer in terms of prices and <Col N="331" /> better service has been the main beneficiary.  We are probably lucky that we introduced competition in mobile phone services comparatively late &mdash; we were the second last EU country to licence a second mobile operator.</P>
    <P>When the independent licence was given to Esat there were strict conditions attached to it.  It is important to emphasise that one of the conditions imposed by the State on the independent operator was to put in place a nationwide network within a very short space of time.  Sufficient masts had to be in place to provide a service for the vast majority of the population within a very tight timetable.  The State fined Esat £1 million for not having enough masts in place to meet the first phase covered by the licence.  As the Minister pointed out in his interesting speech, Esat did not have the very questionable exemption from planning permission which Telecom had for a six month period and during which many installations were erected which might not have passed strict planning criteria.  Esat had to go through the planning process and every application went through the full rigours of that process, taking years in some cases.</P>
    <P>Esat has also been faulted for using existing structures.  However, this was in line with the guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government which advised planners to force mobile operators to use existing structures in order to prevent proliferation of new, stand alone masts.  Esat and Telecom Éireann have been using existing structures as a first choice option.  This has meant using ESB, RTÉ, Garda, health board and local radio masts with new masts accounting for only 30 per cent of the total.  There is no going back from this position.</P>
    <P>The debate is concerned with the issue of whether these masts pose a danger to health or safety.  This is the only concern of Members: we will not question the extent of the revolution which is taking place.  At the heart of the controversy is a genuine fear among many sensible people that there is a health hazard.  Nobody seems clear as to what the hazard is.  All sorts of experts feed the fears and sometimes provide information that is, perhaps, accurate.  Some people question the credentials of some experts. However, I know nothing of their credentials as I do not know the experts or anything about them.  I accept they are speaking from a position of good faith.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for anybody in this controversy. I have great regard for Esat.  Many of its founding members were former students of mine and I have watched their progress with much pride as they built the company into a world leader in its field.  It is one of the finest companies to emerge over the past 30 years.  It has introduced competition to the market and has shown that a young Irish company can compete with world leaders with great success.  The people in Esat are committed to the country; it is an Irish rather than a <Col N="332" /> multinational company and the people running it live here and must be responsible for the consequences of what is done on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The issue of fears is a scientific question which can either be resolved or not.  The fears are either justified or unjustified.  We are not talking about something which modern scientific evidence does not allow us resolve.  Masts are either dangerous or not &mdash; it is this simple.  I listened carefully to the submissions last week to the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.  Like the Minister, I await the findings of the committee.  I was surprised by some of the things said, especially some of the point scoring, something I do not intend speaking about in this debate which is concerned with health and safety.  The most constructive contribution was that of Esat which offered everybody a means of resolving the problem.  The onus should be on the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to put in place independent procedures for the independent monitoring of emissions from equipment used in radio based technologies, including mobile phones.  The only way the public can have confidence that this monitoring is being carried out impartially is if it is done on a completely independent basis.  The person in a position to do this is the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  She is in a position to regulate the industry and I would be astonished if assessment of health consequences were not an integral part of her function.  By statute, by the nature of her job and indeed by her personality she is independent and in a position to provide independent monitoring in which the public can have confidence.</P>
    <P>This begs a question which Senator Gallagher posed on the way into the House, namely, whether people any longer believe anybody in an official position on such matters.  In the past official bodies have given assurances that certain things were safe when they were unsafe.  Nonetheless, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is in a position to do what I have suggested. She has a position of total impartiality and the capacity to appoint people who will be internationally accepted.  Then, at least, the debate can begin from a detached viewpoint, with concrete information at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The State must become more involved.  It is not good enough for it to allow independent operators and Telecom into the field, derive revenue from it and at the same time almost stand back from it.  The State has an obligation to provide accreditation to experts, whose bona fides will be accepted, who can be sent out on the basis of necessity to the various areas where there are controversies.  This will not be the hiring of experts by one side or the other, but the State saying that it regards these people, irrespective of whether they come from Ireland or elsewhere, as being impartial.  That will take away the present issue, the point raised by Mr. Maloney last week when he spoke of a cottage industry growing up around advisers who are available for a fee.  I do not know if that is true, but if the State became <Col N="333" /> involved and stated it verified the credentials of this adviser, then at least doubts about the bona fides of the advisers would be removed.</P>
    <P>I also believe that both the State and the companies need to become more actively involved in deciding on the health issue, and the Minister made reference to this.  After all, it is the State which licenses radio-based technology.  The State needs to let the public know that it is doing so in the belief that it is not harmful or injurious.  When issuing a licence, the State must be sure that what it is doing is not harmful or injurious.  Likewise, the companies involved, whose bottom line is profit, must also take pains to assure the public that what they are doing is not in some way going to be injurious to the health of people involved.</P>
    <P>This debate will be useful if we can get from the Minister, and the report of the committee, agreement on independent assessment of what is at stake.  None of us in this House is an expert. None of us has the training or the background. We are all aware of the fears, but none of us is in an independent position.  What we need is independent assessment at the highest level.  People may not believe it, but at least it will be available. As far as is possible, it will be objective and scientific. Let us go ahead on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity for Statements in the House.  I have asked for this for some time.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House also.  He will be helpful, as is always the case.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that Minister O'Rourke afforded an opportunity to those who were concerned about the future of Digifone masts to raise their concerns at a conference.  I was also pleased about the meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport last week, which was called for by its Chairman, Deputy Doherty, and about all the expertise which attended it. That was useful and informative.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that we will not turn back the clock, but I disagree that the only issue is the health aspect of mobile telephones. That is not the matter in which I am interested.  I am not qualified in that regard and many people who are making comments about the health risk are also not qualified to do so.  My colleague, Senator Farrell, said to me when we met at Montrose that if there was any danger from radiation, etc., from mobile telephones, there would be nobody alive in Stillorgan.  He was right and I must accept that.  Therefore, I will not focus on the health aspect of it because I do not have the expertise or the knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Manning.  The matter was badly handled from the start.  When Esat Digifone tendered for the licence, it had the best tender on paper, which did not include the use of telephone masts at Garda barracks.  It was only after Esat Digifone was granted the licence that it started to negotiate for that.  While I am not going to go back for political advantage, I have reservations like everybody else.  Senator Manning's <Col N="334" /> party colleague, the then Minister and his colleague, went to much expense holding up the importance of sticking to the planning laws in County Clare when they stopped the development in the Burren which cost millions of pounds. Thereafter, we were to have strict planning regulations to which local authorities, State bodies and everybody would have to comply and that was accepted nationally without too much controversy.</P>
    <P>I, as a long time member of a local authority, oppose totally the waiving of planning laws for any reason.  I and all of my colleagues must comply with the planning laws.  If somebody wants to build a small extension or a bathroom to their house, he or she must go to an architect, submit a planning application and conform to the letter of the law.  For instance, the materials used, even to the extent of the colour of the roof tiles, must be correct.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is unacceptable to see a company which can be exempt from planning regulations. We can pad it as much as we like.  Not only is the company exempt from the planning regulations, but it affects the security of Garda barracks.  Most of the masts at Garda barracks are in the yard, garden or confines of the barracks.  If one stops to think for a minute, it involves a security concern.</P>
    <P>The average person believes it is wrong to exempt from planning laws whichever company was granted the licence in the first instance.  Subsequently, for a reason nobody knows, the Government and the then Minister allowed that advantage to a company which had been successful already.  Why?  There are all kinds of allegations that big money changed hands.  I do not know, but that innuendo remains unanswered.  I listened carefully to the answer: that it would avoid covering the countryside with more masts. That would have been perfectly acceptable if it had been stated clearly when tenders were invited that it could happen, but that was not the case. The process must be seen to be fair and balanced because the public are pressed to comply with planning, waste, sewerage and environmental regulations.  We live in an age when it must be seen to be done by the book.  That is a major objection.</P>
    <P>Esat Digifone stated in a letter to me that under S.I. No. 78 of 1997, it may change any existing telecommunications structure so long as it does not exceed the existing height and does not more than double the base width of the existing mast, and that this development in effect constitutes a mast upgrade or refurbishment.</P>
    <P>Those are fine eloquent words.  Whoever negotiated that is not as generous to Mr. John Bloggs who lives on the side of the mountain when he wants a bathroom extension.  Those are extravagant words and that is extravagant legislation. The Minister, for whatever reason, decided not only to exempt the company from planning permission but to allow it to double the size of the base.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> I come from a county where there is a real problem.  I had a deputation with the Minister for Justice, who recognised that we had a problem. Esat Digifone plan to put an aerial or aerials behind a Garda barracks in Castlefin on a mast which, before they began to extend it, was within ten feet of the back door of a private house and close to many houses and a school.  Over 300 people, including the parents of children at the school, attended a meeting in Castlefin but their genuine concerns have not been addressed.  The Minister recognises this is a serious problem and that there are no grounds for allowing Esat Digifone to double the size of the base of the mast, which is located close to local residents.  This has been and will remain a major issue in Castlefin and in a number of other locations in Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Minister said our comments would be taken into account when a new monitoring system was put in place.  Nobody objected to the mast originally because Castlefin is two miles from the Border and the Garda Síochána needed the best security and modern telecommunications systems.  I am in favour of developing the best technology for the Garda.  I met the chief executive of British Telecom in the House last week and he told me he is planning to apply for a third licence in conjunction with the ESB.  We all welcome competition, particularly if it results in a cheaper service.</P>
    <P>I am a mobile telephone user so I do not sound sincere when I complain about telephone masts. I will not take this issue to court as some people did and had to pay the costs when they lost.  I contacted my local authority, Donegal County Council, about the Esat Digifone mast at Castlefin Garda station.  In its reply it stated:</P>
    <P>I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 16th ult.  regarding above and wish to advise that the measurements of the existing mast have been taken by the Council and any new developments will be looked at in the light of these measurements.</P>
    <P>Donegal County Council is on the ball.  Planning exemptions for telephone mast extensions will not be granted without a Government direction. I want a level playing pitch for everyone, whether it is a person building a bathroom to the side of his cottage at the top of Glenties or Esat Digifone.</P>
    <P>I expect the support of the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure we get fair play.  We cannot turn the clock back, but it is obvious that an injustice was done because those who applied for the licence in the first place were not told they could use the masts already erected on Garda barrack sites.  However, that is water under the bridge.  Esat Digifone has infringed on the people's rights and that must be rectified even if it means erecting a new mast.  Esat Digifone did this to save money, but the school and private property must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I appreciate the opportunity to express my views on this serious matter.  We are not experts on the health hazards of such masts.  I am concerned about the planning aspects and I want to ensure that everyone has a level playing pitch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have the opportunity to debate this issue.  Senator Costello, Senator O'Meara and I tabled a motion last October on this issue and we were promised a debate during the last session.  I am glad we are having it so early in this session.</P>
      <P>It will be difficult to find a solution which will keep everyone happy.  People want access to the most up to date technology and communications in every part of the country but they also want to be reassured, to the extent of seeking absolute indemnity, that nothing will go wrong.  I do not know if that circle can be squared but we have an obligation to ensure that the best possible communications technology is available to people in every part of the country, regardless of their location, while also giving them every possible assurance.</P>
      <P>In the review of the planning laws which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is undertaking, I seek a repeal of the exemptions for any type of development, including the exemptions allowed in this regard.  I appreciate the reasons why they might have seemed a good idea at the time, particularly when one considers the pressure to deliver services and allow new companies to operate in this area. However, experience has shown that the people are resistant to the effects of such exemptions.  I agree with Senator McGowan that the planning exemptions should be removed.</P>
      <P>We, as a country or in co-operation with other members of the European Union, must obtain an independent assessment of the health effects of microwave transmitters which are being erected on these masts throughout the country.  That is what our motion, which has been on the Order Paper since last October, seeks to do.  I realise it may not be possible for us as an individual state to commission wideranging research.  However, given that the European Commission is looking at this issue, it should be possible to co-operate with the other 14 member states of the European Union to commission independent research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to win in such a situation.  I remember being asked two years ago by a local community to assist in making representations to the council because it alleged that one company had infringed the planning laws by putting up an unauthorised structure for mobile telephone transmissions.  When the council took action to ensure the law was complied with, I suffered a backlash from the owner of the land who was annoyed that he would not get rent from the particular company for the use of his property.  We must do the best job we can in these circumstances. Impossible as it might seem, we must try to ensure that technology is available to everyone <Col N="337" /> while at the same time assuring them about the health risks.</P>
    <P>I compliment the joint committee on its work and I look forward to its report.  I was impressed with presentation given by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to the committee last week.  She pointed out the benefits of the massive increase in the use of radio for individual, industrial and commercial purposes in recent years. She enumerated those to include television, radio, cell phones, mobile cellular phones, cordless phones, radio navigation systems and equipment used in industry, medicine and commerce. Those of us who have been involved in upgrading emergency communication systems for the emergency service know how important that job is.  I agree with many of Senator Manning's comments on how the office the Director of Telecommunications Regulation can be developed in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was impressed with the submissions made by community groups to the committee last week.  I can be objective on this because while there are concerns being expressed by communities in my constituency, none of the groups who made the presentation last week was from my constituency. It was obvious they had made a great effort, without the funding available to the major companies, to research and present their case.  People may quibble with their evidence but they are equally entitled to quibble with the evidence presented by the companies which have major resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I am not qualified to judge Professor Walsh of UCG, Professor Adey, Dr. Cherry, Dr. Stather, Dr. Goldsmith or anyone else mentioned in the submissions last week, but I accept they are all trying to approach this from an objective and a scientific point of view.  We must find some way of ensuring this is assessed in an objective fashion and that the results of the assessment are put before the public when proposals are made at local level for developments in this area.  Sufficient questions have been raised about the International Committee on Non Ionising Radiological Protection in the evidence we have heard to date to require the Government, individually or in co-operation with other EU member states, to seek an independent evaluation of the health evidence on this.</P>
    <P>I accept that a committee has been set up in co-operation with the World Health Organisation and in association with the United Nations but, as I said to Senator Manning before the debate started, just because it is an international body of standing does not mean people will accept its results.  The more official a body is these days, the less people will accept its findings.  Also there is no such thing as genuine independence, everyone comes at an issue from some angle, but the public would be reassured if the Government took the step of commissioning independent research.  I look forward to the Government, having listened to this debate and having received the report of <Col N="338" /> the joint committee, taking that step as people will be reassured by it.</P>
    <P>There was a point made in the submission by the group from Carrick-on-Shannon with which I agree, a reference to a statement by Dr. Goldsmith of the Ben Gurion University in Israel that an assumption of innocence in respect of mobile phones and other types of radiation transmission is no longer tenable.  That is the basis from which we must start.  We have to prove that it is safe within standards which are being met.</P>
    <P>The group from Donegal questioned the bona fides of Dr. Repacholi, whom I heard making an address to the Government conference in Dublin Castle some weeks ago.  I cannot adjudicate whether his standing is adequate to come down on one side of this argument.  This is something which could be answered by independent evaluation because, no more than I can challenge Professor Walsh or Dr. Repacholi, I cannot challenge any of the experts mentioned by the community groups last week.  We must have the middle way of doing this and there is a duty on the Government to ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>Standards have to be set and we have to make sure they are met.  There is enough evidence to refuse to take the ICNIRP at face value.  It is significant that the Swiss authorities have not accepted the ICNIRP regulations and recommended standards on the short wave transmitter which is being shut down there.  If they have queries about the group, we are entitled to have queries as well.  The independent health review could set standards which are more acceptable to the public.  I agree the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is the most appropriate office to ensure standards are met.  I was heartened to see the director outline to the committee last week the action which has already been taken in respect of how the process should be completely quickly and the results put into the public domain as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister and the Government a motion which was passed by Youghal UDC in County Cork which was sent to my local authority, Offaly County Council.  It passed the same motion last week to the effect that it called on the Government to put in place a system of regular nationwide monitoring of microwave emissions from all sources of non-ionising radiation with the results available to the public.  That would tie in with what I said earlier about independent assessment and the director ensuring the standards were complied with.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made about planning issues in the Minister's speech.  In County Offaly the first local communities learn about proposals to erect masts in their areas are planning notices in the papers and the required planning notices appearing on the boundaries of the properties for which the application is being made.  Esat and Eircell could do much more to reassure the public, to communicate with them, to inform them of their plans and listen to their concerns before any planning application is made.  The Minister has <Col N="339" /> mentioned that a number of issues need to be examined in terms of the relationship between communications companies and the local communities. I endorse that sentiment.  We have invited both companies to come and address the county council at its next meeting but that will not be enough.  They must get out and talk to the people who will have these facilities in their areas.</P>
    <P>The issues mentioned by the Minister included the provision of clear and timely information to local communities by these companies.  I could not agree more.  Secondly, adequate consultation at local level should be ensured.  That is not happening. People are depending on their ability to object once a proposal has been made.  If communication and consultation took place prior to the application being made, in some instances the community would accept the need for the mast and the safeguards promised.  The companies may decide to go elsewhere in some cases, saving everybody concerned a great deal of trouble.  If the exemptions on planning in this area were removed in this area the public would be further reassured.  The Minster mentioned arrangements on the monitoring of emissions.  The role of the Director of Telecommunication Regulation can be expanded in that area.</P>
    <P>This matter will not be concluded with this debate.  I thank the Minister for listening and reiterate the two main points of my argument &mdash; the exemption on planning should be removed in all cases and an independent health study, commissioned either by the Government or in co-operation other European governments, should be undertaken as quickly as possible and the results put before the public.  That would provide a standard which could be stood over in public debate and which would benefit both the existing companies which are providing necessary mobile telephone services and the proposed third operator.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State although I am slightly disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, could not attend.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue for many communities, particularly in rural areas.  We, as public representatives, are sent to the Oireachtas to represent the opinions of people in our constituencies and to produce good legislation for their benefit.  The telephone masts issue has arisen hard on the heels of the MMDS problem which has caused controversy in recent years. Many communities in Donegal are affected by mobile telephone masts.  Senator McGowan referred to Castlefin.  Two other communities succeeded, through consensus and discussion, in preventing Esat Digifone from erecting antennae on masts which it proposed to erect in Dore in Gweedore and in Derryreel outside Falcarragh. The way forward is through discussion, consultation and agreement.</P>

      <Col N="340" /> The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, inherited this problem.  I compliment her on what she has achieved on this issue during her short time in office.  She has taken a number of steps to try to resolve the problem and reassure the public.  In June 1997 the Director of Telecommunications Regulation was appointed and in March 1998 a conference on telephone masts was held in Dublin Castle, which I attended.  In recent weeks, two meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport debated the issue and I take some of the credit for that.  I proposed to the Minister and to the chairman of the committee that, since the people who opposed the erection of telephone masts had insinuated that the experts at the conference favoured only one side of the argument, there should be an opportunity for both sides to give their views and to question each other on those views.</P>
    <P>I learned a great deal from the conference in Dublin Castle.  Initially it dealt with the effect of emissions from mobile telephones.  Many of the people who attended that part of the conference left it with the impression that the conference was of no value to communities which were objecting to the masts.  Later in the evening Mr. John McAuley, who works with Compliance Engineering Ireland in Ashbourne dealt comprehensively with the effect of emissions from masts.  I was encouraged by his comments.  He said that while he was happy that emissions from mobile telephone masts were well below the standards accepted by the World Health Organisation, he was not able to say whether the standards accepted by that organisation were safe.</P>
    <P>With the exception of one, all the speakers at the conference, in the hour long summary and question and answer session at the end of the day, said the masts posed no real health hazard. However, they did agree there were other hazards such as stress and so forth caused by having such masts located in built up areas.  All agreed there should be consultation and that, if possible, masts should not be located in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport gave everybody an opportunity to put their case.  During the first meeting Dr. Tom McManus, who appears to be well informed about this issue and who has enlightened me a great deal throughout the debate on it, said he believed there should be consensus and agreement on the location of masts.  The Minister intends to introduce legislation on this issue in the autumn.  I hope these views will be taken into consideration and that there will not be the same situation as occurred following the allocation of MMDS franchises when the views of certain communities were disregarded.</P>
    <P>At last week's meeting of the joint committee the expert who has been advising the community groups appeared to water down his opposition which had been based solely on health considerations. He has introduced other considerations such as devaluation of homes and the destruction <Col N="341" /> of visual amenities.  The only expert he quoted was at the Dublin Castle conference who opposed the masts for health reasons.  In my view, the rest of the speakers at the conference were much more impressive than that speaker.</P>
    <P>The other important development was the appointment of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  The responsibility for ensuring the compliance of Esat Digifone and Eircell with the conditions of their licences and particular conditions in relation to non-ionising radiation emissions from their networks lies with the director. The office commenced in June 1997 with responsibility for licensing the use of radio frequencies for radio, telephony and broadcasting.</P>
    <P>A standard provision is that all users of radio frequencies ensure that emissions are below limits specified by guidelines published by the IRPA in association with the World Health Organisation. The director has stated that she is undertaking comprehensive audits to ensure that Telecom Éireann, RTÉ, Eircell, Esat Digifone and the MMDS operators are below these accepted standards. Unfortunately, those who oppose the masts state that Forbairt, which is independent of the State, is not independent.  The results of the audits carried out to date show that the telephone masts in Phibsboro and Dunshaughlin, the television mast at Three Rock and the MMDS mast in Naul are all below the accepted international standards.</P>
    <P>Signals from telephone masts are becoming weaker as the years go by but the public only sees a proliferation of telecommunications masts throughout the country.  Esat Digifone and Eircell have been weak in their public relations, in reassuring the public and discussing with it where masts should be located and in seeking agreement before the masts are installed.</P>
    <P>Planning is another issue which has arisen during this debate.  The erection of a mast, as a development, requires planning permission. However, the problem to date has arisen in respect of the co-location of existing masts.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government issued guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures in 1996.  These highlighted the need to have due regard to sensitive landscapes and sites.  To reduce the number of masts, the guidelines advocated the co-sharing of masts.  Local authority regulations in 1997 amended the existing exempted development regulations by including, as exempted developments, the attachment to an existing radial mast of antennae for mobile phones and the replacement of existing masts. These are the two issues of concern to the public.</P>
    <P>The guidelines set out a hierarchy of suitable locations for telecommunication transmitters and state that only as a last resort, and if alternatives are either unavailable or unsuitable, should free standing masts be located in residential areas or close to schools.  Lax planning legislation has allowed masts to be erected on stations without <Col N="342" /> planning permission.  This does little to assuage public concern.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.  My greatest difficulty with the erection of antennae on existing Garda masts is that no consultation took place between Esat Digifone or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and local communities to provide information or reassurances in this regard.  I am aware of the benefits to the State in this area.  As Mr. Maloney, the chief executive of Esat, stated in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in January:</P>
    <P>If Esat Digifone wasn't here, the Commissioner would have to pay for the new masts through public funds.  So it is saving the State and the taxpayer.  It's also good from an environmental point of view, as it results in only one mast instead of two.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to state:</P>
    <P>For the Garda, the main attraction of the deal is seen as technological rather than financial. Under the agreement, the new masts will become the property of the State after they are erected.  As part of a new £75 million communications network, they will enable the Garda to have access to secure, digital transmissions technology.  So far, gardaí have used analog facilities, which are susceptible to interception.</P>
    <P>It is further stated that &ldquo;Esat will have to pay a lease for the use of the new radio masts.  Payments are estimated to be worth up to £3 million a year to the Garda.&rdquo; This problem has led to dissatisfaction among community groups who believe there was an element of cloak and dagger involved because little information was made available.  Personally, I have no difficulty with it but I am disappointed by the lack of communication and discussion involved.</P>
    <P>I spoke to representatives of Esat today who informed me that they are obliged to fulfil the contracts they have signed.  The State and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should permit some relaxation of the rules if Esat is prepared not to erect antennae on certain Garda masts because of local opposition.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an item which is not on the agenda &mdash; it might be taken into account for future reference because it relates to the new director of regulation &mdash; namely, the future of digital television.  The joint committee discussed this matter on two occasions and a draft report has been prepared for the director which seems to indicate that digital cable or digital MMDS might be recommended instead of digital terrestrial television.  As already stated, this problem originally arose because of opposition to MMDS television.  Regardless of the fact that the cost may be higher, I hope the digital terrestrial system will be put in place when a decision is made on digital system because it will fulfil the needs of rural communities and avoid the problems that <Col N="343" /> arose in recent years in respect of MMDS television and telecommunications masts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Members' comments on this controversial subject because many people are concerned about it.  I bought a mobile telephone when they came on the market and I have access to GSM at present.  Therefore, I cannot speak against the great service provided.  I welcomed the introduction of a second operator because, in light of competition in this area and with the prospect of further competition in respect of land lines, the cost of telephone calls has been reduced.</P>
      <P>Mobile phones have proven to be very useful, particularly from the point of view of business. The dangers involved have been overplayed. Eight or nine years ago I tabled a motion at a meeting of the North-Western Health Board.  The World Health Organisation, which had carried out a number of surveys, provided written assurances that there was no danger from telephone masts.</P>
      <P>I have no axe to grind in respect of this matter. Esat chose to use masts at Garda barracks and elsewhere because many objectors stated that a forest of masts would spring up throughout the country and asked why existing masts could not be used.  For that reason, Esat became involved in trying to do business with the owners of existing masts to stop the proliferation of such masts. At a meeting of my local council, I stated that it was a pity the Government did not establish a body to erect masts to be leased out to interested parties.  The rash of complaints about masts was not received until competition was introduced.  If there was no competition, the cost of telephone calls would be more expensive.</P>
      <P>Mobile phones are very popular throughout Europe.  At Christmas, I went on holiday to northern Italy and I was contacted on my mobile phone by a man from County Leitrim.  I could not believe it.  These phones are valuable because people travelling abroad can be contacted directly and there is no need to use international telephone codes, etc.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities recently commented that because of the number of car drivers who use mobile phones, they were tipped off about instances of dangerous driving or drink driving and they were able to intercept the culprits.  If old people had access to mobile phones instead of land line telephones, they would be able to contact the Garda in the event of their houses being broken into and burglars would be unable to stop them.  We do not make enough use of mobile phones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I use a mobile phone and for that reason I cannot speak against them.  However, regardless of the reassurances provided, the problem is that people continue to believe there are dangers involved in their use.  People seem to have problems with many things.  For example, they say there is a need for additional dumps but they do <Col N="344" /> not want such dumps sited in their areas.  They say there is a need to house travellers but they do not want them to be given accommodation in their housing estates.  They say halting sites must be provided, but they do not want them situated on their streets.  They say they need mobile phones, but they do not want masts to be erected. If we continue to behave in this way where will it all end?</P>
    <P>We want modern technology, good television pictures, good telephone services and computers, but they all make use of airwaves of one sort or another and create radiation.  I am told that the microwave oven is more dangerous than many other appliances, yet almost every house has one. Cars are the biggest killers in society, but we do not seek to ban them.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we will manage to address people's fears.  I sympathise with those who object to masts because I know they are motivated by genuine fear.  However, much of the fear is wrongly created because it can further business. A certain number of people set themselves up as experts and make themselves available to objectors as advisers and are well paid.  It is their job to generate fear.  I do not know where to turn for advice nowadays.  On a radio programme this morning two doctors contradicted one another on an issue.  Where does the layman go for advice? If one goes to the Four Courts one will find the best brains in the world who can convince one that a case is solid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet, the case may go before a judge and another opinion is given.  Therefore, one must be wrong and another right.</P>
      <P>I do not know how these genuine fears can be allayed, but a system must be found to address them.  Parents are afraid that masts are dangerous. I congratulate the Minister on the work she has done in this regard.  She organised a conference in Dublin at which experts guaranteed that the masts presented no danger.  However, those who object feel that there is a danger which may not become apparent for some years.  The Minister has a difficult job to allay people's fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are half a million mobile &rsquo;phones in the country and it is an expanding business.  The related services create many jobs for technology graduates.  We cannot go back to the era of the ass and cart.  We must take the risks that come with each business.  I recall when the ESB began widespread electrification that many people would not have electricity because they thought the cables might burn the thatched roofs.  Those fears were unfounded.  If the ESB was trying to put up masts nowadays they would face many problems.  There was a case in which a plan to run a new line on masts from Carrick on Shannon to Ballyshannon had to be stopped due to opposition to it.  In the past such a project would not have faced opposition because it would have been <Col N="345" /> seen as bringing work to an area.  However, people are driven by fear.</P>
    <P>We have many educated experts at our disposal but even those who came from the same colleges, having studied the same courses under the same teachers and passed the same exams come to opposing conclusions on matters.  What can a Minister seeking to resolve a problem such as this do in the face of such contradictions?</P>
    <P>I see no danger with masts.  There has been a mast at RTÉ in Montrose for the last 20 years and had there been any danger people would have been dropping like flies in the area. However, property is as expensive there as in any part of Europe.  It has been well proven that masts are not dangerous.  However, I accept that those who protest against them genuinely believe they are.  It is a problem the Minister must address.  It is unfair to blame Esat because it is trying to fulfil its contract to provide a countrywide service.  There should be no coverage blackspots. Rural development and industry must be based on high technology and we cannot have that without advanced communications.  In a few years the masts will be obsolete and the communication will take place via satellite.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will find a way to allay people's fears in this regard.  A good service should be provided, particularly to rural areas. The cities have the communications networks they need but the rural areas will suffer unless the problem is sorted out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I have listened closely to Senators' contributions and both sides of the argument have been put.  Many people are fearful of the problems associated with masts and antennae but I do not have great fears in that regard.  However, many objections and fears have been raised and the Oireachtas has a duty to allay these fears.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that guidelines were put in place to help local authorities and An Bord Pleanála with planning applications for masts.  The regulations have not gone far enough and more avenues should have been explored. Some of the greatest fears related to the aesthetic impact of masts.  They do not look good in any setting and people object to them.  The regulations do not go far enough in requiring them to be disguised.  Greater consideration should have been given to the use of existing ESB and Telecom Éireann structures and small antennae on the top of existing structures could provide greater coverage in rural areas.  As Senator Farrell said, rural areas will suffer most without new technology.  Urban areas benefit from communications technology which is in place already.  The regulations have not explored enough avenues with regard to the erection of masts and antennae.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the regulations that masts and antennae should be shared by mobile service providers.  There should not be an unnecessary proliferation of such masts in the <Col N="346" /> countryside.  If there is to be a third mobile phone company it should be able to tap into the many masts that are already being operated throughout the country by the two existing companies.</P>
    <P>Competition is good and the arrival in the market of a second mobile phone company has reduced the price of mobile calls charged by Eircell. We all welcome competition.  The Minister who introduced the second mobile licence must be congratulated.  If there is no competition, companies can charge what they like.  We have seen that with the ESB.  Competition has cut prices for the half a million mobile phone users in the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the appointment of a regulator, I mentioned on the Order of Business that the quality of RTÉ's first and second television channels in Castlebar has been very poor in recent months.  This is mainly due to transmissions from Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Will the Minister investigate this?  It is inappropriate that our national television channels should charge a licence fee from viewers in County Mayo for something that is not being provided properly.  The television picture quality is very bad and in most cases people cannot watch either RTÉ 1 or Network 2.</P>
    <P>Rural areas will suffer most from the objections to mobile phone masts.  We have a duty to explore all avenues to appease the many objectors. The Minister should allay public fears that have been raised about the use of mobile phones and the ancillary masts and antennae.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on telecommunication masts.  It is worthy and important that such a debate is taking place.  If this debate had taken place earlier at local authority level, some of the current problems would have been overcome.</P>
      <P>The quality of RTÉ's television service in County Mayo was mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister can ensure that RTÉ will bear the cost of relaying the service to the Treenbeg area of Newport, County Mayo.  Local people should not have to bear an extra cost to obtain a basic service.  I will convey that matter to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, in writing later.</P>
      <P>The debate has covered an important aspect of communications.  Partly it has arisen from the debate prior to the last election when the telecommunications service for the country became an issue.  As a local authority member involved in the planning process, I know there was a complete breakdown in the discussions between elected representatives and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can give a 100 per cent assurance in any given situation, just as one cannot be sure that when gets out of bed in the morning one will go back to bed that night.  Nevertheless, there was a breakdown in communications.  Matters moved swiftly as an important industry was being developed.  Esat and Eircell should review the position where people have objected to the location of their masts.  They should find alternative locations for antennae that are causing difficulties. <Col N="347" /> Those matters can be resolved within counties as long as certain assurances are given.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers mentioned, most of the places where concern has been expressed about masts are areas of high amenity which require good levels of telecommunication.  However, these areas must look after their existing amenities. While siting is important, it is possible to achieve a balance.  Piecemeal operations with individuals doing their own thing, have caused tremendous confusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's guidelines concerning the choice of sites which are suitable for the environment and which should be, as far as possible, away from areas of population.</P>
    <P>It is good that this issue is being discussed.  The Government is constantly reviewing and monitoring the effects on the environment of microwave discharges from the service.  This is necessary to alleviate the concerns of the public whom we are here to serve.  The Government must be seen to keep the public informed of developments.</P>
    <P>Improvements can be made through negotiation. Individual counties can take steps to ensure that telecommunication systems are improved and expanded.  We can create the necessary competition to provide a reasonably priced service based on modern technology.</P>
    <P>I support the discussion document which is very worthwhile.  This process should continue to work in tandem with local authorities for the future development of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment all the Senators who contributed to this important and topical debate.  I have noted the concerns they raised, including the independent monitoring of masts, planning regulations and exemptions, independent research into health effects and the need for Esat and Eircell to consult more proactively with local communities.  The issues will be addressed in the context of the response of the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Independent research is being commissioned by the European Union and the World Health Organisation.  We fully partake in the work of those bodies.  We are following the most up to date standards which are continually assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appreciate very much the interest of community groups in this topic.  As Senators have indicated, those groups have expressed genuine concerns which must be respected and addressed. I note the recognition by Senators of the importance of telecommunications not only to the country's overall economic development but to business and individuals, particularly those who use the service in emergencies.  Coming from a mountainous constituency, the example of a doctor who happens to be out in the Wicklow mountains and is perhaps 20 to 40 miles from his home is often brought home to me.  He goes back home to find that if he had been contactable in that area <Col N="348" /> he might have saved a journey of 80 miles and saved a life or lives.  Likewise there is the example of the vet who might have saved the life of a sick animal.  The telecommunications service is hugely important.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank Senators for raising the issue and assure them that their concerns will be listened to.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an gCathaoirleach as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom an ábhar tábhachtach seo a chur os comhair an Aire agus an Rialtais.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight the need for the Government to set up a special task force to combat the serious decline in industrial employment in County Offaly.  I have seen task forces work in other areas and I think this case deserves similar attention.</P>
      <P>This week Offaly County Council, of which I am a member, considered a report entitled <i>Offaly 2000: Towards Integrated and Sustainable Development.</i>  This report was prepared by council management and put before us as elected members in formulating our submission to the Midlands Regional Authority as part of their process of seeking continued support from the Government and the European Union through Structural Funding in the decades ahead, in particular to seek the support of the Government and the EU in maintaining Objective One status for the midlands region, in conjunction with the Border and western regions.</P>
      <P>For those of us who live and work in the county, the statistics in the report make for worrying reading.  At a time when the country as a whole is doing so well County Offaly, from a socio-economic point of view, is at best stagnant and at worst in serious decline.  The picture the report presents demands action from the Government in continuing to ensure that County Offaly, as part of the midlands region, will benefit in the future from Objective One status.  However, this is a matter for another day and another debate. We in County Offaly demand the setting up of a special task force to tackle the serious decline in industrial employment in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the regional question, I believe we are entitled to Objective One status and that the other two regions whose economies are so much below the national and EU average deserve special attention.  This will require the putting in place of regional structures such as SFADCo.  It is inconsistent for the State, which has lobbied so hard and so effectively to benefit from regional development in the European Union, to deny <Col N="349" /> regions the chance to share in the national prosperity to an equal degree.</P>
    <P>Regarding the demand for a task force in County Offaly, the facts exist and can be analysed clearly and objectively.  At a time when population decline in the rest of the country has been reversed, population growth in County Offaly has stagnated in the last ten years.  It actually declined in the 1986-91 period and while there was a small increase during the period 1991-6, this was way below the national average and came nowhere near reversing or restoring the decline of previous years.  Within the county the picture is even worse.  Only one rural district, Tullamore, showed any growth between 1991 and 1996.  All other districts showed a decline with the Ferbane and Birr electoral areas suffering particularly badly.  My colleagues and members of the county council know this only too well.  In 1991 it was necessary to transfer a substantial number of people from the Tullamore electoral area to the Ferbane electoral area to allow them retain their right of representation of five members on Offaly County Council.  In 1996 when the census was taken, we as a council had to face the prospect of again transferring population from Tullamore to Ferbane or losing a seat in the Ferbane area.  The picture within the county is very uneven and unbalanced.  The number of people leaving the county is well above the national average and most devastatingly, one-third of all those in the 20-25 year age group have left &mdash; 1,800 people in all.  Their futures, or their children's futures, will not be in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in the county, which accounts for almost one worker in five and nearly twice the national average, is under severe pressure.  Our farms are in the main small, with marginal economic viability.  Almost one-third of farm holdings disappeared in the ten years from 1981-91 &mdash;&mdash; from 6,000 to 4,000.  That is a stark statistic.  That figure is now almost down to 3,000 and it will be lowered still further by the Santer proposals unless they are substantially amended.</P>
    <P>In industry, County Offaly is a blackspot. Unemployment is 15 per cent, well above the national average, while in some areas, such as the urban district of Tullamore, it is 20 per cent or more.  There have been major job losses in the county.  A year ago this month, Tullamore learned that Atlantic Mills, which once employed over 300 people, was to close.  No task force was set up, no Minister came to town and 12 months later the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has finally, if belatedly, agreed to meet the council this week.  All I can say is better late than never and I hope she will have good news for us.  Edenderry lost the shoe company and many jobs in Bord na Móna.  Even though it is less than 40 miles from Dublin, the Government has failed to make EU funds available, as requested by Offaly County Council, to upgrade the Edenderry-Enfield Road and link the town to the development of the greater Dublin area. Perhaps the greatest devastation is in south and <Col N="350" /> west Offaly which depended to a huge degree on Bord na Móna and the ESB.</P>
    <P>The major change in employment in the county has been the job losses in Bord na Móna.  In 1983, the company employed over 2,200 people.  By 1993, it was just over 700.  The loss of 1,500 permanent jobs in County Offaly is equivalent to 30,000 jobs in Dublin.  The ESB has since cut a great deal of jobs and is continuing to do so through the CCR process.  Taken together, losses of employment in Bord na Móna and the ESB amount to an equivalent of 40,000 jobs lost in Dublin.  That would not just provoke a task force from the Government but a revolution.</P>
    <P>A task force is needed to concentrate the energy of the Minister, the Department, the Government, State agencies and EU support on this major problem.  As can be seen in Tallaght, Galway and other areas, task forces get results. We are entitled to this because in the 1970s and 1980s, when the council sought better treatment from successive Ministers, we were told we had Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Now we no longer have them to the same extent and we need urgent help.</P>
    <P>Governments since the 1960s have been committed to the balanced development of all regions.  However, the recent NESC report shows this is not happening.  Between 1973 and 1979, over 80 per cent of new jobs in Ireland went to regions outside our major cities.  That figure is now less than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wish to make comparisons within the midlands and I do not mean to highlight your county, a Chathaoirligh, in any unhelpful light other than to further the case I am making for County Offaly.  If one analyses the change in the total number of jobs in manufacturing and internationally traded services for industrial purposes within the five counties of the official midland region from 1973 to 1996, in Longford they increased by 61 per cent, in Roscommon by 98 per cent and in Westmeath by 78 per cent. However, over that period the increase in County Offaly was only 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves.  Urgent action is required and a task force would assist us in no small measure.  We want a task force because they have worked in other areas and I ask the Minister of State and the Government to sanction it.</P>

A total of 4,375 full-time jobs and 139 <Col N="351" /> part-time and seasonal jobs have been created in enterprises supported by these agencies.</P>
    <P>One thousand three hundred people are currently employed in overseas manufacturing companies in County Offaly.  The largest IDA assisted company in the county, Sherwood Medical, is performing and developing well in the manufacture of medical devices.</P>
    <P>The clothing and textiles sector is also an important source of employment in County Offaly with companies such as Lowe Alpine in Tullamore, the world renowned producers of tents and rucksacks, and Snickers, producers of protective clothing, both continuing to expand their operations.  In July 1997, IDA Ireland approved an expansion of the Lowe Alpine facility in Tullamore which involves the creation of a further 30 jobs.</P>
    <P>An inter agency group was established following the closure of Atlantic Mills in 1997 and the subsequent loss of 84 jobs.  Approximately half of the former Atlantic Mills workers have now secured alternative employment.  Others are pursuing further training and a small number are still seeking employment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is actively promoting Tullamore for new investment.  To this end, a marketing brochure promoting the town and the 230,000 square feet Atlantic Mills facility has been produced and circulated to IDA Ireland's overseas marketing networks.  As a result of this ongoing marketing programme, there have been 11 site visits to Tullamore over the past six months.  One of these clients has expressed an interest in the former Atlantic Mills facility.</P>
    <P>There are vacant factory units in Edenderry which are also being actively promoted by IDA Ireland and to date in 1998 there have been two site visits to these units.  In addition, a new privately financed 10,000 square feet advance factory for Birr has been certified by Shannon Development for approval under the BES.  Work is due to proceed on this facility later this year. When completed, these premises will be promoted to potential overseas investors and should enhance the attractiveness of Birr as a location for new investment.</P>
    <P>Despite the decline in employment in the county in traditional employment sectors, many new small businesses have emerged from the resultant pool of skilled workers.  This is borne out in the employment figures for Forbairt assisted companies in County Offaly which show a steady increase from 1,628 in 1995 to 1,868 in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, full-time indigenous employment in companies in south west Offaly which are supported by Shannon Development was 728 at 31 December 1997.  This figure represents an increase of 5.8 per cent on the corresponding figure last year and an increase of 36.1 per cent on the corresponding figure in 1992.  Since the last employment survey in December 1997, Shannon Development have approved five projects for the <Col N="352" /> south west Offaly area which it is anticipated will lead to the creation of a further 104 jobs.</P>
    <P>Since its creation, Offaly County Enterprise Board has provided a range of services to promote small and micro enterprises in the county. Two hundred and sixty five projects with grants exceeding £2 million have been approved to date. Enterprises grant aided by Offaly CEB currently employ 479 people full-time with an additional 139 employed on a part-time and seasonal basis.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies are committed to securing new investment for County Offaly and every effort is being made to ensure that this happens.  I am satisfied that the development agencies are working closely with industry and local interests to promote industrial development in County Offaly through the attraction of new industry and the expansion of existing industry. Given this ongoing work, I do not consider that the establishment of a specific task force for the county is required.  However, I assure the Senator that the industrial development agencies will provide every possible support for enterprise in the interest of job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for dealing with this matter of serious concern in Ballybofey, County Donegal, and I hope he can offer some assistance.</P>
      <P>Herdmans (Ireland) Limited have been in business for more than 100 years in Sion Mills in County Tyrone and it is nearly 50 years since the company set up a yarn spinning mill at Ballybofey. Those of us concerned about job creation welcomed Herdmans to Ballybofey and I worked closely with the late Joe Brennan when he enlisted Government support for the establishment of Herdmans there.</P>
      <P>Herdmans have been good employers and have helped the economy of the area substantially. Very few jobs have been created in the Finn Valley, which stretches from Lifford to Glenties, in the past 50 years.  There was some relocation of jobs from Castlefin to Ballybofey.  The news that Herdmans will make 42 people redundant is a serious shock. If 500 jobs were lost in Galway and Limerick it would be serious, and this loss in Donegal is equivalent to that in terms of the number of people employed, many of whom are male.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State served in the Department of Foreign Affairs previously and knows that Donegal suffered seriously because of its close proximity to the Border.  We suffered in silence, as did all the southern Border counties.  We had to keep our heads down for 25 years because people were losing their lives in the North and while we were suffering economically we could not complain.  All elected public representatives <Col N="353" /> in the six southern Border counties kept quiet and we were seriously disadvantaged by the allocation of European and international funding of which 80 per cent went to the North and 20 per cent to the South.</P>
    <P>The southern Border counties could not compete and that is why we gained little new industry. If we complained about this, we were told Donegal was doing well because it had the Fruit of the Loom factory.  However, Fruit of the Loom is based in Inishowen, which is as big as County Louth, and has had little impact on the valuable employment in County Donegal.  Ballybofey, in particular, suffered because of the Troubles as it is within four of five miles of the Border.  It would not have been the choice in normal circumstances for an industrialist.</P>
    <P>For example, there has a tradition of shirt manufacturing in Buncrana, Castlefin, Lifford and Letterkenny which employed many female workers and was very valuable to the economy. This has been largely lost and there are only two factories doing well in Buncrana and Lifford. Recently, a small manufacturer who set up in a store in Newtowncunningham tried hard to obtain funding to get a better premises for his workers.  Despite his best efforts and representations being made to all the agencies on his behalf, he was not able to get £1 in assistance from any source to employ people.  A funding agency in the North approached him and told him to wise up and look at what was available in the North.  He needed to buy a derelict building and get it assessed and this would act as collateral for his new business.  He was told he would be set up and totally funded without any effort on the basis of the valuation of the derelict building.  How can anyone compete?</P>
    <P>A major mistake was made when public representatives, such as myself, did not speak out during the height of the Troubles.  It never should have been 80 per cent funding for the North against 20 per cent for the South.  The North has been awash with money.  The British Government compensated substantially and generously for the deprivation in the North and that was not taken into account.  This made it more difficult for industrialists to survive in Donegal and Herdmans is an example of this.  It has a substantial plant in Sion Mills, County Tyrone, where it rebuilt its factory.  It had an old five storey building and walked away from it.  The company moved to a green field site and built a brand new plant.  Ten years ago, it modernised its Ballybofey plant using new technology; but the writing is on the wall as we cannot compete with the amount of funding available.</P>
    <P>Herdmans is doing what every other international company will do.  They will choose where they can obtain support and funding and there will no difficulty for Herdmans in extending its factory at Sion Mills.  It transferred staff from the Ballybofey plant to Sion Mills six months ago. There has been relocation, retraining and reprogramming of workers.  Will the Minister of State <Col N="354" /> recognise the fact we did not get jobs and suffered serious deprivation because we were close to the Border?  Will the Minister receive a deputation from the Ballybofey/Stranorlar Development Company Limited?  A task force was established whenever there were job losses elsewhere. An effort was made to compensate by providing extra jobs, etc.  and we are looking for nothing more and nothing less.  Our disadvantage should be recognised as well as the fact that we kept our heads down and paid a price.  This must be looked at in some form, either through a task force or ministerial visit to Ballybofey or a deputation to Dublin from the development association in Ballybofey.  The Minister of State must be seen to be doing something in response to these job losses, which will have serious consequences for the small towns of Ballybofey and Stranorlar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important employment issue.  It is important that the Minister or I, who are involved in employment policy, listen to people such as Senator McGowan and respond as best we can.  I am naturally disappointed at the announcement by Herdmans (Ireland) Limited that it intends making up to 35 of its 100 strong workforce in Ballybofey redundant. The loss of these jobs will be a great disappointment to the people in Ballybofey and the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>The company is currently in the process of an overall restructuring programme which will not alone affect the Ballybofey factory, but also the company's operations across the Border, where it plans to close two mills at Killyleagh Yarns in County Down and Henry Campbell Yarns in Mossley, County Antrim, resulting in a further 200 job losses in those plants.</P>
      <P>The Herdmans operation is a long established business.  The Ballybofey factory was set up in 1964 to manufacture grey linen yarn for the linen industry.  The Herdmans group sells its products world-wide.  While the linen industry can be very cyclical, the company has in the past been able to cope with this.  However, Herdmans has recently been experiencing serious marketing problems, due to the high value of sterling and the financial crisis in Asia.  It is against this background that the group is being forced to radically restructure its operations.  Accordingly, Herdmans proposes concentrating its manufacturing operations solely in the north west at Ballybofey and Sion Mills, where the head office and largest manufacturing plant is located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the group did not easily arrive at the decision to close two of its mills in Northern Ireland and to reduce numbers at Ballybofey. In fact, the company considered a number of alternatives.  However, as more than 80 per cent of Herdmans output is manufactured in Northern Ireland, the high exchange rate of sterling has had a critical effect on export volumes, leading to very high stock levels.  These factors have led to an <Col N="355" /> erosion of the company's export prices by 25 per cent.  European competitors, on the other hand, have been able to offer lower prices in the UK and other markets.  For these reasons, the company said it was left with no alternative but to restructure its business to ensure that production levels are brought into line with realistic market forecasts.</P>
    <P>While the decision to implement cutbacks both in Northern Ireland and Ballybofey is very disappointing, I understand why the Herdmans group have taken the necessary remedial measures to ensure the long-term viability of the operation thereby helping to safeguard the remaining 70 jobs at Ballybofey.  In saying that I am taking account of the information available to my Department on the matter.  I assure Senator McGowan that the State agencies are doing everything possible to maximise job opportunities in County Donegal.  Donegal is a target location for new inward investment by IDA Ireland.  The <Col N="356" /> agency has put in place a number of new measures, including higher grant levels and improved marketing material, to assist in the marketing of the county.</P>
    <P>The Senator made some very significant points in regard to the special position of County Donegal and has asked that my Department do everything possible to safeguard that.  As regards his suggestion that I would receive a deputation on this matter, I would be more than happy to facilitate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's positive response and we will take up his offer to arrange a meeting.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have arisen in recent years and no reply was received to any of the four letters to Forbairt's regional manager in Sligo.  That is not very satisfactory.  I hope the Minister is not pinning his hopes on any future assistance from the regional office in Sligo.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 April 1998.</P>
