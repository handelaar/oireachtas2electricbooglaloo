      <P>I have notice from Senator Avril Doyle that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the implications of the exclusion of VTOS courses from the newly launched back to education scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the protection she can offer to Irish citizens seeking US visas-green cards against fraudulent and misleading advertisements placed in Irish newspapers offering a paid service to process applications with the US authorities.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to carry out, as a matter of urgency, a further study and analysis of the effects on inland waterways, specifically on the ecosystem of Lough Derg, of the growth of the zebra mussel population.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure that the funding for recreational sport, special projects and ordinary grants are paid to Vocational Education Committees on time.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Keogh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review and broaden the remit of the Refugee Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Doyle's and Senator <Col N="950" /> Mooney's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators O'Meara, Costello and Keogh may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The view from this side of the House is much better this morning.  Today's Order of Business is item 1, Committee and Remaining Stages, and item 2, which will be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We also welcome the new sense of transparency on the Government side of the House.  I hope it is more than skin deep.  Natural lighting is a major improvement and if a Minister seated on the opposite side of the Chamber is placed in a glare it is a price worth paying.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the constitutional review group is again considering the future role of the Seanad, it is important that Members' views on that role should be placed on record. Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue before the end of the session?  I thank him for making available to me this morning a rough but complete guide in respect of our programme of work for the remainder of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Manning's statement, I made numerous representations to the Leader and the chairperson of the constitutional review committee about the fact that Independent Members are not represented on that committee.  If there is to be progress in terms of discussion, decisions or recommendations on the future role of the Seanad, it is essential that Independent Members have an input.  It is grossly unfair that we are not represented on that committee because it is an all-party body. The Standing Orders of the House recognise groups and that should be reflected in how we carry out our business.  Will the Leader take note of that?  As already stated, I discussed the matter with him and the chairperson of the committee and I would like to see progress being made. Apart from that, I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Seanad's future role.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Leader is putting together a list of legislation to be taken during the next month.  Will he include on that list the various issues in respect of which he made commitments to discuss?  For example, the Leader stated that industrial relations would be discussed during the current term and there is an urgent need to debate that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Literacy among young children is another issue which has come to prominence in recent weeks.  I raised it on previous occasions and the Leader stated it might be discussed.  I suggest it could be debated in the context of the report of the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  Members must be in a position to understand the extent of this problem and be informed about how it can be addressed and who retains responsibility for it. <Col N="951" /> Teachers believe we should grasp the nettle and eliminate unnecessary illiteracy among young people.</P>
    <P>There has been no indication of the Government's policy regarding the excess £1 billion which will be left in the Central Bank after 1 January next when we join the euro.  That money would cover the cost of two Luas projects.  At a time when there is a need for investment in many areas of the public service, the Government should state what it intends to do with this money.  At the very least, it should ask Members to give advice on the investment of £1 billion of taxpayers' money in the development of the State and its people.  We should be informed of the Department of Finance's view on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that natural light is being allowed to enter the House and I hope it will continue.  As a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution I can inform Members that the potential extension of the role of the Seanad, particularly in respect of European legislation, is currently under discussion.  It is the intention and desire of members of the committee that this issue will be the subject of extensive debate in the House in the context of any recommendations we might make.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's planned programme for the next session.  I appeal to him to include the Shannon River Council Bill on the list of legislation to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members were appalled by the recent pollution of a section of the River Suir which resulted in the destruction of thousands of fish.  Everyone is concerned that there will be a recurrence of last summer's events when several of our best rivers were poisoned because of crass carelessness on the part of certain people.  I am not satisfied that the fines advocated in the Water Pollution Act are sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this matter with the relevant Minister?</P>
      <P>I support yesterday's request for a debate on litter.  I am concerned that we are slipping badly in the context of the green and aesthetic environments. The relevant Minister must come before the House to hear Members' views about what I consider to be a good law, the provisions of which do not seem to have been enforced effectively enough to have an impact.  I hope the House will debate these two issues at the earliest opportunity.  I also support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the recently complied literacy report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also glad that the sticky matter of lighting in the Chamber has been resolved. I join Senators Quill and O'Toole in calling for a debate on literacy.  This is an issue of grave importance and it must be resolved as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> Will the Leader arrange a debate on the likely threat of flooding in the area surrounding Gort? Will the Minister come before the House and state what he intends to do to alleviate the possible threat to people's livelihoods, their homes and their physical safety.  Given that debates on this problem originated in the House, will the Minister come before us and provide information about how he intends to solve it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a matter on yesterday's Order of Business and in the interests of clarification I wish to inform the Leader I was referring to telephone charges not telephone masts.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on Northern Ireland?  We refrained from discussing this issue in the crisis period leading up to the referendum and the House might now make a useful contribution by way of a debate on it.  The people of the South responded generously in the referendum and it would be appropriate that the House debate this issue which affects many counties in the northwest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House to debate the issue of remedial education? A commitment was made in the Programme for Government that top priority would be given to the provision of remedial teachers throughout the country.  However, people's hopes and expectations have not been realised.  As the end of the current school year approaches, it is vitally important that the Minister for Education and Science come before the House to indicate what he intends to do about remedial education because there has been a major outcry in respect of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>On yesterday's Order of Business Senator Rory Kiely referred to a radio interview regarding the removal of Rule 21.  As he will be attending the special conference at the weekend, will the Senator try to persuade those present to take the sensitivity of the situation in respect of the six northern counties into consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government take back the £20 million it gave to the GAA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter for people on the other side of the Border.  While I do not advocate the indefinite continuation of the rule, now is not the time to deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted the delight of Members, particularly the Leader, at the removal of obstructions to the windows of the Chamber.  In that context, I wish to refer to the old house repair grant.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to attend a <Col N="953" /> debate and inform the House of the up-to-date position and when it is intended to introduce a new house repair grant?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole in pointing out again the extraordinary anomaly that the Independent group, the third largest group in the House, is not represented on the constitutional review committee.  The Independent group was very flexible in facilitating membership of Oireachtas committees by Labour Party Senators when it did not have to.  Perhaps my Labour Party colleagues might reciprocate that generosity by reminding the constitutional review committee of our existence.  There is a job to be done and we would like to be involved in it.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider the holding of a debate on the freedom of the press and the need to maintain a diversity of press ownership?  It is interesting that the story which has dominated two of the national newspapers and the national broadcasting media is almost absent from one national newspaper, which happens to be owned by the company involved in this controversy.  If newspapers suppress news stories because they do not like the implications for their owners we are rapidly moving away from freedom of the press.  Why is it necessary to have an Early Signature Motion for the Local Government Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over many months the House has debated the issue of traffic control.  Unfortunately, most of the emphasis has been placed on the situation in Dublin.  Senator O'Toole mentioned two Luas schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Three Luas schemes &mdash; the one which will be built and two more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange an urgent debate and ask the NRA or the Minister on behalf of the NRA to attend the House to discuss the chaos in traffic outside Dublin which is being created by Dublin?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader also arrange for an urgent debate on the situation in the Middle East?  I doubt if there is any Senator who does not have a relative serving in the Lebanon.  A huge number of soldiers from Counties Kerry, Cork, Donegal, Dublin and elsewhere are living in bunkers because of the illegal bombing of the Lebanon by Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made a very good case for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU should use its influence to ensure that Irish soldiers or other soldiers in southern Lebanon should not be illegally bombed by Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, will travel to Sudan the week after next to look at the horrific occurrences taking place there.  This week she has been able to increase the moneys available for <Col N="954" /> overseas development aid.  Will she attend the House and provide an explanation as to how the moneys given by Ireland are being spent in the most deprived areas of the world?  It would be an illuminating and useful exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the PRSI system, especially when more than 20,000 citizens, including farmers, small shopkeepers and others, who were legally obligated to make PRSI contributions from 5 April 1988, have reached the age of 66 years before the 5 April this year and thereby do not have the necessary qualifying ten years?  Surely equity, justice and fair play indicates that they are entitled to receive pensions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the appropriate Minister to attend the House to debate the position of Esat Digifone telephone masts around the country?  I am concerned that such masts have been erected without planning permission in a number of towns and villages in my constituency, such as Tarbert and Ballybunion. Legislation introduced by the previous Government needs to be debated because the masts have been erected in population centres. There is a public outcry on the matter.  The masts should be erected outside populated areas.  Perhaps new legislation is required to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for a debate on the MMDS system, where a radical overhaul is required.  The Minister should attend the House for the debate. People have been ripped off by those involved in the system.  RTÉ may be the proper authority to take it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am outlining the reasons why there should be a debate.  People are being charged everytime an important programme is scheduled, such as a sporting event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made an adequate case for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has already debated education matters, especially literacy.  Could the Leader arrange an urgent and meaningful debate on the latest report on school truancy?  It would appear from the report that no figures have been kept for the past 20 years.  I and every local authority member in the greater Dublin area have appealed for the provision of school attendance officers in the greater urban areas where there have been none.  It is ridiculous.  Their absence is a contributory factor.</P>
      <P>Could Members have lessons on car parking? It is impossible on occasions to park one's car between the parking lines because owners of big cars appear to take up two spaces.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention it in the interest of small car owners who in some cases have been bullied in this manner by the owners of large ministerial cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline the steps he has taken to improve and protect the resources in our waters, lakes, rivers and streams?  The Munster area has the worst quality water in the country and it is gradually deteriorating.  There is a move towards environmental agricultural development in the present planning process.  It is important for the Government and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce policies to monitor the quality of our freshwaters and streams on a national basis.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to outline the Government's plans for dealing with this important resource?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my call to the Leader for a debate on the implications of EU enlargement for Ireland.  Does someone in the Office of Public Works come into the Chamber at night to change the window panes?  I thought the glass was opaque yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Ryan and O'Meara asked for a debate on Seanad affairs for the constitutional review group.  I have allocated a full day to that urgently needed debate on Wednesday, 24 June.  It would serve this House well to have such a debate.</P>
      <P>Many Senators called for a debate on education issues.  I will contact the Minister for Education and Science to arrange a broad based debate on education before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill and others called for a debate on environmental matters.  We will have a debate on all environmental matters, including litter, water quality control and the other matters which were raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked about the time frame for the Local Government Bill.  If the Bill is not signed by tonight the local elections will have to be held in three weeks' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan called for an urgent debate on the serious situation in the Middle East.  We will take statements on that issue next Friday afternoon from the leaders or spokespeople of the various groups in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> Senator Coghlan called for an urgent debate on the position of self employed people's pensions and the enormous difficulties created by the PRSI system, particularly for those who have reached old age pension age.  For example, people who have been paying into this pension fund for eight years still do not qualify.  I will have this matter investigated and I will try to have a debate on it.  However, I urgently request him to seek the agreement of his party before the end of the session for me to allocate extra Private Members' Time to the Fine Gael Party to debate the matter. We on this side of the House would agree to such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely called for a debate on broadcasting and MMDS.  There are great concerns in this area.  I am trying to have a debate on this issue in the House but I do not see it happening before the summer recess.  However, it will be debated at the beginning of the autumn session.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon asked for a debate on EU enlargement.  I said in the House yesterday that I wanted the Seanad to be used to inform the public about what is happening in Europe.  Such a debate was also called for by Senator Manning yesterday.  I am discussing the matter with the leaders of the various groups and I hope to return to the House soon with a proposed plan on how the Seanad can act as a conduit to the public for information on the progress being made in Europe and the debates which take place there.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1998: Committee and Remaining Stages.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 states &ldquo;The Minister shall manage and control the Fund&rdquo;.  However, no criteria have been established for how the Minister is to do that.  One of the weaknesses in the Bill is that the mechanism is still being worked out by the study group in Galway Corporation and Galway County Council, as the Minister explained to us yesterday.  It is very hard to pass a Bill when one does not know the mechanism by which the Minister is going to control this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to accept there is a need to be careful in drawing up the system under which the allocations will be made.  It will be based in only one instance on the pilot scheme which has been undertaken by the Galway local authorities in order to establish the resources and needs of each local authority.  This is the practice <Col N="957" /> in other European countries and is not a new principle.</P>
      <P>The whole question of equalisation has been accepted here since the Barrington report and was the subject of an earlier Bill proposed by the previous Government.  The system of allocation will be based on the principle of equalisation, which will be a core feature of the fund.  It is important that any additional funds which become available are distributed equitably.</P>
      <P>Despite the research that has been done, I am sure we will still be in a learning process when the initial allocations are made in the early stages. All local authorities will be observing with keen interest the operation of the new system. However, it cannot be brought into operation unless the basic legislation is put in place.</P>
      <P>As the Senator may recall, there was great dissatisfaction among local authority members about the way the old rate support grant system operated. It was not fine tuned to respond to a changing society and the changing needs of local authorities. The services being provided may have changed but the level of funding did not.  Substantial additional funding will be available from 1 January 1999, therefore, equalisation is even more important.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary to remind the House that when rates on houses were abolished the then Government introduced a statutory requirement under which local authorities received money in lieu of the funds they would otherwise have received from rates on houses.  This decision operated satisfactorily in the early years until the system was changed by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring.</P>

      <P>Many promises were made in 1977 which the country could not afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision was made in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983, which was introduced by Senator Doyle's party in conjunction with the then Minister for the Environment who was a Labour Party Deputy.  The decision in that Act has been the cause of the gross under-funding of the entire local government system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the original legislation introduced by the Government in 1977 had continued in operation, local authorities would not have found themselves starved of funds at local level while central Government took care of the provision of services at its level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is redressing that position and I am proud to be a member of a Government which is doing that.  I fought against the Bill in 1983 but, unfortunately, we failed because we did not have sufficient numbers to defeat it.  It is facile to suggest that the position regarding the funding of local authorities arose because of the removal of rates on houses.  It arose as a result of <Col N="958" /> the decision to remove the statutory obligation on central Government to fund local authorities in lieu of the money they would have received from rates on houses.  I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to deal with events since 1977 but the Minister raised the issue of legislation that was changed in 1983.  The fact is that local authorities have suffered since 1977. Anybody who says otherwise is suffering from delusions.  The decision to abolish rates without providing matching funds for local authorities in 1977 was a massive mistake.  The Minister gave the impression that the problems started after 1983 but that is not the case.</P>
      <P>There have been problems in local authorities since 1977, particularly in urban authorities.  The Minister knows this is the case in the Galway area.  He should not give the impression that the real problem was the legislation implemented in 1983.  However, I do not blame one particular Government.  Rates were partly abolished between 1975 and 1977 before they were removed totally in 1977.  I do not suggest that was correct because all local authorities were undermined from that day forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not respond to Senator Doyle's query.  He said he was delighted to inform the House that the position will be changed.  Will he explain precisely how local authorities will be funded and how there will be equal distribution.  I have heard promises about equal distribution to local authorities so often that I am confused.  For example, the previous Government established a road fund but, on a percentage basis, more funds were given to county authorities than city and urban authorities.  If that is an equal distribution of funds, will the Minister explain how some authorities received more than others on a percentage basis?  Some authorities received more because county roads needed more work than urban roads.  There is significantly more traffic on urban roads but they did not receive funds because the Minister considered a higher percentage should be provided to county authorities.</P>
      <P>In Cork, the county authority received a higher allocation than the city authority.  The roads in all cities and towns are rapidly deteriorating but no money has been provided for them.  The authorities are expected to come up with their own funding.  Will the Minister explain how there will be equal distribution to all authorities in a way which will enable me to feel happy about supporting the Bill?</P>

      <P>Regarding Senator Cregan's point, all roads have deteriorated and this must be addressed.  It comes down to prioritisation.  Ministers have a difficult job in that respect because they must establish the priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My area, County Kildare, has suffered grievously as a result of earlier decisions.  However, the historic argument is not productive in my county <Col N="959" /> where the level of population has exploded but the rate support grant has not increased in line with that explosion.  It is obvious that the system must be rationalised to allow counties which have suffered population increases to provide the level of services required by the citizens of the area which are inadequate due to the current funding circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, a minimum level of funding must be provided to counties where the population levels have fallen and the revenue deriving to the local authorities is small.  A basic level of infrastructure must be maintained, irrespective of the size of the population.  Given these two aspects, the Bill and specifically this section are a welcome development. They will go a long way towards redressing some of the difficulties which have arisen because of the way the rate support grant system has been administered over many years.</P>

      <P>It is important to note that the fund as outlined in the Bill is not much different from the position which has pertained since 1983. Senator Cregan referred to events in 1977.  I have always articulated the view that local government should be independently funded.  The removal of rates from houses and the abolition of water charges were retrograde steps for local government. Nevertheless, it must be noted that all the major political parties have taken that approach.</P>
      <P>Since 1983 the Minister of the day has been in control of the amount of funding allocated to local authorities.  Under the Bill a special fund with a statutory basis will be established.  This is a step forward.  In addition, the amount of money that will be available to local authorities will be significantly increased.  Section 6 provides for the appointment of a committee to advise on the performance of the fund.  I hope councillors and others involved in local government will be members of this body when it is established to ensure an input from that level.  The Bill is a step forward.  Rather than returning to a position where local authorities must raise finance locally through rates or water charges, the provisions are a move in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister shall manage and control the fund.  This is an exact replica of a section in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, under which the Minister has power to manage and control the equalisation fund.  The powers in this Bill are therefore the same as those proposed by the previous Government and the proposal for managing the fund is based on the legislation introduced by Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference is that the decisions made since 1983 have been arbitrary &mdash; they were not based on an assessment of the resources available to each local authority, whether county or urban. The Government in this legislation is putting in place a procedure whereby the allocation of <Col N="960" /> money from the fund will relate to an assessment of the financial resources available to each local authority and the needs of that authority.  That is a new practice in this country.  The pilot study in Galway is only part of the picture and the Department is also carrying out studies into how this could be done.</P>
    <P>It is important to move away from the arbitrary position which has obtained up to now, in which a Minister decides how much to give to local authorities irrespective of other matters.  Such decisions cannot be made that way in future because the Government is committed to establishing an equalisation formula which will ensure, in the case of each local authority being funded, that there is knowledge of their needs, resources and capacity.  If the Senator wants further information about how it is proposed to do this I can send him the terms of reference, scope and guidelines for the resources and needs study, but I do not intend to take up the House's time.</P>
    <P>The principle I am expounding is something all sides will welcome and we hope it will work satisfactorily. I do not think it will satisfy everyone at its initiation &mdash; experience of how it works may show the need for adjustments &mdash; but everyone can observe it and the principle of equity will apply.  If people see that decisions are made which do not adhere to an equitable formula, that can be exposed and be the subject of debate.</P>
    <P>It is wise to go down this path and I have been advocating it for years.  Having examined local government funding procedures in different countries it is clear this is the best system.  It is employed by a number of countries and we propose to introduce it here.  It will be seen to be the fairest way because smaller and larger local authorities will all be looked after.  The possession of a lot of resources will be taken into account, as will a lack of funding from other sources, and it will all be matched against a measurement of needs.  It is not an exact science and there will be no perfect solution but it is much more transparent and equitable than what has obtained since 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says.  His answer was fair and he knows the system was not right.  That does not necessarily mean the fund is the correct replacement for the rate relief grant; but the grant was a disaster &mdash; it did not help any authority, small or large.  I also accept his remarks about the pilot scheme in Galway and the study by Department officials. Senator Walsh mentioned the committee which is to be set up and it is imperative that those on it know all about local authorities.  I do not want particular people to be on the committee but there should be a fair distribution of people &mdash; there have been enough &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; on committees under all Governments.  This is extremely important for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of roads and traffic throughout the country was mentioned on the Order of Business <Col N="961" />&mdash; it is not only a problem in Dublin, it is everywhere.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important section of the Bill; it deals with the quantum of money which will go into the fund.  The Minister should be complimented for this.  For many years those involved with local government felt resources were not sufficiently available to undertake duties and at times we were targeted for cost savings because it was easier to take money from us than from other Departments.  This section provides a statutory basis for local authority funding. The motor tax allocation to the fund for 1999 is £393 million, including £270 million put into the fund from the Exchequer; that represents a 27 per cent increase on the 1997 figure and must be welcomed. The Bill also removes from a Minister the discretion to reduce the previous year's allocation - it must increase at least as much as the consumer price index.  That means local authority funding will increase in line with inflation.  Also, it has tended to happen in the past that other functions were allocated to local government without a corresponding availability of funds to undertake those functions.  The Bill corrects this by providing that such functions must be costed and resources made available to local government. At a time when we are talking about devolution &mdash; which we hope will mean that the principle of subsidiarity will be fully embraced by central Government &mdash; it is imperative that finances are made available to local authorities to enable them undertake those functions in an efficient and effective manner.  The base being right is essential to the success of a Bill; that is the case here and I compliment the Minister for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to expenses incurred by local authorities.  All county councils are tied in with urban authorities.  The Minister will know about expenses incurred by authorities in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Dublin and Waterford. What happens when an authority incurs expenses because it services a region rather than an urban area?  For instance, Cork Corporation services areas outside the city which are covered by Cork County Council.  It costs the corporation more than the county council while people in the city do not benefit to the same degree as those in the council area.  I cannot understand why counties do better than cities or big towns percentagewise in terms of contributions.  The Minister said equal distribution will solve that problem. Will he give an assurance that the committee to be established will be relevant to proposals made by certain councils and authorities?  Cork Corporation has often made arguments for contributions to get joint ventures moving but the county council moves much faster than the city.  Why do urban councils always lag behind?  I do not mean to be critical of county councils as Cork County Council and others work well but cities and towns are deteriorating.  Why is that the case?</P>

They will be highlighted in the resources and needs study and the best assurance I can give the Deputy is that for the future there will be a mechanism in place by which these arguments can be made and which can correct the situation if it is possible to do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy did not give a specific example and I can only guess.  However, it is an ideal matter to take into consideration in determining the equalisation formula and what allocation might be made.</P>

      <P>Following discussions when this was announced there was concern that urban authorities might find themselves in a position where moneys would be channelled through the county council and they felt they might not get a fair share of the monies from county councils.

      <P>The Minister grasped what I am about.  The committee to be set up should not be called a &ldquo;committee&rdquo; but it should have an authority of its own and answer only to the Minister. It is important the Minister makes sure the committee comprises people with no axe to grind.  A county or city councillor cannot be on it because this would lead to a domineering effect since politicians are politicians, irrespective of whether they come from an urban, city, county council or the Seanad, Dáil or Government.  An equalisation officer who would look at this fairly is very important, given that one is talking about a 27 per cent increase in funding this year, with a 5 per cent increase next year if it is consumer indexed, and inflation will be running at 4 to 5 per cent. The body to be set up should have people on it who would make sure everybody is treated equally.  There will be a deterioration again otherwise. One cannot blame small urban councils where everybody must go through to get to the other side of a town, city or county.  For instance, Kinsale and Killarney are busy little towns.  How much does Kinsale UDC get in comparison to other areas, yet it must cater for many people? An equalisation officer would handle that and I would appreciate if the Minister would take that on board.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Cregan.  Many urban areas, such as the greater Dublin region, are traversed by people who visit, carry on business, use its services and deposit litter.  This leads to extra costs for these areas which are not created by people living in them.  The equalisation system proposed in the Bill must address such an issue.  Senator Cregan developed his argument by saying individuals from those areas should be on the advisory committee.</P>

      <P>I explained how the equalisation formula and principle will work and it will cover the matters raised by the Senators.  They are important aspects that will have to be taken into consideration.  Senator Walsh raised the question of the allocation of funding.  It will be paid directly to all local authorities and urban authorities will not get their moneys through county councils.  Each local authority exists in its own right and its needs and resources will be assessed and funded accordingly.  Where the towns mentioned are involved in a great deal of extra expense in providing services arising from their use by people who do not reside in the area, such factors will be taken into consideration.  That is the point of having an equalisation system in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study in Galway in not just being carried out by Galway County Council.  It will take in all the local authorities in County Galway which has a good cross section.  It has a county borough in the city, an urban council in Ballinasloe, town commissions in Loughrea and Tuam and the county council is an ideal model for a pilot study. I am pleased by the reaction of Senators to its <Col N="964" /> effectiveness and none of the points raised should cause alarm.</P>
    <P>Cork will benefit from areas designated in 1986 under the urban renewal scheme where rate remissions were granted.  Some of those have expired and others will expire in future which will result in increased revenue for Cork Corporation and I am sure it will spend it wisely.</P>

      <P>In page 13, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;Where immediately prior to the passing of this Act a person held a temporary appointment to perform the functions of an office or employment to which section 2(1)(b) of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, would have applied but for the temporary nature of the appointment, the appointment, during the two years commencing on such passing, of that person to the office or employment, being an office or employment up to and including the grade of Executive Engineer and cognate grades, on a permanent basis <Col N="965" /> shall not be deemed to be an appointment to an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was tabled by my party in the Dáil and I understand that there was some discussion and teasing out of the matter.  I also understand some progress was made on the issue raised by the amendment, that of temporary appointments and the effect of the passing of the legislation on those who hold such positions.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment tabled by Senators Costello, Gallagher and O'Meara is the same as that tabled by Deputy Howlin in the Dáil.  The effect of their amendment is limited in that it seeks to create a temporary exclusion for a two year period in respect of the filling of permanent posts up to the level of executive engineer and cognate grades for those in temporary positions at the time of the passing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage in the Dáil the Minister tabled his own amendment on this section which was accepted.  It enables the Minister to specify by statutory order all the posts which are required to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission. When an order is made by the Minister, it must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and is capable of being annulled if a resolution of either House is passed to that effect. Orders amending or revoking previous articles can be made from time to time, but in every case the order must be laid before both Houses.</P>
      <P>The framing of the Minister's amendment to provide a statutory basis for the declaration of posts to be filled by the LAC is believed to be the appropriate approach to take, given that titles of posts may change from time to time or new posts may be created.  From the perspective of framing legislation, it is not considered suitable to specify in primary legislation the levels of or reference to specifically named positions above which all posts are to be filled by the LAC.  This is the reason powers are included in Acts for the making of orders and regulations to specify particular matters which can vary from time to time.</P>
      <P>This is another measure to give greater autonomy to local authorities.  It is part of the devolution process of giving the local authorities more control and power over matters affecting the way in which they operate.  Under existing requirements, all professional positions have to be filled through competitions organised by the LAC. Under this change, only certain higher professional and administrative positions in local authorities would be required to be filled through the LAC.  Other posts can be filled by arrangements entered into by local authorities, while complying with certain conditions laid down for them to ensure that such positions will be filled in a uniform manner throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temporary employees, local authority assistant engineers and others employed from time to time, cannot be made permanent without being <Col N="966" /> appointed by the LAC.  Recently there were 600 applicants for two positions of engineer.  The delay that will cause can be imagined.  A local authority which wishes to fill a vacancy has to wait its turn in the LAC for posts to be filled.  It should be recognised that local authorities now have the competency to set up interview boards and make appointments in a fair and just manner.</P>
    <P>It is a move towards decentralisation and devolution and giving greater autonomy to local authorities.  It presents the opportunity for many people employed in temporary positions for a long number of years of becoming permanent employees.  The Opposition amendment proposes that we revert to the <i>status quo</i> after two years. The Bill is trying to change that and to achieve the objectives I have outlined.  That is praiseworthy and I ask the House to accept the changes the Minister made in the Dáil as regards statutory orders.  They will allow him to specify the posts and those orders will have to be approved by both Houses.  If a motion were tabled against any of them within 21 days of their being made, it would have to be put to the House.  That safeguards against anything untoward being attempted.  Therefore, I regret I cannot accept the Opposition amendment.</P>

      <P>This section is important from the point of view of local authority members.  Concerns have been expressed about it and the Minister is aware of them.  It is unfortunate that the amendment tabled by Senator Doyle, that all members would be recognised, has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential financial charge on the Revenue.  It makes the valid point that a person may still feel they have a contribution to make.  This Bill more or less states that if a person retires, a gratuity scheme will be established for them.  However, schemes can be abolished.  Is this initiative a scheme, a gratuity, an allowance, a benefit or a pension?  These are questions which must be asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concern of people in public life, be they county council, urban council or borough council members.  As a long serving Senator elected by these people I know them well, as do other Senators.  The Minister is finally recognising the contribution of local councillors.  This recognition <Col N="967" /> seems, however, to be conditional on councillors not standing for re-election.  If public representatives are discouraged from standing for election they are more likely to wish to stand.  I want to give recognition to county and urban councillors who have given enormous commitment to local government.  We can learn such a lot from these people.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not go far enough in recognising the contribution of councillors.  The vast majority of councillors got no financial reward up to six years ago.  They were only paid expenses for travelling to meetings.  They nevertheless were totally dedicated.  I meet councillors from all parties and all parts of the country and I know this to be the case.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 an allowance has been paid to county councillors.  The Minister now proposes a scheme to pay a gratuity based on the number of years service.  It will be a sad reflection on us if we pass a Bill which sets up a scheme, the details of which are not clear.  This would be unfair to the councillors who will be affected by it.  I am not prepared to allow this Bill to become law if its terms are not clarified.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to imply that there are many councillors who would be well advised to retire. Such a thing should never be said about anyone. Many councillors have given more than 40 years service.  I have seen such experienced councillors listen to a contribution of two hours and then dispense with the speaker's arguments in a speech of four lines.  If such people wish to stand in the next local election they should not be discouraged from doing so.</P>
    <P>Let us say that of the 900 councillors who stand in the next local election 300 are defeated.  It would be preferable to give the gratuity to those defeated councillors &mdash; the number of such councillors will be very small &mdash; and it would not cost the State any more money.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to say that we wish to see people removed from public service.  I will not allow that to be said.  I do not say this because councillors elect me and others to this House.  I would not demean anyone in that way.  Public representatives should be permitted to stand and, if defeated, their contribution over many years should be recognised.  Section 6 makes provision for circumstances in which the Minister may make payment from the fund.  Would it not be possible to provide that the Minister may make a payment in recognition of the services of councillors who are defeated in an election?  Public representatives who have given long service should not be told they may not stand for re-election.</P>
    <P>Section 12(1)(a) speaks of the retirement of members.  What politician is in a hurry to retire? Politics is not a job, it is a commitment.  If a politician's contribution to society is to be recognised that should be done the day after he or she is defeated or he or she decides not to stand.  The contributions of Senators, Deputies and Ministers are recognised financially if they are defeated in <Col N="968" /> an election.  Why are we not prepared to give the same recognition to the people who have elected us to this House?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister prepared to consider a scheme to recognise a person who wishes to stand for election and is defeated?  The number of people concerned is small and the scheme would not be costly.  It would be far cheaper than a retirement scheme.  About 18 per cent to 20 per cent will be defeated and on that basis it would cost less than this scheme.  Will the Minister of State tell us what he is prepared to give?  The section does not explain what the people who retire will get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan with regard to councillors.  I have spent 19 years on Wexford County Council and 24 years on New Ross Urban District Council.  Having been elected to the Oireachtas recently I see the disparity in the way Members of the Oireachtas and councillors are looked after.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Ministers of State, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Dan Wallace, and the departmental officials are committed to putting right an injustice against those who have given selfless service to their communities over many years.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that councillors spend around 35 hours per week carrying out their duties, depending on the councillor and the locality.  Many Members of the Oireachtas acknowledge that the majority of work they do at constituency level relates to their local authorities.  It is an anomaly that councillors are expected to do similar work without payment, other than the recoupment of some out of pocket expenses.  Hopefully, the anomaly will be corrected.  The initiative in the Bill is the first step in giving tangible recognition to the contribution of councillors.</P>
      <P>Given the longevity of the current councils, it is inevitable that some members will decide to retire.  It is appropriate that those who do so will receive a gratuity for their years of service. Members of the Oireachtas and people who work in the public service get a gratuity and a pension on retirement.  It has been discriminatory that councillors have not qualified and this measure is a welcome change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure is restricted to those who retire.  I would like it to be ongoing and to apply to those who are defeated at election.  Having discussed the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister, I am aware that the provision in the Bill will not be altered.  I hope that over the course of time a system similar to that for national politicians will be applied to local politicians.  The thrust of local government is towards greater commitment and professionalism from councillors and in that context they should be compensated adequately.  The <Col N="969" /> Minister of State has spoken of a payment for councillors and I hope that will be introduced at a level commensurate with the responsibility and workload involved.  If such a payment is introduced, gratuities and pensions may flow from it.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Minister to decide on the amount that will be paid to people who retire. The LAMA, the General Council of County Councils and the AMAI have made a submission seeking a minimum level of £570 per year of service. I recommend that figure to the Minister as a minimum and anything higher would be welcome. I do not think it should be any less.  The Bill does not deal with the tax status of the gratuity. It should be tax free because if it was subject to tax the amounts councillors would get would be very small and would not recognise their years of good service.</P>
    <P>Will the amount to be paid be the same for urban councillors as for county councillors?  Subsection (2)(a) indicates that a gratuity shall be granted by the local authority specified in a scheme.  Will urban authorities qualify under that provision?  I note the provision in the Bill for a clawback, so to speak, for those who qualify but who are re-elected or co-opted subsequently. Many councillors with long service died during the life of the current councils.  What provision is to be made for them, particularly in cases where their seats were taken over by their spouses?  Will the qualifying period include that of the deceased spouse?  That should be recognised for the sake of equity.  I welcome this as a good initiative.  It should be extended in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision which concerns many Members of the House who have served local authorities well over many years.  We must welcome the Minister's decision to recognise such service with a gratuity.  I do not refer to it as a retirement lump sum because many councillors feel that if they go for election in 1999 and are defeated they should be entitled to a lump sum as if they had retired before going for election. It is the Minister's intention not to change the provision, but perhaps he might consider alternative ways to facilitate defeated councillors in the future.  As Senator Cregan pointed out, they would be small in number, especially in view of the numbers who may retire.</P>
      <P>There is a matter to which the Minister referred yesterday which I do not see in the Bill. The Minister said yesterday &mdash; and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will bring this matter to his attention &mdash; that people will have to give notice between June and September of their intention to avail of the retirement scheme.  It is a little unfair to put an onus on people to make up their minds between June and September 1998.  I cannot locate the reference to this in the Bill but the Minister made reference to it yesterday in his reply.</P>

      <P>I understand the views expressed in relation to certain aspects of the Bill.  It is important to bear in mind that this is the first time any Government has put forward a proposal recognising the contributions made by people who have been members of local authorities for a number of years.  They will receive that recognition by opting to retire and not contesting the subsequent election.  No other Government has proposed such a measure.  It is a very generous offer and will be a small reward for those who have served on local authorities for years.  Many people have retired after years of dedicated service who on reflection would rightly have harboured the view that officialdom gave very little recognition to their role, contribution, time and effort in serving their local communities.  This Government is proposing to change that.  We are introducing this system whereby generous amounts, perhaps based on the length of service, will be made available for people retiring from local government.</P>
      <P>We are at a crossroads in the local government system.  We have reached the tenth anniversary of the foundation of this Act.  Reform of local government and introducing new funding methods through acceleration in the reform process is heralding a new era for local government, one in which the work of councillors will in future be recognised by way of remuneration.  That is what is intended, though the formula has not yet been worked out.  It will perhaps take further legislation to implement it.  I hope and expect that there will be a salary system for councillors.  Many comments have been made which remind me of the man who places a decent bet on a horse and the horse comes in at generous odds: when you win, you never have enough on it.  When the Government is doing something generous there will always be someone who will say we are not doing enough.  Nothing has been done up to now. I know that councillors who are considering retirement are pleased they will receive some recognition for their services from this Government. They expected whole-hearted support for this measure when it came before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is being seen as an option not available to them before.  I cannot subscribe to the intent of the proposed amendment which has been ruled out of order.  I recommend that Senators accept the Bill as is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators raised specific questions.  It is intended that the amounts paid will be tax-free. That will not be covered by this legislation, but following consultations with Revenue it may be contained in a future Finance Bill.  The figures on the scheme have not yet been decided.  I think it was wise not to decide on that until views from Members of the Dáil and Seanad had been heard. Such views will be taken into account by the <Col N="971" /> Minister in determining at what level the scheme is to be pitched.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has been elected to Government office through the local government system &mdash; town commissioners, urban councils, county councils, corporations, borough corporations etc. - will qualify for payment under the scheme. Procedures, excluding the figures, for the scheme are laid down in the Bill but they will be published soon and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is the Minister's intention to publish the scheme about two or three weeks after the Bill is passed.  Councillors will have adequate time to examine the proposals before deciding to opt for the scheme.  Such decisions are personal and will be made by each individual having consulted his family and local organisation.  Popular councillors find it difficult to withdraw from local government because of pressures from their local organisations to remain because of their certainty in winning seats.  Many councillors remain in office because of pressure from other people to do so, but I think they should have the right to make a decision themselves.</P>
    <P>This proposal provides them with an option they did not have before.  It is expected that there will be remuneration in the new system so it is not a question of take the money now or you will get nothing later.  The decision to retire will be a voluntary one.  It is hoped to introduce salaries as part of the new system.  It is not the Government's intention that this be seen to sweep out people who have given loyal service for years.  It is in recognition of that service that we are introducing this measure.  I would prefer it to be read in that way.</P>

I cannot supply Senators with any information in relation to figures to be included in the scheme because no decisions have been made in that regard other than that they will be generous.  It is expected that the introduction of this measure will cost £1 million. If a person has died since election in 1991 and who had he been alive would have qualified under the scheme, it is intended that the amount will be paid over to his estate.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated he may decide to give the period from June to September. He has not made a final decision in that regard.  It must be accepted that if a councillor is to opt for retirement under the scheme and not be a candidate in the following election, then it is proper that decision be made earlier rather than <Col N="972" /> later in the interests of the organisation who will need to find someone to replace him.  That is reasonable to enable new candidates to get their profile before the public.  As political animals, we know how important it is to have such an opportunity. That is the thinking behind the Minister's announcement.  He will grant a three month period from June to September.  He may vary that but I would not expect him to extend it by much more than he has already indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the explanation given by the Minister.  This is the first time a Government has made any gesture towards the work done by councillors.  We have been looking for this for a long time through the General Council of County Councils.  I proposed this some years ago at a meeting of that body and it has progressed from there.  I compliment the Government for making the first move to recognise people who have done outstanding work on behalf of the public.  As one Senator stated today, sometimes up to 40 hours a week is taken up by this work and these people receive nothing in return.  It interferes with their families and life-styles and those who enjoy public life should be complimented.  Our predecessors did not even get a gold watch for 40 years outstanding service. Now councillors are being recognised for the first time.</P>
      <P>An avenue should be left open in the legislation. Political parties might put a certain amount of pressure on people who should retire to run again.  If those people with long service are defeated there should be a system of awards introduced for them.  This part of the Bill should be examined again.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government for bringing this piece of legislation forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and appreciate what he says.  This is the first time any consideration was given to members of local authorities.  The first step &mdash; legislation &mdash; is always welcome but the next step takes a long time.  The impression in this section is that there is a demand on people.  I do not want to give that impression.  The Minister is right not to do so and I apologise if I am giving that impression.</P>
      <P>There is no recognition for people who will be defeated.  That is unfair.  The Minister should not ask people to make decisions before the end of September.  He should give people some time. People could be greedy.  A person who is prepared to serve another term but is defeated is not recognised.  That is unfair.  To how many people will this happen?  It could be less than 50, and, at an average gratuity of £10,000, that will cost £500,000 or less.  The Minister is undermining this section by not recognising these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the recognition given at long last to county councillors; they are not necessarily getting enough.  No politician does this work for £570 per year for 20 years &mdash; and that is what this £10,000 is worth.  Big deal.  It will be tax free; that <Col N="973" /> is marvellous.  Compare that to the amount now being paid out.  At least the Minister is recognising the loss of a person within the period 1991-9. The estate of any person who died in that time receives the benefit and that is appreciated.  Does a person who lost his or her seat as a junior Minister receive the benefit?  I would appreciate it if some recognition could be given to people who stand.  What happens to a person who is elected and is in an accident three days after the election? They receive no recognition.</P>

The devil is in the detail and that will unfold in the months to come.</P>
      <P>Subsections (3)(c) and (10) give the Minister latitude in the context of how the scheme will be set up and to whom it will apply.  Has the Minister or his Department given any thought to spouses of members who were elected in 1991, died in office and the spouse was subsequently nominated to fill that vacancy?  Will the gratuity apply to the spouses?  In most cases the spouses are women without income.  On humanitarian if not legal grounds there is a strong case for the gratuity concept to be extended to members in that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1991 elections were for county councils and county boroughs while the 1994 elections were for the other authorities.  When we refer to 1991, we mean 1991-4.  If a councillor had been a member of a local authority for more than five years, was a candidate in the last election in 1991 or 1994 and subsequently died but would have had an entitlement under this gratuity scheme if they were alive, the gratuity to which they would have been entitled up to the time of their death will be paid to their estate.  Everybody, except Senator Mooney, understands this. This is a very generous measure.</P>
      <P>This gratuity is a once-off scheme and was introduced into this local government funding Bill which became a mechanism for this gratuity. To qualify for the scheme or the gratuity, a councillor must have served a period subsequent to the last local elections &mdash; June 1991 for county and city councils and June 1994 for town, borough and urban district councils and town commissioners &mdash; and must also satisfy minimum service requirements and must have served five years, as specified in the scheme.  The scheme will specify a period for making applications to the local authority for a gratuity.  The Minister mentioned June to September 1998 as the possible period, but that is not finalised.</P>
      <P>The local authority will issue written notification to a person that they qualify for the gratuity and inform them of the amount.  The scheme will specify that if a person stands for election to any local authority in 1999 the decision to grant the gratuity will stand revoked.  The scheme will provide that the gratuity is payable following the June 1999 local elections.  The Act provides that where a person has been paid a gratuity and subsequently becomes a member of any local authority, he should pay over the amount of the gratuity. If they fail to do so, the local authority will cease expenses and other payments until the amount of the gratuity is recovered.</P>
      <P>The effect on dual members &mdash; town and county members &mdash; is as follows.  The gratuity will be calculated and paid by the county which will aggregate service with the urbans for concurrent service and the more favourable result will apply. If the person does not stand for any local authority in June 1999, then the gratuity becomes payable. If the person stands for any local authority, the decision to grant stands revoked.</P>
      <P>Persons who are currently Ministers or Ministers of State will not be eligible for a gratuity. However, service by previous Ministers or Ministers of State, who were elected to a local authority in 1991 or 1994, will qualify them for the payment of the gratuity.  I see a smile on Senator Avril Doyle's face.</P>

I <Col N="975" /> understand what he said in relation to the elected member.  However, I need to contextualise this matter.  The person I have in mind was a member of my local authority and died three months after the 1991 local elections.  His wife was subsequently nominated to fill the vacancy.  The Minister has clarified that the estate of the member, who died and who had been a long standing member with well in excess of five years' service, will receive the gratuity from the date of the commencement of his tenure to the time he died.  All I wished to have confirmed was whether his wife, who is a member of the council since September 1991 and who will more than likely retire, would in turn be entitled to a gratuity in her own right. I am sorry for being specific but it was necessary in order to clarify the matter.  This has happened in many other local authorities.  We are <i>ad idem</i> on this matter but I wanted to put it on the record.</P>

      <P>This is a significant Bill, although this is only part of the process.  I was interested to hear Senator Cregan refer to my involvement for many years and it is true that I produced the first document for the reform of local government in 1971.  It is remarkable to notice the warm reception among councillors, in particular, and the public for the idea of modernising and improving the local government system and devolving more functions to local authorities giving them a solid funding base and making some changes in the structure within which they operate.</P>
      <P>There was deep suspicion in 1971 when I went on similar grounds to those the Minister has gone. I visited the nine regions to explain the proposals and there was a suspicion that we were proposing something which might undermine the situation which obtained.  At the time there was general acceptance of what was required and that what was proposed were improvements.  Looking back, it is sad it has taken so long, from the early 1970s to the late 1990s, to achieve the levels of reform about which we are talking.  It has been a long and slow process.</P>
      <P>Europe has moved ahead in reforming its local government system which is stronger than ours and has a greater constitutional role in the governance of many European Union countries. The proposals made 20 or 25 years ago are now becoming a reality; this makes me very happy.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to stand in for the Minister to deal with this important Bill.  I hope it will lay down a solid foundation for the future funding of local government and give local authorities greater discretion in terms of spending and the projects they wish to undertake within their areas.  That has been a great difficulty since prior to 1983.</P>

      <P>I asked to raise on the Adjournment the implications of the exclusion of Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme courses from the newly launched back to education scheme and I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to do so.  Everyone welcomes the Minister's initiative in providing the new back to education scheme.  The scheme reads very well and I wish it every success.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned, as are many adult educators, that this new scheme will create an unequal playing field between the VTOS centres and other course providers.  Students now on VTOS courses will receive fewer benefits and it will not be financially attractive to them to attend VTOS courses once they can chose the back to education allowance scheme.  This would be a great pity as VTOS programmes are the only courses specifically designed to cater for the individual needs of the long-term unemployed.  That is most important.</P>

The courses are unique in offering life skills, study skills and personal development as an integral part of second chance education.  We all know that VTOS has a track record second to none, especially in the areas of personal gain, academic achievement and employment.  I do not have to bring to the Minister's attention the recent publications by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs entitled <i>Every</i>thing to Gain and <i>College Knowledge</i> and the Department of Education and Science book entitled <i>VTOSpell Success.</i></P>
      <P>For over 12 years VTOS staff and centres have developed a wide range of skills and expertise in the area of second chance education for the long-term unemployed.  The teachers have participated in numerous in-service training programmes specific to the needs of VTOS students and the needs of the long-term unemployed.  VTOS centres have built up resources appropriate to the labour market needs in their local areas.  They have established good reputations and built networks within their local communities.</P>
      <P>This new scheme, good as it is, will direct students away from VTOS.  This would appear to be a shocking waste of expense, resources and established networks.  In effect, it would appear to be a case of reinventing the wheel.  Many view it as regressive in the sense that 12 years of VTOS courses at VTOS centres would be lost.  New courses would start again at the beginning.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate to penalise VTOS students and to further marginalise them by excluding them from the benefits of the back to education allowance scheme.  I strongly urge the Minister to use his influence to take whatever steps he can to ensure parity of payment and conditions for students on VTOS courses with those on the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> To compare the two schemes, the BTE allowance scheme offers the maximum standard rate of payment whereas VTOS payments to students are means tested.  The BTE allowance scheme offers students a £150 grant in September for books and other necessary items whereas VTOS offers no additional money in September or at any other time of the year.  The BTE allowance scheme allows students to work to supplement their payment whereas VTOS students are means tested for holiday and part-time work.  The BTE allowance scheme has no time limit whereas VTOS students are allowed a maximum of two years on their course; and the BTE allowance scheme has no cap on the number of lone parents, people with disabilities and other categories whereas the VTOS schemes have a 10 per cent cap on such students.  While I welcome the back to education allowance scheme it should not discommode or discourage those attending VTOS at present, given the enormous work VTOS has done for the long-term unemployed in so many local communities.  Will the Minister try to resolve the apparent inequity between the two schemes?</P>
    <P>VTOS is now paid by the Department of Education and Science, and that includes an ESF grant.  Could students on VTOS schemes be paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the same way as those on the back to education allowance scheme or could the Minister ensure that the Department of Finance would sanction an increase for VTOS payments through the Department of Education and Science to ensure a parity of payment and benefit between students attending both VTOS and the back to education allowance scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for giving me the opportunity to clarify a number of matters.  I have sympathy with her comments.  VTOS, which is administered by my Department, is a separate scheme from the back to education allowance scheme operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The recently launched Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs publication <i>Back to Education Programmes,</i> which contains details of both schemes, was produced solely as an information document on the education programmes available to unemployed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VTOS scheme was established in 1989 as a special initiative designed to cater for the education and training needs of the long term unemployed. Participants in the scheme receive a training allowance equivalent to their social welfare entitlement had they remained on the live register. They are also paid travel, where they reside more than three miles from the centre, and meal allowances.  The courses provided under the scheme are free of charge.  There is no charge for books or course materials.  To enable participants <Col N="979" /> achieve the set goals, VTOS provides a supportive learning environment that enables them develop their talents, improve their quality of life and make informed choices about further education, training and employment.</P>
    <P>VTOS participants do not constitute a homogenous group.  Variables include age, social class, educational background, labour market experience and family status.  In practice, however, unemployed people, especially the long-term unemployed, tend to share certain characteristics, such as low skills of educational attainment, poor or outdated occupational skills, discontinuity in their labour market history, or, in the case of people under 25 years of age, no experience or limited experience of paid work.</P>
    <P>The provision of appropriate educational and vocational preparation experience for such diverse groups is a major challenge to providers. VTOS has been underpinned by a belief in the right of access of adults to a provision that meets their needs.  In effect, VTOS is an umbrella scheme rather than a specific programme or course.  It is an enabling mechanism, a series of structured education-led, work-related opportunities which enable participants to continue their education and vocational training.</P>
    <P>Apart from the educational aspect, the majority of participants obtain personal and social benefits, such as improved social confidence and motivation as a result of their participation in the scheme.  In providing a second chance for participants to acquire an educational or training qualification, VTOS offers an important pathway back to employment or further training opportunities.  It is regarded as a significant policy intervention in these areas and it is generally agreed that the scheme has proved to be a huge success, as the Senator has acknowledged. The progress statistics for 1997 shows that approximately 74 per cent of the people who have completed the course went on to either employment or further education-training.</P>
    <P>In its overall evaluation of the 1988-93 community support framework, the Economic and Social Research Institute described the VTOS programme as a high quality programme which attempts to provide a bridge back into the education and training system for the long term unemployed.  The report argued that a significantly higher rate of economic return could be achieved for measures that add an educational or training component to interventions for the unemployed.  The National Economic and Social Council's report <i>Education and Training Policies for Economic and Social Development, 1993</i> endorsed the role of VTOS.  The report on the evaluation of the scheme, which was carried out by WRC Social and Economic Consultants and was published in 1996, was also very positive.</P>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, the VTOS scheme is meeting real needs in an effective manner and it is important that this successful approach be supported and developed.  This will include taking <Col N="980" /> account of any factors which would tend to affect or reduce the attraction of the scheme <i>vis-à-vis</i> other similar schemes.  In this context I assure the Senator and the House I am concerned that the recently emerged disparity in training allowances between VTOS and the back to education allowance scheme of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs could have serious implications for VTOS.  Certainly, the feedback from the providers is that it is an issue of major concern.  I will be concerned, therefore, to ensure that the allowance rates for VTOS be brought into line with those applying in the parallel scheme and my Department is in ongoing discussion with the Department of Finance on this matter.  I hope the issue can be resolved satisfactorily in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.  He is here to respond to my matter which was transferred to the Department of Enterprise and Employment but he is also a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The circle has been squared to a certain degree in that I have managed to get the right man, although he might be here for the wrong reasons.</P>
      <P>Unscrupulous US companies are advertising in Irish newspapers and on the Internet inviting Irish citizens to send large sums of money in return for a service which could easily be availed of free of charge.  The US State Department has announced the DV 2000 registration period is scheduled to begin at noon Eastern Standard Time on 1 October 1998 and close at noon on 31 October 1998.</P>
      <P>Some of the advertisements contain misleading and inaccurate information on this new lottery round for visa applications.  They highlight the availability of 55,000 visas and seek an application fee of £50 to £70.  Under the DV 99 programme only 50,000 visas were available and were distributed to selected nations around the world.  The essential point is that there is no application fee for a diversity visa lottery.  A number of individuals contacted by these visa services have been asked to go to the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service to be fingerprinted.  Fingerprints were not required for the DV 99 registrations which have just been completed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we can expect to see more of these advertisements in Irish newspapers and on the Internet in the coming weeks as the US State Department has recently announced the DV 99 notification process has begun.  I wish to distinguish between the DV 99 process, where the application process has finished and the notification process is about to begin, and the DV 2000 lottery visa process which begins in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lottery visa winners &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;winners&rdquo; advisedly &mdash; in Africa are currently being notified.  This will be followed by notification of <Col N="981" /> winners in Asia and then Europe, including Ireland.  It is expected that roughly 1,000 Irish winners will be selected.  As a receipt of notification does not guarantee a DV 99 visa and since there are only 50,000 available &mdash; a reduction by 5,000 on previous years &mdash; I suggest the lucky 1,000 should respond as soon as possible after they are notified.  Unsuccessful lottery applicants will not receive any notice of the failure of their names to be drawn in the lottery and, if they are still intent on seeking green cards, will wish to be included in the DV 2000 lottery, registration for which commences in October.</P>
    <P>I also wish to take this opportunity to warn those who have been living in the US as undocumented illegal aliens for 180 days or more that they could face a three or ten year bar to re-entry to the US if they return to Dublin for the visa interviews.  I am interested in the Minister's views on this issue.  It is important to remember that since a successful DV 99 applicant must take up residency in the US upon receiving a green card, those who face a three or ten year bar have little chance of legalising their status; in other words, to use an American term, it is a double whammy.</P>
    <P>Undocumented illegals in the US who were among the lucky 1,000 under the DV 99 process will have to return to Dublin to be interviewed at the US consular office.  Green card applicants will be asked at the interview to document where they have been living since 1 April 1997.  The comprehensive list of documents required includes tax returns, wage stubs, employers' statements, airline boarding passes, old passports, medical records, school diplomas or transcripts, Government assistance receipts &mdash; i.e., social welfare receipts &mdash; where relevant and public utility bills such as ESB and Telecom Éireann bills.</P>
    <P>The three or ten year bar will only apply when the person leaves the US and attempts to re-enter. Some people have left the US and returned by presenting fraudulent documents but in so doing they are committing visa fraud which could have an adverse effect on their ever gaining legal status in the US.  Ironically, one of the few options open to those who want to gain legal status, having been living undocumented in the US for years, is through marriage to a US citizen - not that I am encouraging full blooded Irish males to suddenly rush out and find a suitable American mate in order to establish legal status.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State has a long term interest in this area.  I suggest that, due to the far-reaching changes in US legislation over the past 18 months, DV applicants who receive notice of selection should call their local Irish immigration centre for information on how to proceed.  For example, I have been made aware by my friends in the excellent Boston immigration centre that they received a call within the past two months from a family who have been living in Florida for the past 18 years as undocumented aliens, not because they did not wish to be documented because they had fallen through the system.  They <Col N="982" /> unsuccessfully applied for every visa initiative over the past 18 years.  Their children are attending American schools and they are integrated into American society.  However, because of the changes in US legislation which affect their social welfare and other documents, they are now afraid they will be deported as illegal aliens.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will have a humanitarian response to this situation.  In addition to addressing the question of fraudulent advertisements and the scam being operated by unscrupulous people trying to take money from Irish people for a service which is not legally required, the Minister of State might also indicate how the ongoing problem of illegals living in the US who wish to be regularised might be resolved. It is desperately unfair that if such people are successful in a visa lottery they could be debarred from re-entering the US if they return to Ireland to legalise their status.  That would cause great trauma to people who have settled in the US and integrated into that society.  While this debate is an opportunity to convey important information on the visa application process, it is also an opportunity for the Minister of State to respond accordingly.  I am grateful to him for taking the time to come here.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for raising these two issues.  I am very aware of his work for and with emigrants over the years.  We have been involved in many campaigns over those years.  I will deal first with the question of misleading advertisements in Irish newspapers, as Minister of State with responsibility for Consumer Affairs, and I will then be glad to comment on the issue of illegals in the US.</P>
      <P>Consumers are entitled to be satisfied that information provided by way of advertisement is truthful and accurate.  Our determination to protect consumers from misleading advertising is reflected in the laws and regulations governing this issue.  Under section 8 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, it is an offence to advertise the provision of a service if it is likely to mislead the public to a material degree.  Misleading advertising is also prohibited under the European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988, which implemented a Council directive on misleading advertising.</P>
      <P>Under the Act and the regulations the Director of Consumer Affairs is empowered to prosecute persons for such offences.  The penalty for summary conviction under the Act is a fine of up to £500 or six months imprisonment or both.  The penalty for conviction on indictment is a fine of up to £10,000 or two years imprisonment or both. The regulations also provide for penalties on conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the that Director's office will investigate any complaints in the area of misleading advertising and I ask the Senator to make available to the director any information <Col N="983" /> and documentation in his possession.  The Director regularly receives and investigates complaints regarding the general issue of advertising. In 1997, over 650 such complaints were received.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Director's office that he has not received any complaints in the recent past regarding advertisements which offer a service to prospective emigrants to the US.  It is, therefore, important that information is furnished to him as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Senator is aware that the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland was established by the advertising industry to promote, by way of self-regulation, the highest standards of commercial advertising and to enforce the code of advertising standards.  Complaints received by the authority will be investigated.</P>
    <P>Information about possible fraudulent activity should be passed on to the Garda authorities.  The Senator may wish to bring such information at his disposal to the authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> The Senator also mentioned the broader issue of illegal immigrants and people who wish to regularise their position.  I share the Senator's concern about the position in which these people find themselves.  As a former Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs, I am aware of the humanitarian support given over the years by the US Embassy staff to people who found themselves in difficulty.</P>
    <P>I encourage young people who are in difficulty to use the services available from our staff abroad.  Although the services are stretched, the staff have always been helpful in individual cases of difficulty.  As the Senator pointed out, there are also various support groups and emigration centres abroad which can help.  I find the case put forward by the Senator most worrying and disturbing. I assure him that I will raise his concerns with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask him and his Department to respond in the speediest manner possible to points raised.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 June 1998.</P>
