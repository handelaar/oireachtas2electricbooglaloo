      <P>The Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 14, motion No. 21.  Item 1, Second Stage to be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; Senators may share time.  Item 2, Statements on the Review of the Seanad, to be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. with the contributions of Leaders not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; Senators may share time.  This item will not conclude today.  Item 14, motion No. 21, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Item 1, Second Stage to be continued at 8 p.m. if not previously concluded.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. We are on the eve of the important elections to the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  We wish those taking part in this important democratic process well in the interests of future peace, stability and reconciliation.  We should have a debate on Northern Ireland when the elections are completed. All sides would support this &mdash; a debate is long overdue and we have been patient by not seeking one for some time.</P>
      <P>When can we expect legislation on the release of prisoners?  Yesterday Senator Costello asked for a debate on the Murphy report.  The Fine Gael Party supports such a debate before the end of the session.  Will the Leader give a commitment in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a debate on press standards in the light of the disturbing photograph which appeared in <i>The Star</i> newspaper this morning?  I listened with interest this morning to Dr. McKeon, the chairman of AWARE, a group which deals with depression and suicide.  He gave his professional opinion which is substantiated by a great deal of research, that the publication of such a photograph can lead to copycat suicides and add to the distress of relatives.  I also heard the editor of the newspaper and it seemed plain that the photograph was published for purely <Col N="214" /> commercial purposes.  He did not identify any criteria for its publication.  He knew nothing of the circumstances of the young man, whose family may have had to identify him from that photograph. As the examination of suicide by both Houses of the Oireachtas started in this House with the initiation of a Bill supported by all parties, it is appropriate that we discuss this and related matters.</P>
      <P>When will the Bill promised by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, in the other House concerning the broadcasting of sports events and the restricting of control in the media by individuals and corporations come before the House?  It is important that we play a role in this discussion as a debate in this House prompted the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, to make a substantial reply which formed the basis of the Labour Party's proposed legislation which the Government did not accept.</P>
      <P>I was sad to hear that a large section of the Department of Education and Science burned down.  However, I was relieved to learn it was not the identical twin building, Tyrone House, which is an extremely important building architecturally. The original inhabitants were rather unpleasant &mdash; John Beresford, who in 1798, 200 years ago practically to the day, organised his own police force to go out and snatch people. They were tortured in the basement and a Dublin wit wrote on the front gate &ldquo;J.  Beresford &mdash; mangling done here&rdquo;.  Despite that, I am glad the house survived.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland, especially on the eve of the historic elections to the Assembly. It is appropriate that we should have that debate before the summer.  The Leader said yesterday that he would consult the Whips and come back to us today.</P>
      <P>In the light of the publication of that terrible photograph on the front page of a newspaper this morning we need to look into the question of press standards.  We debated the office of the Insurance Ombudsman last week.  We need a media ombudsman with proper criteria and regulations in terms of non-interference with their duty.  That photograph seems to have been published for blatant voyeurism and commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>I move an amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That motion No. 22 be taken as the first item on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been raised on a number of occasions and it is not good enough that we should wait until the autumn to have a debate. This is a pressing matter.  The Murphy inquiry has taken place and permission has been given for the publication of the report.  The Minister has been asked by all sides to take urgent action.  If we are <Col N="215" /> to assist in the process, that debate should take place before the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope the elections in Northern Ireland tomorrow will help to consolidate the progress made by the Agreement and the stability and peace which has been evident in recent months.  A debate on progress in Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations would be useful and I support the calls for such a debate.</P>
      <P>As regards the picture published in <i>The Star</i> this morning, the defence of the newspaper was that its publication was worthwhile as it might stop a suicide.  However, having heard the expert opinion of Dr. McKeon from AWARE on the radio this morning, it seems that the publication of the picture will result in more suicides.  Did <i>The Star</i> make any effort to consult expert advice before publishing the picture?  It seems that it was published for sensationalist reasons as part of a circulation war, which is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Newspaper standards are falling rapidly &mdash; once it was regarded as unacceptable to take pictures of mourners at funerals and now it is acceptable to publish pictures of dead bodies.  We must all condemn that.  It would be useful to return to this subject in the context of a debate on broadcasting and press standards.  Senator Costello is correct in stating that there should be some recourse for the public and interested parties in the form of a sanction system.</P>

      <P>As one who has consistently sought the assistance of the Tánaiste in the provision of industry in Killarney and South Kerry, I welcome the announcement, following the meeting between the Tánaiste and Rosenbluth International in Philadelphia yesterday, of the provision of 250 jobs for Killarney.  I pay tribute to the entrepreneurship and negotiating skills of the people of Killarney who were so successfully involved in meeting executives over a long period. As one who was closely involved in negotiations and in securing the site at the former Kerry Glass factory, I welcome the announcement. I wish the IDA well in the renewed negotiations to secure an industry for the vacant Pretty Polly factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in asking for a debate on the North of Ireland on the grounds that over the past number of years people in public life have played a low key role on this side of the Border.  Particularly in this House, we have refrained from debating the <Col N="216" /> North of Ireland during the past six months. There are signs of political maturity in the North at the moment and a debate in the House would be useful because the potential for development, especially in the tourism area, is fantastic.  The southern Border counties and the North of Ireland have suffered serious deprivation.  Those areas do not have any tourism structures at all. While other parts may have benefited from the Celtic tiger, we can only make a useful contribution towards the future in the North by having a full and open debate in this House.  I support the request for such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business.  One of my reasons for supporting Senator Costello is because, like many people, I have a child who is involved in competitive swimming.  One can get close to cold sweats thinking about this matter. There is a related issue I wish to raise, as one who is still an active member of the institution.  There is another big private institution in this State which has a dubious record in terms of how it has handled child abuse and that is the Roman Catholic Church.  It seems to me that since it has so much influence in our society, there is a case to be made for society examining the way that institution has dealt with the problems that arose within it.  Members of our society who freely choose to be involved with that Church should be sure, in the same way as members of our society who are involved in swimming should be sure, that their children are safe and that those who are in positions of authority take the problem seriously.  If the institutions themselves cannot do it, then society and the State will have to do it for them.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader allow us to have a debate on inequality in society as soon as possible?  It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Government parties are determined to make inequality as great as possible, given the outburst by the Tánaiste last week.  She has apparently decided that if she cannot kick the rich and powerful she will kick the poor instead.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues in their assertions of distaste over the publication in <i>The Star.</i>  This newspaper does not operate on its own; it is part of the biggest newspaper group in the State.  It is the duty of that newspaper group, not just of that individual newspaper, to ensure that standards are met throughout the newspaper industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments of other Senators in relation to media standards.  A more fundamental issue, however, is the problem of suicide in society which appears to affect people of all ages.  We should have a discussion about what we can do to assist in efforts to reduce the number of suicides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish every success to the pro-Agreement candidates in the Northern Assembly elections tomorrow.  I hope the people who gave a resounding <Col N="217" /> yes vote last month will come out in full force again for the elections tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed concerning suicides.  I would ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Government suicides of young Irish emigrants abroad who are tragically dying by their own hand.  It is essential for the Government to introduce immediately a comprehensive plan to inform emigrants, particularly to the United States and England, of the helplines available to them in those countries.  I am talking in particular about the excellent work the Catholic Church and other Churches are doing in those countries.</P>
      <P>A number of our emigrants are exploited commercially in some of these countries, particularly illegal emigrants who have no avenue of assistance. Information leaflets indicating where emigrants could obtain help, should be available at every Irish port and airport, as well as being included in the publications of Aer Lingus and other transport companies.</P>

      <P>The situation warrants a serious debate on the basis that it is a reflection of a changing and prosperous society.  Some people certainly feel it difficult to work within those changes.  It merits a debate in order to see if we can help in any way to make people more at ease within a changing and developing society.</P>
      <P>In the context of a just society, we should look at the Government's proposals in relation to rural development.  There is talk of a White Paper on the rural development programme and it should be dealt with by the Government.  Will the Leader of the House invite the relevant Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House to discuss the importance of that White Paper and his plans to develop its contents?</P>

      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning and others for a debate on Northern Ireland. I wish all the pro-Agreement candidates well tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I find there has been <Col N="218" /> very little change in the North of Ireland over the past few months, particularly in relation to the actions of the security forces.  I would refer, in particular, to the long delays experienced by people going to the match last Sunday.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the charges that have now been proffered against a number of young men in the Portadown area &mdash; nearly a year after the events took place at Garvahy Road &mdash; including a brother of Robert Hamill who, as we all know, was murdered last year in Portadown.  I attended a vigil ceremony in Portadown on the occasion of the anniversary of his death.  I met the young man in question and was in the family home.  I am more than perturbed to see that a year later some movement has taken place.</P>
      <P>With regard to the commission that has been set up to review the events of Bloody Sunday, I abhor the lack of movement and particularly the lack of legal representation being given to the families of the victims.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Dardis, McGowan and Bonner all called for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I am pleased to inform the House that on the Order of Business next Tuesday I propose to make time available for such a debate.</P>
      <P>I join with other Senators in calling on people in the North of Ireland for a massive turnout, the same as we saw for the previous referendum. That would bring about change in the best possible way.  It is timely to have a debate on Northern Ireland and, in calling for this debate, I thank all Members of the House for their co-operation and understanding in recent months.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and others called for an indication in relation to legislation on the early release of prisoners.  This Bill will be before the House next week and will have completed all Stages by Friday next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello, along with other Senators, requested a debate on the Murphy report.  I would like to meet Senators Costello and Ryan after the Order of Business to discuss when we can debate this issue.  I would like to allow as much time as possible to debate this urgent and important report. Many Senators have expressed a wish to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Norris and others have expressed shock and horror at the photograph published in today's edition of <i>The Star.</i>  Irish newspapers have hit a new low.  It is an horrific photograph.  I will facilitate a debate on the decline of press standards at the earliest opportunity and request the Minister to attend.  It is time we considered the urgent need for a press council to be put in place. <Col N="219" /> The photograph does nothing to alleviate the massive suicide problem we have at the moment. I cannot comprehend how publishing this photograph could make sense.  The professional advice given on the early morning interviews on Radio Éireann indicated that this could lead to more people taking their own lives.  <i>The Star</i> should apologise and state they will never publish a photograph like this again.  It would show the general public and people contemplating suicide that they will not get publicity in this way again. Senators Leonard, O'Dowd and Chambers also referred to the article in <i>The Star.</i></P>
    <P>Senators called for a debate on the televised broadcasting of sporting events.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will bring forward a Bill before both Houses in the next session to deal with this issue.  Late last night she made a statement in this regard as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan welcomed the 250 new jobs in Killarney.  This is as a result of the good work done by this Government, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment along with the Deputies and Senators of that constituency.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on equality in our society.  I will try to facilitate such a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd called for a helpline to be established at the port of arrival for our young emigrants.  This can be done by way of a letter to the Minister.  I am pleased to support Senator O'Dowd's request for a helpline.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke requested an early debate on education.  Yesterday, on the Order of Business, I stated that we will debate this issue in the first two or three weeks of the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Chambers called for a debate on rural development.  The Western Development Bill is at an advanced stage.  Perhaps Senator Chambers can check out a lot of his points on the Urban Renewal Bill which is going through at present.

    <Title>Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, 1998:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to come before the Seanad today to present the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, 1998.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a statutory body to be known as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which will have full responsibility for all food safety and hygiene matters. This honours the Government's commitment on food safety as outlined in the Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>Since taking office this Government has attached particular importance to the issue of food safety generally and to the concerns of consumers in particular.  It recognises the need for uncompromised and independently verifiable assurances on food safety to ensure consumer confidence.  While the primary purpose of the Bill is the protection of consumers, the Government also recognises that one of the best ways of promoting the entire Irish food sector is to put in place a strong, independent and science-based Food Safety Authority, which will have the confidence of consumers both at home and abroad. The provisions of this Bill will not only contribute to public health but will also serve the economic development of the Irish food sector.</P>
      <P>Food scares are nothing new.  For many years we have been warned about the dangers of using unpasteurised milk, the need for proper hygiene in the home and have been advised on the proper cooking of food.  Then along came BSE and the possibility of a link with new variant CJD.  Consumer faith in our food industry to produce safe wholesome food was severely undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As if BSE was not enough, E-coli 0157 claimed the lives of a number of elderly people in Scotland. If we add in the threats caused by drug-resistant salmonella strains, antibiotic residues in pork, angel dust and other illegal growth promoters, it is little wonder that consumers treat vague reassurances with scepticism.  Other concerns have been voiced in relation to new crop developments and food processes, such as the increasing availability of genetically modified foods and food irradiation.  Let us be very clear about this, consumers are very concerned about food safety and it behoves any Government to listen to and respond appropriately to these concerns. Let me assure the House that this Government will not be found wanting in this regard. The protection of public health is an absolute priority for me, as it is for all my colleagues in Government.  Any threat to the safety of the food we eat, whether it be real or potential, will be responded to robustly and with transparency.  It is therefore imperative that we have a structure in place that can adequately identify and assess the risk in a competent professional manner and <Col N="221" /> then communicate clearly and effectively with both consumers and providers. ln November 1996 the previous Government appointed an interim Food Safety Authority on a non-statutory basis, and then proceeded to draft a Bill to put this Authority on a statutory footing. The thrust of the proposed Bill was to establish the Authority as a &ldquo;regulator of regulators&rdquo;&mdash; that is, responsibility for food control services would remain with existing agencies, but these would be audited by the Authority which would have a role in the setting and maintaining of standards and the promotion of good practice. Despite numerous promises, that Bill had not been published prior to the 1997 general election.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government outlined its plans, we in Opposition vigorously opposed them &mdash; not for the sake of opposition in itself, but because we strongly felt that the proposals were wholly inadequate.  What we would have had would be a toothless body supervising the same old agencies carrying on their business in the same old way, despite the fact that everyone recognised the need for a fresh approach to food safety.  The only new element proposed by the previous Government was that the Food Safety Authority would have an audit function, but this in our view fell far short of the radical change and imaginative solution which is required.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to convey the impression that the existing State agencies responsible for food controls have not done a fine job in the past.  I fully acknowledge the commitment and professionalism which these agencies have demonstrated in dealing with what is an increasingly complex environment.  However, it is this very complexity which now dictates the requirement for a central authority which will harmonise the State response to the food safety challenge.  The Government believes that the interests of consumers are better served by the creation of an Authority which will be directly accountable for all food control functions. As pointed out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this new Authority will take over all current functions related to food safety from existing agencies and will be independent, science based and provide for full &ldquo;farm to fork&rdquo; traceability.  This Bill has all the features which were identified in the action programme, with the exception of the immediate transfer of staff from the existing agencies to the Authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain to the House the rationale behind this adjustment to our original proposal. Responsibility for food controls currently rests with a wide number of Departments and agencies and it is delivered by a broad range of disciplines.  In all some 50 State agencies and many hundreds of staff are currently involved in the delivery of food control services.  Furthermore, it is not uncommon for such staff to have other duties, in addition to food controls, assigned to them.  It is not possible, therefore, to definitely identify &ldquo;food control&rdquo; staff individually. In view of this, the transfer of all relevant staff from existing agencies to the new authority <Col N="222" /> will take some time and will only take place after detailed discussion and agreement with staff representative bodies.  The Bill will, therefore, provide the Authority with the capacity to discharge its functions by way of contractual agreements. These agreements, or service contracts as they are described in section 48 of the Bill, will be agreed between the Authority and the State agencies in relation to the wide range of food safety functions contained in existing legislation.  Lists of this legislation and the State agencies involved are included in the Schedules to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Each service contract will include the targets and objectives which the Authority wishes the agency to meet and the time frame within which these must be achieved.  Existing funding arrangements will be maintained, that is, the agencies will make the resources available to meet their contractual obligations.  The Authority will publish details of the contracts and will introduce a system of monitoring to ensure that the agreements are being adhered to.  If contracts are not satisfactorily performed the Authority will report to the Minister for Health and Children, who will arrange for such reports to be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 49 of the Bill provides for the appointment of authorised officers to carry out statutory food safety functions and these officers will be furnished with an official warrant issued by the Authority, or by the official agency on its behalf. I have already established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on an interim basis by way of Statutory Instrument under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, with effect from 1 January 1998.  This arrangement was put in place to allow the Authority to recruit staff and to facilitate the development of structures in advance of the Bill being enacted.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the Authority, as outlined in section 12, will be to promote, encourage and foster high standards of safety and hygiene at all stages of the food chain from primary production to final use by the customer.  A key objective for the Authority will be to bring about acceptance that primary responsibility for the safety of food rests with producers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and caterers.  It is also incumbent on the Authority to encourage a greater awareness among consumers of good food safety and hygiene practices.  Although the provisions of the Bill provide in detail for a policing and enforcement role for the Authority, the Bill's main aim is to foster, through education and promotion, a food safety culture among providers and consumers which characterises the food chain from &ldquo;farm to fork&rdquo;.  The establishment of such a culture will serve public health much better than any system which relies merely on the enforcement of a regulatory régime.  The Authority's role in enforcement is not being neglected and it will carry out, through the contracts negotiated with the agencies, inspections, approval, licensing and registration of food premises and equipment.  It <Col N="223" /> will also be responsible for the sampling and analysis of food and inspection of food labelling.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain full traceability, the Authority's remit will extend to farms, other places of primary production, water treatment plants and any other source of materials used in food production. Indeed, section 30 of the Bill gives the Authority the power to seek reports from any State body on any matter which in its opinion impinges on food safety and to report to the Minister for Health and Children in the matter. This provision is very wide ranging and does not confine the Authority's remit to particular parts of the food chain.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the Authority's involvement, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with food producers' representatives, in the establishment of schemes to protect consumer interests.  These schemes, described in section 13 of the Bill as food safety assurance schemes, will cover the promotion of best practice and preparation of guidelines on raw materials, processing, packaging, preparation, storage and handling.</P>
    <P>While the formulation of national food safety policy will remain with my Department, I foresee the Authority playing a very important role in the formulation of this policy.  As was the case with the Food Safety Advisory Board, which has now been merged with the new Authority, the Government will rely on the professional expertise of the Authority to advise on matters such as nutrition, food technology and industrial practices and the cultivation of food plants and animals. This advisory role, outlined in section 15 of the Bill, will also extend to issues such as food labelling and packaging and the very important area of improving systems for the communication of information to the public on food safety and hygiene in the home.  The National Disease Surveillance Unit, which will have primary responsibility in relation to food-borne diseases, will also maintain a liaison with the Authority in this area.</P>
    <P>Much thought has been given to the structure of the Authority and the segregation of powers and responsibilities to ensure that the Authority can discharge its functions in a fair and balanced way.  This has been achieved by making specific provisions in Part III of the Bill for four key, interlocking elements &mdash; the board of the Authority, its scientific committee, the chief executive and staff and a consultative council.  The board of the Authority, as detailed in section 31, will consist of ten members, including a chairman appointed by the Minister for Health and Children. This body will have overall responsibility for ensuring that the proper food safety systems are in place and will act as the forum in which the work of the various structural elements are harmonised.  It will provide the strategic direction for the Authority.  The chief executive, together with the staff, will be responsible for converting this strategy into an operational plan and overseeing its implementation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> Section 34 of the Bill also provides for a scientific committee.  This will have 15 members appointed by the Minister in consultation with the board.  The Minister in appointing members will have regard to relevant scientific qualifications and experience to ensure the broadest possible range of expertise.</P>
    <P>The scientific committee will advise on matters referred to it by the board pertaining to scientific or technical questions, food inspection and nutrition.  In order to guarantee the science based nature of the authority the board will await the scientific committee's response before deciding on any matter referred.  This scientific committee may establish sub-committees to undertake further investigation of matters referred to it, and it will report through its chairman who will also be a member of the board.  The board will be empowered to publish the advice of the scientific committee.  However, I must stress that the role of the scientific committee is to assist and advise the board.  Such assistance and advice will not be the sole determinant in the board's decisions.</P>
    <P>Food safety is a concern for the community as a whole and there will be a duty on the authority to ensure that it has access to a broad base of views.  In promoting higher standards it will be incumbent on the authority to endeavour to consult representatives of a wide range of food safety interests.  Specifically, section 14 of the Bill provides for a broadly based consultative council. The Ministers for Health and Children, Agriculture and Food, the Marine and Natural Resources, the Environment and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the board of the authority will nominate the members of this council.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the consultative council will include representation from various interests &mdash; including producer interests &mdash; and that the authority will have regard to the council's views, it will not be bound by these views in arriving at its decisions.  In its deliberations, the board of the authority will see the best interests of the consumer as being paramount and this notion of the &ldquo;consumer as king&rdquo; will be reflected in the appointment of the board's membership.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, the authority will exercise its powers through its authorised officers who will be empowered to enter and inspect food premises, to secure these premises for later inspection and to inspect and, if necessary, remove records. These officers may take samples of food or related materials and have them analysed.  It will be an offence for any person to obstruct an officer in carrying out this duty.</P>
    <P>Where an authorised officer is of the view that any premises or activity poses a threat to public health, he or she will have the power to dictate the remedial action required and set a time limit for its completion.  These so-called &ldquo;improvement notices&rdquo;, referred to in section 52, are a new feature. While in the past officers could advise on the required improvements to premises or equipment, such advice did not have a statutory basis. <Col N="225" /> Improvement notices, therefore, give food safety professionals in the field a new statutory tool which can be used where there is clear need for some remedial action, but where a complete shutdown of operations may not be warranted.  Where an improvement notice is not complied with, the officer may seek an order from the District Court to force compliance.  In more serious cases where, as provided for in section 53, an officer believes there is an immediate and grave threat to public health, a closure order may be made which will require operations to cease until the problem has been remedied.</P>
    <P>Situations may also arise where improvement notices or closure are not sufficient.  For example, unsafe products or product batches may have been distributed by the producer and be on the market.  In such cases authorised officers may insist on the withdrawal, recall, detention and supervised destruction of products posing a threat to public health as provided for in section 54.  The Bill provides that prosecutions may be taken by the authority or by one of the contracting agencies and the provisions contained in existing food legislation shall continue to apply in that regard.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Bill there is a strong emphasis on the openness and transparency under which the authority will operate.  As provided for in sections 41 and 42, the chief executive, members of the board, the scientific committee and its sub-committees, the staff of the authority and any consultants, advisers or other persons engaged by the authority are required to declare any financial or other beneficial interests which might be in conflict with their role in the authority.  Accountability measures are found elsewhere in the Bill and I have already referred to the publication of the service contracts.</P>
    <P>The authority's accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and laid before the Oireachtas.  The chief executive will be the accounting officer and he or she may be called to give evidence to the appropriate Dáil committee. Under section 25, the authority must prepare an annual report of its activities which will also be made available to the Oireachtas.  The Bill also provides for the preparation and submission of other reports by the authority as the need arises.</P>
    <P>The authority will have a broad remit in the area of research.  Section 18 provides that the authority may undertake, commission or collaborate in research projects and activities on issues relating to food in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    <P>The Dáil debate on the Bill revealed a general agreement from all sides of the House on the importance of food safety and on the value of establishing an independent body to deal with this important area.  Useful and constructive amendments were proposed on a range of issues, some of which, such as the use of gender-neutral terminology and increased transparency in respect of the receipt of gifts by members of the authority, have been incorporated in the text of the Bill.  The sweeping changes proposed in this <Col N="226" /> legislation mirror the change in direction that is taking place at EU level.</P>
    <P>A new Directorate-General &mdash; DG 24 &mdash; has been established within the European Commission with responsibility for consumer policy and consumer health protection.  From now on responsibility for food inspection and control, as well as all the relevant scientific committees that advise on the various scientific aspects of food, will be placed under the authority of the Commissioner for consumer policy and consumer health protection, Ms Emma Bonino.  The Commission's control function for the entire EU is now exercised through the Food and Veterinary Office based in County Meath.  The office's main function is the monitoring of the observance of food hygiene, which is defined in EU legislation as &ldquo;all measures necessary to ensure the safety and wholesomeness of foodstuffs&rdquo;.  A new unit on the assessment of consumer health risks has also been established within DG 24.</P>
    <P>Other EU member states are also taking steps to establish independent food safety bodies on the lines of the authority proposed by the Government.  I am pleased that Ireland is among the first EU countries to have such an authority, reflecting the importance the Government attaches to food safety.  Ireland enjoys a good reputation for the quality of the food it produces for the domestic and export markets.  Similarly, food imported to Ireland is rigorously monitored by way of bilateral and multilateral networks with other countries.</P>
    <P>We owe a considerable debt to our existing food control agencies for the work they have done in the past to ensure that the food we eat is safe.  However, we cannot afford to be complacent and we need new structures to face the challenges which lie ahead.  The enactment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill will provide the framework for the future control and regulation of food safety in Ireland.  We can be proud that we are far ahead of other countries in this regard and that these countries see our proposals as a very useful model.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide the reassurance that consumers seek in the important area of food safety and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed by the Minister of State's initial comments because he gave the impression that the previous Government did not show concern about food safety and that it was lethargic in its efforts to introduce legislation in this area.  An interim food authority was established by the Rainbow Coalition in November 1996.  A draft Bill to be put on a statutory footing was ready for submission before the previous Government left office.  This Bill could have been introduced earlier if the Government had not felt it necessary to oppose the thrust of the draft Bill produced by the previous Government.  The Minister of State should have made reference to the work of the previous Government in this <Col N="227" /> area.  Had the scare in relation to BSE not taken place we might not have this legislation before us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland order was revoked in 1997 culminating in the introduction of this Bill.  It provides for the establishment of the Authority on a full statutory basis from 1 January 1999.  The interim authority will remain in operation until then.</P>
      <P>Much has happened since the first BSE scare in 1996.  Food safety is a consumer priority today. I never gave a thought to food safety in the past. One wonders how we are alive today given our previous lack of concern in this area.  I remember drinking unpasteurised milk as a child.  Taking the cream off the top of the churn and putting it on porridge was part of the course of what we got every morning before going to school.  Nobody questioned if we should do that.  Pasteurisation was relatively new then.  Whether or not we should drink unpasteurised milk has become cause for concern nowadays.</P>
      <P>I was rushed to hospital due to food poisoning on New Year's Day in 1991.  That was the day President Robinson came to Limerick.  The doctor was able to identify that I had food poisoning having eaten deep fried Camembert in a Dublin restaurant which had lain over the Christmas period which it should not have.  I would not like to relive the horrors of those days. I experienced the two ends of the scale &mdash; not having a care and then realising what food poisoning does to the system.  It causes dehydration and resulted in my losing about three to four stone in a couple of days.  Ironically, when I complained to the said restaurant, they replied by inquiring about my health and offering me a voucher for a free meal for two people.  I felt it was the wrong way to deal with my complaint.  I have not darkened the door since.  That incident brought home to me that we are complacent about food safety.  Camembert should not have been left lying around during the interim period after Christmas.  I now understand the importance that must be attached to food safety.</P>
      <P>Food sections of supermarkets are exotic places.  There is a myriad of choice.  Consumers demand high standards and are very much aware of food safety as a result of the many food scares highlighted by the media.  People will remember the shock and horror when Edwina Currie, who has since taken up writing exotic novels, resigned over the famous eggs scandal.  She became known as the &ldquo;Minister for Eggs&rdquo;.  That was the first time the media took on board consumer concerns about the scare.  It was the BSE crisis in 1996 which raised our awareness in relation to food safety and resulted in the low level of consumption of beef.  It remains a concern of beef producing farmers.  While travelling in Britain and Germany recently I saw advertisements in relation to beef traceability still displayed on posters and billboards.  Though the scare is over to a degree, people are still extremely concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> My colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, as Minister for Health, at the time examined the measures in place to secure consumers' health and sought to devise new policies and strategies for the protection of the consumer.  I have done some research in this area.  There is no shortage of rules and regulations both in Irish and European law for maintaining and developing food safety.  Legislation on food safety has been in place since 1887, over 100 years ago.  The Schedule refers to the Margarine Act of 1887.  We are great at introducing laws, whether it be in relation to road safety, pollution control or anti-litter measures, but slow to enforce them.  I would like if the Minister of State had told us more about how the inspectorate will enforce these laws.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have conferences, whether they be on local government or Euro-funding etc.  It is also important that we have conferences in relation to food safety.  Papers submitted at the Teagasc Conference in November 1997 made reference to E-coli 157 contamination of beef which a Teagasc scientist described as a major public health hazard.  We have been very lucky, unlike, as the Minister of State referred to, the outcome in Scotland.  Our contamination problems did not result in human tragedies.  Four hundred and ninety-six people were affected by the outbreak of E-coli in Scotland, including the death of 20 elderly people.  We have a great bond with the Scottish people and what happened there scared us.  Reference was made at the conference to the introduction of regulations banning the sale of dirty animals to meat plants and abattoirs. Perhaps the Minister of State can tell us if that has been put in place.  If it has, it would greatly reduce the risk of contamination by E-coli. This strain of E-coli was only discovered in 1982.  We cannot therefore underestimate the importance of vigilance.</P>
    <P>Three thousand consumers in six different countries surveyed said they now ate less beef as a result of the scare.  I am glad to see that beef is still very much to the fore in our restaurants. Consumers in Ireland have great confidence in our beef.  Consumers in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden were surveyed. We in Ireland were most concerned about meat safety while the British are somewhat less concerned and many consumers are confident that foods in shops are safe.  However, one in three EU consumers believe the contrary.  It is important to take heed of how consumers respond to crises.  While looking for information on meat safety I felt people had tremendous confidence in butchers, whether they were independent or in supermarkets.  They were the people most trusted by consumers.  It was interesting that 60 per cent of beef consumers were very concerned about hormones, BSE, antibiotics, salmonella and other bacteria.  In Spain, Italy and Ireland consumers were concerned about hormones in beef.  Germany and Sweden were concerned with BSE and Britain was most concerned <Col N="229" /> about salmonella.  There are differences on how consumers react to crises in EU countries.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear that EU countries have not been to the fore in relation to food safety.  We are to the fore in this field and I can understand why.  We are very much a food producing country and depend on our agricultural foods.  We are leaders in food safety.</P>
    <P>Of seven factors relating to food safety in beef, pork and chicken, a survey found that consumers regarded freshness as the most helpful indicator, followed by country of origin and what the animal was fed, while price and the name of the producer were regarded as less important.  Another survey of 1,200 pre-leaving certificate students, conducted in 1997, found that 60 per cent of them were eating the same amount of beef as the previous year, 28 per cent were eating less and 7 per cent had stopped eating beef.  As regards those who made statements on food safety, the students had the greatest confidence in doctors &mdash; the next speaker will be glad to hear that &mdash; followed by scientists, Government Departments, teachers and, last of all, farmer representatives.</P>
    <P>Safety consciousness has permeated food companies of all sizes and tremendous emphasis has been placed on it.  Teagasc has called for the development of a national food purity database and I hope the Minister takes that on board. Senator Quinn has provided extremely good food labelling in his supermarkets; he has no shops in Limerick, sadly, but there is tremendous confidence in the origin of the food and vegetables sold in his chain and in the cleanliness and hygiene of the stores.  I look forward to his contribution on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The difference between the Minister's Bill and the legislation which would have been presented by my party, had it continued in Government, concerns the establishment of the authority as a &ldquo;regulator of regulators&rdquo;.  The Minister has taken a roundabout approach because responsibility for food control rests with the many existing agencies. They must have served us well because we had no problems in the past and perhaps they would have continued to do so if we had not suffered the BSE crisis, which caused us to act quickly to establish a food safety authority.  The previous Government proposed that the existing agencies would be monitored and audited by the authority, which would have a direct role in setting and maintaining high standards and promoting good practice.  That approach should have been followed.  The authority would have featured a high level committee, with members from all relevant Departments, which would have reviewed the efficiency of the arrangements in place for the control and supervision of a food production chain.  It would have reviewed existing arrangements, identified problems and suggested organisational or legislative improvements.</P>
    <P>The Government should have placed more emphasis on legislative improvements in this Bill. It would have had the option to establish either a new body to assume the functions of the existing <Col N="230" /> food control bodies or one with the primary role of food safety which would supervise, co-ordinate and control activities carried out by existing bodies. I prefer the &ldquo;regulator of regulators&rdquo; approach because it would have provided a second tier of inspection to supervise the agencies. The Minister said he had confidence in the existing agencies but our scheme would have avoided duplication, and improvements could have been put in place without any major change in the operation of the existing control mechanisms.</P>
    <P>What regulations and safety laws will be put in place?  Does the Minister intend to employ extra staff for food inspection duties?  There is a tremendous need for more people to cope with the heavy workload of existing staff.  The service contracts are cumbersome and provide an extra layer of bureaucracy.  There are some 2,000 personnel, which is a huge number; how does the Minister intend to deal with their transfer from the interim authority to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland proper?  There will have to be trade union discussions.  I am unhappy about the layer of bureaucracy, which means the legislation will take time to implement.</P>
    <P>As with many things, we are reacting to a scare and we might not have had this Bill otherwise. Nonetheless, I welcome it and I hope the Minister takes on board my points about its implementation, especially those concerning the inspectorate, the employment of extra resources and staff and the further legislation he intends to introduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relatively uncontentious Bill because food producers and consumers alike realise the existing legislation is outdated. Some years ago, when food shopping on holiday in the Canary Islands, I noticed a carton of milk which was coloured green and covered with shamrocks and a packet of butter which bore a striking resemblance to Kerrygold.  When I examined the products more carefully I found they had been produced in northern Germany and transported at great expense to the Canaries, but most people would have thought they were Irish goods. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and this shows we have a good name for the quality of our dairy products.  The impression is abroad that we have a green environment so our dairy products and beef should be of high quality.  We are discussing this Bill is to protect that high quality and support our exports at the upper, high value added end of the market and it is only by strict adherence to standards that we will maintain these markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environment in which our foodstuffs have been produced has changed over the years.  BSE, CJD, E-coli, antibiotic residues, angel dust, illegal growth promoters and genetically modified foods have all impinged on the public consciousness. There has also been a revolution in retailing and food production in terms of pre-packed, precooked and other prepared foods.  Our food <Col N="231" /> inspectors cannot confine themselves to checking hygiene in abattoirs, shops and factories &mdash; they must look at the food production chain &ldquo;from farm to fork&rdquo;, as the Minister elegantly put it. This can only be done through rigorous control and strict enforcement of regulations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the wide ranging provisions in the Bill which give the authority discretion to examine not only the food chain but anything which impinges upon it &mdash; water quality, residues, etc. It is vitally important to maintain consumer confidence. The Authority will police and enforce, but it will also educate.  The promotional aspects will be left to Bord Bia.  However, the Authority must, to quote the late President Roosevelt, &ldquo;speak softly but carry a very big stick&rdquo; if it is to be listened to and have power.  I refer again to the Minister of State's commitment to full traceability from farm to fork.  Senator Quinn has been years ahead of us in this area, especially through his butchery departments, which are outstanding examples of how retailing should be carried on.</P>
    <P>This Bill will reinforce the consumers' faith in the quality of food produced, manufactured and retailed.  The Minister of State referred to food produced abroad and intimated that we would depend on the bona fides of food authorities abroad regarding the quality of imported food and their adherence to certain standards.  On the other hand, he stated Ireland will have the first state of the art food safety authority.  Therefore, we would set standards for the rest of Europe and the EU.</P>
    <P>This is a food quality Bill, but the quality of liquids, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, is not mentioned. Will the Food Safety Authority have right of entry to breweries, distilleries and soft drinks factories to check their adherence to standards and will it set standards for them?  I commend the Bill and look forward to debating it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comment that the Government will not be found wanting in regard to consumer concerns about food safety.  The work he has put in and intends to put in is evident in the Bill.  I was excited when I heard in November 1996 that a food safety authority was to be set up.  I heard about it in my car and was contacted by RTÉ to give comment on the news that day.  I was excited that it was to come under the Department of Health.  It is essential that the Authority is driven by consumer interest and there is a doubt about its independence. However, I welcome this move because there is a much better possibility of demonstrating that the Food Safety Authority will be totally independent of Government and vested interests. Other vested interests present a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators Jackman and Fitzpatrick for their kind words about my business.  Senator Jackman referred to the former MP, Edwina Currie, and BSE in Britain.  The cause of her problem was that she sided with the interest of the health <Col N="232" /> of those who bought eggs and not the egg producers. The BSE crisis occurred because short steps were taken in the interest of producers.  It is essential that independence jumps to the forefront. The national interest should not be to the forefront in the short term, even though some individuals will say we are a big food producing country and should preserve the national interest. However, the interest of consumers must be to the fore because that is the national interest in the long term.  We must keep our eyes on the long-term picture.  In arguing from the outset about the perceived independence of the Food Safety Authority, I always stressed that such independence is in the long-term interest of the nation, the food industry itself and the economy.</P>
    <P>Any attempt by the food industry to influence the Authority or to influence the Authority's activities from a political perspective will undermine its value to everybody in the equation.  It is in everybody's long-term interest that the authority is seen to act only in the interest of the consumers of food.  It seems wrong to say we should not take the national interest into account, but this body must take the consumers' interest into account and that in turn takes account of the long-term interest of the country.  If one was an international buyer of Irish food and knew that an individual on the Authority was not Irish &mdash; for example, that he or she was a professor of food science from a European country &mdash; it would add much more credibility to the strength of the board because he or she would act in the interests of the consumer rather than that of the nation. That adds credibility to our food.</P>
    <P>If we lose sight of this cardinal point about consumers in framing this legalisation, the project is doomed and it is important that does not happen. Despite all the talk about the independence of the Authority, that cardinal point has been obscured.  It is easy to forget credibility is the issue and independence is the bedrock of such credibility.  We are left as a result of a Government decision with a super agency approach and our task is to make it work as well as possible in the national interest.  I understand the balance the Government is trying to strike, but consumers must be put to the forefront, which is in the national interest.  There is a great deal of work to be done on Committee Stage and I would welcome an assurance from the Minister of State that regardless of whether the Dáil is in recess, he would be open to taking constructive amendments in this House next week.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that it is a non-contentious Bill and I hope my comments or suggestions are constructive rather than contentious.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline three areas of concern where the Bill compromises the independence of the Food Safety Authority.  They are the scientific committee, the status of the chief executive and the need to make it clear beyond doubt that the Authority exists to act only in the consumer interest.  The scientific committee is vital to the standing of the Authority.  Its work will underpin <Col N="233" /> all pronouncements and policy initiatives that impinge on matters of public concern.  The authority of this committee will be the most important element of the Food Safety Authority's overall credibility.  The perceived independence of this committee is vital.  However, having the Minister appoint the committee is totally incompatible with the perception of independence.  It suggests that the Government wants to control the output of the scientific committee so tightly that it does not even trust the Authority.  It does not even trust it with the task of appointing the committee. It wants to keep a dog and do the barking itself. Nobody would seriously argue that our history of ministerial appointees is without blemish or has never been tainted with the suspicion that political considerations entered into appointments. That is the reality upon which we must build.</P>
    <P>We must not only avoid the possibility of future Government interference but also any possible suspicion of it.  We will not address the problem by providing that the Minister will consult with the Authority before making these appointments, although I know those words are always used.  To be blunt about it, the scientific committee will have more standing if it is appointed by the Authority than by a future Minister; in fact, its standing will be undermined if it is appointed by a Minister.  It is in everyone's interest that the scientific committee has the maximum possible standing.</P>
    <P>There is nothing personal about my remarks in this regard.  I was the chairman of a State body which had six Ministers over a four year period. I am not talking, therefore, about this or even the next Minister but Ministers who will be in office in the years ahead.  I hope this legislation will last for many years.</P>
    <P>It should be the Minister's overriding concern to avoid any appearance of seeking to influence the output of the scientific committee in any way. The best and only way to do that is by keeping the committee and the Minister at arm's length. This legislation should provide that the Authority appoints the scientific committee, full stop.  The Minister should have no hand, act or part in that appointment.  If the Minister is moved to make only one concession to me on this Bill, I want it to be on this matter.  I cannot overestimate its importance to the future value of the Food Safety Authority.  We can dramatically improve the effectiveness of this legislation by making this simple change.  I urge the Minister to give every consideration to that before Committee Stage next week.</P>
    <P>My second concern is the status of the chief executive.  The chief executive will be &ldquo;Mr. Food Safety&rdquo;.  I am using the term &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; because the person concerned is already in place, before Senator Jackman accuses me of being gender biased.  The perception of his status will be a key element in the Authority's overall credibility &mdash; let us make no mistake about that.</P>
    <P>It is completely incompatible with what we are hoping to achieve for the Authority, to disbar statutorily <Col N="234" /> the chief executive from membership of both the Authority board and the scientific committee, as is provided for explicitly in section 37(7).  This is an extraordinary provision and I cannot think what could have motivated it.  It smacks of the Dark Ages, not of a country moving into a new millennium.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about downgrading the chief executive's standing by statute, which seems to fly in the face of all good management practice. Bearing in mind what we are trying to do with the Food Safety Authority, we should be aiming to enhance his standing rather than trying to undermine it.</P>
    <P>This is a major presentational issue which is directly linked to the issue of the perceived independence of the Authority, but it is also a management issue of quite some significance.  Downgrading the chief executive in this way and saying he must not be a member of the board flies in the face of best management practice, not only in the private sector but also in the public sector.  From my experience in State bodies, I believe very strongly that the chief executive should always be a member of the board.</P>
    <P>Last week the Seanad passed the Bill establishing Enterprise Ireland which provides for the chief executive of that body to be a member of the board as of right.  Some eyebrows were raised, including those of the Tánaiste, when I mentioned that legislation was on the way to the House which took a diametrically opposed viewpoint &mdash; I was referring to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having the chief executive on the board is now the norm for State bodies.  One exception to that slipped through a couple of years ago without my seeing it in regard to the Medical Council but I do not know of any other such case.  It is against all modern management thinking and practice for the chief executive not to be on the board.</P>
    <P>This disbarring should be removed and replaced with a provision specifically making the chief executive a member of both the Authority board and the scientific committee.  I am against leaving it up to the Authority to make its own arrangements on this matter because board membership for the chief executive should have a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>My third major area of concern is that, despite the Minister's words today, the Bill is not sending strong enough signals that the Authority is there to act in the consumers' interest and, if necessary, to act against the short term interests of other parties involved.  It is of paramount need for the Authority to be clearly seen to be acting above all and exclusively in the interests of consumers of food.  I know there is a difficulty with this because people ask if we can appoint an Authority that is not acting in the national interest.  However, if we act in the interests of food consumers we will be acting in the long-term national interest.</P>
    <P>We should specify here that we are acting in the interests of the consumers, not of other vested interests.  Only through this focus can the credibility of the Authority be firmly established.  As I <Col N="235" /> said earlier, an Authority that is seen to be acting in the consumers' interest will in the long run also serve the national interest and the real interests of food producers.  It would be quite disastrous if the Authority were ever seen as reflecting the concerns of a &ldquo;wide spectrum of interests&rdquo;, to quote the phrase used in the Bill, a spectrum of which the consumers' interest was merely part.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned, therefore, about the consultative council provided for in the Bill and the language that is used and, more particularly, not used in this regard.  It is, of course, right that the Authority should always consult as widely as possible, including consultation with those who might be adversely affected by its decisions. There is no reason the Authority's independence should be compromised by such consultation.</P>
    <P>However, it is highly questionable whether a consultative council is the right way to go about that.  It suggests a body that will hammer out compromises between conflicting interests and present an agreed consensus for the Authority to consider.  That is not an appropriate way of acting when interests can be diametrically opposed.  Any appearance of consensus in those circumstances is usually a descent to the lowest common denominator.  Such bodies then produce fudged decisions.  Neither is it an acceptable way to act when one set of those interests, namely the interest of the consumers of food, should always remain paramount in the Authority's policy and actions.</P>
    <P>It can be said that the output from the consultative council will not be binding on the Authority, which I recognise as a possible saving factor.  However, such bodies always carry inbuilt risks that they will acquire a momentum of their own, which we must guard against.  Such a council could fudge issues and say that while consumers' interests are important it must take the other interests into account.  However, in the long-term national interest consumers' interests must come first.  For example, a German supermarket buyer will believe that a body which is seen not to act in the interests of the State, farmers or producers but only in the interests of consumers has credibility. If the Minister can get a German supermarket buyer to think that, he will be acting in the best interest of the food business and the nation.</P>
    <P>If the consultative council approach is to stand, there is a clear need to state in the Bill that the mission of the Authority is to act in the interests of the consumers of food.  I would like the Minster to consider stating that explicitly in the Bill because the current wording could lead to a fudge.</P>
    <P>When we pass legislation we often aim to create a situation in which the consumers' interests will be taken into account, along with other legitimate interests.  This case is different; here, the consumers' interests must be clearly seen to be paramount.  I seem to be saying that the other interests should not be taken into account; however, taking the consumers' interests <Col N="236" /> into account will be in the best interests of the nation and the other interests involved in the production and development of food.  If we do not take the consumers' interest seriously, the credibility of the Authority will be questioned.</P>
    <P>Credibility is the big issue in this Bill.  Unless we legislate for credibility we will create an empty shell, which I do not want to happen.  I hope the Minister of State will recognise there is still important work to be done on the Bill before it becomes law.  I welcome his speech and his intentions. I also welcome the hard work he and his team put into the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are three aspects to which the Minister of State should pay special attention.  First, independence in the legislation is crucial, not just to the people of Ireland but to the buyers of Irish food abroad.  If they have confidence in the independence of the Authority it will act not just in the interests of our consumers but in the interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Second, the scientific committee should be appointed by the Authority.  I have difficulty with the establishment of a food authority which is effectively not trusted to appoint a scientific committee because of concern it may only appoint its friends.  If there is any doubt about that we should not establish it.  The Authority should be able to recruit the best people to sit on its scientific committee.</P>
    <P>Good management practice says the chief executive should be on the board.  I am surprised I missed the passage of a Bill through the House a couple of years ago which also debarred the chief executive from sitting on the board.  In the six years I have been a Member of this House I have carefully sought to ensure that no Bill provided for that.  I understand it happened once.  It should never happen again because it is against best management practice.  The chief executive should be a member of the board statutorily.</P>
    <P>Third, the consumer interest must be paramount. I welcome the response of the Minister of State, especially his willingness to consider these points for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important Bill.  Since I became a Member of the House we have had a number of debates on food and matters relating to agriculture and agricultural production. However, this is our first opportunity to discuss the issue of confidence in what we produce on our farms and how it is presented to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn is correct when he says the most important issue facing not just us as consumers but the entire agricultural and food industry relates to confidence in what we sell on our supermarket shelves.  A number of issues, including BSE, have caused great concern and have shattered the confidence of some consumers in what is available.  In this regard, the Bill puts into focus the most important issue of consumer confidence. It establishes a structure whereby the consumer <Col N="237" /> has at last a major say in what goes on supermarket shelves.</P>
    <P>Much of what I intended to say has been covered already so there is not much point in repeating it.  However, a number of matters from a scientific viewpoint need to be stressed.  The function and composition of the scientific committee is very important.  The emphasis must be on the science and quality of food.  I do not share Senator Quinn's concerns about the appointment of the members of the committee.  What is important is its composition and the work it does.</P>
    <P>However, there is much merit in Senator Quinn's view that we should consider including members from other countries on the committee, including people with high international reputations in the area of food science.  That would strengthen the committee enormously.  It is similar to the way articles in scientific journals are refereed by experts from various parts of the world.  It is a very good system because it means the reader can have confidence that any published article has passed the eyes of very reputable people in the relevant field of science.  It is important the scientific committee has the same structure.</P>
    <P>The concerns of the public on food safety need to be quickly addressed.  There have been considerable concerns regarding the use of growth promoters in beef production, of antibiotics in various forms of meat products, especially pork, and even in the area of cereals and various crops of pesticides, insecticides and fungicides.  There was little use of these products 25 years ago because they were not available on the market to the extent they are today.  Science has progressed enormously over those years and there are many products available that aid the production of crops and animal husbandry.</P>
    <P>However, we must be extremely careful with the use of these products.  A matter came to my notice regarding the debate in this country on genetic engineering.  In potato production in the Americas, especially central America, where the Colorado beetle is an extremely damaging pest, the Americans bred a specific strain of the Russet Burbank variety of potatoes through genetic engineering that is resistant to the Colorado beetle.  This was a major development and was very welcome by producers.</P>
    <P>However, after a short period of time, the Colorado beetle built up a resistance to this gene.  We must, therefore, be very careful and monitor what is happening on the use of any of these asides on an ongoing basis.  While DDT was very beneficial in the 1930s and 1940s we now know, with the benefit of science and the worldwide increase in scientific knowledge, that DDT, which is in all our bones today, has resulted in the extinction of certain animal and bird species.  At the time we did not have sufficient scientific knowledge to realise the dangers.</P>
    <P>We need to invest in our scientific understanding of these products on an ongoing basis.  I am <Col N="238" /> not one to promote public spending to a great extent but scientific research in this country is very important, especially with regard to food safety.  The use of broad spectrum antibiotics on an ongoing basis is a dangerous practice.  It may make life easy for vets and farmers but there is a danger that we are using broad spectrum antibiotics to cure many different diseases.  What are the long-term consequences of this?  We must continuously investigate this area.  That is why I believe that we need to invest much more in the food research area.</P>
    <P>Genetic engineering has been extensively debated over the past two years.  I have grave concerns about it but I do not agree with the destruction of experiments carried out in a controlled environment by self appointed guardians of the earth.  These experiments are designed to discover the benefits and dangers of this scientific development and I welcome the investigation of genetic engineering and the benefits which may accrue from it in the years ahead.  If a scientific paper was published tomorrow indicating that there was a possibility that cancer could be controlled with the help of genetic engineering, we would all be delighted.  That is why we need to invest in this and study it.  We do not destroy experiments and anyone who condones that type of action will have to answer for it.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Minister the importance of investing more money in the scientific field.  I welcome the fact that the Food Safety Authority will be under the Department of Health and Children. It is high time that the consumer was taken into consideration and responsibility removed from the area of production.  They are related issues but they do not go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>As a location for investment in this area I will be parochial and suggest Carlow.  There has been a good scientific base there for many years.  There is a sugar company with a high level of scientific skill and Carlow is a major centre for food production. These are the areas of expertise which we should use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Authority is being placed on a statutory basis through this legislation.  It is the first legislation to come before us from the Department of Health and Children in 12 months.  I regret that we have not seen other long awaited legislation from that Department in that time.  The Health (Amendment) Bill giving effect to the changes in the Eastern Health Board and the delivery of health services has been anticipated for some time.  We have also been waiting for the Mental Health Bill for a long time.  Perhaps the Minister could give some indication of when those pieces of legislation will come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sides of the House support this Bill.  It is difficult to reassure consumers in an increasingly sceptical climate about food safety.  It is ironic that as our society becomes more developed, the less contact there is between the production of <Col N="239" /> food and its consumption.  If the Food Safety Authority can bridge that gap in any way it will be doing a good job.</P>
    <P>It is also ironic that as the consumer and producer lose contact, the more we turn to the scientific community to reassure us.  That is not easy because there are differing views in science on various matters.  It puzzles me that people accept without question the calling of scientific witnesses in respect of the production and consumption of food without examining the alternatives available within the scientific community.  There was an interesting article about this in the book <i>Encounters with Modern Ireland,</i> published by the Institute of Public Administration.  It states that doubt rather than trust is the glue which binds modern society together.  Depending on the scientist called, there can be different doubts.</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill in principle, I share the concerns expressed at length in the Dáil during its consideration, and in a succinct fashion this morning by Senator Quinn, regarding the gap between the laudable objective of ensuring the primacy of the consumer and the lack of specific provision for it in the Bill.  I followed the debate on Committee Stage in the Dáil and there was a number of amendments which the Minister undertook to consider and return to on Report Stage.  I regret that the guarantee of consumer involvement in membership of the board and of the consultative council have not yet been given. I appeal to the Minister not to treat the Seanad as the last lap before getting the legislation out of the way before the summer recess.  The Minister should reconsider the points made concerning the assurance to consumers that their interests will be paramount as regards membership of the board and the consultative council.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the concern raised in the Dáil that there should be a more direct opportunity for consultation, linkage and information exchange between the scientific committee and the consultative council.  The Minister said that is not necessarily precluded but we should expressly provide for the greatest amount of interaction between the organs which are being put in place under this Bill.  Only good can come from the exchange of information.</P>
    <P>The possibility of publishing the opinions of the council was raised in the Dáil.  That has not been dealt with satisfactorily.  The Minister responded to it in a certain fashion but if we are to reassure consumers we should not be seen to prevent the council from publishing its opinions.  We saw the difficulties which arose with the Insurance Ombudsman's role and the role of the council in the insurance industry.  The public was not reassured by the way the industry or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment handled the matter.  There is an opportunity to get it right in this case and to avoid those pitfalls with this new body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> The worst thing that could happen is for controversy or difficulties to arise in the early stages of this body's operation.  Fortunately, that has not happened in respect of the existing non-statutory authority.  However, when something is put into law, people look at it from a legalistic point of view.  If we are seen to diminish the openness with which the Authority and its various associated bodies conduct their business, we will not be doing our best for the consumers.</P>
    <P>As regards staffing and funding, it is important that we and the public are assured by the Minister that appropriate funding will be made available to the Authority to carry out its work.  My colleague, Deputy Upton, spoke eloquently on this subject in the Dáil.  As someone who is involved in the scientific community, he knows more than I do about this matter.  He made a good point when he said that the success of the authority will depend on the budget it is given and on the ability of its staff to carry out its work.  It will be necessary for the authority to have a large research budget.  It will not always be able to rely on outside support or be reassured that it is provided in an independent manner.  The authority will need the financial capacity to carry out its own research and investigations at various stages of its operations.  I want the Minister to assure us that the necessary funding will be forthcoming for that.</P>
    <P>I agree that the most preferable option is to have this body under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.  I hope the Department will operate in a supportive rather than a controlling fashion in its dealings with the Authority. The board must have the greatest level of independence and latitude and it must not be seen to be in the pocket of any vested interest.  Not only must consumers' interests be of paramount importance, but the level of satisfaction of those interests will determine the success or failure of this body.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the Authority will consult widely with relevant interested parties on standards for the food industry.  These standards are generally set by legislation and the bulk of the legislation implemented in this area in the past few years has been on foot of EU directives.  Any input into the formulation of these directives has come from relevant Departments.  Will the Authority play a principal or a subsidiary role in this regard in the future?  Will the proposed authority be responsible for drafting legislation on foot of such directives or will that responsibility remain with the relevant Departments?  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify a number of such issues as this would help to guide me in my consideration of what amendments I need to table on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the consultative council, I was disappointed that the suggestions made for guaranteed consumer representation were not accepted in the Dáil.  I give notice to the Minister that I will table amendments to that effect on Committee <Col N="241" /> Stage.  I have similar concerns about the composition of the board.  While we are giving the Minister power to appoint the board, we should also set out the categories from which representation is to be drawn.  That is a commonplace feature of other legislation and it warrants further consideration in this regard.</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments made by Senator Quinn about the scientific committee.  The authority should be able to set up its own scientific committee and be answerable for its composition. I concur with the remarks made by Senator Quinn and Senator Gibbons about getting advice from outside the country on the work of the scientific committee.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed by staff of the existing agency about their relationship with the new Authority.  Section 38 deals with the appointment of staff by the board and the transfer of existing staff.  I know assurances have been given about such changes in negotiations with their representative bodies.  Does the Minister envisage a situation where all the staff currently employed in food control will be transferred to the Authority over a number of years?</P>
    <P>I caution against the overuse of contract staff in the Food Safety Authority.  I accept that contract staff are necessary from time to time but if we want to build up a <i>corpus</i> of experience and knowledge in this area, we should not follow, for example, the experience of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in recent years.  That Department was set up in 1993 but because of public service recruitment restrictions, it had to employ many people on a contract basis.  However, they moved on quickly to other employment opportunities.  I would like a good body of knowledge and experience built up in the Food Safety Authority as quickly as possible. Proper terms and conditions for staff will play a big role in that regard.</P>
    <P>What will happen to staff who do not wish to transfer to the proposed Authority if agreement is reached with their representative bodies on such a transfer?  What will happen, for example, to the services provided by health board EHOs in the non-food areas, such as nursing homes, tobacco regulations, etc., if they are transferred from the health boards to the Food Safety Authority? These may seem like matters of detail, but they are matters of concern to people who have experience in the field and I would like the Minister to address them.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions about service contracts and the provisions for the issuing of contracts by the authority and the appointment of authorised officers to the Authority.  Will there be an appeals system for agencies which have a service contract terminated by the Authority? Will the Authority be able to specify who it wants in particular to perform its functions within a service industry?  Will the Authority be able to sanction staff in an agency above the existing management in that body?  Will consultation reviews and <Col N="242" /> planing processes be set out prior to an agency being granted a service contract or a service contract being removed from it?  If the Minister could respond to these questions, it would help me to decide what amendments to table on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is a proactive measure by the Minister and the Government in the area of food safety.  While much has been said in the past about food safety, relatively little has been done.  This legislation gives effect to a commitment made by the Government before taking office that it would identify matters of concern in this area.</P>
      <P>It is often said that we are what we eat.  Food safety is important whether people eat to live or live to eat.  As the Minister said, food scares are nothing new.  People, like myself, who come from a rural background were always told it was unsafe to drink unpasteurised milk and that proper hygiene in the home was important.  We were also taught to cook meat properly, particularly pork and chicken, and the dangers of not doing so.  A new agenda was established with the onset of BSE and its possible link with the new variant CJD and the creation by the farming community of bovine cannibalism through the feeding of bonemeal to cattle.  The Minister of State referred to the Stephen King horror stories, but fact is stranger than fiction and it is given vent in this regard in relation to CJD.  Prior to the introduction of the swill regulations in the mid-1980s even offal was being fed to pigs.  Then there was salmonella in eggs.  We all heard about that scare.</P>
      <P>Senator Gibbons referred to fertilisers and sprays.  When I was growing up and involved in a small way in farming there was minimal use of artificial manures.  Now artificial manures are used almost exclusively in the growth of vegetables. A feature of one of the hotels in Mullingar is that the vegetables used are grown organically. That, of itself, seems to be a new trend.  This is a means of saying that the provider has not used artificial sprays and manures.  In the context of the use of artificial sprays, etc., what goes in must come out and what goes up must come down.  Therefore, high standards must be maintained at all levels.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to E-coli O157 which claimed the lives of a number of elderly people in Scotland.  Some years ago a number of people became very ill with listeria and some died due to carelessness in a cooked/chill system.</P>
      <P>The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in pigs and poultry is another matter which must be tackled in a realistic way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an appropriate response to the concerns which have been articulated by the public. Members of the farming community have been prosecuted for feeding angel dust and other artificial <Col N="243" /> growth hormones.  The greatest critics of this practice are members of the farming community and I am pleased that only a small minority of their number are involved.  However, one must consider the harm done.  There is a just concern abroad pertaining to this illegal practice.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill the Minister has raised the concept of farm to fork traceability.  It is important that food can be traced from the table to the farm from where it came.  He also referred to the fact that, in all, some 50 State agencies and many hundreds of staff are involved currently in the delivery of food control services.  Using the old adage &ldquo;Too many cooks spoil the broth&rdquo;, if this Bill does anything, it rationalises the approach to food safety.  In one fell swoop the Minister has put paid to that absolute nonsense, as everyone who knows anything about administration will know.  I am not being critical.  Given the multiplicity of agencies, a relatively good job has been done.  However, the Minister has pulled together all the strands of these agencies and placed them under this appropriate body under the Bill.  He also said that it is not possible to definitely identify food control staff individually. Therefore, this agency must have one remit, food safety, and that is what this Bill achieves.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not agree with other speakers in regard to the scientific committee.  Reference is made in the Bill to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and accountability.  Who is most accountable?  The Minister is accountable to the House and to the electorate.  That is the person who should appoint the scientific committee.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to Ireland's proud food standards record.  With possible exceptions over the past number of years, in the main we have achieved a high standard of food production. At the end of the day, however, we must not be complacent.</P>
    <P>Another important provision in the Bill is the placing of staff on a statutory basis.  The Minister has given them the power to inspect premises and take away samples of food.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Where an authorised officer is of the view that any premises or activity poses a threat to public health, he or she will have the power to dictate the remedial action required and set a time limit for its completion.  These so-called &ldquo;improvement notices&rdquo;, referred to in section 52, are a new feature.</P>
    <P>He continued with what is the operative sentence:</P>
    <P>While in the past officers could advise on the required improvements to premises or equipment, such advice did not have a statutory basis.  Improvement notices, therefore, give food safety professionals in the field a new statutory tool which can be used where there is clear need for some remedial action, but where a complete shutdown of operations may not be warranted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> The Minister went on to state the action to be taken further to that.  He also stated:</P>
    <P>For example, unsafe products or product batches may have been distributed by the producer and be on the market.  In such cases authorised officers may insist on the withdrawal, recall, detention and supervised destruction of products posing a threat to public health as provided for in section 54.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks of contributing at this point is that much of what one would like to say has already been said.  This is one of the most important Bills to come before this House and I am pleased to have said a few words about it.  Not only has the Minister been proactive on the food safety area but he is among the first EU Ministers to introduce such legislation, and he should be congratulated.  I commend this Bill to the House. It has many important provisions.  I appreciate that certain Members on the other side of the House may have their criticisms; that is democracy. However, it is a great pity they did not do what the Minister of State, Deputy Moffat, has done when they were in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus fáilte roimh an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>It is an important Bill because food safety is very important.  The Bill is necessary because of food poisoning, salmonella, etc.</P>
      <P>When I was a gasúr there were travelling shops around the country.  Those shops carried the bread, butter, bacon and the paraffin oil.  The shopkeeper would fill the paraffin oil first, clap his hands and then take in the home produced eggs.  He would then throw the plain loaf into the basket too, but we had no problems with food poisoning.</P>
      <P>When every house killed a pig, it was salted in a big barrel, brought in and hung from the roof. At night, depending on how many there were for dinner the next day, the woman of the house cut a chunk of bacon and put it into a bucket of spring water overnight to take the excess salt out of it.  She washed it the next day, boiled it with a couple of turnips or a head of cabbage and a big pot of flowery Kerr's Pink potatoes, and there was no such thing as food poisoning or the present troubles.</P>
      <P>These problems started with the scientists and the experts, and with concentrated and intensive farming.  This has bred the pill society in which we live today.  We have a pill or an injection to cure every ill.  If we wish to take the question of food production seriously we should make a case to the EU to have Ireland &mdash; an island nation &mdash; designated as a producer of traditional foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should return to the system of feeding cattle on good grass produced with farmyard manure.  In the old days we grew oats, barley, wheat and rye, took them to the mill to be crushed and fed cattle on home produced foods that had no insecticides or added chemicals.  In <Col N="245" /> those days we had good beef, lamb, bacon and eggs because everything was produced on the open farm.  We had no farm pollution or fish kills before the introduction of artificial manure.  It is time we looked to the past and to the good food which was produced then.</P>
    <P>We are now trying to develop food with a long shelf life.  Why?  Who is profiting from this development?  Large international consortia who do not care for the farmer or farm produce are making huge profits from the production of chemicals.  Artificial manure causes enormous problems to water supplies.  In many cases we do not know what we are drinking.  Spring wells which supplied water to families for generations are now contaminated by pollution from silage or slurry tanks and from the overuse of artificial manure.</P>
    <P>The country could be saved the expense of importing chemical additives.  We are feeding our animals with imported maize and silage.  These foods are artificially produced and we do no know what they contain.  The bag of feed will show a list of the ingredients but an ordinary person is as wise when he has read it as before.  The law requires food packaging to show the list of ingredients but these lists mean nothing.  We do not know what we are eating.  When we produced our own farm foods for animals and produced animals on farms we knew exactly what the food contained.</P>
    <P>It is time we returned to traditional production methods.  When I was a milk roundsman in Sligo town in the 1950s people would not buy pasteurised milk.  I had the first agency for pasteurised milk in Sligo.  Occasionally, in winter when milk was in short supply, I might leave a customer a couple of pints of pasteurised milk.  The bottles would be left out next morning with a note to say that pasteurised milk was not acceptable.  I had great difficulty introducing pasteurised milk in Sligo town.  Now we are told it is the only thing to drink.  I wonder is it.  A bottle of milk will now last a week but I wonder if Senators have ever opened a bottle of milk that was a fortnight old. They will find it rotten and useless.  In the good old days milk was delivered fresh from the farm every morning and when it went sour it was used for baking.</P>
    <P>Traditional farming methods would create employment in farming and bring life back to rural Ireland, and if food were produced in the traditional way we could guarantee the safety and wholesomeness of our food exports.  We should get rid of injections and antibiotics and ensure the health of our animals by care and good husbandry. The injection is seen as the modern cure for all illness in animals and humans.  I wonder what the outcome of this will be.</P>
    <P>I remember the war years when an old cat might come into a shop early in the morning and lie on the warm loaves of bread.  A customer might hit the cat to drive him away and then take a loaf from the pile.  I never heard any complaints <Col N="246" /> or knew of people contracting illnesses.  I do not say we should return to those methods but our modern hygiene practices do not appear to reduce the level of sickness and I wonder if they have paid off.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the EU designate Ireland &mdash; a small island nation &mdash; the first EU exporter of traditionally produced foods.  Our economic life depends on exports.  We should make less use of chemicals and forget about strengthening multi-national companies.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Senator Quinn for his excellent contribution and his work in promoting Irish foods.  He is an example to everyone in the food business.  Irish produce is clearly identified by the shamrock symbol in his supermarkets.  I wish others would follow his example.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of improvements to businesses. Will these improvements be exempt from planning permission?  I have seen firms being told to make improvements to comply with EU regulation only to find difficulty getting planning permission for those improvements.  I can foresee problems arising and delays being caused if planning authorities do not work in co-operation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Meat factories are at present examined by veterinary surgeons.  As far as I know environmental health officers look after the retail trade but do not inspect factories. Will the Food Safety Authority have responsibility for all aspects of food production and retailing or only for retailing?  Will there be duplication in this regard?  It is important to clarify these two points.</P>

      <P>As ever it is a challenge to follow Senator Farrell because he speaks such an amount of good sense.  I agree with him about the methods of food production and that it is a pity that we do not play to our strengths in food production, not only for domestic consumption but for international consumption also.  I also share the Senator's views on Senator Quinn's efforts to sell Irish produce in his stores.  My researcher was in a Marks and Spencer store and informs me it is running a promotion comparing Irish and American strawberries.  Why do we need American strawberries in mid-June?  Such policies in supermarkets need careful examination.  Irish producers have limited production periods for fruit and vegetable production, in particular, and despite the GATT agreements we must take cognisance of the importance of local industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is a long overdue measure.  I agree with Senator Glynn's points about the use of herbicides, pesticides and antibiotics. The abuse of fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and antibiotics has been very unfortunate. Recent work carried out by Danish researchers indicates definitely what has been suspected for a long time, that antibiotic residues in food, in particular pork and chicken, affect those who eat them.  Antibiotic resistance and allergies can be <Col N="247" /> developed as a result.  It is important that these issues will be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be seen to operate in favour of consumers.  It has been a problem in the past that much of the Department of Agriculture and Food's policy emphasis was in favour of producers. I have found it difficult to get information from the Department on herbicides and pesticides found in foods.  There has been considerable concern for many years that organochlorides are implicated in the development of cancers, particularly breast cancer.  Research work for and against this theory has been published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine.</i>  In view of the high incidence of breast cancer in this country I take a careful interest in this matter.  I got a poor response from the Department to requests I made for information on the presence of lindane, an organochloride commonly used in the past, in a range of foodstuffs.  I received helpful information from the Department's research facility at Abbotstown, Dublin.  The Department of Agriculture and Food must be open to requests on these issues because they are very important to consumers.</P>
    <P>It does not appear from the Bill that the consultative council must include consumer representatives. If that is the case an amendment should be brought forward to rectify the matter.  The Consumers' Association of Ireland has done trojan work over many years, but it is important that the Bill would guarantee consumer interests a position on the consultative council.</P>
    <P>The board and the council must be independent. If the Minister of State goes to a trade fair abroad to extol the safety and nutritional value of Irish food he will be seen as being there to sell the products.  A truly independent board would have more authority internationally.  There may not be the same degree of scepticism nationally because those who are appointed will be known or recognised.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State should think again about the manner in which the board is to be appointed.  It is less satisfactory to have the board appointed solely by the Minister, rather than to have at least some of its members nominated by various bodies, such as the Science Council.  It is important that the board will be able to be critical when necessary.  The circumstances surrounding BSE in the UK is an example of how a lack of independence in the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food led to inaction over a ten year period.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake not to include the Authority's chief executive on the board.  Unless there is a very good reason to exclude the chief executive officer from the board the Minister of State should consider amending that provision.  The Minister of State should also consider amendments to allow bodies such as the Science Council, the RDS or the Consumers' Association of Ireland, to nominate board members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  We are agreed that food safety is a most important issue and as Minister of State it is my top priority.  The Government recognises the need for uncompromised and independently verifiable assurances on food safety to ensure consumer confidence.  While the primary purpose of the Bill is consumer protection, the Government also recognises that one of the best ways to promote the Irish food sector is to put in place a strong, independent and science based Food Safety Authority, which will have the confidence of consumers at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>BSE, new variant CJD, salmonella, listeria and E-coli are increasingly causes for concern for consumers, as are new crop developments and food processing.  The Government must listen to and respond appropriately to these concerns.  I assure the House that the Government will not be found wanting.  The protection of public health is a matter of absolute priority and any threat to the safety of food will receive an immediate and strong response.  It is vital to put a structure in place that can identify and assess in a competent and professional manner any risk to public health and which can communicate effectively with consumers and providers.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that the interests of consumers are better served by the creation of an authority which will be directly accountable for all food control functions.  In order for the Authority to be accountable it must have direct responsibility for these functions.  While the original intention was to effect the immediate transfer of all relevant staff to the new Authority on the vesting day, it has not proved a practical proposition.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman referred to food poisoning. We should all be aware of the importance of food safety and hygiene, to prevent food related illness in the first place.  The Senator also asked about the implementation of food safety legislation. This legislation is being implemented by the relevant agencies.  Following enactment of the legislation, this service will continue to be provided by the official agencies under the aegis of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland by means of service contracts.  Food safety legislation will be introduced by the relevant Departments.  Following enactment, this legislation will be included in the Second Schedule.  Further food safety legislation will be introduced as required.  In practice, much of the legislation in this area is driven by the various Departments at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the Government decision not to give the Authority the audit function envisaged by the previous Government was changed for the sake of it and an attempt to put Fianna Fáil colours on the previous Government's proposals. I disagree with this.  The previous Government's proposals were little more than a knee jerk reaction to the growing lack of consumer <Col N="249" /> confidence.  An authority with no direct role in the administration of food safety services and which would sit pontificating at one remove would not have provided the reassurance that consumers demand and deserve.</P>
    <P>There is nothing simple or straightforward about food safety.  We are talking about a complex, ever changing environment where the range of skills required extends from microbiology to animal husbandry to environmental control.  It requires a structure which brings these diverse skills together and allows them to function in a harmonised and responsive way.  The structure proposed by the Authority is not a bureaucratic nightmare, as some would claim.  It provides the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the best interests of the consumer are served.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the questions about service contracts.  The provision in the Bill for contracts between the authority and existing official agencies was criticised and it was suggested that the Authority could go elsewhere for services. This is nonsense.  For example, the health boards employ 200 environmental health officers who are highly skilled professionals with years of training and experience.  They are in the front line when there is a food alert.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the Authority will be able to publish details of contracts and will introduce a system of monitoring to ensure the agreements are being adhered to.  If contracts are not satisfactorily fulfilled, the Authority will report to the Minister for Health and Children who will lay such reports before the Oireachtas.  The service contracts proposed are a practical, workable and immediate solution and do not purport to be anything else.  In the long term, the authority may have its own full complement of staff, the bulk of which will come from existing agencies.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised the transfer of staff. This will only happen following discussion and agreement with representatives of the staff concerned. The Bill provides that any staff transferred will enjoy terms and conditions no less favourable than those they already have.  I will not be drawn on the timetable for transfers, which was also mentioned by Senator Gallagher, as no decisions have been made.  We should be allowed to get on with the work in hand and to ensure that the Authority is operational without delay, using the service contracts device as an interim measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to his experience in the Canary Islands.  This is a good example of why we must always read the label of any food product.  The Senator recognised the professionalism of those employed in the agencies.  He complimented Senator Quinn for the work he is doing on traceability and the quality of food.  Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the quality of alcohol.  I do not know whether that is classified as food. Nevertheless, environmental health officers have the authority to examine areas where drink is <Col N="250" /> stored to see if health regulations are being observed.</P>
    <P>The ultimate benchmark of quality is safety and the protection of public health.  This Bill focuses firmly on this.  In the broader context, quality is much more subjective and is influenced to a great extent by personal taste.  It is essentially a market driven concept.  Different markets have different perceptions of quality.  To give the Food Safety Authority responsibility for this wider area of quality would deflect it from its primary responsibility, which is to focus clearly on food safety.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has initiated a wide range of programmes dealing with quality, which are complemented by schemes operated by Bord Bia, An Bord Glas and the processing and retailing sectors.  These schemes represent industry's response to consumer concerns about quality and I am satisfied that area should be left to deal with them.  Quality assurance schemes will benefit from the underpinning safety role of the Authority.  However, this is a desirable spin-off and not a requirement of the food safety system.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the Authority's involvement, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with food producers' representatives in the establishment of schemes to protect consumer interests.  These schemes, to be known as food safety assurance schemes, will cover the promotion of best practice and preparation of guidelines on a range of food safety issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised a number of issues.  He said he was concerned about the appointment of the scientific committee.  It is envisaged that the principles of openness and transparency will be the key in the operation of the Authority.  The board will not have sole responsibility for appointing the scientific committee from whom it will receive expert advice.  The consultative process envisaged in the Bill ensures the board will have an input as regards appointments but will not be in a position to exert undue influence.  This provision ensures that the independence of the scientific committee is not compromised.  It does not mean the Minister does not trust the board but that he wishes to guarantee the independence of the scientific committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also raised the position of the chief executive.  In order to maintain his independence in the authority, he cannot be a member of the scientific committee.  However, he may attend meetings of both bodies and advise them and seek their advice.  He may also be involved in the decision making process.  This is the position which obtains in the Irish Medicine Board, which has been alluded to.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also expressed concern about consumer aspects of the Bill.  The whole basis of this legislation is concerned with consumers.  It is based on the principle that the consumer is king and the desire to ensure that consumers are as well informed as possible in relation to all aspects <Col N="251" /> of food safety.  Far from being a talking shop, the 24 member consultative council is a vital component of the Authority's structure and will ensure a consumer input into the day to day operations of the Authority as well as its decision making process.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the comments of Senator Gibbons and I agree with the emphasis he put on the importance of scientific research.  We are fortunate to have a scientific community covering a broad area of expertise in the food related sciences. Many give of their time spontaneously in regard to this matter and their expertise is much appreciated.  I look forward to their continuous involvement in this area in the future.  Senator Gibbons was also concerned about GMOs and other aspects of biotechnology &mdash; an expanding area which is of great importance to the Authority. A special group from the scientific committee will examine this area.</P>
    <P>Naturally enough, we will hear much more about genetic engineering in future.  It will not be all bad news, as has been said by many commentators in the Dáil, although I have not heard it in the House today.  Naturally, there is a place for genetic modification in future.</P>
    <P>Ireland enjoys a good reputation for the quality of food it produces, both for the domestic and export markets.  We owe a considerable debt to our existing food control agency for the work it has done over many years to ensure that the food we eat is safe.  We now need new structures to face the challenges which lie ahead.  The enactment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill will provide the framework for future control and regulation of food safety.</P>
    <P>At an early stage of the Dáil debate on this Bill the Authority was described as being an emperor with no clothes.  Let me stress that the Authority will have a full and well fitted wardrobe and will be well decked out for the job in hand.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn made some interesting remarks on how BSE and the new variant CJD had arisen &mdash; bovine cannibalism, as he called it.  It was also interesting to hear his comments about what happened in the 1980s in England concerning salmonella and eggs, as well as what is happening today with regard to fertilisers, insecticide sprays and artificial manure.  He said we must ensure the highest standards and avoid the indiscriminate use of antibiotics.  As he said, the Bill appropriately responds to these concerns.  He also spoke of rationalisation, and the Food Safety Authority will bring all groups together under one agency. That will be something to look forward to because it will co-ordinate the entire food sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons also mentioned accountability, and politicians should not be afraid to make decisions about whom they appoint to boards.  Ultimately, the Minister and politicians generally are responsible to the people and not some quasi groups we might hear about.  We must take the responsibility and that is particularly so <Col N="252" /> in regard to the Minister.  I thank the Senator for his remarks.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell gave us a tour back to ancient times.</P>

      <P>He spoke of his own experiences of killing pigs and said we had become a pill society.  To a certain degree he is factually correct. There is too much use of antibiotics and certainly the medical people agree with that, especially with regard to the amount of antibiotics used in animal husbandry.  Increasingly, people are running into antibiotic resistance which is causing major problems in our hospitals.  As far as possible we should get away from the quick fix, especially in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell praised Senator Quinn for what he is doing for food quality and safety.  I would like to add my own words of praise for Senator Quinn for what he has done.  He was out there first and recognised the issue.  Naturally enough it was good business, but he spotted it and has continued on that line.  He must be complimented on what he has done to date.  I am sure we can rely on him to keep going in that vein in the future.</P>

    <Title>Review of Seanad: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to open this debate in the Seanad itself on the reform of the Seanad.  The Seanad in its current form has come in for criticism over the years.  It is my belief that an analysis of the Seanad should begin with the specification of the functions of the Seanad.  The form or structure of the Seanad <Col N="253" /> should be the one that best serves its specified functions.</P>
      <P>The current debate on the Seanad was begun by the report of the Constitution Review Group 1995-6, chaired by a former distinguished Senator, Dr. T. K. Whitaker.  It concluded its review by recommending that a special commission be established to report on the functions and structure of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution chaired by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe decided to carry out this review itself.  It commissioned a report from two distinguished academics, John Coakley, UCD and Michael Laver, TCD.  Their report set forth the structure and functions of second chambers worldwide.  Of the 156 unitary states surveyed by Coakley-Laver only 40 or 25 per cent have second chambers. This underscores the wisdom of examining the functions of Seanad Éireann with a view to ensuring that they are politically significant ones.</P>
      <P>The Second Progress Report of the O'Keeffe committee which dealt with Seanad Éireann observed: &ldquo;The Seanad does make a useful contribution to the democratic life of the state. .. but the Seanad is a resource that could be deployed to far greater effect if it were reformed.&rdquo; The report examined the functions of the Seanad and came up with recommendations for substantial changes in the composition of the House.  It is clear from the Coakley-Laver study that there is a wide range of options available for determining the composition of a second chamber.  So I urge once more the debating strategy that we concentrate on the determination of the functions of the Seanad because composition is fundamentally a technical political issue.</P>
      <P>One of the aspects of modern government that does not receive adequate attention but which is of growing importance is European Union legislation. As the O'Keeffe committee puts it:</P>
      <P>Ireland's membership of the EU has created a broad bridge over which a huge volume of EU regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions is carried out.  This traffic represents how the powers ceded by the member states under the Treaties are being used.  It is clear that careful checks on it should be carried out by the Oireachtas.  Owing to the heavy calls upon their time Dáil Deputies find themselves unable to do this effectively.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the results of the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty that a substantial number of people are concerned by the failure of politicians to keep them informed about EU matters and the policies it is pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Seanad should be made a checkpoint on the EU bridge.  Prospective EU legislation should be debated in the Seanad with European Commissioners present and their officials being available to provide the background and rationale of the policy measures being proposed.  Irish legislation on foot of European <Col N="254" /> legislation should be introduced in the Seanad.  Moreover, MEPs from the North and South should have right of audience in the Seanad.  It seems to me that if the Seanad were given this function and that if it tackled it with high critical ability and energy, it would be performing an important task that needs urgently to be done.  Inasmuch as it would create within itself a special expertise in EU affairs it would greatly strengthen this relatively new element in our political culture and, since Europe is a growing part of political life, the Seanad would become a growing star in our political system.</P>
    <P>As far as the composition of the Seanad is concerned I want to make two observations.  First, the functions of the Seanad are fundamentally political in character and criticism of the composition of the Seanad that, for instance, it does not have a sufficient number of representatives of vocational interests is wide of the mark.  Political work is for politicians, it always was and it always will be.  I disagree, therefore, with the recommendations of the O'Keeffe report that the Seanad should simply be a consultative body whose Members, broadly speaking, would be non-partisan people with knowledge, experience and judgment.  Having been a Member of the Seanad for almost 17 years, I would like to believe that I served with some of the most eminent public representatives in the history of the State who were knowledgeable and experienced and who showed great judgment.</P>
    <P>I also hold the view that because Members of the Seanad cannot be returned by direct election, the obvious political way is to have them returned is by indirect election by local authority members. Since the appearance of the second progress report of the 1996-7 committee, chaired by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, which deals with Seanad Éireann, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has made known his intention to act on one of the committee's recommendations, namely, that which recommends a referendum to give constitutional recognition to local government.  This and other proposed legislation indicates the Government's determination to reinvigorate the local government system.  Therefore, I oppose the recommendation of the O'Keeffe committee that a lesser number of Senators should be returned by local authority members than at present.  Such recognition would be given practical political meaning if local authority members were given an enhanced role in returning Senators.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of seeking to establish regional membership of the Seanad by grouping local authorities into regional constituencies.  On the contrary, local government would be best served if it were seen, in respect of this electoral function, as a unified instrument of national policy. Furthermore, a higher calibre of Seanad candidates would be assured if those seeking election were obliged to make their pitch to a national rather than a regional constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I look forward to Members' contributions and I anticipate a lively debate.  With these remarks, I declare the debate now open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely and important debate.  I compliment the Leader on his measured and thoughtful comments.  He set a good tone for the debate, which, I hope, will be helpful in the context of Seanad reform.</P>
      <P>In recent years there have been several debates on this topic in the House.  Many of the ideas which will be expressed this afternoon were put forward in the past.  We are not dealing with this issue for the first time and Members have already made a wide range of suggestions regarding how change could be effected.  There is also a clear willingness on their part to accept the need for and consequences of that change.  Like the Leader, I intend to concentrate largely on the principles which should underlie any change.</P>
      <P>A question people frequently ask is whether a second House is needed.  As the Leader indicated, many countries, particularly some of the Nordic states, manage quite well with one House of Parliament. It is interesting that, to date, none of the reports on this House carried out by outside experts has reached this conclusion and they all stated clearly that there is a need for a second House.  They are correct to make that assertion.</P>
      <P>We live in what is frequently referred to as the &ldquo;age of the democratic deficit&rdquo;, which is a real problem particularly as it relates to how we deal with European matters.  No matter how hard they try, the 15 MEPs, who are generally people of high calibre, are not able to do what is expected of them.  They cannot ensure that there will be a full flow of information in respect of and a full debate on major issues or that there will be a proper examination of the many detailed proposals put forward daily by the European Commission, <i>via</i> the European Parliament and elsewhere, which will inevitably find their way into domestic legislation.</P>
      <P>Europe is not an esoteric subject.  The day to day matters dealt with in Europe affect trade, commerce and living standards in addition to the daily lives of virtually every citizen in this country across a wide range of activities.  It is important that within the Oireachtas there should be a House with the time and facilities to deal with these matters, so that when a debate arises similar to that on the Amsterdam Treaty, claims will not again be made &mdash; in my opinion they were correct &mdash; about the lack of proper scrutiny and debate in the Houses of Parliament.  I will return to that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great justification for the existence of a second House.  Virtually all of the new countries which emerged after the collapse of Communist and totalitarian rule have opted for a second House of Parliament.  They did so, for the most part, following a great deal of reflection.  They realised that there will be needs for which a lone <Col N="256" /> House of Parliament cannot cater and that groups and interests which need representation will not obtain it if only one House is established.  They also recognised that there are many functions which will not be carried out by Lower Houses but which, in the interests of democracy, should be carried out.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to consider current events in Britain where one of the aims of the Government is to transform the democratically indefensible House of Lords into a form of senate which will meet some of the needs that are glaringly obvious &mdash; and which could be dealt with effectively by a properly organised second House &mdash; to people involved in British politics.  It would be foolish and short-sighted of us to abolish an institution which has not only served the country well but which, more importantly, has the potential to add significant value to our democratic process.</P>
    <P>As already stated, Members accept the need for reform.  Our electoral system must be widened to broaden membership of the Seanad.  As the Leader indicated, this is a political House and it is an integral part of the political process of the State.  I can do no better than recall the words of the great 19th century philosopher of parliament, Walter Bagehot, who stated &ldquo;Without party, parliament is not possible.&rdquo; In the context of the Seanad, &ldquo;party&rdquo; could be taken as meaning politics. This is a political House and it is concerned with the business of politics, in its narrowest and broadest sense.  What was true in the 19th century is even more true today.</P>
    <P>Any reform of the electoral system should be based on a frank acceptance that politics is about politics and that Houses of Parliament are run on political principles because they are about the business of politics.  I do not believe we want a second House of Parliament which is a carbon copy of the NESC or a similar body.  We do not want to see the establishment of some form of corporate State institution populated by those who are loaded down with vested interests, individuals interested only in one issue or those who are not answerable in any democratic or accountable way and who concentrate only on serving the interests of their supporters.  That would be a recipe for narrow brokering between powerful professional interests and it would represent a negation of everything parliament represents. Above all else, parliament stands for the general interests of the people pooled together in one assembly rather than professional interests fighting against each other to fulfil their selfish desires.  There are many other places where such battles can be fought.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I accept the need to change our electoral system, broaden the electorate and tighten up a number of current procedures. However, I believe that a college of electors drawn from those who are themselves elected and who are involved in local government on a daily basis is not merely defensible, it is eminently sensible as a means of electing some Members of <Col N="257" /> an Upper House.  It is also inherently democratic because those people are accountable to their electorates and we, the people they choose to elect here, are accountable to them.  Any reform of the Seanad should retain this electoral college as a large element within its structure &mdash; I say this not because I have a vested interest in it, which I have, but on the basis of democracy.  Ireland is not unique in this system.  France and Spain have broadly similar structures, and in other European countries the principle of an indirectly elected House of Parliament is accepted as inherently democratic.  Other groups should also have the possibility of being elected to this House, especially representatives of groups which may have something distinctive to say, and we should examine ways of bringing this to pass.</P>
    <P>I have been vague up to now about the type of electoral system we should have and I do not believe our Constitution should go into too much detail about how the Seanad should be organised. A constitution should lay down general principles and leave the rest to legislation, and if the legislation does not conform to the constitutional principles it can be tested in court.  The present Constitution goes into far too much detail about how the House should be constituted and on the type and detail of the electoral system.  The Seanad of 60 years ago should not be the Seanad of today.  I have been in the House for 18 years, on and off, and I know that it wants to reform but it is constrained from reforming itself by constitutional limitations.  We should not have found ourselves in this position; we should be answerable to the general principles on which the House is constituted and should be free from time to time, through legislation, to make changes which are thought appropriate.  Too rigid a constitutional framework inhibits the changes necessary for any institution.</P>
    <P>Equally, some of the suggestions for a new Seanad would, had they been enshrined in the Constitution, have proved even more restrictive than the current position.  They would have ossified this institution within the political correctness of the 1990s, much of which is already out of date, and would leave our successors with an institution even more anachronistic than some people say the current House is.  The worst possible thing which the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution could do would be to start prescribing the detail of a new Seanad in a way which would necessarily be fixed, rigid, cumbersome and expensive to change, with too much input from theorists and not enough from those who understand the practice, pressures, needs and aspirations of politics.</P>
    <P>I urge the committee not to undertake a detailed remaking of a House of Parliament; rather it should lay down clearly defined principles as to what a 21st century second House should be, the categories of people who should be represented, the job the House should do and the contribution it should make to the overall <Col N="258" /> body politic.  The rest should be left to legislation. Constitutions should not be involved in detail or be over-elaborate.  They should not reflect as fixed principles what may only be current practice or the modish whim of the day.  They should lay down principles clearly and succinctly; those principles may be radical or conservative as needs be, but constitutions should not bind future generations with fixed ideas which may be out of date before they are enacted.  Also, if we confine ourselves to principles, practices can be changed more easily, through legislation, without having to resort to the cumbersome, expensive and uncertain process of referendum.  We could have made many more changes had we not been so constrained.</P>
    <P>What should the Seanad do and what role should it have at this point in the life of our country? We have covered this ground in previous debates.  It should do a number of things well. First, its principal job is the detailed scrutiny of legislation.  We do this well at present but we do not do it well enough.  We should never rush legislation; we should always allow time for reflection and consultation with other groups.  We also need a greater back-up service for the examination of legislation.  I accept that is a matter for parties rather than the Seanad but all parties should give it urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>Second, we should be a wider forum than the other House.  In the past, this House pioneered debate on key issues which were live for almost two decades; for instance, the efforts of the former President, Mrs. Robinson, when she was a Senator, to change the law on contraception, and issues like homosexuality, suicide and East Timor.  Those issues were first brought to light in this House and attracted great attention because we had the time to deal with them in a way the other House did not.  In the coming years this society will face enormous change from technology and the consequences of globalisation and the task of creating a fair society in the midst of prosperity.</P>
    <P>There is a range of huge issues which should be discussed in Parliament on a regular basis which are not dealt with in the other House but on which this House could lead the way.  The Leader referred to the European role, and there is also the matter of secondary legislation.  A great deal of provisions are made law through statutory instruments and as politicians we should be hostile and suspicious of all such measures.  We should examine them carefully on the basis that the Executive will always try to go further than it should &mdash; that may not be true but it is how we, as legislators, should approach them.  A fixed part of our business should be the detailed examination of statutory instruments, with proper back-up services to enable us to do it.  The former Senator, Professor Lee, made the good suggestion that regular reviews of Departments should be part of the annual work of this House.  Time <Col N="259" /> prevents me from going into the many other constructive ideas proposed in recent times.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for the reform of the composition and role of this House.  The process will only be done effectively if we can agree on the principles which should underpin the role and composition of the House and can enshrine these principles, not the details, in constitutional form.  We should translate these principles into reality through legislation, always remembering that Houses of Parliament are concerned first and last with the business of politics, both narrow and wide.  Let us not enter into the self-indulgence of constitutional engineering which will leave us and our successors infinitely worse off than at present.</P>
    <P>We should listen to the professors and experts but also remember what the former Senator Lee wisely said in the last debate on this subject &mdash; it is not expertise which ultimately counts but judgment, and as politicians we above all others are called upon to make a judgment.  Lawyers can tell us the law and economists can tell us about the economy, but we must make the judgment about what is in the best interests of all the people.  Our job is to justify this House, and we can only do this by making it a good House.  We are all agreed that is the best justification for the existence of the Seanad; let us now find agreement on common principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the future direction of the Seanad, its contribution and its relevance to society, which is one of several we have had since I entered the House in 1989.  I applaud the Leader of the House and the leader of the main Opposition party for their very reflective and studied contributions.  The report of the all party committee on the Constitution in May 1996 stated that:</P>
      <P>The need for a system of checks and balances in the legislative process and the need to bring as wide as possible a cross section of society into the representative system suggests the Senate should be retained.</P>
      <P>The position of the Progressive Democrats Party on its foundation was that in a unitary state such as ours there was no need for a second Chamber and we could get by without one.  Indeed, there are many example of countries abolishing their second Chambers, several of which are of recent origin.  However, we do not see an inconsistency between adopting that position and participating in an important institution of the State with a political dimension.  It would be improper of us as practising politicians not to participate in all the institutions of State, particularly those enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One suggestion is that the entire system could be changed to one of popular vote which would be taken at a regular interval.  However, one of <Col N="260" /> the conclusions of the all party committee was that this could lead to certain clashes between the two Houses and perhaps there is something to be said for avoiding that.  For the purpose of the debate, I am making a reasonable assumption that there will be a Seanad for the foreseeable future.  We can be reasonably sure of its complexion and that it will exist.  One of the principal reasons for this is that if one looks at the Constitution and the number of amendments or, indeed, major and fundamental root and branch changes which would be required in terms of the abolition of the Seanad, it would need to be totally overhauled and presented to the people as a single document rather than by way of individual amendments.  That is a logical conclusion to draw from any decision to radically alter the Seanad, particularly one to abolish it.</P>
    <P>The report also refers to &ldquo;the arcane nomination and electoral procedure to the Seanad&rdquo;.  A worrying aspect of modern society is that increasingly it appears that decisions fundamental to the people and the welfare of the State are taken outside of Parliament, be it the Dáil or Seanad, and that is unhealthy in a democracy.  Increasingly the Executive makes decisions, which are meant to be rubber stamped by Parliament.  Parliament is regarded as an inconvenience and the programme of legislation agreed by Government should just be pushed through irrespective of the wishes of Parliament.  That is not healthy and Senator Manning was right when he said there should be reflection on these matters, whether they involve legislation or general policy.  The Seanad could make a valuable contribution in the examination of policy as distinct from legislation.  Of course, there should be studied examination of legislation as it is important, but the policy aspect of a Government's legislative programme should also be considered.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to extra-parliamentary decisions. For example, the social partners come to Government Buildings to negotiate directly with the Government and as a result agreements are reached which are critical in terms of the economic welfare of the country, but at the same time Parliament has no function in those matters and that is unhealthy in a parliamentary democracy. A vehicle must be found to try to overcome that deficit.  It could most easily be overcome through a reform of the representational nature of the Seanad.  However, this is difficult because it is a political body.  It is correct that a House of Parliament is political and represents political parties, but it is difficult to reconcile that position with that of those who say there should be vocational representation and certain groups should have access.</P>
    <P>I am not sure certain groups who wish to be represented in Parliament would accept it if they could have such representation.  For example, the Irish Farmers' Association is non-party political. It is a significant national body with political influence and one reason why it has been so <Col N="261" /> cohesive is that it is non-party political.  I suspect that if the IFA, SIPTU or other similar bodies had the right to contest elections for the Seanad whether by county councillors, universal suffrage or its own members, they would be politicised to an extent they would not wish.  I do not have an easy answer to that conundrum.  This House is an important political institution of the State and if one were to try and broaden its representation into groups other than political parties, it is difficult to see how both can be squared.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present system of election, it is most often said on the university benches that councillors are not a representative electorate. They are a highly representative electorate in that they have been elected themselves and know very well the needs of their local areas and the country as a whole.  It is wrong to suggest they are not representative.  The alternative is universal suffrage rather than a confined electoral college. There are difficulties related to universal suffrage. The panel system does not produce the vocational Seanad which was intended, but again the reason is that it is a political institution and, obviously, political parties will attempt to ensure its members are elected to the Upper House.</P>
    <P>One suggestion made in reviews of the Seanad is that the Dáil and Seanad elections should be &ldquo;decoupled&rdquo;; just because the Dáil falls, the Seanad should not as a result.  An effect of that would be to stop the criticism frequently made that the Seanad is a resting home for politicians on the decline or on the up.  I do not accept that is the case and if the Dáil and Seanad elections were &ldquo;decoupled&rdquo;, it would have a dramatic effect on such criticism.  I am not prescriptive when it comes to the Constitution on other matters. It is wrong for us to be too prescriptive in terms of specifying to the all party committee on the Constitution, for example, what should be done.  This needs to be debated and teased out because there are side issues which do not become evident until one gets well into the examination of the main issues.  Senator Manning was correct when he said many issues should be studied by expert competent people who have academic qualifications and expertise in the area. I see nothing wrong with the Seanad being a party political House.  However, there could be difficulties, in the sense that if one were to try to extend that to organisations outside the political parties they could become politicised.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for the Government to have a built in majority with the 11 Taoiseach's nominees. We often regard the Seanad as an alternative Dáil with which it is in competition but that should not be the case.  However, one of the best Seanaid in which I was a Member was one where the Government was in a minority.  That Seanad worked extremely well because everyone took a reasonable and responsible approach.  The then Leader, Senator Manning, was kept on his toes to a degree which he might not have been otherwise. Nevertheless, it did improve matters.  The presence <Col N="262" /> of the Independent Members was an important check on the system.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate to examine the functions of the Seanad.  It is right to review legislation. The Seanad gives more reflective consideration to legislation.  It is good to see Bills being initiated in the Seanad because they are frequently better debated as a result.  I can think of many instances where defects in a Bill, which had slipped past the draftsman and the Dáil, were picked up in the Seanad because Senators had taken the trouble to study the legislation line by line.</P>
      <P>The provisions in regard to recommendations on Money Bills are archaic.  All Bills should be treated in the same way.  The most recent incident of a recommendation being made in the Seanad was in 1979 and it was accepted by the Dáil. Recommendations were also made on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>The connection with the European Parliament is very important and is the area in which the most progress can be made.  It is part of the Maastricht Treaty that there should be closer co-operation between the national Parliaments, the European Parliament and the European Union institutions.  For that reason, MEPs should have a right of audience here, although not necessarily the right to vote here.  It is impractical to expect European Commissioners to attend here on a regular basis but a Commissioner should be invited here twice a year or once in a session. Commissioner Kinnock's address was very useful.</P>
      <P>It is very important to monitor the increasing amount of legislation, regulations and directives coming from Europe, which this House could do. It is a defect in our system that the raft of European regulations, directives and legislation is, to some extent, imposed on us without the full debate which would take place if such measures were proposed by the Government.  I do not see why European measures should not be debated.</P>
      <P>Representation from the new Northern Ireland Assembly, or from Northern Ireland generally, is important.  There should be, by right, between two to four representatives from Northern Ireland.  This will have to be looked at in the context of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>It is totally wrong that the electorate for the university seats should be confined to graduates of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin.</P>

      <P>The question of providing seats for emigrants has been discussed on several occasions.  I think providing such seats would be a sop.  Emigrants should be entitled to vote in Dáil elections.</P>

      <P>I have been given all sorts of reasons that cannot take place, which are to do with technical matters, registration and so forth. However, if other countries can do it so should we.  Anyone who has left within a specified time should be able to vote for candidates in their home constituency.  It should not be possible for all the emigrant vote to be located in a single constituency where it would affect the outcome. However, some of the bogeyism which has gone on about how these terrible people who are abroad might affect and undermine the democratic system are canards.  The complexion of the Dáil would not change significantly if emigrants were given a vote.  After all, if they are citizens they should be entitled to vote here and the technology should allow them to do so.</P>
      <P>We are straying here into procedural areas, which are probably not appropriate to this debate as they do not impinge on the Constitution, but I think the question of a postal ballot does.  I do not see why the recent Seanad by-election was a postal ballot.  All Members of the Houses are meant to be here and I do not see why we cannot cast our ballot papers here.</P>

      <P>It is another relic of old decency or antiquity.  Perhaps it dates back to the time when people such as Gladstone came to Parliament two or three times a year and would have thought it a tremendous inconvenience to have to go to Parliament to cast their votes in a by-election.</P>
      <P>The issue of gender must also be attended to and is discussed in some detail in the second progress report of the committee chaired by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I broadly agree with the recommendations in that report.</P>
      <P>The Seanad should not be in competition with the Dáil.  However, I return to the difficulty of reconciling the political nature of this assembly and the vocational ideal to which many subscribe. A major overhaul would mean a total review of the Constitution from top to bottom and perhaps putting a total package to the electorate rather than individual amendments to the Constitution. There are no instant solutions.  I agree with Senator Manning that the Constitution should not go into detail; the Constitution should paint the brush strokes and the detail should be filled in by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Much of the legislation I have seen pass through the Upper House has been improved by the scrutiny it received here, which has been its main unsung contribution.  It does not get widespread coverage or approval but it is important work.  That work has been done pretty effectively by the House since I became a Member.  Senator Manning is also correct when he says that major issues such as homosexuality, East Timor, contraception and so on have been resolved by debates in this House and society has been changed as a result.</P>
    <P>We are just touching on some of these issues today.  I hope the all party committee on the Constitution will examine these issues in detail, look at some of the practical implications of what has been said today and make proposals which could be put to the people by way of referendum.  That would improve the House and make it more relevant because the criticism made is that the House should be more relevant to today's society.</P>

      <P>While I rarely translate into English what I say in Irish, I wish to reiterate in English at the start of this debate that I am very proud of the fact that I have been a politician on and off for the past 20 years of whatever persuasion or none.  I believe in politics and I believe, almost with a degree of arrogance, that the political process is the one place where society can be changed for better or worse.  Senator Manning said others can attempt to influence us, pronounce about us and introduce ideas, but politics is the only forum through which ideas, however good or bad, can be brought into societal effect.  It is the only place where things can be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of debating with Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien in Dingle at the beginning of May.  At the beginning of an informal discussion a number of people started by saying &ldquo;I am not interested in politics, but.&rdquo;.  He made a valid point when he replied to the effect that if one was not interested in politics one was not interested in people.  While this is a little harsh because some people are detached from politics, I am not aware <Col N="265" /> of any other institutional way to change the lot of people in society.  However limited it might be and however much I may criticise my colleagues, I continue to strongly assert the primacy and centrality of politics in changing society.  That is one of the reasons I am here.</P>
    <P>Many of us, including myself, probably get a little too sanctimonious.  Many of us enjoy politics and much that goes with it, although we suffer much to be able to enjoy it.  However, we are also here because, unlike many others, we want to make a difference and we succeeded in persuading those who elected, nominated or appointed us that we had a contribution to make.  Most Members make their contribution in different ways, some of which I would not be too keen on and some of which are very good.</P>
    <P>Unlike some of the Members who sit on the Independent benches I have never besmirched people because they are members of political parties. I have often said there are different roles for different people.  One is the role of an Independent Member which gives certain freedoms and limitations; the other is the role of members of political parties, which gives people the capacity to influence at a level which an Independent Member cannot reach, but which also imposes constraints.</P>
    <P>Much of what passes outside these Houses as criticism of the Seanad is an attack on politics. For example, it is often said the Seanad is a failure because it is too politicised and because the political parties dominate it.  There is nothing wrong with political parties.  That is self evident, although Independent Members try to strike alternative poses.  I have not been a member of a political party so far in my political career in these Houses.  However, that is not to say anything other than political parties are both necessary and important &mdash; not a necessary evil but a positive part of our political process.  This applies even to those political parties I believe we could do without.  I will not mention names since Senator Dardis is present.</P>
    <P>We want to stop being defensive both about this House and about politics.  This House now works at least 200 per cent harder than it did when I first became a Member in 1981.  It sits three or four days a week and the involvement by all Members in the committees amounts to an enormous amount of work and requires enormous preparation if people are to contribute effectively to the range of legislation that is passed.</P>
    <P>The only difference between politicians and the rest of the world is that we must make our compromises in public.  When politicians join Government and support things they do not like they are accused of hypocrisy.  There is nothing hypocritical about politicians who have to make judgments about what they do or do not support. It is much more hypocritical to have people in positions of influence outside politics who omit to mention their connections with the business <Col N="266" /> world, some of the things they write about and the perks and the benefits.  For example, in the case of journalism these include the circuit of receptions, functions and informal contacts which are part of the natural role of journalism but which, if our little compromises are despicable, are even more worthy of suspicion because they are not declared, not identified and rarely made known.  It is on that tone that we should assert ourselves.</P>
    <P>I never had any patience with the proposal to abolish this House even though no rational person could say democracy would collapse in the morning if it was not here.  It is a question of the nature of our democracy, our society and the way our politics have evolved.  A large chunk of our democracy cannot suddenly be taken apart unless there is an overwhelming reason to do so, although it can be changed.</P>
    <P>Earlier I put together a list of ideas I thought made a Seanad worthwhile.  Many of them are already being done here, although some could be done better.  The first, which everybody has identified, is that we are part of the legislative process. In this regard, people should not confuse influence with power.  It is very uncomfortable when Ministers attending the House are put under considerable pressure because of the lack of logic, principle or thought in legislation.  It is little enough consolation for any practising politician to know measures will be passed if a vote is called.  There is a fundamental level of accountability involved when Ministers must justify their position to the House.  The process educates them.  I have seen Ministers attend the House determined not to listen to anybody but, over the period of a few years in politics, they realise such an approach is not worth it and that it is humiliating to appear before the House with badly drafted legislation, irrespective of the numbers in the House.  It would be nice to have been here in the days when they were very tight, but that does not get away from the fundamental of accountability. It is a fact that we should be and continue to be part of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>When the previous Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution addressed the legislative role of the Oireachtas its tone was a little smug.  There is a sense of the inherent superiority of Dáil Éireann in terms of its ability to analyse legislation which no objective evidence would support. The committee was under-representative of the Seanad.  Of the two Members of the Seanad on the committee, one was an elected Member in her first term as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the other had spent most of his life in the Dáil and was only temporarily a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>Seanad Éireann was poorly represented on that committee.  Its other members were never Members of this House.  It is like being a goldfish in a bowl, being analysed by people who do not know what the place is like.  The wisest thing that committee could have done would have been to <Col N="267" /> establish a sub-committee made up mostly of Members of Seanad Éireann.  That sub-committee could report to the committee which would then decide what to do.  Experts from outside politics were sought to discuss Seanad Éireann with the committee but it did not think to establish a representative group of Members of Seanad Éireann to discuss in detail how the Seanad should work.  That was presumptuous and I, as a person who takes this House seriously, resented it.</P>
    <P>The committee did, however, make some sensible recommendations such as the need to avoid institutional duplication.  If we spend weeks on Committee Stage of legislation introduced here, it should be recognised as pointless to go through an equally long and tedious Committee Stage in the other House.  There ought to be a way to reduce that level of duplication.  It would help if when legislation is introduced in this House, one does not gain the impression that the Department is not ready to deal with any amendments and is waiting to go before the Dáil before thinking seriously about them.  The Employment Equality Bill is an example of this &mdash; many of us on both sides of the House struggled for a long time to have even commas inserted.  Weeks later, we discover 27 amendments were accepted in the Dáil and then presented to us to be accepted.  That is not the way to balance the legislative process, it is not the way to put together proper institutional arrangements which reflect the work of this House.</P>
    <P>The need to incorporate fundamental accountability into the way in which the European Union impinges on the lives of citizens in this State and the manner in which this House could assist in that has been mentioned.  There is no doubt that Europe is regarded as remote and as something over which people have little influence.  It has been good for us so far and for that reason people are prepared to ignore the fundamental lack of democracy in the way it does its business.  It would be useful if we could work with Irish MEPs, agree on issues which need to be dealt with on a European level, and then have the right to initiate Europe-wide legislation, a right which only the Commission only has at present.  It is a fundamental flaw in European democracy that the only body not elected by or accountable to the people, and which can be made up of people who were never elected, should be the only body with the power of initiative.</P>
    <P>This House could feed that through Irish MEPs if the European Parliament had the power of initiative.  We need to make the institutions of Europe not appear to be accountable by glossy public relations campaigns but be truly accountable meaning that if people do not like it they can change it.  Accountability means the ability to change the system of government if you do not like it.  If that unqualified right does not exist, there is no democracy, there is no intermediate <Col N="268" /> position.  Europe is not democratic at present and we could contribute to making it so.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has a third role as a forum for ideas.  Senator Manning mentioned some of those ideas and many people are astonished at the way ideas which have been raised here by individual Senators have ultimately become central to political debate in this State.  That is a useful role and one which will continue.</P>
    <P>There are as many new ideas needed now as before.  We have not reached the end of history, there are new ideas the political consensus which exists to an alarming degree does not mention. One such issue is globalisation and the danger of having one country dominate the world agenda politically, economically, militarily and socially. That is not the way for global democracy to develop, to have one country's ideology and self interest become that of the entire planet.</P>
    <P>There are other ideas.  I would like this House to spend a considerable amount of time discussing the issue of immigration before we run into huge problems.  All we have seen so far in regard to this issue are the signals which suggest we will make all the mistakes that were made in other countries &mdash; forcing immigrants into ghettos, making their lives difficult and abusing them for claiming social welfare while not allowing them to work.</P>
    <P>Another area is the development of the global information network and the need to think through what this means.  It is not necessarily an unqualified good thing.  We are in danger of creating an isolationist society in which individuals will increasingly sit in front of a computer screen.  I am not keen on the idea that you do not have to leave your house to work, shop or be educated.  Sooner or later there will be cyber-based religious services so you will not even have to leave your house to go to church.</P>

      <P>That is a reason to sustain and defend that institution.</P>
      <P>This House needs a fundamental structural change in terms of membership, to build into its representational capacity the representatives of civic society, the sort of people who will be represented by the civic forum in Northern Ireland. That sort of forum in this State with a proportion of members becoming Members of Seanad Éireann would be useful.</P>
      <P>There should also be representatives of the regions, selected by the regions, as Members of Seanad Éireann.  We need to transform our regional government, give it real powers and create a proper institutional link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am enthusiastically in favour of changing the franchise for the election of Members representing third level education, although the wording of the committee on this is peculiar.  In the constituency from which I would seek election, <Col N="269" /> the phraseology states that the south Munster third level education constituency centres on University College Cork.  Where did the committee get that notion?  Why is the university the centre of the universe?  People write things like this without thinking and create a hierarchy of priorities in education and everywhere else, a hierarchy which is way out of date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the review of the Seanad.  I am the longest serving Member of the House with more then 29 years' service.  I have enjoyed every minute of it and I express my gratitude to the present Leader who has allowed this debate.  I sat on the Opposition benches and I thank Senator Manning for his fairness and consideration when he was Leader of the House.  He conducted the Business of the House in a proper manner and allowed everyone an opportunity to express themselves.</P>
      <P>I sat beside Senator Jan Sullivan and, while I knew her politics, I never knew her religion.  As someone who comes from a northern county where religion and politics are intertwined, I cherished the thought that I did not know her religion until something controversial happened in Limerick.  I told that story at home many times as an example of the good relations in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>A mixed bag of people, including a university professor and others like myself who come from an agricultural background, represent various constituencies in the House.  This is a useful Chamber for debating issues in a balanced way.  I did not run for election to the Dáil or even stand for a party selection convention because I am happy in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a review of the Seanad.  Few mornings go by without someone raising an urgent matter in their constituency on the Order of Business.  The Cathaoirleach allows Members to do this and that is of great help.  However, Question Time should be introduced in the Seanad.  This was proposed some time ago but the response was that it would not be feasible to have a Minister here to answer 25 questions on different subjects.  We should make the procedures more formal and effective rather than using the Order of Business to raise urgent issues.  This affects someone like me who comes from a rural constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities must be seen to have a role in electing Members to this House.  Elected representatives are constantly under pressure from the media or community groups.  I support many community groups who do tremendous work on community projects.  However, there is a hard core of people who believe that elections to county or urban councils are a nuisance; they want a decision making facility without the responsibility.  Recognition must be given to local authorities which do trojan work.  Local councillors spend the best years of their lives working to <Col N="270" /> resolve problems in their areas.  It is not a profession but a way of life for which they do not get paid nor are they compensated.  Their role in this House should not be diminished.  I question the right of universities to nominate people to the House, particularly as this puts local authorities in rural areas at a disadvantage.  Every local authority should have a representative in this House.</P>
    <P>We must review the structures periodically. Members should be represented on the constitutional review committee.  There may be one or two Members on it at present but that is not enough if we want it to be effective.  If a review of the Garda Síochána or the Department of Agriculture and Food was being carried out, they would have representatives on the review committee. There must be cross-party support for Seanad representation on the constitutional review committee.</P>
    <P>I hope local authorities will be strongly represented in the Seanad.  I do not want to see the day when they will not have an input to make because that would lead to an imbalance which could be dangerous.  Everything is now centred on Dublin where half the population lives.  People from rural Ireland are being forced to work or go to university in the city.  It is now compulsory for a person who passes the entrance examination to the Civil Service to work for two years in Dublin. A magnet is drawing people into the city.  It will be a serious mistake if rural Ireland is under-represented in this House.</P>
    <P>The House should change its procedures to allow EU Commissioners to address it.  I was here when Commissioner Neil Kinnock addressed the House.  It was a useful exercise because I was able to ask him questions about the provision of funding for national primary routes between the North and South and valuable information was exchanged.  I urge the constitutional review committee to allow EU Commissioners to come before the Seanad to answer questions of interest to the House and the country.  That would help to strengthen the role of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I hope the constitutional review committee recognises that it is unconstitutional to ask someone like myself who is from Donegal to canvass the entire country.  The cost and effort involved in canvassing is prohibitive for a new candidate. The Dáil election is restricted to a constituency and the European Parliament election is restricted to a region.  It is time the House considered this serious matter.  If someone does not have the means to travel the length and breadth of Ireland, they will not be elected to this House.  A person would need to be a sports star or someone who is recognisable and therefore acceptable to the nation before they would be elected, or they would need large resources to travel the entire country.  I ask the constitutional committee to look at that serious aspect.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty whatsoever in having an effective Seanad based on the European constituencies. In that way every part of Ireland would <Col N="271" /> be represented in this House.  That would strengthen the House and provide a better opportunity for the legislation to be seen to work for the whole country.  If we allow a review of the Seanad to take place with an extension of the universities' vote to the Regional Technical Colleges, it will be at the expense of local authorities in rural Ireland and that will be a mistake.  It will never be accepted.</P>
    <P>There will always be those who call for the abolition of the Seanad.  The best way to ensure the future success of the Seanad is to make it work for all the people.  The Seanad is a useful forum and I want to see it continue, but it is long past time when it should look at itself and at the structures and the mechanisms by which it works.</P>
    <P>People must have the opportunity to raise urgent matters.  There must be some such procedure available to me on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  I do not want to be always imposing on the Cathaoirleach of the day.  I strongly urge that we look at the possibility of making such a provision.</P>
    <P>Any review will only help to enhance the effectiveness of the Seanad.  The nation could not do without the safety valve which the Seanad provides for legislation and procedure.  The Seanad is an important legislative body and I can only see it improving.</P>

      <P>When a man or woman in the street asks what is the function of the Seanad and how does it differ from the Dáil, the first thing that comes to my mind is that it is a non-confrontational Chamber.  Those of us who sit here cherish the fact that we can have a civilised debate. We can raise issues which the Dáil may be unable to tease out to the same degree because of the pragmatism of day to day politics.  All would agree that debates are non-confrontational and that we get opportunities to raise issues of importance which may not deal with the day to day business of politics.  That is because the Seanad reflects the vocational nature of its constituent parts and, although we are politicians, I do not forget and I do not believe other Senators forget, from where they receive their nomination. In the examination of legislation I, as a Labour Panel nominee of ICTU and the ASTI, try to reflect the views, issues and concerns of my nominating body.  The vocational nature of the Seanad has been maintained to a degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with most Senators who said that we could take more time to create a forum for projecting a philosophical view of where we, as a country, are going.  Between 1989 and 1992 I remember listening carefully to Professor John A. <Col N="272" /> Murphy who had strident views on Northern Ireland and many other issues: he was interested in foreign places and this is reflected in this evening's Private Members' motion on East Timor.  The fact that we can look beyond the Twenty-six or the Thirty-two Counties, and even beyond the EU, and seek to raise issues of concern &mdash; such as famine in Ethiopia and the Sudan, and refugees, and a number of global concerns which are not always reported to the degree that they should be in the national newspapers &mdash; is extremely important.</P>
    <P>On such issues as neutrality, which may be controversial at a particular time, I would hope we could debate it here without any hassle.  Every time there is a referendum the subject of neutrality is tossed back and forth.  This does not reflect what is neutrality, what it means to us and how we would deal with such a subject at a time when we would not be asking people to support a yes vote for the Maastricht Treaty or the Amsterdam Treaty, for example.</P>
    <P>Any criticisms of the Seanad which I have read do not suggest that the House should be abolished; far from it.  Fifty-nine out of 178 democracies have a second chamber so we are in line with modern democracies.  Critics ask if the Seanad has any power and do we, as I believe we do to a certain extent, operate in the shadow of the Dáil and Government.  I do not think those who defined a role for the Seanad in the Constitution anticipated the powerful Government control of the Legislature which was brought about by standing orders and the Whips system.  This has led to the Seanad not having the power it should.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should and could have new powers which do not overlap with those of the Dáil.  At a time when the buzz words are openness and transparency, perhaps the Seanad could review the appointment of senior public figures.  If the Seanad conducted tribunals of inquiry, we would be extremely busy.  Perhaps we would not have much time to do anything else with the number of tribunals there have been in recent times.  The net result of those changes would be that we would be even more transparent and accountable. I suppose that critics will say that if the Seanad, like the taxi system, is to be reformed, it should not be tinkered with but should be reformed from the bottom up.</P>
    <P>Mention was made to extending the franchise. I raised this issue many times.  There is a Bill, which has the support of the Fine Gael Members, to extend the franchise to the University of Limerick, Dublin City University, the institutes of technology and other appropriate third level institutions. Let us take the University of Limerick as an example, because it was established recently and its first graduates emerged in 1976 &mdash; there were 65 then and there are 2,207 today &mdash; and its graduates would reflect modern Ireland.  I am not saying that the other universities do not reflect the views of their graduates, but the extension of <Col N="273" /> the franchise to modern colleges would, in the view of the 1937 Constitution, reflect modern views.  I asked for this many times between 1989 and 1992 and again recently, and we hope all Members of the House will support the Bill to extend the franchise to the University of Limerick and the other appropriate third level institutions. Dr. Ed Walsh is leaving the University of Limerick having received tributes from every corner of the country.  As university president he spoke out on many issues and he was almost always controversial.  He flagged markers for the kind of society we want.  We may agree or disagree with him, but he is now leaving.  It would be appropriate to extend the franchise as a tribute to what he has done for Limerick and for Ireland. The University of Limerick is considered a top university in the European league and has very strong links with American universities.  The president-elect of the University of Limerick is Professor Roger Downer, a Northerner, who has come from Thailand where he set up a university and previously worked in the University of Waterloo in western Ontario.  It would strengthen cross-border relations if the University of Limerick with its 2,000 graduates headed by a Northerner, were enfranchised.  We might return to this subject at another time.  I hope we do not have to wait too long for the review and in the meantime I hope we extend the franchise to people who are disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>We must forge greater links with Members of the European Parliament and not ignore our MEPs except during European elections.  They should be in the Seanad speaking to us about European legislation which influences so much of our lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the views expressed by Senators.  The Seanad needs to be reformed.  It has a place in the body politic because every state needs a second chamber where legislation can be carefully examined and if necessary changed.</P>
      <P>All graduates should have a voice in the election of Members to this House.  The franchise is restricted because of an accident of history.  Had the newer colleges existed when the Constitution was written their graduates would have been given the vote.  I would not object to an increase in the number of university Senators.  Their contributions to debates are always of a high intellectual standard and balance the contributions of more ordinary people like myself and Senator Jackman.</P>
      <P>The Seanad franchise should be extended to allow representation to emigrant groups.  Hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens live abroad and it is important that we give them a voice and listen to their views.  I can think of no better forum for the expression of their views than Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All shades of opinion in Northern Ireland should be heard here.  Northerners should be permitted <Col N="274" /> to speak on legislation which affects their part of the country.  We should find some mechanism to allow representation to the mainstream political parties in Northern Ireland.  Those of us who want an inclusive Ireland could not object to that.</P>
    <P>This House could play a much more important role in European affairs.  Members of the European Parliament have no right of hearing in the Oireachtas.  They should have the right to address this House and take part in our debates.  We have excellent debates here but they are often no more than that.  Many of the issues of the day are not aired here except on the Order of Business when they are referred to only briefly.  We could provide a forum for minority groups such as travellers. Those of us who are members of local authorities hear the views of our electorate but the views of travellers and other minorities are not sufficiently recognised.  Their views could be heard in this House.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas does not provide a forum for young people.  They are the country's future but we have no forum where we can listen to what they have to say.  We should invite representatives of youth organisations to the House to hear their views.</P>
    <P>We need to make our debates more open and controversial because the House can be a sleepy place.  We must open our doors, allow new people to come in and make the House more relevant to public life and to the issues of the day.  Our debates should include more interraction between Senators and Ministers.  We could pursue subjects which have already been discussed in the Dáil more fully.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is one of the major issues facing our society.  We should invite employers, trade unions and all interested parties to discuss this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Senator Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to elaborate on views expressed in the House over the past ten years.  During almost every Administration since I first came into the House we have debated this matter.</P>
      <P>There is a need to look at the structures, procedures and powers of this House.  This debate is timely because the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution is currently deliberating on the the future of the Seanad and on many other consititutional matters.  Our interest is in the shape of the House in the new millennium. All of us agree that there is a need for change. Otherwise we will become political dinosaurs. Change takes place in every generation but change for change's sake is not a good thing.  In changing institutions of state one must hasten slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of key issues must be addressed and I hope the all-party committee on the constitution will do so before its deliberations are finalised. <Col N="275" /> The report of the O'Keeffe committee, contained a number of wide ranging proposals and I wish to nail one of them.  I do not believe it is in the interests of the House that there should be a change to the election procedure as outlined by that committee.  It is not in the interests of the Seanad that the other House should have the right to nominate Senators, that there should be external direct elections for Senators and that the balance should be drawn from an amalgam of other interested parties, such as professional bodies and local authority members.  Local authorities guard jealously their right to elect Senators and that right should remain.</P>
    <P>Whether the panel arrangement should continue is another matter.  I have no objection to the panels as they are organised.  I am proud to be here as a nominee of the Library Association of Ireland, having made a conscious decision that that was the route I wished to take to secure election to the House.  I have a keen interest in the public library system and my role in the House is not only as a party member but to represent and further the views of the Library Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It would not be a good idea to follow the advice of some academics to allow the House to become a body purely representative of the professional organisations.  The Seanad is a political body, irrespective of its make up.  Senators are here as politicians taking political decisions which may have far reaching effects on the electorate.  If the House were narrowly based on representative interests it would not be good for democracy. Although the Independent Senators are elected by a narrow electorate they do not take a narrow view in the execution of their duties in the House. It would not be in the best interests to have a narrowly based nomination and election procedure which would result in Members pursuing the interests of their relevant trade and representative bodies.</P>
    <P>I agree that the role of the House should be expanded to include a European dimension. There should be more debate on EU Directives which, in many cases, receive scant attention from the Oireachtas.  The House may first come across such directives when the relevant legislation is debated.  The House debated a Bill yesterday on the Geneva Convention Protocols arising from an EU Directive of some months ago.  The Bill involved the ratification of a treaty from 1977. The House should have a greater role with regard to European matters, not only by inviting a Commissioner to the House but by setting aside time each week to exercise a legislative role with regard to EU Directives.</P>
    <P>The House is greatly restricted in the manner in which it can debate Money Bills, principally because it cannot table or make amendments to them.  I understand that the reason for this is more hereditary than it is based on logic.  In 1911 the British Government introduced such a restriction <Col N="276" /> to reduce the powers of the House of Lords which was frustrating that Government's budgets. I do not foresee this House being allowed to adopt such an aggressive approach.  However, I see no logic to the continuation of a bar introduced by another Administration which carried through the political settlement of the 1920s.  We should make our laws for our people based on our experience.</P>
    <P>I hardly think that if this House was given the right to draft and table amendments to Money Bills it would lose the run of itself, irrespective of the complexion of the political contributions, and go out of its way to frustrate the Administration's fiscal policies.  There is a need for the all-party committee to allow the House some flexibility in this regard.  The present inflexibility leads to an erosion of public confidence in the House.  It is seen as being somewhat irrelevant because we can talk about money until the cows come home but we cannot table amendments which might be accepted.  That situation should be changed.</P>
    <P>The changes I suggest would improve the role of the Seanad.  We are in a time of change.  This and future Governments will not allow the present arrangements to continue.  It is incumbent on Members not to resist change because we are afraid of it and not to be afraid of the future because of what it may hold.  We must take the initiative while we can so that we might make an impact in the ongoing debate.</P>

      <P>Senator McGowan outlined a nightmare scenario of tramping around the country seeking votes in a Seanad election campaign. That falls to us all if we wish to be elected to the Seanad.  The Senator also referred to the star qualities that would be required of candidates if the electoral arrangements were changed.  I have no doubt Senator McGowan has the necessary star qualities to be elected.  I am proud to be a politician and a Member of the Seanad.  It is a great tribute that people think enough of us to cast votes in our favour, a tribute we should be honoured to accept.</P>
      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas have worked well since their inception.  They were born out of the Civil War and the taking of power by the majority on the departure of a minority rule.  We have managed to make the Houses work.  The Seanad had its genesis in the nominations of people so that the Unionist community would not be frozen out and that its views would be represented at the centre of the Administration.  It did not work and we have been paying for the failure of the political process in Northern Ireland for over 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem arose from a difference between what I would call the English and Irish political views.  The English view is based on the people of the UK and the majority of Unionists considering the primacy of the electorate to be exercised through the House of Commons.  To put it crudely, what the House of Commons says is law.  The <Col N="277" /> Irish political view sees the political process as the primary function.  We talk about the primacy of the political process wherever it happens, even if that is not in the Dáil or the Seanad.  The political process is ongoing &mdash; we must talk and listen. That is the great strength of the Irish political system.</P>
    <P>The allparty committee's review of Seanad Éireann has a tenor of condescension running through it and it is obvious that those who carried out the review feel the political process is concentrated in the Dáil.  They are right in the sense that the Members of the Dáil are directly elected by the people and are responsible to their constituents. Seanad Éireann is constituted from an amalgam of a direct election from a minority electorate and appointments by the Taoiseach. However, that should not be considered a weakness.</P>
    <P>Causing dissent between the Seanad and the Dáil would lead to major political problems.  This House can make a contribution to political life. The answer lies in the eighth conclusion of the second progress report which states:</P>
    <P>The second major issue to be confronted is that of giving the Seanad new powers that do not overlap with those of the Dáil.  These might include the review of senior public appointments or the conduct of tribunals of inquiry, as well as a number of others.  The arguments in favour of doing this seem to us to be much stronger than the arguments against.  The net result could well be an Irish political system that is more transparent and accountable, which almost everyone (at least almost everyone outside the core executive) would regard as a good thing.  We therefore suggest that very serious consideration indeed be given to the possibility of giving the Seanad new powers that do not overlap with those of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We could advance the democratic process a great deal if those in powerful positions, with little accountability, were appointed to the Seanad.  For example, people such as the Director General of RTÉ who is important in moulding the views of the public, and editors of national daily newspapers could discuss their views, give us the benefit of their thoughts on their mission statements and tell us how they think Ireland and the world should be run.</P>

      <P>As I am a Member of the Seanad for less than a year, I wonder how qualified I am to comment on the role of Seanad to the same extent as other Senators.  Senator McGowan spoke about his 29 years in the Seanad, while I have been here less than 29 months.  As a member of the current all-party committee on the constitution, this debate is important and I thank the Leader for arranging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not a Member of the all-party committee which compiled the second progress report which was published in 1996.  A number of Senators <Col N="278" /> referred to the fact that only two Senators sat on that committee.  However, there is a much stronger representation from the Upper House on the current committee.  Members need not fear that the views of the Seanad are not represented by Senators who attend the committee regularly and are excellent contributors.</P>
    <P>The fact that so many Senators have referred to the need for change prompts the fundamental question whether the Seanad in its current form is working.  If it is not, it is perhaps failing in its role and duty and we must urgently address the issue of reform.  The second progress report was drawn up two years ago and once again we are debating it.  The nettle of reform has not been grasped by the previous Government or the current one.</P>
    <P>Who will take the initiative on reform?  Committees such as the all-party committee can produce erudite reports.  This is a good report and the issues investigated, such as the electoral system, are also important.  However, it is easy to produce reports &mdash; our shelves are full of them but where are the action and the initiative? Changes will not be easily implemented because constitutional alterations will be needed.  Is the House living up to the role to which it should be living up?  Is it a failure in its current form?  If this is true, the issue must be urgently addressed.  Who will take the initiative and when?</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on two related issues &mdash; first, our role and function and second, representation and franchise.  What is our role in 1998 as we approach a new century?  I studied politics and I have experienced a Seanad election and the vocational system first hand.  One would have to ask about its relevance in the current era.  The vocational panel system, as devised by Éamon de Valera in the 1930s went out of date rapidly. Ireland has changed a great deal since then.  Even by the 1960s that system had outlived its usefulness, having been devised in a political and economic climate which changed radically within a decade of the Second World War.</P>
    <P>The National Social and Economic Forum gives the Government and major players in society, including unemployment, social, voluntary and community groups, a seat at an important table.  Senator Ryan referred to a civic forum.  However, this is a forum where groups can have an input to Government policy and are given access to Ministers.  Does it take power away from where it should be or was it constructed because this House is not seen as relevant?</P>
    <P>Should we have a system which allows not only gender balance, but social, voluntary and community groups to have a more formal electoral representative role in the Houses?  We consider our electorate to be broad and we do our best to represent a wide range of interests.  However, is the current system as representative as it could be?  One can only conclude that it falls short in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Gender balance is important.  This democracy will not be truly representative until there is a better gender balance in both Houses.  How political parties promote women is a wider issue in terms of political representation.  However, it is one that cannot and should not be ignored. Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned our relationship with the European Parliament and the extent to which MEPs could play a role in this House.  He also said that European Commissioners could make appearances in this House.  That could give us a unique role and function and could easily be taken on board.  The whole issue of our relationship with the European Parliament and our role in scrutinising European legislation in particular could give us a uniqueness and relevance, particularly in the public domain.  It appears there is widespread agreement on that matter which could and should be pursued.</P>
    <P>I wish to move on to the question of the franchise and who elects Members of Seanad Éireann.  There is simply no argument in relation to the universities in this day and age, considering the extent to which large numbers of graduates are disenfranchised.  It could make an enormous difference if the franchise was extended and there is very little argument against doing so.</P>
    <P>In principle, electing Members from Northern Ireland is an excellent idea and one which is currently being explored by the all-party committee. We have had a useful exchange of information with officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government as to how that could work in practice.  We should not underestimate the technical difficulties involved and obviously it has much broader political implications, but if the will is there it could be done.</P>
    <P>The same point could be made with regard to votes for emigrants.  I am disappointed that that issue has not been advanced to a greater extent. My party colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he was Minister for the Environment, was not able to advance that issue.  I agree with Senator Dardis that if the will is there it can be done.  Other countries manage to allow their citizens who live abroad to vote.  I have received correspondence from Irish citizens living abroad who do not have a vote of any description and are totally disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>This issue is not as current as it was because we have, in effect, net immigration.  In the 1980s we had massive emigration involving young people who felt they had been forced to leave.  As a result, that created a particular edge to their sense of exclusion due to unemployment and lack of opportunity.  That has changed totally, however.  If people leave now it is by choice to gain experience or, given the global economy, to move within a large company.  Coming back is a choice they can make at any time and that has taken the edge off the votes for emigrants issue. Nonetheless, it is an important principle about which the all-party committee will be making <Col N="280" /> strong recommendations.  I would not limit the notion of votes for emigrants purely to this House.  While we could have a role in that regard, the principle should extend across both Houses.</P>
    <P>We should not be afraid to be different or unique, although up to now our experience in this House has shown that we do not have a different or unique role.  It is an honour to be a Member of Seanad Éireann.  However, on the day after being elected to this House the only question any reporter put to me was &ldquo;Why would you want to be a Member of the Seanad?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What does the Seanad do?&rdquo; In other words, I was being asked to justify my existence.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Dublin based national media think the Seanad is irrelevant.  That is not something one picks up outside Dublin in the local media where there is an appreciation that to be a Member of Seanad Éireann, particularly in a local context, is important and relevant.  It has a relationship with local government, to which other Members have referred, which is extremely important.  That is sensed and understood.</P>
    <P>We must get the message that we have to reform to be relevant.  It is an urgent issue.  To come back to the point I made initially, if there is an acceptance of change that suggests there is a recognition that there is a problem.  There is a recognition that in many senses this House is not working.  If there is a broad acceptance of that we must tackle the issue urgently.  I call on the Government as a matter of urgency to come forward with a programme of initiatives for reform. The Government should work closely with Members of the House and, in particular, with the Leaders who are people of long experience. The Government should listen to your views, a Chathaoirligh, and your experience of the House. The issue should be treated as a matter of urgency and should receive the important attention it deserves.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar ath-struchturú ar an Seanad &mdash; go b'hféidir leathnú ról agus obair an tSeanaid &mdash; a phlé anseo.  Tá mé sa Seanad le bliain anuas agus dáiríre tá déanta doimhin machnamh agam go pearsanta ar an taithí atá agam anois agus na tuairimí a bheadh agam ar obair an tSeanaid agus na gnéithe a bhaineann leis anseo.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss perhaps not the changes in the Seanad but the broadening of the role of the House.  I have been a Member of the House for one year so I am a relative new-comer. To some extent I have carried out my own personal review of the past year.  In that regard I have been endeavouring to reconcile what might be the perception of Seanad Éireann abroad with the reality as I have found it during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have found that Senators work exceptionally hard.  They take their jobs very seriously and certainly do their research.  They are sincere in what they do and there is a minimum of political rancour <Col N="281" /> in our debates.  Perhaps that is already the perception among the public regarding Seanad Éireann and I hope that is the case.  On the other hand, we should welcome the opportunity of any reform that would improve the performance of Seanad Éireann and make it more accessible.</P>
    <P>I am always intrigued by the procedural gymnastics in which we must all engage each morning on the Order of Business in order to avoid the benevolent and watchful eye of the Cathaoirleach and ensure we might be able to make what we would regard as an important and relevant point. On the Order of Business we have raised such diverse issues as civil rights abuses in East Timor, nuclear testing in India and Pakistan, the death penalty in the US and the good news that Killarney will have an increase in jobs.  The Cathaoirleach has been exceptionally patient with us in that regard.  It often struck me that it was a pity we did not consider that in some way we would be able to elaborate on those contributions as statements of urgency.  I do not mean it cannot happen as it is but I am talking in the context of reform of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We should have an opportunity of informing and reflecting public opinion as a matter of urgency.  Items raised in the Seanad are very topical. Usually Senators hear about issues by listening to a morning radio programme or reading about them in the newspapers.  It is important that a representative body like the Seanad would make a developed, reasoned and thoughtful contribution to the debate because it could play an important role in the way that debate would develop subsequently.</P>
    <P>The composition of Seanad Éireann is based on the vocational principle.  Those of us who had to garner votes from public representatives know that we stand for a particular brief by way of our nomination, background or experience.  I was on the Cultural and Educational Panel and, therefore, see myself being on the front line on matters related to those headings.  I have discovered that people who approached me to make representations, subsequent to being elected, generally dealt with the brief which I believe that I have.</P>
    <P>Bearing all these issues in mind I believe we could consider a reform of the Seanad.  We live in an age of required transparency and accountability. I see no reason an interest group, however it may be selected, could make a contribution here followed by a debate by Members.  This suggestion might sound radical but I do not see anything wrong with radical reforms of the Seanad which would make it more relevant to community needs.  For instance, the concerns of Gaeltacht areas can only be expressed by individual Senators or Deputies.  A representative group from several Gaeltacht areas could make a submission here directed at the Seanad.  Likewise, an international representative group, while observing procedures, could present themselves here to make a submission for subsequent debate.  In that <Col N="282" /> way we would create a definite link with the constituency we represent.</P>
    <P>I would not disagree with the university franchise in regard to electing Members to the Seanad.  Some people have reservations in that regard.  Senators elected by university panels bring with them an experience and point of view in an era where education is so important and we cannot deprive the country and ourselves of the opportunity of hearing those views.  Indeed, their representatives are quite eloquent in many ways.</P>
    <P>We have often paid lip service to the Irish diaspora and yet there is not a single representative here.  We would have a more informed, assertive and successful assembly if our diaspora were represented. The same would apply if we had representatives from the Nationalist and Unionist communities in the North.  We talk about breaking down barriers but in an era of instant communication I see no reason we should not invite representatives to attend from the Nationalist, Unionist and Irish diaspora communities.  It would provide us with more informed debates.  It is within our power to do this by way of constitutional change or otherwise and it would give much greater meaning to this House.</P>
    <P>We are also told that Europe is the main legislator. At times we feel subservient to Europe and there are many changes which affect the quality of life here.  This is the price we must pay for the grant aid we receive, but there is so much legislation coming on stream and there is no opportunity for Dáil Éireann to debate it properly or to process it in any conclusive manner, that we are dealing with abbreviated versions, newspeak and the single page handout.  Yet we are committing this country, our welfare, our future and legislative powers to Europe.  It would make a lot of sense if the type of Seanad I suggested, which would include representatives from the North and South and the Irish diaspora, could debate European legislation.  We could analyse it and pinpoint the difficulties, weaknesses, dangers and strengths that might exist.  I do not know who would object to us doing that.  I believe we could use our time exceptionally well in the context of European legislation because of the calibre of Senator, coupled with the minimal political rancour which exists in this House.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people suggest that the Seanad is a system of checks and balances on the legislative process.  We are to some extent but I would like to think the Seanad is much more than that.  I would not like to think we were always the second line in the legislative process because the debates I have heard here do not suggest to me that we are an inferior part of the Oireachtas. When major issues arise which provoke cynicism among the public regarding politicians, whatever the new and fresh scandal might be, the Seanad could become a tribunal of inquiry in its own way. I do not mean to hand out sentences, indictments or whatever but if we could discuss issues here without political rancour and create a transparency <Col N="283" /> we could remove a lot of the cynicism which exists.</P>
    <P>I criticise the media for its treatment of this House.  On the one hand the media highlights the cynicism which exists about politicians and, on the other, it gives very little coverage to the debates in this House.  Increased coverage would give Senators an opportunity to indicate that they are playing a full and meaningful role in the democratic process.  In my opinion, the media may be misjudging or underestimating the public's demand and hunger for proper information.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted that the majority of people are slaves to alarmist headlines.  The majority of people exercise discretion and discernment, they want to know the full facts and they want to be helped to make up their minds. Usually one is obliged to consult the newspaper editorials to obtain an inkling of the essence of current news stories.  I invite the media to give more attention to Seanad Éireann and to this debate in particular.</P>
    <P>I have not heard Senators state that the Seanad is beyond reproach or that it is a perfect institution. In a time of change, the House must review its procedures and performance.  Many suggestions on possible reforms have been put forward and I hope they are considered as a matter of urgency.  I would like to believe that today's debate marks the beginning of a larger process. Following the summer recess, I hope the Leader will make it possible to lay aside two to four sessions over a period in which we can breakdown the various contributions of Members and consider the documentation from the review committee on a section by section basis.  I do not suggest that the House try to take control of the reform process but we must show we are prepared to initiate, encourage and be part of such reform.  I intend to suggest to the Leader that we continue this debate by taking on board the various points made today and the content of any subsequent contributions, including those made by the public.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my views to the arguments already made about the restructuring of the Seanad.  The report of the review group &mdash; I do not agree with everything in it &mdash; is not concerned with politicians or the standing of this House as a political institution.  It focuses instead on proper representation of people from all walks of society in the House, such as those representing voluntary groups and educational groups and, from a legislative point of view, barristers and solicitors.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of the Seanad for a number of years.  I might not be one of the most elegant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;speakers and I might not be inclined to waffle on about a particular point, <Col N="284" /> but like other Members, such as the Cathaoirleach, who has been here as long as I, I recognise the value of the Seanad.  It is not easy to accept that some people believe they know it all and that they can make statements in reports but how did we do our work before these reports were published? I would like that question to be answered. The people who write these reports point out what is being done in other countries but Ireland is doing just as well as those countries.  They ask if there is a need for a second House but I would be very careful about posing questions of that sort.  They state that Portugal and other countries have only one House of Parliament but at the same time legislation in those countries provides that another House can be established after general elections.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in stating that there is a need for a restructuring of politics and of the Seanad.  It must not be forgotten that the committee system was not introduced until 1984.  Have things improved or have we introduced reforms or developed better legislation since the committees were established?  Would we be better off if people from the groups and professions to which I referred at the outset were Members of the Seanad?  I do not believe so.</P>
      <P>I have taken part in six Seanad election campaigns. I am conscious of the fact that each vote I receive in an election actually represents 1,000 votes.  The authors of the report recommend that people from other walks of life should be permitted to seek election to this House.  In my opinion, a Member of the European Parliament should not be allowed to be a Member of the Seanad. However, they should be made accountable to this House because they represent the people. They should also be made accountable for the five years they spend in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The European Union is important to Ireland and we have obtained exceptional benefits as a result of our membership.  Debates on Europe have taken place in this Chamber which could never take place in the Lower House.  I could speak for a month on the way the Seanad works in comparison to the Dáil.  However, all I will say is that Members of this House are far better placed to question Ministers on particular details than are their counterparts in the Lower House. I can make approaches to Ministers in the Seanad in a way Deputies cannot do in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We have had many great debates on legislation with Ministers in this House and our amendments have been accepted without any great difficulty. I have won many arguments with Ministers and I have done exceptionally well in having amendments accepted.  Regardless of the side of the House from which amendments are tabled, if Ministers believe them to be important they will be added to the legislation before it is sent to the President for signing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one has made the argument about what the Seanad means to Members.  I make no apologies for the fact that I am not concerned whether <Col N="285" /> members of the media cover the proceedings of the House.  What does concern me is that the legislation we pass is important to the people.  I do not care whether what I say is reported or whether my photograph appears in the newspaper.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business Members referred to the photograph of a suicide victim which appeared on page 3 of a particular newspaper.  If newspapers are not accountable for their actions, someone should ensure that they will be in the future.  We are the legislators and if the actions of certain newspapers cause people to lose their lives they should be made to answer for them.  We debated this issue for 40 minutes this morning on the Order of Business and Senator Ó Murchú was correct to state that we should not be obliged to do so.  Action must be taken on this issue; perhaps this House is the place to initiate such action.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to legislation which has been introduced in the Seanad.  The Companies Act, which took two years to complete its passage, was initiated in this House.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, was also introduced in the Seanad &mdash; it was amended in the Lower House &mdash; and Members voted against the Government in respect of it.  I am no expert on criminal justice but when the Act completed its passage through the House every Member was well versed in that area.  The blend of Members in the Seanad is different to that which obtains in the Dáil.  I intend no disrespect, but the Lower House is responsible for ensuring that the lights on our streets are lit.  If they are not, Deputies will lose votes.  That is the nature of local politics.</P>
    <P>This House is responsible that proper amendments are made to legislation.  For example, let us consider the recent child care legislation passed by the House a number of months ago.  Some Independent Members would not allow the Bill to pass unless amendments were made, and in the end the Government agreed they were right.  That would not have happened in the Dáil but it happened here because we took more time over it; we were able to speak to the Minister, and no Member was in a hurry with the Bill.  Politicians do not recognise this in themselves.  I have always given credence to the person who says the right thing, irrespective of who they are or who they represent and it is important that this House does not lose that tendency.  We should not demean ourselves because the media or other people do so.  We do not have to look up to someone because he is a journalist &mdash; he means no more to me than anyone else.  That is what the public expects of us.</P>
    <P>This House is important for our people.  Who thought we would ever have decriminalised homosexuality?  This House made significant amendments to that legislation.  I did not attend the debate but I listened to it in my office and learned from it.  The Acts on legal aid, companies and setting up the Environmental Protection <Col N="286" /> Agency were also important; they were raced through the other House but not through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>What would people say if we kept the District Court and the High Court and abolished the other two courts?  We should always have a second option.  Would anyone argue that there is no need for an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court or from the High Court to the Supreme Court?  It is the same argument as saying there should be only one House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In politics we should move carefully because we are speaking for everyone, not just a particular group.  Different lobbies speak to us but this House acts in the interest of everyone.  I do not deny the need for restructuring and I would be the first to do it &mdash; I am a motivated person and I want to get on with the job &mdash; but we should not give the impression that a new person would be better than the person he replaces, because that is not always the case.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with people who can be extremely constructive, sometimes more constructive than I, who give me their first preference vote because they think I deserve it.  Those people have served this country very loyally for very little, unlike some of those who report to us and give the impression that they know it all.  I have listened to people who have spent 45 years in public life and have been in no hurry to leave them.  I have also listened to people who have spent five years in public life and who are learning. I have just listened to a person who has been in the Seanad for 12 months and has learnt what this House is about, and I thank him for acknowledging it.  I remember one Member who said, when he first came here, that the Seanad should not exist; today he said that in no circumstances should it go.  That is a change but I am prepared to accept it because when people come here and see what happens, they realise that under no circumstances should we allow one legislative body to decide everything.</P>
    <P>There should always be another avenue and the example of that is in the courts.  A person involved in a District Court case should have the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  Politicians make the most constructive decisions which suit everyone because they have to do it.  People have found that legislation does not allow them to do certain things, and now politicians have to restructure, at local, national and international level.</P>
    <P>The importance of this House should not be undermined.  I am proud to have received votes from the people who elected me and I will not allow anyone to demean me for that because that demeans those people also.  Those who vote for me have been elected by the people.  I have heard from people who have never knocked on a door for a vote but who seem to know everything.  I am not trying to run down people who produce reports, or those in this House who gave the <Col N="287" /> impression that it should not exist.  The other House thinks it knows everything but that is not true.  No House knows it all and the proof of that is in the courts.  Cases ultimately go to the five judges of the Supreme Court who will decide what is right.</P>
    <P>Are people saying that the other House can debate all aspects of health, say, on a particular day?  Members of this House can do what Deputies cannot do &mdash; we can put down a question for a Minister at 2.30 p.m. and receive a reply at 8 p.m. Perhaps politics or voting arrangements do not allow a Minister to do that in the other House, but he has to reply to an Adjournment matter here.  What we have in this House is unique and we should not waste it.  A Senator has the right to put a question to a Minister on behalf of any organisation, and he will get a reply before 8.15 p.m., but that does not happen in the other House.</P>
    <P>We should not have to apologise to anyone because we are not on television or in the newspapers. The most important thing we can do is to represent everyone.  I do not refer to North or South &mdash; we should have a proper blend.  I have no objection to Senators from the North but Senators should be representing us in the North also.</P>
    <P>Just because journalists question us, that does not mean they know everything and we see the proof of that today.  Lives will be lost because of what is in a newspaper owned by a monopoly, and we should condemn that at whatever cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be a Member of this House and appreciate my experience since I was elected last August.  I have learnt greatly from others and some of what I learned has not been for my own good.  However, I appreciate one cannot win them all.</P>
      <P>I am still on a learning curve with regard to the work of this House.  I looked up the definition of &ldquo;senate&rdquo; in the dictionary and it stated that it was &ldquo;a council of wise old men&rdquo;.  Happily, that has changed.  The men are not that old and I do not know how wise they are, but there has been some form of gender balance in the House in recent years, but obviously not enough.  Women comprise 51 per cent of the population and this is not reflected in the number of female Members in the House.  I appreciate there is a possibility of reform because the vocational panels and nominating bodies reflect the ethos of the time they were formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Constitution was drafted women mainly worked in the home.  It was not until the 1950s that there was growth in the work patterns of women.  The marriage ban was not lifted until 1972 and the ability of women to gain the experience that would allow them to receive a nomination was exceedingly limited.  I do not have any problem with the nature of the vocational panels given the increase in the numbers of women in <Col N="288" /> the workforce and access to education to women. The people elected to these panels bring with them the requisite skills.  I deeply resent the notion that because people are politicians they do not meet the requirements of the panels.  I do not know of anybody on a nominating panel who does not have the required experience.  The House benefits from the wealth of experience Members have professionally and politically.  It is something to be proud of and it should not be hidden.</P>
    <P>There should be visible encouragement of women into the Upper House.  I referred to the council of wise old men but it would not be as wise as a council of wise old women.  The life experiences of women and men are similar in many ways and totally different in others and this provides a good balance to debate in the House. There is nothing wrong with having an Upper House and I am very happy to have been elected to it.  I do not understand the cries we have heard. When there is little else happening there are calls for Seanad reform, whether it is to do with not having a system to elect emigrants or the removal of the Trinity three on the University panels.  I appreciate life is about change, which can be good and bad.  If Seanad reform is to take place one hopes it is constructive not destructive.</P>
    <P>We should be fair and equitable in terms of the representation of graduates.  All graduates should have the right to vote, as I and many others have. If I attended the University of Limerick I would not have that opportunity.  I acknowledge that the reason for three Trinity graduates was to make sure there were no excluded minorities.  That was wise and sensible but by retaining three seats for them when there are only six we are excluding people.  It should be opened up to graduates of all third level institutions.  I may possibly annoy my good friend, Senator Norris; but he is not here and I doubt if he will read the report.  We cannot be partisan on behalf of certain colleges.  For example, I contacted UCD and was told 40 per cent of graduates entitled to vote for NUI candidates come from UCD and we would discriminate against them if we opened up the six seats to all graduates.  That is not right.  If one attends college and obtains a degree one should be entitled to vote in Seanad elections.  It would make the list of candidates more interesting, exciting and less predictable.  Finally, submissions could be sought from groups that would reflect the role of women more than is currently the case on nominating bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have learned a great deal about legislation since I entered the House 12 months ago, but nevertheless the public perception of the Seanad is not what it should be.  Our job is to make the House more relevant and to try and improve its structure through reform.  One of the criticisms levelled in the press is that we spend too much time debating issues, but the press does not give us any coverage.  I receive more media <Col N="289" /> coverage when I speak for five minutes at meetings of Ballina UDC than I receive speaking in the Seanad over a six month period.  There is something amiss when such a situation prevails. The same could be said for other urban councils as they attract more local media interest than the Seanad.  I would find it much easier to get coverage in the <i>Western People</i> for a speech to Ballina Urban District Council than I would for a speech in Seanad Éireann.  We should work to change that.</P>
      <P>One way to make that change would be, as some Senators have suggested, to get interest groups involved in our work and to provide a platform for such groups to give their views on different aspects of Irish life.  In that way we might be able to identify niches which need attention and areas which need urgent examination.  I am sure it would be possible to provide such a platform as part of the talked about reforms.  For example, Senator Ó Murchú referred to Gaeltacht interest groups.</P>
      <P>I do not think Senator Cregan's comparison of the Seanad with the courts is very relevant.  One of the obvious failures of the Seanad is its lack of power to change anything, which certainly could not be said of the courts which have authority to reverse decisions.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the virtual impossibility of raising matters of topical interest on the Order of Business because of the time restraints, while there is considerable padding of speeches during the rest of the day.  I know the Cathaoirleach must attend to his duties and that the Order of Business as it is constituted at present does not allow for such matters. However, a platform should be provided in the mornings whereby issues of national and local interest could be raised.  We would attract media attention by so doing because the journalists leave the Chamber after the Order of Business. That area badly needs to be reformed.  The Cathaoirleach should be given latitude to allow Senators raise relevant and topical issues.</P>
      <P>I know there are mechanisms for raising matters of concern but that procedure can sometimes be somewhat off-putting and the designated time at the end of the day's business may not suit Members.  There are severe restrictions in that area which need to be reformed.  Senators would utilise time far more effectively if they had those opportunities rather regurgitating speeches made in the other House and engaging in what journalists call &ldquo;padding&rdquo;.  We need to have an opportunity to raise issues which could be very relevant and which might receive media coverage, given that we are all talking about the lack of attention paid by the media to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good there is a climate of opinion in favour of change, although we will have to wait to see how radical and far reaching these reforms will be.  Not enough time is being allocated to this debate because it will probably be our only opportunity to contribute to this reform process. <Col N="290" /> We can blame only ourselves afterwards if we do not agree with the end result.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge referred to the need for gender balance.  We would all like to see more women Senators because their contributions are always very relevant.  I have spoken to women's groups, especially in County Mayo, which are interested in public life but had no idea of the functions of Seanad Éireann.  They were very interested in hearing about the composition of the Seanad and how it operates.  It is good to see such groups emerging but they do not get the necessary opportunities.  I know of a group which is very articulate and involved in many local development issues, and which would welcome an opportunity to present its views to a forum such as this and to receive some public recognition for its work.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am amazed by people's lack of knowledge about the operation and functions of Seanad Éireann.  I hope this ongoing debate, which I welcome, will result in some worthwhile and overdue reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the territory of East Timor has been illegally occupied by Indonesia since 1975 resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 East Timorese; bearing in mind that the human rights situation in East Timor has deteriorated since the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Bishop Carlos Belo and Dr. Jose Ramos-Horta in December 1996; in light also of the recent collapse of the Suharto regime, Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; press for the implementation of the 1997 UN Commission on Human Rights Resolution on East Timor;</P>
      <P>&mdash; press for effective on-site UN monitoring and;</P>
      <P>&mdash; use every means at his disposal to ensure that the temporary regime of Mr. Habibie acts to release the acknowledged Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao and to hold an internationally monitored plebiscite on self determination for the indigenous people of East Timor.</P>
      <P>I am especially pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, is in attendance because I know of his genuine concern in this area.  I recall being on the barricades with him on this issue in previous years.  A succession of very good Ministers have also taken responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> It is appropriate the Seanad should debate this motion because this House has always had a special interest in the affairs of East Timor.  It was raised for the first time close to the original tragic invasion of the island of East Timor by our former distinguished colleague, the then Senator Mary Robinson, subsequently President and now fulfilling an important role as the UN Commissioner for Human Rights.  I recall subsequently signing a motion for Mrs. Robinson in the company of Senators Ryan and O'Toole.  It is especially satisfying to recall that on each of these occasions there was unanimous support from all sides of the House on a non-partisan basis.  It is clear this will happen again this evening.  I welcome the absence of an amendment to the motion.</P>
    <P>We are a small country but we have played, and can continue to play, a significant role in the resolution of this situation.  It is very heartening to note the role played in Irish public life by conscientious and idealistic political lobby groups.  In this instance the work of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign must be mentioned.  I salute the work of Tom Hyland, who is in the Chamber this evening, on which I have spoken at length previously.  I do not, therefore, intend to rehearse all the details of the remarkable story of his involvement in the matter.  However, it is worthy of note that no less an authority than Professor Peter Carey of Oxford University, in a statement on the collapse of the Suharto regime which was carried on the international wire services, paid special tribute to the work of Tom Hyland and indicated that he had played a significant role in the downfall of the Indonesian dictator.</P>
    <P>This by any standards is a remarkable achievement. Indeed, I have often wished that some Government would take note of this kind of work in a practical and imaginative manner.  Seanad Éireann would be greatly enhanced in its debates on international human rights issues if a future Taoiseach was to have the vision to nominate Mr. Hyland to this House as one of the Taoiseach's eleven.  Previous Taoisigh have had this kind of vision and nominated, for example, people of an independent cast of mind from the North of Ireland.  It would send a significant signal to people like the dictator Suharto and his successors that the Irish people take these kind issues very seriously.</P>
    <P>I referred to previous debates.  There is a certain grim satisfaction in seeing matters unfold in Indonesia and East Timor very much as some of us predicted over the years.  It is approximately seven years since I predicted that the Indonesian dictatorship would disintegrate from within for economic reasons due to the staggering scale of corruption surrounding Suharto and his circle. This was at a time when virtually all nations were pursuing what they perceived as their own economic self interest in the Pacific rim area and were not inclined to be over critical of the human <Col N="292" /> rights abuses of the Suharto regime.  I am glad to say that from time to time, especially in the work of former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, Ireland has taken a stronger line in this matter than any of our European or international allies.</P>
    <P>Now the situation predicted has come about and, even from self interested motives, it is important that Ireland demonstrates solidarity not just with the oppressed peoples of East Timor but also with the equally oppressed people of Indonesia.  A visit to East Timor was arranged for me a year or two ago.  I was illegally removed from an aeroplane by the Indonesian secret place. It was a foolish action because it concentrated attention on people who would otherwise have been rightly regarded as fairly insignificant.  When I returned home I was complimented on my courage. I did not display any; the people who displayed courage were the Indonesian people who organised our tickets and who probably could have been traced by the secret police.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the fall of Suharto and his replacement by Mr. Habibie.  I do not, however, believe that this is the end of the matter.  Habibie is clearly a transitional figure.  Nevertheless much appears to be changing.  Even the impersonal forces of fate and destiny, called ironically by the Greeks the Eumenides, or the kindly ones, played a role with the helicopter crash on 5 June in East Timor which removed from the scene as if by divine intervention the entire senior Indonesian military leadership in East Timor, including some spectacularly unsavoury persons who had been involved in widespread human rights abuses and torture.  Let me remind the House that this torture included slicing the flesh of civilian captives in front of their fellow villagers and rubbing chilli powder into the wounds, burying people up to their necks in the blazing sun until they died from heat stroke, literally tearing children from the wombs of their mothers and smashing the heads of infants off blocks.  One recalls also the massacre at Dili itself which the world, thanks to the work of people such as John Pilger, Max Stahl and of course our own Tom Hyland, now recognises at last and deplores.</P>
    <P>However, the misery is not completely at an end.  While we in Dublin were celebrating Bloomsday on 16 June, a young man, Herman Soares, aged 21, was shot by Indonesian soldiers while collecting wood with his cousins, dying en route to hospital.  This led the next day to a demonstration of about 3,000 people who accompanied a black sedan carrying the body of Soares.  Led by students from the University of East Timor they sang and prayed as they made their way to the Governor's office and then to the provisional parliament building.  A few dozen students occupied the parliament building briefly and strung up banners critical of the Indonesian military.  One banner read &ldquo;Demilitarise Timor &mdash; When?&rdquo; East Timorese students also demonstrated <Col N="293" /> in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, where last month protesters took over the national parliament after security forces shot at least four student demonstrators.  It was these deaths that triggered the protests and riots which were instrumental in forcing President Suharto to step down after 32 years in power.</P>
    <P>The murder of Herman Soares was not unusual.  What marked a difference was the uncharacteristic response of the Indonesian military authorities who apologised for the shooting and announced that an officer had been detained for questioning.  To many in East Timor Mr. Soares has become a martyr.  His death sparked a series of protests which concentrated on a demand for a referendum on the status of East Timor.  A member of the Timorese parliament, Florentino Sarmento, a former solider with the army of Portugal in Indonesia, said &ldquo;I think it is understandable because we have been living under oppression for so long, so the students are coming out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was also highly unusual that despite the political turbulence few Indonesian soldiers were visible on the streets of Dili, a marked contrast to seven years ago when Indonesian army troops shot dead more than 50 people in a similar protest. Greater press freedom has also emerged and the fact that the soldiers stood back and allowed students to occupy the parliament building would have been unthinkable a few short months ago.</P>
    <P>The deputy chief of the East Timor Military Command, Colonel Mudjino, was quoted by <i>Agence France Press</i> as saying &ldquo;What happened was a mistake by the armed forces and I have ordered a thorough investigation.  We have apologised to the family, to the Bishop and the public in general.  In essence our personnel were at fault. There was no reason for shots to be fired since the soldiers only suspected the victim of stealing wood.&rdquo;.  Mr. Soares was in fact gathering wood to provide ballast for his truck which he was driving with his cousin, Olandino Soares.  Olandino, who has already lost two of his own brothers in the conflict, is quoted as saying &ldquo;It is better to let the military go to their own country, if they stay here they will kill us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I note from today's <i>Irish Times</i> that the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas, who we in Ireland will remember for his undignified behaviour when confronted by Deputy Spring in New York, has said that his government was ready to give East Timor special status in an attempt to find a lasting solution to the issues. President Habibie is also to meet Nobel Prize winning Bishop Carlos Belo.</P>
    <P>However, what is missing from the report is the sinister connection which Alatas is attempting to establish between the granting of special status &mdash; which in any case is quite inadequate at this point &mdash; and the release of the Timorese leader, Xanana Gusmao, to recognition by the international community that East Timor is part of the integrated territory of Indonesia.  This is an astonishing <Col N="294" /> and cynical piece of impertinence on the part of Alatas.  It is not possible to mitigate one breach of human rights with another.  Moreover, the question must be asked in terms of his suggestions that the substantial elements of this special status can be discussed with Portugal.  This suggestion breathtakingly eliminates from such discussion the representatives of the very people most centrally involved, the East Timorese themselves. I therefore call tonight for the direct involvement of representatives of the East Timorese people in any such negotiations.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mr. Habibie, although there have been some concessions with the release of prisoners etc. there have been no substantial political reforms.  The new President, B. J. Habibie, has said that he will wait until 1999 before calling new parliamentary elections.  This is mainly so that he can place his own people in positions of power and strengthen his position in the government. The military see him as a caretaker President and he wants to stay in power until 2003 when the next Presidential elections are due.</P>
    <P>The economic crisis in Indonesia continues to be harsh, with reports of food shortages coming in from the outlying provinces.  There is also a certain amount of infighting going on within the military.  One example of this is the fact that the head of the armed forces, General Wiranto, appointed General Johnny Lumintang as head of Kostrad, the strategic reserve command.  Lumintang, however, is a Christian and this was found to be unacceptable to the Islamic generals.  This indicates that the armed forces are not loyal to the Republic of Indonesia but have loyalty to regions in Indonesia or to other Islamic generals.</P>
    <P>All the signs indicate that although Suharto is gone the regime remains essentially the same.  Mr. Habibie is a crony of Suharto and most of the other cronies also remain in power.  The armed forces are still the main force in Indonesian political life and do not want to give up this position which allows them the biggest say in the day to day running of the economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the island of East Timor itself and its current situation, there are still about 20,000 Indonesian troops occupying the island. The Timorese themselves are demonstrating on a daily basis both in Jakarta and Dili for a valid act of self determination so that they can decide their own future.  Under international pressure Habibie has released about 14 East Timorese political prisoners but scores more remain in prison.  Many international leaders, including a Freeman of the city of Dublin, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, have lobbied for the release of Xanana Gusmao.  Mr. Habibie now offers to release Gusmao and reduce the number of Indonesian troops in East Timor in exchange for the international community accepting East Timor as part of Indonesia.  Naturally, the Timorese have rejected this as blackmail.  Xanana Gusmao should not be in prison and the Indonesian troops should not be in East Timor in the first <Col N="295" /> place.  However the fact that Mr. Habibie wants the international community to &ldquo;accept&rdquo; Timor as part of Indonesia is a first admission by the Indonesian government that they know the international community does not accept Indonesian control over East Timor.</P>
    <P>The three main demands of the Indonesian people and their leaders are: the immediate and unconditional release of Xanana Gusmao; the withdrawal of Indonesian troops from the territory; and a plebiscite or referendum by the people of East Timor on the issue of self determination.</P>
    <P>The East Timorese resistance forces have offered a generous peace plan.  Phase one consists of nine steps which are as follows: a call for an immediate end to all armed activities in East Timor &mdash; Fretilin has already offered a ceasefire which was rejected by the Indonesians; the reduction of Indonesian troops to a maximum of 1,000; the removal of all heavy weapons; the release of all political prisoners; the gradual reduction of Indonesian civil servants in East Timor; the introduction of UN specialist observers in human rights and political rights; an objective census of the population to ensure that only indigenous East Timorese rather than transmigrants can vote in any referendum; the establishment of a Human Rights Office; and an end to military control of the media and political censorship.</P>
    <P>Phase two consists of four steps to take place over the next five to ten years.  First, Portugal and Indonesia to normalise relations; second, the legalisation of all political parties; third, the appointment of a permanent EU representative and finally local elections to be held under the auspices of the UN.</P>
    <P>As a third phase, within 15 years the people of East Timor should be allowed a democratic decision between full independence or integration with Indonesia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago I was approached by a young woman who worked for Trócaire who wanted to talk to me about East Timor and I had never heard of the place.  Subsequently this House debated the imminent Gulf War and I mentioned East Timor as an example of an invasion of a sovereign state by another power which did not generate the same heat as the invasion of Kuwait. Members of this House asked me afterwards where East Timor was and I was unable to tell them precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing was that East Timor was invaded in the early 1970s and until the late 1980s the world and its media turned their backs. I agree with Senator Norris that a large section of the world would still have turned its back if it was not for the extraordinary efforts of Mr. Tom Hyland and the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  This campaign has now got international <Col N="296" /> recognition as an extraordinarily effective campaign which has used constructively the willingness of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs to use the EU to bring pressure to bear.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental issues which need to be addressed about the nature of the Indonesian regime.  This regime came into power and subsequently massacred at least half a million if not one million of its people.  It was approved by the western world and for many years it was regarded as a place of stability in Asia and as a model of development.  Now it is neither stable nor developed.  It has turned out to be what many of us who knew Indonesia knew it would always be &mdash; corrupt, rotten at the core and a military dictatorship. That military dictatorship, which was put into power with the explicit support of western Europe and North America, proceeded to invade East Timor and decided unilaterally to annex it.  It has no more right to be in East Timor than Germany had to be in France or Denmark during the Second World War or Israel has to be in the West Bank &mdash; that will probably upset Senator Norris.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no moral or legal basis for any of these things.</P>
      <P>To the great credit of a succession of Irish Governments, we have taken a reasonable lead in this regard and we continue to do so.  However, it is extremely important to ensure that no type of mealy-mouthed intermediate compromise is foisted on the people of East Timor.  We have enshrined in our Constitution in the past month the principle of consent.  We have said this is the principle which we, as a State, believe is the way to settle disputes about sovereignty and the nature of government in areas where there is a dispute. We cannot say the principle of consent, which is the correct principle, applies to six counties of this island but somewhere far across the world a different set of global geopolitical strategies means we cannot do something as simple as ask the indigenous people of an area what is their view on how they should be governed.</P>
      <P>We have been good until now on these global issues.  However, there are gaps in our morality in terms of our policy in the area of arms exports.  I want to quote from a document published by AFrI about licences to export military equipment, particularly licences awarded to a company called Moog in my home area.  Moog has been awarded licences by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Licences were scrutinised and approved by the Department of Foreign Affairs to sell military equipment to Singapore.  Singapore is a well known staging post for dubious arms sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which is the best authority on these matters, says there are only two countries to which this equipment could be sold.  One of those <Col N="297" /> two countries is Indonesia.  We undermine the moral position we have justifiably claimed for ourselves by allowing a firm in this country to get involved in the export of military hardware to a regime such as that in Indonesia.  I invite the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, to address the morality of our armaments industry.</P>
    <P>British Aerospace is also involved in supplying weapons to Indonesia.  There would be a sick irony if, in a time when we are attempting to demilitarise part of this island which has suffered from conflict for 30 years, British Aerospace became a more extensive contractor to Shortts in Belfast and we expanded an armaments industry in Belfast when we are trying to get rid of armaments on this island.</P>
    <P>Moog has adopted a moral position on this issue.  In the AFrI report, &ldquo;A Supplement to AFrI's &lsquo;Links&rsquo; Report&rdquo;, it states: &ldquo;we are aware which particular pieces of equipment are destined for a defence application, and we do not rely on the &lsquo;dual use&rsquo; approach&rdquo;.  In other words, it is saying it is not a hypocrite because it knows what it sells.  It believes the Government should put together a convincing policy about such matters and it will obey the law.  It is not that a company in Cork is attempting to hoodwink anyone.  It is being open, honest and truthful and it is selling to a market which is available to it.  It is up to the Minister and the Government to tell Moog what to do.</P>

      <P>The company wants a logical licensing policy. It is not fooling anyone or pretending this is something else.  The Government gave it a licence to sell equipment which has ended up in Indonesia and which will, therefore, be used for the wrong reasons.  It is up to us not to besmirch our excellent moral position on East Timor by being involved in any way in the export of arms to that most despicable régime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Norris for moving this motion and I join with him in praising the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign and Mr. Tom Hyland.  Were it not for the work carried out by such groups and NGOs, many of the problems about which we are concerned would not be brought to the attention of the media, the Government or the Parliament.  The situation in East Timor has been brought to the attention of <Col N="298" /> the people by Senator Norris and Mr. Tom Hyland.</P>
      <P>It is easy to ask why we should worry about East Timor when we have problems in Ireland.  I remember talking to a Congressman in the United States about the problem in the Middle East and he told me to get out of his office and try to solve the problems in the North of Ireland instead of annoying him about the Middle East.</P>
      <P>The problem of East Timor goes back to before it was invaded in 1975.  I am sorry the role of the Australians has not been brought to the fore because they have played a more insidious role in what has happened in East Timor than the Americans or anyone else.  Were it not for the support of the Australian Government, the Indonesian Government would not have been able to carry out genocide in East Timor for many years.  The Australians are heavily to blame for many of the reasons associated with trade relations between larger countries and their near neighbours.</P>
      <P>East Timor is a country rich in minerals.  Like in many other countries, multinational companies or big neighbours attempt to side with genocidal groups because of the potential for financial reward.  The potential for financial reward for Australia in getting involved with Indonesia and forgetting about the East Timorese is huge, but we must not forget the role of the British in this. The British arms industry is to blame for much of what has happened in East Timor.</P>
      <P>If one reads Mr. John Pilger's new book, <i>Hidden Agendas,</i> one must conclude that the Australians have very short memories.  In &ldquo;Anzac Day&rdquo;, which forms part of a chapter in that book, Mr. Pilger outlines the heroic efforts of the East Timorese to prevent the Japanese from taking over the region.</P>
      <P>With regard to the British and the arms trade, in the chapter &ldquo;Flying the Flag: Arming the World&rdquo; Mr. Pilger states that in 1898, Hilaire Belloc wrote in <i>The Modern Traveller:</i></P>
      <P>Whatever happens, we have got</P>
      <P>The Maxim gun and they have not.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what happens in the world today. The smaller countries do not have the modern equivalent of the Maxim gun and the poor must fight the arms dealers.</P>
      <P>According to the book, in 1905 Vickers paid Sir Basil Zaharoff £86,000 as their chief salesman and made him a millionaire.  He &ldquo;understood the connection between arms and power, diplomacy, spying and bribery, and flying the flag, regardless of whose flag it was&rdquo;.  The comparison between 1905 and 1998 is a fair one.  Zaharoff said &ldquo;I made wars so that I could sell arms to both sides&rdquo; and &ldquo;I must have sold more arms than anyone else in the world&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there are three big arms suppliers in the worlds: America, Britain and France.  The arms dealers in these countries have no moral qualms about where those arms are sold.  The British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin Cook, who was preaching <Col N="299" /> against arms sales to the Indonesians when he was Labour Shadow Spokesperson, is now selling arms in that area.  A recent survey suggested that less arms were sold during the years the Tories were in power than when the Labour Party has been in Government.  However, it must be said that when the then former British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, alluded to higher motives, stating that under the UN Charter all sovereign states have the right to self defence, so there is nothing wrong with selling arms to friendly countries to allow them to defend themselves, he was referring specifically to Indonesia.</P>
    <P>According to Mr. Pilger, Indonesia's military dictatorship, one of the most bloodthirsty in the twentieth century, gets most of its arms from Britain &mdash; Hawk ground-attack aircraft, Sea Wolf and Rapier surface-to-air missiles, Tribal class frigates, Marconi and other battlefield communications equipment, sea-bed mine-disposal equipment, Saladin, Saracen and Fernet armoured vehicles, Tactica &ldquo;riot control&rdquo; vehicles &mdash; with water canon optional &mdash; and a fully equipped institute of technology for the Indonesian Army. No less a person than His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, got into the act when he suggested that minor wars do not count as long as we can sell to the people who are conducting them.</P>
    <P>The Australians could create an atmosphere in Oceania in which they could do something about Indonesia.  The British could stop this war in the morning if they wanted to.  On the Irish involvement, whereas there is a moral imperative to do something about the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia, there is very little we can do except keep bringing the problem to every forum possible. A debate in the Seanad will not make that much difference, but we have seen in the past that the more places in which such problems of major world concern are referred, the better.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reciting a short poem by an East Timorese.</P>
    <P>Names without faces</P>
    <P>Hearts stabbed</P>
    <P>with memories</P>
    <P>of the tears of children</P>
    <P>shed for their parents .</P>
    <P>More than death</P>
    <P>made them utter their last word</P>
    <P>in every tear the cruel spectacle .</P>
    <P>the whimpering of a mother</P>

    <P>The rags</P>
    <P>which cover her</P>
    <P>in tatters</P>
    <P>in the dim of her own flesh</P>
    <P>cruelly scorned</P>
    <P>by the Indonesian soldiers</P>
    <P>one by one <Col N="300" /></P>
    <P>on top of her</P>
    <P>Inert, the body of a woman</P>
    <P>becomes a corpse</P>
    <P>insensitive to the justice</P>
    <P>of the dagger</P>
    <P>which has liberated her from life</P>
    <P>and in the meantime .</P>
    <P>blows of the rifle butt</P>
    <P>resound</P>
    <P>in the tear drops</P>
    <P>of the very same children</P>

    <P>and .</P>
    <P>the tears dried</P>
    <P>in the memories of the children</P>
    <P>replaced by the sweat of the struggle .</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the sweat of the struggle of the people of Indonesia will continue irrespective of whether the new Government thinks it has changed.  The people of East Timor will continue their struggle against repression.  I hope tonight's debate will make some difference to their plight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apt that today, because of the motion in the name of Senator Norris and the Independent Group, Members of this House should again have the opportunity of reflecting on the subject of East Timor.  The Indonesian President, B. J. Habibie, recently held talks with the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in East Timor, Bishop Carlos Belo, in Jakarta on the future of the island of East Timor.  We await with hope news of the outcome of these talks, but it is a hope tinged with the knowledge of the brutal atrocities which have been and are still being inflicted on the indigenous people of East Timor by the Indonesian Army at the behest of its Government.  We must remember not only the genocidal policy pursued by the Indonesian Army in 1975 resulting in the death of 200,000 Timorese, that is one-third of the total population of the island, the massacre of over 100 unarmed civilians in a graveyard at Santa Cruz in 1991 and the daily ongoing violation of human rights, but also the ongoing systematic state run programme of indoctrination.  This process has involved the replacement of their native tongue.  It involves four year old native Timorese children entering school being told that their capital is Jakarta, their president is Habibie and their being made repeat these mantras until they believe them.  This form of indoctrination extends right up to the island's only university, where nobody graduates unless he or she passes a special paper on the president's political thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What hope we have for a better future for East Timor stems from the departure of General Surharto but, as Senator Norris noted in his motion, President Habibie's regime may well turn out to be a temporary arrangement.  Certainly, some of Habibie's political thoughts and actions in the <Col N="301" /> past do not lead us to be optimistic about his humanitarian credentials.  Indeed, President Habibie was one of the main financial beneficiaries of President Suharto's crony capitalism.  His company possessed a monopoly in supplying aircraft to the military &mdash; planes no one else would buy. It is perhaps not wishful thinking to suggest that these very planes have been used by the Indonesian army in their operations against the Timorese people.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the first sign of movement from the new regime is to be tentatively welcomed as a first step in at least addressing &mdash; and it is nothing more than that &mdash; the rightful claim of the Timorese people to self determination.  Of course, the proposal that would seem to be now on the table from President Habibie to release the separatist guerrilla leader, Xanana Gusmao, and grant East Timor &ldquo;special status&rdquo; in return for international recognition of the Indonesian annexation of East Timor in 1976 has rightly been rejected by exiled vice-president of the National Council for the Timorese Resistance, José Ramos-Horta, and by the Portuguese government &mdash; the former colonial power in the island. The idea of giving the disputed territory a &ldquo;special status&rdquo; within Indonesia along the lines of that already existing within the Republic of Indonesia in exchange for an end to the conflict between the government and the pro-independence groups would seem to be aimed at encouraging the international community to recognise Indonesia's illegal annexation of East Timor.</P>
    <P>In this respect I am sure the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will stand by and uphold, in whatever forum they can, the rightful and just claims of the Timorese people to self determination.  What the Timorese people simply want is Indonesia's withdrawal from East Timor and a referendum to decide for themselves on the future of their own country.  It is a clear and simple message and one we must not tire of repeating again and again in this House until the people of East Timor are free.  We who are free have the duty of standing in solidarity with the people of East Timor in speaking truth to power. In this respect it is heartening to hear of the continuing student protests in Jakarta and Dili over the holding proposals put forward by President Habibie on the future of East Timor.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to address the broader question of what leverage western states and particularly the United States and the European Union &mdash; and Ireland as a member of the European Union &mdash; now have <i>vis-a-vis</i> Indonesia. What has been particularly disturbing is the west's reaction to the economic melt-down in Asia, particularly in the way the IMF bail outs have been targetted.  The private losses of foreign creditors seem to be socialised because, under the bail outs, their debts are transferred to the government and must be repaid by the taxpayers. All this is dangerous because it will result in a backlash of resentment and anger from hardworking <Col N="302" /> Asians.  This is the moment for the west, in particular the United States and the European Union, to use its financial leverage to push for a strategic vision in the region which incorporates reforms in democracy, respect for human rights, rule of law, transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>The United States and the European Union, through their stabilising and supportive role in the region at this time, are in a position to force the inclusion of the East Timor question into the ASEAN regional forum and to encourage a dialogue on human rights and democracy.  Indeed, for all the megaphone diplomacy we have heard from south east Asian leaders about Asian values and Asian human rights, it is not surprising now to hear their sudden eloquent silence on the subject. These allegedly Asian values were nothing but a smokescreen for the ideologies of developmentalism and crony capitalism.  Now the time is ripe for a comprehensive security agenda for peace and stability with a formula of conflict resolution acceptable to all parties to be openly and genuinely discussed in the region.  I hope this is a conversation to which we can make some contribution and one which will crucially involve the resolution of the East Timor conflict at its centre.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for putting forward this motion.  I am reminded that when I was in Opposition I attended a conference organised by the Portuguese government which was also attended by Senator Norris, Senator Henry, Senator Lydon, yourself, Sir, and others from Senator Doyle's party.  Irish parliamentarians, particularly Senator Norris, have taken an interest in this issue and have campaigned on it for many years. Some, like myself, have done so both in Government and Opposition.  I am pleased, therefore, to be here to respond to a debate on this very important issue.  Senator Norris has been a consistent champion of the cause of East Timor and I congratulate him on the work he has done.  As Senator Lanigan said, debates such as this are important.  We may feel we are not being listened to but they are important in the overall scheme of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was, quite rightly, made to Tom Hyland.  I add my thanks to Tom Hyland, who with a small number of people, has maintained the East Timor support group.  Ireland has a strong reputation as a supporter of human rights. That reputation is real and I am very proud of it. We have that reputation because of people like Tom Hyland.  His work, which is done quietly and efficiently, encapsulates the strong feeling of solidarity in the Irish people with oppressed people throughout the world.  There is a historical reason for that genuine feeling of solidarity and support for people who are suffering under oppressive regimes.  Tom Hyland's work is a classic example of that.  I have worked closely with Tom both in Government and Opposition.  I met him again <Col N="303" /> recently and I am pleased he is in the House this evening.  I rarely get a chance to thank people like Tom Hyland.  I do so now and I encourage him to continue his work, which has been recognised internationally.</P>
    <P>The recent upheavals in Indonesia and the ousting of General Suharto last month as President of Indonesia after 32 years have focused attention once again on the question of East Timor.  This is an issue which has dogged the international community for too long and has given rise to a high degree of ill-will and at times confrontation between Indonesia and those countries who wish to see justice and human rights upheld in this distant island.  It is because the East Timorese people themselves have been oppressed so grievously and have undergone so much tribulation in recent years that everything possible must now be done to bring their suffering to an end.  The Government accordingly welcomes the debate which is taking place today and looks forward to hearing views and opinions from other Members of this House.  It is the Government's intention to take all such views fully into account in the further development of its policy on the issue.  There is wide cross-party concern and interest in this subject and quite rightly so.</P>
    <P>Following the fall of President Suharto, a new administration headed by President B. J. Habibie has taken over the reins of power in Jakarta and has already expressed a certain willingness to seek a negotiated solution to the issue of East Timor.  Only time will tell of course whether this new administration does in fact possess the political will and wisdom to negotiate a solution which will be acceptable to all parties &mdash; not least to the East Timorese people themselves.  Nevertheless, a window of opportunity may now be opening up as a result of the upheavals in Indonesia which may allow this long-standing problem to be dealt with in a fair and equitable manner.  We must do all in our power accordingly to encourage the Indonesian Government to demonstrate more clearly its willingness to meet its obligations under the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and to grant to the East Timorese people their rights under international law.</P>
    <P>I am heartened in this respect by the latest news reports that President Habibie has arranged a meeting today with Bishop Carlos Belo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader in East Timor.  I will in a moment give Senators the latest up-date on that meeting.  I understand that President Habibie has offered special autonomy status for East Timor and the release of all political prisoners in return for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.  It is for the East Timorese people to decide whether it is in their best interests to accept or reject.  The Indonesians appear to be moving in the direction of seeking a peaceful negotiated settlement to the issue &mdash; something which never happened under the <Col N="304" /> regime of former President Suharto and which the outside world must do all it can to encourage.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that on 25 June 1996 the European Union adopted a Common Position on East Timor.  This Common Position committed the EU to seeking the achievement by dialogue of a fair, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor, which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people, in accordance with international law.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis was placed in the Common Position on the need for the Indonesian Government to adopt effective measures to improve human rights in the territory by implementing fully the relevant decisions of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  This EU statement of position does not, however, refer to the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination or independence.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks EU partners have turned their attention more closely to the question of East Timor.  Following the call by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on 27 May for the release of the resistance leader Xanana Gusmao and other political prisoners, the UK Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travelled to Jakarta and succeeded in meeting with the prisoner himself.  At the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 June, Ministers made a further appeal for the release of Xanana Gusmao and for the early reinstatement of the postponed visit by the EU troika of ambassadors to the East Timorese capital, Dili.  This visit has now been rescheduled by the EU Presidency for 27 to 30 June.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting at Cardiff on 15 and 16 June also discussed the question of East Timor.  It called on Indonesia to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and sought the release of all political prisoners, including Xanana Gusmao and others from East Timor.</P>
    <P>Along with our partners in the EU, Ireland is particularly supportive of the role of the United Nations and of the efforts being made under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General in an attempt to resolve this difficult issue.  Such efforts include the intra-Timorese dialogue which brings all the parties in East Timor together in order to find common ground which might help to resolve the disputes between them.  Furthermore, we welcomed the appointment last year by the Secretary-General of Mr. Jamsheed Marker as his special envoy on East Timor and we are ready to support any appropriate initiative taken by the Secretary-General on the issue.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva we actively supported the proposal to assign a programme officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to be located in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, or preferably in East Timor itself.  Negotiations <Col N="305" /> are taking place currently with the Indonesian Government on the assignment of such an officer.  Under the terms of the chairman's statement agreed at this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights, Indonesia has committed itself to the early assignment of such an officer &mdash; with access to East Timor &mdash; within the framework of technical co-operation between the two sides.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government have availed of every opportunity to raise the issue of East Timor with their counterparts.  During his visit to Lisbon two weeks ago the Taoiseach had a detailed and useful exchange of views with the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. Guterres.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, also had an extended and fruitful exchange of views on East Timor and Indonesia with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Gama, during his official visit to Lisbon earlier this year.  The Minister expressed the Government's continuing deep concern at the situation there and our readiness to help in any way possible, including in relation to the intra-Timorese dialogue.  I reiterate the Government's willingness to host a meeting of the intra-Timorese dialogue here in Ireland should it be so desired by all the parties concerned. I conveyed this information personally to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas, when I met him in London at the ASEM summit last April.</P>
    <P>In considering a situation like that which exists in East Timor at present and in attempting to find a solution which may achieve a wide level of support, I feel there are two tasks which should be undertaken which can help greatly in the search for a just and peaceful settlement.  One is to examine the historical roots of the problem in question which can give us valuable insights into its causes.  The other, which is more important, is to seek to take advantage of all relevant events happening in the present which may be utilised for the achievement of a settlement.</P>
    <P>Historically, East Timor has faced the problems of traditional underdevelopment which have been combined with acute economic and political obstacles.  At the time of its decolonisation, I understand that East Timor possessed only one high school and one technical school and that the illiteracy rate stood at a truly astounding 92 per cent of the population.  There were reported to have been only 12 university graduates and not much more than 20 miles of paved roads in the entire colony at that time.  In 1975 the radical Fretilin party came to power and was considered by the Indonesian authorities to pose a threat to the stability of the surrounding region.  While short-comings in the decolonisation process may have been responsible in part for this outcome, the result, as we know, was the brutal invasion of the territory by Indonesia in December 1975 and its subsequent illegal annexation.</P>
    <P>The massacres and repression of the civilian population which occurred at that time and which <Col N="306" /> have continued to take place during the more than 22 years of Indonesian control which followed are well documented.  These atrocious abuses of human rights must be brought to an end and the Timorese people must never again be subjected to such brutal treatment.</P>
    <P>The Government has no difficulties with the text of the motion tabled by Senator Norris. According to all the reports we receive, it seems undeniable that the human rights situation in the territory continues to be deplorable.  Ireland has always been to the forefront in condemning the shocking violations of human rights which have occurred so regularly in East Timor.  Senators will be aware that we were among the strongest supporters of the resolution on East Timor adopted by the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last year.  Among the demands contained in that resolution was the assignment of a programme officer from the Centre for Human Rights to the UN office in Jakarta with unhindered access to East Timor.  It is appropriate that we should repeat that demand in this House.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed the Government's strong support for the call to release Xanana Gusmao and all prisoners held for political reasons not just in East Timor but throughout Indonesia. We can also offer our support for the holding of a plebiscite conducted in a free and fair manner which would demonstrate accurately the democratic will of the East Timorese people.  It must be stressed, however, that it would be unwise to predict the results of such a plebiscite in advance. The results of such a plebiscite would be an important element, but not the only one, in deciding the future of East Timor.  Regional stability and other factors arising from the relevant United Nations resolutions would also have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I offer my good wishes to the people of East Timor in their struggle to demand their basic human rights and to achieve the civil liberties to which every human being has an undeniable claim.  As a step towards attaining these ends we hope that the new administration in Jakarta will maintain and reinforce the moves &mdash; admittedly small so far &mdash; which it has promised to take on the path to democracy and greater social justice for all the people under its control.  The most likely means of achieving peace with justice for the people of East Timor lies with Indonesia's acceptance of democracy in a fair and open manner for its own people and institutions.  We must encourage the Indonesian Government and people in every way we can to follow that course.</P>
    <P>For too long the East Timorese people have suffered from persecution and oppression.  I hope they will not be denied for much longer their fundamental freedoms.  We offer them our full support in their courageous struggle.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the AFRI report, with which I am familiar, having raised some of the issues raised by it with the previous Government. As the Senator is aware, we do not manufacture <Col N="307" /> arms and, therefore, we do not export them.</P>

      <P>It is true that we produce dual use goods &mdash; for example, computer equipment.  The Senator mentioned a company in particular and electronic sensor equipment which goes to Singapore and on to Indonesia.  I will ask the officials in the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>An international news agency report from Jakarta today reads:</P>
      <P>Outspoken East Timorese Bishop, Nobel laureate Carlos Belo, held landmark talks with Indonesia's new President B. J. Habibie here Wednesday and said he had won a pledge for a &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; troop withdrawal from the troubled territory.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They will study the issue and little by little they will withdraw,&rdquo; Belo told reporters after an almost two hour meeting with Habibie held in the presidential palace at the president's initiative.</P>
      <P>Foreign minister, Ali Alatas, who sat in on the talks, was more reticent, saying only: &ldquo;The Armed forces. . .yes the role of the armed forces was included in the conversation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>..</P>
      <P>Though no timetable was given, the withdrawal pledge was seen here as a major move by Indonesia, which under the leadership of former President Suharto had for 23 years doggedly rejected any concessions on the issue, despite the heavy damage to its foreign policy.</P>
      <P>But western diplomats told AFP this week that the Indonesian military, which is believed to have suffered more than 20,000 casualties in the territory, would be &ldquo;more than glad to leave as long as East Timor remains a part of Indonesia&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Current Indonesian troop strength in the territory is estimated by diplomats to be from 15,000 to 20,000, while only a handful of armed rebels remain.</P>
      <P>Belo emerged from the meeting in an upbeat mood, heaping praise on Habibie and saying he now hoped for &ldquo;a new starting point&rdquo; for his people.</P>
      <P>.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The main thing we talked about was how to improve the situation in East Timor.  On how to lift the dignity of the East Timorese and the president agreed with the majority of the things we proposed to him,&rdquo; he added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is balanced and gives us some hope. The international campaign must go on as well as the work of Tom Hyland's group.  I welcome this debate and look forward to hearing the contributions of other Senators.  We will continue our <Col N="308" /> efforts.  It has been acknowledged that successive Irish Governments have played an important role in trying to advance the cause of the people of East Timor.  I assure this House that at this important time there is a window of opportunity. We will redouble our efforts to bring this problem to an end and restore the rights of the people of East Timor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember when the Minister of State supported this cause in Lisbon.  The Government's support for the assignment of a programme officer from the High Commissioner for Human Rights' office to the Indonesian capital of Jakarta or preferably East Timor would not only be welcomed by the people of East Timor but by the Chinese minority in Indonesia who have suffered appallingly in the past few months and have become scapegoats for the difficulties there.  I am sure the Minister of State has seen reports of the terrible treatment of Chinese women.  Two or three hundred of them have declared they were raped.  Security forces stood by while atrocities were perpetrated against them.  I hope the Minister will promote the assignment of a programme officer from the High Commissioner's office to Jakarta as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that we discussed the ratification of the protocols to the Geneva Convention last night.  The Second Protocol, Chapter II, Article 76 states:</P>
      <P>(1) Women shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected in particular against rape, forced prostitution and any other form of indecent assault.</P>
      <P>(2) Pregnant women and mothers having dependent infants who are arrested, detained or interned for reasons related to the armed conflict, shall have their cases considered with the utmost priority.</P>
      <P>When one reads the reports of what is happening to women in East Timor, it is appalling that these conventions are being totally ignored.  This also applies to the rest of the civilian population.</P>
      <P>This has been happening since 1977.  In 1988, a woman who described herself as Ms X &mdash; as members of her family were still living in East Timor &mdash; gave an horrific account of her treatment, which was published by the Catholic Institute for International Relations in 1990.  Her husband was tortured and killed but she managed to flee to Portugal.  She described how in 1977 a vehicle from the regional military command in Koramil arrived at her home with orders to arrest her because her husband was a freedom fighter. Her eldest son was two years old and her youngest son, who she was breastfeeding, was six months old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She was taken to prison with her sister where she was treated appallingly.  Her sister was taken from her and was brought back scarred all over from instruments of torture.  Her skin was covered in dried blood and there were countless <Col N="309" /> cigarette burns where the Indonesians has put out their cigarettes on her flesh as if she was an ashtray. Ms X was threatened and was told that if she did not tell the truth she would get the same treatment.</P>
    <P>This continued in a most harrowing manner.  It was ironic that the interrogators started to worry about the breastfed child and brought him back and forth to her in prison until he got so ill they wanted him brought to hospital.  She insisted the child should be sent home to her father.  She had the bad luck to appeal to one of the local majors who kept her captive and raped her repeatedly. She eventually managed to escape and went to live in Portugal.</P>
    <P>This case happened 20 years ago and one might presume that the situation had calmed down. Unfortunately, today I heard of the case of Rosita Gomes Pereira.  She complained to the local church and the International Committee of the Red Cross, presumably hoping that the perpetrators of her rape might be brought to justice. She gave a similar account to that of Ms X of her ordeal.  On 1 May last she was raped by Indonesian soldiers in the Ermeria district where she lived.  One held her from behind while the other raped her.  She had a baby of approximately the same age as that of Ms X with her.  She attempted to flee with the baby but was not in a position to get away from her torturers.</P>
    <P>Rape has been recognised as a war crime and some people were brought to court following the atrocities in Bosnia.  It is important that we ensure that those who commit these crimes against women in East Timor are also brought to justice. The East Timorese authorities have made no effort to bring rapists or those who sexually abuse, harass or force women into marriage or prostitution before the courts.</P>
    <P>Women in some areas have had to endure forced sterilisation.  This involves the medical profession and I was appalled to read in an article reprinted by Tom Hyland that the Indonesian medical profession have been involved in the killing of wounded people.  Following the massacre of some people they were brought to a hospital which was surrounded by a large number of troops.  The reporter, who was a paramedic, said he saw the Indonesian security forces use rocks to crush the skulls of wounded people.  He went on to say that the Indonesians wanted to inject the wounded with sulphuric acid but it was argued that this would cause much pain and the victims would scream too much.  They then asked the doctors in the hospital for some pills.  The report says the doctors brought a jar of pills which were then given to some of the wounded. The victims started to lose strength, their breathing became weaker and they died quickly.  He goes on to name those doctors and nurses who, he said, were involved in this.</P>
    <P>It is appalling to read such reports in view of the fact that we passed the first, 1977, Protocol to the Geneva Convention yesterday, which talks about the protection of medical personnel, be <Col N="310" /> they part of the armed forces, relief agencies or civilian doctors.  I know they are in terrifying situations but to see the medical profession involved in such appalling activity makes one wonder how the situation in that country can be rectified.  I hope the Government will do all in its power to rescue the civilian population from the appalling plight they are in.  Any such steps would be very much welcomed on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated the annexation of East Timor so many times in recent years and now we are doing so again.  It is due entirely to Senator Norris, to whom I pay credit.  As Senator Ryan said, ten years ago he did not know where East Timor was and I do not think many of us did either, although we knew where Indonesia was and we may have seen East Timor on the map.  It is entirely due to Senator Norris's efforts that this matter has been raised time and time again in the Seanad.  It is important that we debate this issue because some note is taken of such debates.</P>
      <P>I want to pay particular tribute to Mr. Tom Hyland who has done sterling work for East Timor.  He is a gentleman but he has a steely resolve which helps him to forward this cause. Mr. Hyland, Senator Norris, the Minister of State, a number of other Senators and I attended a conference in Lisbon recently as guests of the Portuguese Government which, for the past 22 years, has been trying to do something about the situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>We would not have been discussing this matter so soon again if it were not for the downfall of General Suharto or, indeed, because of the murder of a young man there recently named Herman Soares.  Every time there is a murder like this it seems to roll off the tip of the tongue and it appears as a small footnote in a newspaper. However, it means that another family is affected by a life that is taken.  From our own situation we are well aware of the grief, pain and agony that one death can cause.</P>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion and to call for the release of Xanana Gusmao.  I hope the talks in which Bishop Carlos Belo and the new Indonesian President Habibie are engaged will produce some results.  The only result we want, however, is self-determination for East Timor. That is what this is all about.  In our own country we fought long enough for self-determination and we have it for most of the country at the moment; in fact, we will have it for all of the country after the peace agreement.  These things can be achieved by peaceful means.  I hope the ultimate result of all our discussions, debates and work for East Timor will be self-determination for the East Timorese people, deciding their own future.</P>
      <P>We should do everything we can to support the attempts being made to solve the matter by the United Nations under the auspices of the Secretary General.  The UN's efforts are being supported by everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> In previous speeches on this matter, as now, I am always reminded of the horrific sight of the Foreign Ministers of Australia and Indonesia shaking hands having signed an oil deal.  As in the case of most takeovers of smaller countries by larger ones, it is not so much about self aggrandisement but about natural resources and power.  It was a cruel act and the Australians in particular need to be taken to task because their country is supposed to be a democracy, yet they signed this oil deal with the repressive Suharto regime.  They shook hands on it and hoped the East Timor problem would go away.</P>
    <P>It is thanks to small people &mdash; and I include myself in that category &mdash; in various parts of the world and in parliaments who have highlighted such things over and over again that eventually mobilises the press and international opinion so that matters are gradually resolved.</P>
    <P>The new Indonesian leader, President Habibie, will make an impression.  The Minister of State said there was hope that prisoners would be released and that the army might be withdrawn from East Timor.  There is still no mention of self-determination. I do not suppose it will happen overnight; not after 22 years of repression.  It is a start, however, which we hoped for and must welcome.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, it is important to highlight this issue repeatedly.  One can see the effects of it and more is wrought by the pen than the sword.  We have seen that occur in South Africa, in the Six Counties and hopefully we will see it in East Timor in the future.  People there will eventually be allowed to determine their own future.  If at that stage they want to side with part of the Indonesian set up, that is fine, but they must determine that; not us or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I think, though, that sometimes we are not hard enough on the larger powers who suppress the smaller ones.  I mentioned that point yesterday in another debate in the context of the overthrow of President Allende of Chile.  I know he was a Communist, but so what?  He was democratically elected and his overthrow should never have happened. As regards their oil deal with Indonesia, we have not taken a strong enough line against the Australians.  We must take a strong line.  We are very good at espousing the cause of human rights, so let us espouse them all the way and hope that this will be the end of the East Timor problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate.  The Minister of State has expressed an interest in the East Timor problem over an extended period.  It is important for us to discuss these matters.  I am pleased the Government has accepted the motion and that all sides of the House can agree to it.  It is important for us to demonstrate our solidarity on these matters.  Ireland can be reasonably happy with its record in trying to promote the cause of East Timor internationally, irrespective of what Government was in power.  We have tried <Col N="312" /> to ensure that the human rights violations and genocide that has occurred there will not be continued. We hope it will be possible for East Timor to exercise self-determination and decide its own future.  I welcome the news this evening from Jakarta and hopefully it is the dawn of a dialogue which will lead to a better future for East Timor. However, time alone will tell in that respect.</P>
      <P>It is also important for us to outline what has taken place in the recent past.  I do not intend to go back over the history of repression and genocide which has taken place in East Timor.  The Minister of State referred to the 1975 invasion and we all know what happened subsequently, particularly the massacre at Santa Cruz, which was horrific.  The world might not have understood what took place there but for the journalists who reported it.  Some of them gave their lives to bring reports from the area.</P>
      <P>It was a matter of some satisfaction that the House unanimously adopted the resolution passed in Lisbon at the conference which has been referred to earlier and which many of us attended.  That resolution was assented to by all groups in the House.  I had the privilege of meeting the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, with an interparlimentary group to emphasise to him the need for the UN to keep pressing that its resolutions would be adopted.  He was very sympathetic to our requests, but after the meeting we wondered how much could be achieved in the face of repeated and sustained resistance to any progress by the super powers and Australia.  The US was also unhelpful.  This all goes back to the factors Senator Lanigan mentioned.  These were the economic importance of Indonesia as a region and the fact that it was then an economy experiencing rapid growth with very substantial trade. There was also the issue of the international arms trade.  These issues were in the background when all the discussions took place and were largely responsible for our lack of progress.</P>
      <P>I join with other Members in saluting the work done by Tom Hyland and the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign group because without it this matter would not have received the prominence that it has and would not have been as dominant in Irish foreign affairs.  He needs to be recognised for all his work.</P>
      <P>We should also salute the fact that Bishop Belo and Dr. Ramos-Horta were conferred with the Nobel Peace Prize.  That again emphasises the merit of the argument on behalf of the East Timorese people.</P>
      <P>The Church of Ireland has been anxious about the matter of arms and the degree to which Ireland may be involved.  So much so that the issue was raised at its general synod.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult in the case of very large multi-national corporations, and where <Col N="313" /> the Church has investment in those corporations, for people to know precisely what they are involved in, especially in terms of providing components for arms that might be used for very undesirable purposes in that part of the world. One can understand the difficulties that poses for people, even for the Government, to find out what companies are involved.</P>
      <P>I have spoken about the economic importance and Senator Lydon and others have also referred to it.  I am glad to see the Minister's speech emphasises that there is a need for human rights to be vindicated.  It is essential that the violation of human rights which has taken place should be highlighted and that every action should be taken to ensure there are no further violations.  That means there should be an independent verification system on the ground in East Timor.  I note what the Minister said in his speech that somebody may be located in Jakarta with access to East Timor.  It is very important that the Government repeatedly states at international level the need for an independent verification system in East Timor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure human rights violations do not take place and that if they do they are reported widely.</P>
      <P>Self determination is fundamental to all of this and it is the right of any people to freely exercise their right to it.  If the circumstances in Indonesia change radically and there is a democratic state and the East Timorese freely and willingly assent to being part of that system then, as member of the international community, we are obligated to accept that decision.  I do not wish to anticipate what the decision would be in changed circumstances. Irrespective of whether the decision would be to be part of Indonesia, it is up to the East Timorese to decide where they want to be and to whom they want to pledge allegiance.  We should readily be able to identify with this scenario.</P>
      <P>I agree with Members when they called for the release of Xanana Gusmao.  He must not be used as a pawn in negotiations which attempt to achieve Indonesian objectives.  It is very important that his release is a unilateral decision and not part of an overall package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Government when having future talks to ensure the implementation of the Lisbon declaration, the absolute right of the East Timorese people to be represented at talks about their future and that they should not be excluded from such talks.  It is good that this matter has been given such prominence by the Irish Government.  We should not underestimate the influence of our small population on the other side of the world to exercise some moral influence on the outcome of the situation in East Timor.  We must recognise the sovereignty of East Timor and it should not be a spurious sovereignty <Col N="314" /> based on an Indonesian trade-off involving Xanana Gusmao or others in that region.</P>
    <P>Again, human rights must be subject to verification. I think it is important that we continue to raise our voice in whatever international fora are available to us to ensure this matter does not subside into the undergrowth of international diplomacy and is lost.  I know that this will not happen. I am confident the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the rest of the Government will ensure that East Timor is kept in a prominent place in Irish foreign policy.  I appeal to the Government to do that.  We should not assume because we are a small and remote country on the other side of the world from East Timor that our voice is lost in the wilderness.  Sometimes we may be breathing our sweetness on desert air, but on occasion people listen.  If the Government listens to us and bring that message to the international fora, then there will be a beneficial effect.  I welcome the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and thank my colleagues for taking part in such a wide-ranging discussion.  I thank the Minister in particular. I already mentioned that I regard him as a very appropriate person to have replied on behalf of the Government to this motion.</P>
      <P>I preface my comments by indicating my great respect for our diplomats, our foreign service in general and our professional civil servants in Iveagh House.  Over the years I have learned to have a great respect for them because, by and large, we are well advised.  In many areas of this difficult problem this is also the case.  However, I think the Minister may have had a little help with his script.  The Minister I know spoke in a more passionate manner when he talked off the record and there are some things in his speech that worry me considerably.  He mentioned special autonomy status for East Timor.  Let us knock that out of the water straight away on this ground. I have always held that East Timor was fundamentally important for a number of reasons, not just the intrinsic human rights issues of that localised region but because it was very likely that the issue could be won.  When it was won it could create what the Americans always feared &mdash; a domino effect in reverse on behalf of human rights.  I have been to Tibet and have heard the Chinese talking about the special autonomous region of Tibet.  I hope to God that East Timor never achieves that lamentable and squalid state because under this diplomatic language is a further violation of the human rights of people.</P>
      <P>On the last page of the Minister's speech it is stated: &ldquo;The results of such a plebiscite would be of course an important but not the only element in deciding the future of East Timor&rdquo;.  I was astonished by this statement.  Is that what one might call <i>a la carte</i> democracy?  He went on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told regional stability and other factors arising from the relative United Nations evolutions will also have to be taken into <Col N="315" /> account.  In an historical survey we discovered that in 1975 the radical Fretilin party came into power and was considered by the Indonesian authorities to pose a threat to the stability of the surrounding region.</P>
    <P>Where is the morality in that?  This is precisely the argument the British authorities traditionally used in respect of Northern Ireland.  Would Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, accept that the British have a right to do what they like in Northern Ireland because they are concerned about the stability of the region?  I strongly question that aspect of the Minister of State's contribution and he might pause for thought when he rereads his script.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the intra-Timorese dialogue, which has a certain small significance.  We should not be deflected &mdash; this is what the Indonesians want &mdash; into believing that problems in East Timor involve squabbles between political leaders who cannot agree with each other and that the Indonesian authorities must impose their views.  There has never been a solid substantial attempt to involve the Timorese leadership in the resolution of this problem.  It is time that such an attempt was made.  Let us not be deflected into believing that this matter is merely a squabble between the Timorese people.  Historical divisions in East Timor have been exacerbated and fomented by the Indonesians.  Holding discussions which include only the Indonesians and the Portuguese is an outrage against the very people whose civil rights are under discussion.</P>
    <P>In light of his comments about the common position of the European Union &mdash; there seems to have been a retreat of sorts from the position adopted by Ireland &mdash; will he be adhering to the position enunciated by the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, namely, that it was an absolute principle that the Timorese people should have the right to self-determination. There seems to be a contradiction between the supplied script and the position held by the former Minister.  I doubt that is what is desired by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputies Andrews and Tom Kitt.  I intend no pun but it must be stated that our excellent civil servants, who are not Timorese, are somewhat timorous.  It is the responsibility of their political masters to tighten the reins and say &ldquo;This is what the people have decided, this is what the Oireachtas wants, so please proceed to do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the brave Timorese people have managed to essentially defeat the might of a sophisticated oppressor.  I was saddened when the Minister of State said that:</P>
    <P>Historically, East Timor has faced the problems of traditional underdevelopment which have been combined with acute economic and political obstacles.  At the time of its decolonisation, I understand that East Timor possessed <Col N="316" /> only one high school and one technical school and that the illiteracy rate stood at a truly astounding 92 per cent of the population. There were reported to have been only 12 university graduates and not much more than 20 miles of paved roads in the entire colony at that time.</P>
    <P>So bloody what?  What is the point of including such information in the Minister of State's script? Who cares?  If the people are happy walking on uncobbled streets, rearing their families, doing no harm to anyone else and being in possession of their property, what business does the European Union have commenting on the state of the roads in East Timor?  Everyone knows why the roads have improved in East Timor: it was not so that the Timorese could enjoy the view, it was so that the Indonesian authorities could move military vehicles around and massacre the population.  Let us not have any old guff about the state of the roads because we know that is not important.</P>
    <P>When in Beijing I was upset when some of our people there stated that the Tibetans had to be brought into the 20th century.  They informed me that when they visited Tibet they saw people singing in the fields surrounded by flower-laden yaks. Is that not better than being enslaved and brutalised by the Chinese?  It certainly provides a contrast to the massive dilution of the indigenous population in Tibet which I witnessed on a trip to China and Tibet last year.  I was one of those responsible for writing a report on human rights at that time which did not please the Chinese.  Is it not patronising and supercilious of western countries to cry crocodile tears about the state of the roads, flower-laden yaks, etc., in these countries? If the people who live in Tibet and East Timor are happy they should be allowed to enjoy their civilisations and environments, which were less affected by pollution before the construction of cement factories, etc.</P>
    <P>East Timor is the stone in the shoe to which Ali Alatas referred because he knew they would be lamed by this issue.  It is extraordinary that the Timorese people managed to defy the armed might of Indonesia.  When listening to Members' contributions, I was struck by the similarities between East Timor and Ireland.  God knows I have never been a supporter of the armed struggle in this country but I recall Séan O'Casey's character Séamus Sheilds, when a British &ldquo;tommy&rdquo; objects to the activities of snipers, saying &ldquo;They wanted us to come out in our pelts and throw stones at them.&rdquo; Essentially, the Timorese came out in their pelts and threw stones at the Indonesians and they landed a number of strategic hits, without much help from the international community.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to Israel and stated that I would not agree with him in respect of Palestine and the West Bank.  Of course I agree with him, but there is a difference between the situation in Israel and that which obtains in East Timor.  The West Bank was acquired as a result of a war of <Col N="317" /> aggression against Israel.  No one could pretend that East Timor declared war on Indonesia.</P>
    <P>Another Member stated that the Australians have short memories.  They do not; the Australian Government has no memory for anything at all. It is merely concerned about its interests and money and exploiting others.  However, the Australian people have better memories.  I recall creating hell in the Australian Parliament in Canberra by attacking the Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans.  The response was astonishing because the Australian people were delighted because the majority of them do not support their Government's policy in this area.  I am glad that policy is beginning to change.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan took a few too many pot-shots at the British and his targets were somewhat diffuse. I wish he had taken a swipe at the loathsome Alan Clarke.  The Senator was unfair to target Prince Charles because I doubt that he said what he was quoted as saying in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>I crave the indulgence of the Chair to make a final remark.  When I raised the question of the French supplying Alouette helicopters and other machines of death to the Indonesians, I was informed by the ever cynical Mr. Juppé &mdash; who has since received his just reward from the French political system &mdash; that Europe and France had nothing to apologise for because it was an employment issue.  I reminded him about Zyclon B gas, etc., and he went on to state that the European Union was not a human rights organisation. At that point he was correct because there was no human rights protocol in the foundation Treaties of the European Union.  I campaigned and voted against the Amsterdam Treaty because I oppose any strengthening of the European arms industry, which is already in a state of overproduction &mdash; everyone knows where the resulting surplus of weapons is being absorbed &mdash; but at least that Treaty, for the first time in the history of the EU, contains a human rights protocolumn Thank God for that.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State but he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, must hold firm and adhere to their principles.  If they just imagine that we are manning the barricades together, everything will be all right.</P>

      <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions but I will return to Senator Norris because he has taken my contribution apart, as is his prerogative.  He rightly commended my colleagues in Iveagh House and I echo his praise &mdash; they are dedicated and committed people.  He quoted the following remark of mine:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> In 1975 the radical Fretilin party came to power and was considered by the Indonesian authorities to pose a threat to the stability of the surrounding region.</P>
    <P>That is merely a factual statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is unfortunately linked to the comment about the considerations which should be taken into account in the plebiscite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the plebiscite, we have always said that it is a matter for the people of East Timor.  I assure the Senator that the Irish Government takes a strong position on the issue of self-determination and there is no question of our position not being the same as that of the last Government.  If anything we need to redouble our efforts and we are doing that.  This is the area of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and I support him in every way because I know of his personal commitment.</P>
      <P>As the Senator is aware the Irish position is stronger than the EU position.  He mentioned the EU statement I quoted but in a reply of this nature we always refer to the common position.  I also said: &ldquo;This EU statement of position does not, however, refer to the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination or independence&rdquo;, which is another factual statement.  I reiterate that the Irish Government supports the right of the East Timorese people to self-determination. As to the plebiscite, I accept Senator Norris' analysis of some elements of my speech but I suggest that the reference to the plebiscite recognises the wishes of the people as well as the other regional factors.</P>
      <P>The ousting of General Suharto provides an opportunity to make a determined effort and, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government, I assure the Senator that we will be as centrally involved in this process as possible. We must try to achieve a negotiated solution and perhaps some of the language in my speech reflects diplomatic work we need to do at this point.  In that sense we must take Indonesia's view into account but we acknowledge the changing environment in that country which we are trying to encapsulate in the Government's response to the motion.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I do not think this will be the last time we debate it because during the debate I received an up to date report from an international news agency, as I mentioned earlier.  We might question some of the comments in that report and I would not take everything in it at face value but all current reports share the sense of hope and opportunity.  The Minister could not be here but he wishes to convey his continued interest in this subject.  I assure the Senator that the Government will continue its efforts on the basis of the cross-party support in the House.</P>
