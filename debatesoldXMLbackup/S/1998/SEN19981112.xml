      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to take note of the report of the National Rehabilitation Board research department on respite care facilities and the paucity of these facilities.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item 1 is to be taken without debate.  Item 2 is Committee Stage.  On item 3, the statements are to be taken from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. and the contributions are not to exceed ten minutes.  Business is to be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. Item 4 is to be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Spokespersons' contributions are not to exceed ten minutes and all other contributions are not to exceed seven minutes.  If the previous item is not concluded, it will resume after that.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I thank the Leader of the House for agreeing so readily to put item 3 on the Order Paper today.  I am grateful for that.</P>

      <P>We are anxious that Report Stage be taken at a later stage.  I do not think I am out of order in saying that one of the most long-standing members of staff, Mr. Paddy Dowdall, retires after 31 years' service.  On behalf of all of us, this is an opportunity to say how much <Col N="70" /> we appreciate the work of the ushers and to wish Mr. Dowdall a long and happy retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, we all wish to be associated with Senator Manning's remarks.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader, as a matter of extreme urgency, ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, not the Minister of State, to come into this House to explain the extraordinary attitude the Government is taking towards overseas development aid?  It is a defining moment in the history of the Government that it has decided to abandon the poor of the world, to reduce disaster emergency aid by £1 million and to effectively reduce overseas development aid in real terms in the Estimates. I do not care what face-saving happens in the budget.  The Estimates have revealed how the Government thinks.  This was never announced in advance or put in an election manifesto.  The Government has ducked its responsibilities to the poor.  It is prepared to be bullied by the Department of Finance.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are entitled, not to an innocuous debate stuck in at 2 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon, but to a serious debate on a motion with the Minister for Finance either here or in the Dáil or in both Houses.  This is perhaps the most disgraceful revelation of mean-minded Government philosophy I have seen in my many years in this House, and I mean that quite sincerely.  I have rarely witnessed such an appalling decision by a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the remarks expressed by Senator Manning on Mr. Dowdall's retirement.  Is it intended to conclude Committee Stage of item 2 today?</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked for a debate on the health services both in the context of waiting lists for hospital admissions and for services for people with intellectual and physical disabilities and the exacerbation of those situations due to current budgetary difficulties in many of the health boards.  Perhaps the Leader could suggest an early date for that debate.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator Ryan for a proper debate, not just a series of statements, on the overseas development aid budget.  After a number of years of progress since 1992, it is scandalous that at a time of budgetary plenty we are choosing to cut our emergency humanitarian aid for disasters such as that in Central America and our bilateral aid programme for the poorest countries in Africa.  No member of the public would stand over that.  This must be redressed immediately.  Having had such an interest over many years in this subject and having supported the increases by the last two Governments in this area, the House will have a lot to say on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on funding for the National Roads Authority. It appears it is concerned only about <Col N="71" /> bypassing towns.  I strongly protest that elected members of local authorities do not have an input into designating or designing routes.  This is done by officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and executive engineers and local authority members are told about it only when it is a <i>fait accompli.</i>  It is undemocratic and this House should have an opportunity to discuss it.  It costs £30 million to build a bypass, which sometimes wipes out business in a small town.  Local authority members have expertise in this area and they should be allowed to have an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Ryan said about overseas development aid.  I am a little surprised we have not had any support from the other side of the House, but I am sure it will come in the next few minutes.</P>
      <P>A debate on this issue is essential.  I do not want to get involved in details but I will give the House two statistics which will put this matter in proportion.  We have given £400,000 in emergency aid to Central America.  That is the amount of money the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance spend on telephone calls and postage each year.  It is paltry and pathetic.  I support keeping public expenditure down.  We are allocating £300 million for public service pay increases next year, yet we are spending only £400,000 on saving lives in Nicaragua. There is something wrong with a nation as prosperous as ours when that is the way we view things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the effects of EMU which will come into force in six weeks' time.  On the last occasion we debated it we were told the banks would carry the loss of the profitable currency exchange business. However, there have been two cuts in interest rates in recent weeks which have not been passed on to the consumer.  Today, the largest bank in the State announced a record half year increase in its profits.  We should also have a debate on the high level of interest charged on credit cards, particularly when the wholesale money rate has dropped substantially over the past four or five years, as this is important for the consumer.</P>
      <P>I support Senator McGowan's comments about the National Roads Authority.  The Government should increase the overseas aid referred to by Senators Ryan and Ross, particularly as we are great beneficiaries of other types of funding, such as IFI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House to explain the situation in relation to remedial teachers.  There is an increasing need for remedial and special needs teachers.  Many teachers and parents are concerned that they have not been provided in recent years.  Commitments <Col N="72" /> have been given but not honoured.  It is important that the Minister comes into the House to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on enlargement of the European Union.  Negotiations on this began the day before yesterday. We must discuss the implications of enlargement for Ireland, particularly in terms of Poland whose entry will affect CAP which will have profound implications for farmers.  This is a pressing matter which should be discussed, especially when the Polish Prime Minister is visiting this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take only Committee Stage of item 2 today.  Senators Manning, Ross, Bonner, Ryan and Gallagher expressed their concerns about our overseas development aid.  I have confidence in the Government's ability to address this in the budget.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Members.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher asked for a debate on health issues.  As I said yesterday morning, I will allocate time for such a debate in this session.</P>
      <P>Senators McGowan and Bonner called for a debate on the National Roads Authority.  We had a debate last night on this issue.  Senator McGowan, one of the longest serving Members of this House, said that local authority members should have more direct input into how the budget of the National Roads Authority is spent. I will pass on his comments to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Bonner asked for a debate on EMU, the currency exchange business and the high level of interest charged on credit cards.  I will make time available for such a debate during this session.</P>
      <P>I thought Senator Tom Hayes was going to make a point about agriculture.  I know he must be pleased with the Estimates published yesterday because he did not refer to it this morning and he has a keen interest in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 27, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any person deemed to be so by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I expressed my concern that the definition of the term &ldquo;a designated officer&rdquo; is too narrow.  While I accept the Minister of State wants people to report in the most suitable and direct way possible &mdash; in other words, reports should be made to someone within the health board to avoid confusion &mdash; the proposal contained in the amendment is sympathetic with the spirit of what Deputy Shatter intended when he drafted the Bill in its original form.  When the Bill was introduced by Deputy Shatter it was stated in section 2 that, unless the context otherwise requires, &ldquo;an appropriate authority&rdquo; means any statutory or non-statutory body concerned with the welfare and care of children which includes each health board in the State and the Garda Síochána.  He further stated that &ldquo;an appropriate person&rdquo; means any person who is a member or an employee of any such body.  That is a much broader definition than the one currently contained in the Bill and it is much more in line with the recommendations of the Murphy report, which I quoted on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 would allow the Minister, if he believes it is correct to do so, to appoint members of staff of other statutory or non-statutory bodies to serve as designated officers.  I am <Col N="74" /> not insisting that certain people serving within sporting bodies or voluntary organisations should be designated officers.  Following Second Stage, I received a complaint that some voluntary bodies which operate junior sections are perhaps not as careful as they should be about monitoring those sections and the activities of those who run them. For that reason, I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts a definition of the term &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; as &ldquo;Minister for Health and Children&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill.  This was not previously required but it is necessary now because of the proposed insertion of amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>As stated on Second Stage, the impetus for amendment No. 3 arose because I accepted in good faith and at short notice an Opposition amendment which was designed to ensure the speedy implementation of the Bill when enacted. As stated previously, this was always my clear intention, but I was subsequently advised the amendment I accepted might conceivably give rise to questions about the legality of the appointment of designated officers in the future.  Accordingly, when informed of this possibility, I instructed my officials to have the offending section redrafted to copperfasten the designation of officers of the health board.  In doing so I was also conscious of the considered contribution of a number of Deputies on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil who advised me that I should amend the legislation to allow the Minister to give directions to chief executive officers under this section.</P>
      <P>I have given this matter careful consideration and, in the interests of ensuring a uniform approach to the granting of immunity to reporters under the terms of the Bill, I propose to amend section 2 to allow for a direction to be given to chief executive officers regarding the officers to be appointed as designated officers.  In effect, prior to the commencement of the Bill, chief executive officers will be asked to designate a broad range of categories of staff to be designated officers for the purpose of the Bill.  As I reported previously to the Dáil, I had arranged for consultations with the chief executive officers on this point.  For the information of the Seanad I will outline the main categories of health board officers who, at this stage, it is envisaged will be designated.  They are social workers, child care workers, public health nurses, hospital consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors &mdash; particularly those employed in accident and emergency departments, community welfare officers, speech therapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied these are the professionals in whom members of the public are most likely to confide or to whom they will express concerns.  In practice, these officers will pass on reports immediately to the relevant child care staff in health boards.  In most cases, this will be the child care manager.  I will review the matter with the <Col N="75" /> health boards prior to the implementation of the Bill.  If further categories of staff are required, I will add them to the aforementioned list.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to include as wide as possible a range of personnel from the statutory agencies to be designated under this section.  I have gone as far as possible to meet Members' legitimate concerns about the immediate and uniform implementation of the legislation by revising section 2.  Accordingly, I must reject amendment No. 1 in the name of Senator Henry even though I take her point.  That point was also made by a number of Deputies in the Dáil and I subsequently amended the definition of the term &ldquo;designated officer&rdquo;.  We are now prepared to widen that definition to include all health board personnel who come into contact with the general public.  We feel that nurses, doctors, social and child care workers and others represent a broad spectrum and consequently there will be an adequate designation.  If the Senator has any other categories she wishes us to include, I will be happy to do so.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of designated officers, however, we must take care that we can identify who they are, otherwise it would be impossible to have the reporting procedures which we are all so anxious to get right.  It is a complex issue.  Many of the troubles of the past arose because the complexities were not understood and dealt with.  Consequently, I am happy to listen to the Senator, as I listened to a long discussion in the Dáil, to tease out this issue.  We must respond in a definitive way or it defeats the purpose of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has expanded the situation under section 2 and I am glad about that.  I want to allow the Minister leeway so a committee chairman might be appointed a designated officer if it is realised at some stage that some non-statutory bodies need to be included.  We do not want to have to go through further legislation.  I do not want the Minister to specify anyone.  If it is felt that there may be non-statutory bodies where a designated officer is also needed, the legislation would exist to allow the Minister to appoint such a person.  There is a good list of people within the health board who are likely to be informed but in five years time it will be realised that people are still telling members of committees of swimming clubs and junior GAA teams.  Of course those people should report immediately to health board officials but there should be some protection for those who did the original reporting.</P>
      <P>I am not asking for any specifications, just that the Minister should have the leeway to appoint such designated officers without having to go through further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry.  I am pleased that the Minister has specified the designated officers within the child care management <Col N="76" /> arena.  Senator Henry is pushing to ensure that we never have to go through the whole scenario again.  She wants to copperfasten a procedure which takes into consideration voluntary and non-statutory bodies which would need to be designated at some stage.</P>
      <P>I am concerned when I look at the amendment tabled by Deputy Shatter which was not accepted. He proposed that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; publish guidelines describing the category of persons who shall be appointed designated officers.  The legislation uses the phrase &ldquo;the Minister may give a direction&rdquo;.  There is little between them but &ldquo;shall&rdquo; could be considered stronger.  The Minister may give direction in writing to the chief executive of the health board or he may not. Could that be stronger?  Does that mean the Minister would come into play only if there was a problem as a result of a chief executive officer asking him?  It is a little weak in comparison to Deputy Shatter's original amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry that she is reacting to the Murphy report.  She is anticipating &mdash; and I hope it does not happen &mdash; that the non-statutory and voluntary bodies, at some time, may not have a facility to do something about a report made to them.  It would go back into the shadows and we would have to introduce more legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Senator clarify where she is talking about &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment tabled by Deputy Shatter read that the Minister &ldquo;shall publish guidelines describing the category of persons who shall be appointed designated officers&rdquo;.  That amendment was rejected.  The Minister's amendment reads that the Minister &ldquo;may give a direction in writing&rdquo; to the chief executive officer of a health board requiring him to appoint designated officers.  The Minister gives directions to the chief executive officer to appoint as a designated officer each person falling within a category of officer of the board specified in the direction.  I feel that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is weak in comparison to the amendment which was not accepted which used the words &ldquo;shall publish guidelines&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Senator Henry and she is correct when she says that, while we must confront this issue in the context of all the information available to us, it is a good idea, if it is possible in the framing of this legislation, to leave some leeway to make provision for eventualities.  We are making law which we hope will stand for a long time.  I agree with Senator Henry and I am glad that we are not taking Report Stage today.  That will give the Minister time to take on board concerns expressed by us on Second Stage and which were clearly articulated today by Senator Henry.  The Minister will hopefully find himself in a position to come back to us on Report Stage and show us that, following deliberation, he has added this to the Bill.  By way <Col N="77" /> of a ministerial order or a new guideline emanating from such an order, this Bill could be amended to take on board the very real concerns expressed by Senator Henry and in the Murphy report.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for broadening the range of people who can act as designated officers.  It is broader than I initially realised.  I understand his concern when he says that there will come a time when he does not want to broaden it further.  It is a fact that everybody's business becomes nobody's business.  That is what happened in the swimming scandal.  People knew what was happening and chatted about it among themselves; it may be that they agonised about it. However, one way or another they did not take the correct course of action and as a result, pain was inflicted on so many victims who will carry the scars for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>I understand why the Minister wants to be clear and definite about where he places responsibility and the protection in law which goes with that. Nonetheless, as Senator Henry said, if someone in the voluntary sector wants to report to another person in a key position of authority as opposed to going directly to a garda or health board officer, provision ought to be made to enable that to happen.  I read the Murphy report in great detail.  It recommended, that in the first instance, officers might have the matter of suspicion discussed within the internal structure.  That should not be ignored.  If it can be taken on board I ask the Minister to come back to us about it on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>This is Committee Stage and I will not make a Second Stage speech.  However, our history is one of under-reporting.  It is like the valley of the squinting windows &mdash; we are all looking out to see what is happening but none of us is taking action to prevent vulnerable people being damaged and destroyed.  This Bill should ensure that citizens are alerted to their responsibility, particularly to children.  Every adult citizen has a responsibility to take care of the next generation. This must be taken into account.  This Bill should not be copperfastened in such a narrow fashion that matters which arise at a later stage cannot be provided for.  I ask that Senator Henry's concerns be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Henry's amendments and I listened carefully to Senator Quill.  However, basically we are making law here today.  The nub of the question is whether the Minister can delegate statutory powers to those in the voluntary sector.  I want a strong Bill, not a narrow one.  I do not want weaknesses shown in the Bill in years to come because of what we do today.  If cases are reported they will go to court.  I would hate to see somebody getting away with a crime.  I look forward to the Minister explaining the thinking behind this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill gave the most important reason for this Bill &mdash; we want to get away from the culture of the squinting windows. Perhaps Senator Henry will expand on why she feels her amendments are necessary.  I am satisfied that reports should be made to the statutory authorities.  I accept the legitimate concerns of Members about not allowing those in the voluntary sector to be involved in the loop.  This is a small part of the wider issue of mandatory reporting on which we are preparing a White Paper.  We will introduce legislation and I will be happy to examine this concept further in that context.</P>
      <P>We have to invest significant moneys in an adequate child care system.  The essence of that system is that when someone reports a case, the authorities have the ability to respond quickly and adequately and that there are qualified people who can deal with it in a professional way. For that reason, we are employing new child care managers at a very high cost.  I am looking for further funding from the Government to strengthen our ability to respond quickly and effectively to reports.</P>
      <P>That is why we want to get away from the culture, whether in a club or other organisation, where one person reports to another person, an amateur, the chairman of a football or swimming club who works in an office during the day.  That person is then asked to adjudicate.  He cannot use the &ldquo;Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean leí&rdquo; concept. He has to go to the committee and decide whether to report it.</P>
      <P>Can anyone honestly say that is the proper way to go about reporting?  That will not improve what has been happening in clubs where there is a controversy or a scare about someone.  The club must make a decision but the chairman is not the person to do that.  We want to get away from that culture which has bedevilled child abuse reporting here.</P>
      <P>What we want is simple &mdash; if anyone is worried about or suspects child abuse, they can go to a designated officer in the health board or any garda.  I wish to clarify a misunderstanding of Senator Henry's.  There is a specific set of protocols between the Garda and the health boards for immediate transmission of reports.  We are strengthening those in the child abuse guidelines legislation.</P>
      <P>Every expert is of the same opinion, from the officials in the Department to the social workers in the health boards, to the management of health boards, to the expert group which I established last February under an independent chairperson, made up of voluntary agencies and professionals. If we are to have a proper system of reporting we need clear and distinct lines of communication. We will hear the arguments of Senators Henry and Jackman later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to encourage any further designated officers who are not capable of dealing with or trained to deal with a report and who are simply becoming another link in the chain we <Col N="79" /> want to break.  Forty five million pounds have been invested in child care services in the past four years, double the funding given prior to that time, yet, the problems are not getting fewer and we are striving to ensure they do not get any worse.  We must have specific and clear guidelines. There is no point in making a report if the statutory agency is not able to respond immediately and effectively and Members will be aware from the figures that statutory agencies are unable to respond immediately and effectively. For that reason we must improve the response of health boards, both in terms of response times and effective action.  Also we must ensure proper treatment, intervention and therapeutic care for children who we discover from the reports are victims of abuse.  Of course this is another issue.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear the arguments because I accept the point made in the Murphy report that if a person has a suspicion he or she should report it to the chairperson of the club.  There is nothing to stop someone reporting to the chairperson of a club because, having also reported to the designated officer in the health board or the Garda, they are covered.  If a person has an immediate worry that somebody in the club should be expelled, I suggest he first goes to the Garda or the health board.  At the same time there is nothing to stop him telling the chairperson he has done that.  In that case the chairperson can take immediate action, the person is covered by immunity and the statutory agencies will make the examination.</P>
    <P>Recently I spoke to social workers as I was taken by the stringent arguments Deputy Shatter made in the Dáil.  All the social workers were clear in their minds that the biggest problem they had was that people would talk about something and not know whether it was just a suspicion. They were afraid that if they reported it they would destroy somebody's reputation.  The social workers said that kind of circle is more harmful to their work.  If the person with the suspicion went directly to them and let them deal with the issue in a professional way, it would be far more efficient, quicker and easier to deal with.  They are the professionals on the ground.</P>
    <P>If Senators would like to talk to the professionals we can arrange that; Senators can choose social workers in any part of the country. They are at one and they know best the proper procedures.  We consulted with all the health boards during the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.  They all said the proper thing to do was to have designated officers within the statutory agencies.  While I appreciate and wish to accommodate Senators points &mdash; I will think about what I hear today &mdash; I wish to hear cogent arguments the system as amended is better than the Government's proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I hope he and the social workers are at one when it comes to mandatory reporting.  It may not <Col N="80" /> be the same then.  I thank Senators Quill and Jackman for their support.  It is important to note that I am not asking the Minister to expand the number of designated officers at this moment.  I am giving him the latitude to expand the number if he needs to.</P>
      <P>I wish everything was as clear and straightforward in life as the Minister wishes it to be.  He is right, people should report.  There should be a chain of command within the health service by which proper and direct action is taken immediately and professional experts in the area deal with these cases.  People in the voluntary sector and in non-statutory bodies should be discouraged from taking on the responsibilities of trained social workers.</P>
      <P>However let us be practical.  The Minister has been practical about the extent to which the statutory bodies are able to do anything at present.  I am sure the Minister, like myself, saw the reports in the newspapers that the Eastern Health Board had not inspected any child care facilities in its jurisdiction in the past few years.  I presume the same must have happened with the other health boards.  I do not see why the Eastern Health Board, the one with which I deal, would be any worse than the others.  They are terribly over-stretched.  They are not very close to what is happening on the ground.  The Minister has expanded the number of designated officers.  I was delighted to hear that.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not have to come into play at all and I will not press it if the Minister will think about it.  It does not have to come into effect if his proposal is seen to be working adequately in five years time and everyone is reporting to the health boards.  That would be fine.  However I know from experience working in the health service for 30 years, there are unfortunately a large number of cases that &ldquo;trickle through&rdquo;.  I anticipate that this will not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a valley of squinting windows.  I think Senator Quill was implying we are inclined to close the lace curtains and pretend nothing is happening outside.  There are people in voluntary organisations who are not happy about the way something is happening.  They want to do the best they can for children but they are not sure to whom they should report.  Let us suppose that within five years we do not get through to these people that they must contact someone in the health board, then I want the Minister to be able to put the youth officer of a club in a position to which people can report without fear of prosecution. That is all I want.  I do not want him to do anything today.  He can consider it in five years time and set a time limit.  I would like there to be leeway.  I will not press the amendment as the Minister said he will think about it.  The Minister will have gone on to higher things by then but he could leave the then Minister of State with the leeway to deal with a problem if youth clubs have not got the message and there needs to be an officer within the organisation to whom people can report.  That officer can be told that he needs <Col N="81" /> to report immediately.  I am anxious that we will be left with a situation we might regret in a few years time.  The Minister need not appoint any other designated officers.  I agree with his aims and that is preferable.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to ascertain from inquiries within the health board if it is true that none of these facilities has been inspected in the past few years.  It is few years since we brought in legislation that facilities for children were to be inspected.  I acknowledge this is very difficult because it is a large area and inspections can be expensive and time consuming.  Those inspecting child care facilities cannot simply run in, look around and run out.  All these things take time and it is a very onerous task for the social workers involved.  Of course they would like people to report directly to them but I am asking the Minister to leave leeway.</P>

      <P>We are in tough territory and I am not trying to put road blocks in anybody's way. If anything I say helps ensure we have the best available legislation and procedures, I know I will get a fair hearing.  We are essentially providing immunity in law for people who in good faith report an abuse to a designated person.  That is the essence of our actions in the context of this Bill; there will be further legislation.</P>
      <P>The only personal experience I have is teaching in a school for almost 25 years.  If I had a suspicion that abuse or neglect was taking place, my first port of call would be the principal's office.  It may well be, in the context of the school in which I taught, that there would not have been any difficulty in this regard.  Sadly, it has emerged that many abusers of children have been school principals. Are we extending immunity in this Bill to a teacher who would follow the route I would have taken by reporting to the principal's office as opposed to the gardaí?  Until quite recently there was not a good response to the reporting of rape cases.  This is something we must take into account when putting in place procedures we hope will work and deliver the outcome intended in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments of various speakers is a clear indication of the concern to get this legislation right.  However, we must be careful when framing it to ensure the people enshrined in it as the appropriate people to whom to report, will have the ability to correctly interpret the report. In the past there has been a great reluctance on the part of the abused and members of the general public to report abuse cases.  However, recent cases have focused people's minds regarding the concept of child abuse.  This could be described as the silver lining behind the cloud.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill referred to school teachers. Given the various cases that have emerged in the last number of years, it is fair to say that all categories of people have abused.  This is why we must be so mindful of the situation confronting us when framing this important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I would be concerned that people appointed to receive reports would not be in a position to correctly interpret them.  The people referred to by the Minister should be the people designated to receive reports.  I would be concerned about two categories of people in this regard &mdash; the abuser and the false accuser.  If someone gets a bad reputation it is difficult to disprove it.  We must give careful consideration to those to whom we give a mandate to receive reports.</P>
    <P>The health board of which I am a member has a confidential telephone line.  It is within the remit of anyone to pick up the phone and ring an appropriate person regarding a report.  Twice in the last three years I received two different reports about work being carried out by the board in relation to child abuse.  This concerned children who were being physically abused by their parents.  I got a blow-by-blow account from the parents of what had taken place.  Having listened carefully to what I heard from both occasions, I found the approach of the social workers to be absolutely correct.  I would be extremely worried that we would not designate the people who are best qualified to receive reports.  For example, the PRO of a youth club could have no qualifications; he or she could be the biggest lúdramán since the sliced pan.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the comments of Senators Henry, Quill and others.  However, it is imperative that we get this legislation right.  I am pleased the Minister said he has listened carefully to Senators and that he will consider their comments.  I compliment Senator Henry on not pressing her amendment because it is a clear indication that she wants to get this legislation right.  When we discuss the Report and Final Stages of this Bill, we will all be focused in on what the Minister is trying to do.  The Minister also wants to get the legislation right.  The appropriate people to receive reports are those mentioned by the Minister. They are the best qualified people to interpret them and to take the correct action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are forgetting the amendment refers to &ldquo;or any person deemed to be so by the Minister&rdquo;.  It is up to the Minister to designate the particular person, it is not the youth club who will designate the PRO.  While I agree that categories of social workers within the health boards would be the appropriate people to deal with these issues, reports from the health boards indicate that these people are currently very hard pressed.  Senator Henry's amendment proposes that we should give people an opportunity to come forward.  Many people will not want to go that route; we are not a civic minded people. Have there been instances of people reporting from a malicious or vindictive viewpoint?  On Second Stage Senator Norris gave statistics in relation to New Zealand where very few of the cases reported were of a malicious or vindictive nature.  I was surprised to learn that the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand and Ireland are the only countries going down this road.  I am not <Col N="83" /> sure of the position in Northern Ireland.  We are fairly proactive in this regard and we could learn a lot from the other countries who have this immunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry is asking the Minister to bear in mind that he may get many complaints from sporting organisations, GPs or the teaching profession. Up to now these people would have said they would not do so because they intend to go down the legal route and it is not worth it.  It is such a sensitive area they would not want to bring a complaint against a person.  Paedophiles can be very respected people in the community.  In rural areas, in particular, a person can be singled out as the one who made a complaint.  Senator Henry's amendment would give the Minister leeway so that people would feel free to go to the designated people.</P>
      <P>Will health boards be in a position to react immediately to complaints?  This is related to my later amendment.  There may be a delay before designated officers of health boards or the Garda are in a position to act and that could give time for similar acts to be perpetrated on other children. There is so much pressure on health board workers and on the Garda in other areas that we must question how quickly they could act on an allegation of child abuse.</P>
      <P>Is it possible for immunity to be expanded to other areas?  The matter would still be dealt with by health boards and the Garda.  It is a matter of granting immunity to other designated people. The Minister has the final say.  Senator Henry raised the matter to give the Minister of State an opportunity to consider if there is a better way.  I am aware his heart is in the right place and that this is a very sensitive area.  However, we tend to forget that the legislation should be centred on the child and that we do not want to resort to the legal route.  That would cost a fortune, by and large, and the Minister of State has limited funds. It is our hope that 80 per cent of the funds would be spent on the child rather than on the legal route which has been the case up to now.  Our hearts are in the right place.  Senator Henry is merely asking the Minister of State to consider if other people could be designated and to return on Report Stage with his decision.  Perhaps the health boards and Garda would know of suitable people.  We must be more creative in this area because it is so traumatic for us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>If we all followed child abuse guidelines, there would be no need to worry because they are good.  Unfortunately, this does not happen. I was taken with what Senator Quill said about teachers.  I was involved in the establishment of a sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital almost 15 years ago.  The other doctors and I involved in its establishment thought we would be dealing with one or two adult rape victims a week.  Within six weeks, we were flooded with children who had been brought in by teachers.  They had been receiving these complaints <Col N="84" /> but they could think of nowhere to bring the children.  When the unit opened, they thought they had somewhere to bring them and children of all ages were brought to the unit.  We had to open two specific facilities in Temple Street and Crumlin to deal with them.  Even the most intelligent people, and among those I include the teaching profession, are sometimes nonplussed as to where they should go.  There was nothing preventing them from contacting the health board or social workers.  However, they did not know where to bring the children.</P>
      <P>I will not continue to discuss this matter because the Minister of State knows my views.  I understand what Senator Glynn said, but I am not suggesting that PROs should be able to set themselves up as some form of social workers in youth clubs.  All power rests with the Minister. We want to ensure that, if it is seen in five years' time that the necessary reporting is still not happening, he or she will be in a position to do something about it rather than having to return to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I will not press the amendment because I only want the Minister to consider it and see if he can grant this leeway for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Henry would consider how the time lapse issue might be dealt with in five years' time, I would be prepared to consider the issue in general.  However, the wording of such an amendment would need to be exact so that, in a situation where a time lapse existed and the current system of reporting was not working, further officers could be designated who would not be employed by a statutory body.</P>
      <P>The irony in what all three speakers said is that they agree with the thrust of what we are trying to achieve.  Senator Henry initially asked what social workers would think of mandatory reporting. This is a small part of the wider issue of mandating people to report to which we are committed and on which we have a White Paper.  It is possible that, if people were to be designated, the legislation would have to be changed in the context of mandatory reporting.  All are agreed that the only people who should be mandated to report are professionals &mdash; teachers would probably be the most important.  The example given by Senator Quill will be catered for in the mandatory reporting legislation under which all professionals will be mandated to report child abuse. However, ordinary people will not be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have studied countries where mandatory reporting has been introduced, and the most significant finding regarding its introduction, especially in the United States, was that it was necessary to put a great deal of resources into training professionals given the responsibility to report.  It is a major problem here that many professionals, including teachers, are not trained to recognise abuse.  One of the major tasks in the context of the legislation will be training professionals, such as teachers, to recognise and report abuse.  In the context of mandatory <Col N="85" /> reporting, the amendment is going in the opposite direction because we will be mandating professionals and not ordinary individuals in clubs across the country.</P>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Henry referred to the pressures of designated officers.  They are all designated to receive a report.  The child abuse guidelines include a series of new channels.  Once the designated officer in the health board receives a report, it is then channelled to the child care manager who has the specific task of examining and responding to it.  One thing of which we are certain and have been assured by the health boards is that, while there are pressures on health boards and waiting lists in terms of investigations, every case received is screened and any case deemed urgent is dealt with.  There is no question of children being left in circumstances of continuing abuse.  They are always given priority and dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>I accept there are delays in the introduction by the Eastern Health Board of inspection of child care facilities, but that is a separate issue.  Having regard to health and safety and children's welfare, we are now implementing the child care legislation. However, it is only in the past six months that health boards started to carry out inspections because the regulations had to be introduced, but inspections are now taking place.  I accept Senator Henry's point that the only excuse for their not happening earlier is that the Eastern Health Board did not have the resources in that area, which is separate from that with which we are dealing now.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to consider the limited possibilities of an officer in a club, which could include a timescale.  If Senator Henry wishes to expand on the five year time span, I could consider the matter, if it were acceptable as a compromise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it and commend the Minister of State.  I could not envisage a situation in any registered club with recognised structures, that is grant aided out of public funds, where officers would not be given some level of responsibility in the context of the law we are going to frame.  This is the angle I have been using all the time.  My motivation and information on this issue derives from the Murphy report and the awful story about a Dublin institution that was on the news this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister is correct to narrow the provision to make it as effective as possible, my fear is that young people are very vulnerable.  People who run clubs for children must recognise from the outset that they have to take on board huge responsibilities for their welfare.  It is not enough to take in children and teach them new skills in <Col N="86" /> swimming and so on.  They must be required by law to be responsible for their welfare and wellbeing while they are under their care.  That is the least the State should seek to demand.  I am pleased the Minister of State said he will see if it is possible, without in any way weakening the fabric of this Bill, to bring people who work in the voluntary sector into the designated area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern about clubs, or designated people in clubs, is that people tend to join clubs because they are of a like mind and share a common purpose, whether it is swimming, the GAA, or some other type of sport, and there is a club atmosphere.  I may sound cynical and like someone who has lost faith in human nature, but I would not trust a club member to protect my child or any other child if child abuse was taking place within the confines of that club, even if I were a member.  I would have more faith in a statutorily appointed civil servant because we would have some sanctions against that person if he or she failed to live up to his or her statutory obligations.  I am uneasy about the route we are considering, but perhaps we can flesh out the issue on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and welcome what the Minister of State said.  The Murphy report identified all the risk areas for children, for example, swimming, the GAA, etc.  It may be necessary to extend the legislation beyond the statutory bodies, but it is not envisaged that there will be a huge plethora of designated persons.  I hope there will not be any forthcoming scandals.  The legislation should give the Minister the option to afford children extra protection in areas of high risk.  We do not know what will be uncovered in the future because each week there is a new scandal to shock our system.  This provision will act as a safeguard.  I rely on the Minister of State to glean from what will happen over the next number of years how this reporting system emerges. As a teacher I welcome what he said.  Teachers have been crying out for the necessary training for a long time.  It may be necessary to extend this training beyond teachers.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to club officers.  A committee of a club takes on the responsibility to run that club, not necessarily for the pursuit of excellence in the sport, they also take on the responsibility to care for the children in the club. Parents would be very pleased to know there is another arm of designated people whom they or perhaps teenage children can approach.  I do not believe teenage children, who may not want to say anything to their parents, would go to a health board or the Garda Síochána.  A designated person is another option for a child.  We have to think through this matter and I believe the Minister will do that and come back to us to determine how it can best be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Henry stated, this provision does not apply to every youth club officer.  The Minister can examine other areas where a designated <Col N="87" /> officer would be an easier person for a child or parents to contact.  I thank the Minister of State for stating he will consider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I defer to comments made by Senators Quill, Henry and Jackman.  As I have already stated, I am concerned that designated persons would not be qualified to receive reports, interpret them correctly and take appropriate action.  The adage &ldquo;too many cooks spoil the broth&rdquo; sums up this matter.  There could be an excellent person in a club, but there could also be a head banger who would not be qualified to deal with child abuse.  I accept Senators are trying to broaden the Bill to ensure as many people as possible are in a position to report child abuse.  I am concerned that unqualified people could be put in a position of huge responsibility.  I am not pre-empting what the Minister might do because he said he will consider the matter, but I urge caution for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>If what Senator Fitzpatrick said is true, that all people in a club are like minded and that it would be pointless contacting them because they would not report abuse, why is Minister McDaid withholding money from the Irish Amateur Swimming Association until it puts its house in order?  The Minister is saying people within a club must have some sense of responsibility for what happens in a club.  I would say the same to Senator Glynn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister.  People who run clubs should have responsibility for the activities that take place within their organisations, especially when many of them receive financial, moral and ethical support from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The ethics in sport regulations are being reviewed with a view to ensuring the current difficulties are brought to an end.  Again, I am prepared to consider the provision but I can see difficulties arising with regard to associations and clubs.  There would still be the same problem even if we designated the chairman of a club.  The chairman would then have to decide whether to adjudicate himself or automatically approach the health board.  Would it be acceptable that we would try to amend the legislation to allow for a person informing the chairman and going to the health board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely people have a sense of moral responsibility.  The appointments do not have to be made now.  Everything is all working so that people get on to the health boards at once. That is terrific.  The child abuse guidelines are very good.  Would that all of us kept them in mind but, unfortunately, that does not happen.  When a person knows that if they receive a complaint they <Col N="88" /> must get on to the health board, they will not sit around adjudicating on it themselves.  They should get on to the health board or the Garda. Senators Quill and Jackman have the same thing in mind.  They should not set themselves up as a private social work board.</P>

If they feel they should say something there should be someone adjacent to them to go to.  This provision may be badly needed.</P>

Subsection (2) of amendment No. 4 states that &ldquo;a meeting of the governing body or relevant committee, whichever is the case, shall forthwith be convened. .&rdquo;.  We are not interested in getting into that.

      <P>I would expect the Minister of State would say it is stronger.  The previous amendment, which was not taken in the Dáil, said &ldquo;shall issue guidelines&rdquo;.  That wording is very strong.  Under the terms of the Bill the Minister has to &ldquo;give a direction in writing to the chief executive officer of a health board requiring him or her to appoint to be designated officers.  . . &ldquo;. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not appear in that section. The Minister told us he will appoint designated officers.  Could the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; not be used?</P>

I assure the Senator that the phrase &ldquo;may give a direction&rdquo; means that we intend to give directions under this section.  There will be no ambiguity.  We have already named the people whom we intend to designate and there will be others.  I am satisfied that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is adequate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) A person who, apart from this section, would be so liable shall not be liable in damages in respect of the communication whether in writing or otherwise, by him or her to a member or members of the governing body of a sport or of the committee of a sports club of his or her opinion that a child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated or sexually abused by a member of or an employee of such governing body or sports club unless it is proved that he or she has not acted reasonably and in good faith in forming that opinion and so communicating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where a report as described in subsection (1) of this section is made, a meeting of the governing body or relevant committee, whichever is the case, shall forthwith be convened and if the committee finds that there are grounds for the complaint, it shall immediately furnish the details of the complaint to a designated officer of a health board and/or a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="93" /> and the complainant shall be advised of the finding of the committee and the action, if any, taken or to be taken by it as shall the person in respect of whom the complaint is made.</P>
    <P>(3) The action taken as referred to in subsection (2) of this section may include amongst other things the suspension from sporting, coaching and training activities of the person in respect of whom a complaint is made and the governing body or relevant committee which suspends any person following receipt of a communication to which subsection (1) of this section applies shall not be liable in damages to such person for so doing if it is proved that it acted reasonably and in good faith in taking such action.</P>
    <P>(4) The reference in subsections (1) and (3) of this section to liability in damages should be construed as including a reference to liability to be the subject of an order for any other form of relief.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An amendment identical to this was moved in Dáil Éireann by Deputy Shatter.  The Murphy report pointed out that a child might be at risk if his or her parents made a complaint to the officers of a sports club.  The amendment would ensure immunity from prosecution to children and parents in such a situation.  A person who makes such a complaint reasonably and in good faith should not be liable for damages or prosecution. The amendment also calls for an immediate meeting of the governing body of a sports club and, if there are grounds for the complaint, for the governing body to inform the Garda Síochána or a designated officer of a health board.  Does the Minister have difficulty accepting these proposals?</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 26, to delete &ldquo;An&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;It shall be a term of an employee's contract of employment that an&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to section 4 which gives protection from penalisation to employees who have reported child abuse.  It makes it clear that an employer cannot penalise an employee for doing his or her duty in reporting child abuse. The purpose of the amendment is to state that it shall be a term of an employee's contract of employment that he or she shall not be penalised for making a report as provided for by this legislation. It makes clear that the prohibition on penalising workers in those circumstances will be an implied term of an employment contract similar to the implied term relating to discrimination on grounds of gender.  The inclusion of the provisions of section 4(1) in a contract of employment will give a rationale for involving the labour law mechanisms in a case of the reporting of child abuse.  This will strengthen the assurance to employees that they will not suffer through reporting child abuse because they will have the complete protection of labour law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

This statutory protection is considered adequate and in line with the approach adopted in other employment protection legislation.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

It refers to the appropriate person having sufficient reason to believe that the statement was false.  The term &ldquo;appropriate person&rdquo; has particular meaning under this Bill.  It refers to designated officers of the health board in a broad range of categories of staff and <Col N="97" /> members of the Garda Síochána.  These are the persons to whom reports are to be channeled initially so the reporter may enjoy the immunity provided under the Bill.  They are not, in the majority of cases, the persons who will direct the investigation assessment of allegations and, therefore, would not be in a position, nor would they want to be in a position, to decide on the validity of a person's motives in making a report of child abuse.</P>
    <P>The intention is to ensure that the widest possible grouping of health professionals is available for the purposes of receiving reports of child abuse.  People who report child abuse to those individuals will enjoy the benefits of immunity offered by this Bill.  The designated officers will pass the reports to the relevant responsible official in the health board.  In most, if not all, health boards this person will be the child care manager.</P>
    <P>I am advised that it is standard practice to have a time limit for the bringing of summary proceedings. This reflects the principle that summary offences should be disposed of speedily within a reasonable time after their alleged commission. The defendant in a summary prosecution has a right to expect that the matter will be pursued with reasonable expedition.  Otherwise, it would be hard for a defendant to meet a case properly. Delays can lead to a defendant's summary proceedings being unfairly prejudiced in making a defence, and natural justice may require that a summons be dismissed.  Irrespective of statutory time limits, the prosecution can be open to criticism by the courts for deliberately or neglectedly delaying the commencement of summary proceedings.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the intention of amendment No. 14 and I am pleased to bring forward my own proposal, amendment No. 13, which will meet the concerns of the House.  Section 5(3) if amended will allow for a period of two years from the date on which the offence was committed or, if later, two years from the date on which evidence that, in the opinion of the complainant, is sufficient to justify the bringing of the proceedings comes to that person's knowledge.</P>
    <P>In layman's terms, section 5(4) will allow for a certificate to be produced by the complainant to the effect that evidence came to his or her knowledge at a particular time and that this evidence is accepted by the courts.  The amendment meets the concerns of Senators and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcomed this section on Second Stage and I welcome the Minister of State's response to that debate.  I and my colleagues were concerned that the 12 month time limit as originally included might prevent the legislation being used in the majority of cases of malicious reporting that might arise since cases can take up to three years to be investigated by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Amendment No. 14 was put down to ensure that this issue would be addressed.  I do not understand the Minister of State's amendment.  It was explained to me twice by a lawyer and I still do not understand it.  It is written in strictly legal terminology.  I have doubts about how the evidence by way of certificate might stand up if challenged in court.  However, I accept the Minister of State's good intentions and assurances in that regard.</P>

      <P>For many families of Irish soldiers who fought and died in the Great War, this is a special time.  Nine million soldiers died in that war and 20 million were maimed or wounded.  Of the nine million who died, 50,000 were Irish soldiers. They were laid to rest in forgotten graves in foreign fields.  Now, 80 years after what was called &ldquo;the war to end all wars&rdquo;, and what can only be described as one of the most barbaric episodes in European history, a new spirit of reconciliation and understanding prevails.  This spirit of understanding is helping to heal some of the wounds of generations.  At last the families of those who perished can pray openly together for a lasting peace.</P>
      <P>It is only fitting that Ireland's Great War dead should be cherished alongside all patriots who struggled and suffered.  We should remember the 50,000 Irish men who died in World War I with the same respect as those who struggled for Irish freedom.  Those we commemorate in the House today and commemorated in Belgium yesterday suffered a double tragedy.  They fell victims not only to a war against oppression in Europe but their memory fell victim to a war of independence at home.  Those who died were remembered only by their families and friends, they were forgotten by a nation who had found other heroes.</P>
      <P>Eighty years later we have managed to restore some dignity to the commemoration of a common sacrifice in whatever cause.  It is right that we should remember the soldiers of the 36th Ulster Division and the 16th Irish Division from the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> Nationalist South who fought side by side for freedom, not for flags.  The 250,000 Irish who fought in this terrible war came from every corner of Ireland.  My granduncle, James Cassidy, was one of those who fought and was fortunate enough to survive and come back and live for many years in Castlepollard.  Every parish in Ireland was touched by the consequences.</P>
    <P>We must try to use this knowledge in the continuing search for lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  We must keep alive the memories of those who fought in the Civil War and those who were victims of the Northern Ireland conflict who now yearn for peace.  The lessons we must all take from Flanders is that of the futility of war and the waste of young lives.  There must be a better way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for so readily agreeing to these statements.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's ceremony at Messines was long overdue but, nonetheless, welcome.  It brings to an end decades of neglect and at times a shameful conspiracy to write out of national history one part of our story.  Yesterday the State acknowledged in powerful symbolism that this is a pluralist state, that to be Irish is not just to be Nationalist and to be a Nationalist is not just to be of the Sinn Féin tradition.  For too long the official version of Irish history denied these essential facts.</P>
      <P>Let us base what we say today on truth and face up to our past.  In the 1920s the survivors of the war and their relatives held yearly ceremonies of remembrance.  Remembrance for most of them was of people recently dead, of events recently over and these ceremonies were often tinged with the real rawness of recent loss.  For the most part they held these ceremonies without interference, their grief and pride respected by their neighbours and by the Governments of the day.</P>
      <P>In the 1930s that changed.  In the then mood of intense nationalism more and more they found their parades were unwelcome, their manifestations greeted with hostility.  There was intimidation, some overt, some silent, but the message was clear &mdash; Irish republicanism was an exclusive creed and these Irish people were not welcome. That continued to be the case for decades. Official Ireland did not want to know.  Republican Ireland, or at least sections of it, saw them as an enemy, a symbol to be shunned, a remembrance of things best left unremembered.  Let us recall that it is just over a decade since the Irish State was officially represented at a Remembrance Day ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  What is happening now is welcome, but it is also a rebuke to years of neglect, indifference and hostility.  Above all, it is a rebuke to an old intolerance, to an old and bitter version of nationalism, a version we hope is passed for good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all today, let us remember those who died, fought and who came home to obscurity and often hardship just as their fellow soldiers did in all the other countries which were involved in <Col N="100" /> that war.  Nothing about the Great War was good. It was brutal and barbaric.  It was the breakdown of civilisation.  It created and unleashed forces which led directly to the emergence of international fascism in the 1930s and the unfinished business of that war led almost directly to the Second World War, 21 years later.</P>
    <P>I hope we have learned; I believe we have.</P>
    <P>Today the former enemies of Europe are integrated in common cause.  International understanding has never been greater, even if war is still an ever-present threat.</P>
    <P>It is important for us, as parliamentarians, to remember that two Irish parliamentarians died in the Great War.  They are commemorated today in the Parliament at Westminster.  Captain Willie Redmond, the Nationalist MP for Clare, a decent self-effacing patriotic man, died at Flanders.  That tortured genius, Tom Kettle, MP for Tyrone and professor of economics at my university, UCD, died at the Somme.  Incidentally, the son of the third parliamentarian to die, Charles Lyall, a Scot, is well known to many people in these Houses as a founding member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.</P>
    <P>Tom Kettle wondered why he had volunteered to fight in the Great War.  He asked himself whether his rightful place was there or with the men of 1916, many of whom were his friends.  His last poem, written to his daughter just before his death at the Somme in 1916, gave his reasons.  It was written in the brutality, the horror and the nightmare of the trenches.  He wrote:</P>
    <P>So here, while the mad guns curse overhead,</P>
    <P>And tired men sigh with mud for couch and floor</P>
    <P>Know that we fools, now with the foolish dead,</P>
    <P>Died not for flag, not king, nor Emperor,</P>
    <P>But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed,</P>
    <P>And for the Secret Scripture of the poor.</P>
    <P>These same sentiments troubled another poet who found himself at war.  Francis Ledgwidge ended his days questioning the why of it all.  His lines, again written in the trenches shortly after the 1916 Rising, called to mind the death of his great friend, Thomas MacDonagh.</P>
    <P>He shall not hear the bittern cry</P>
    <P>In the wild sky, where he is lain,</P>
    <P>Nor voices of the sweeter birds</P>
    <P>Above the wailing of the rain.</P>
    <P>But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor,</P>
    <P>And pastures poor with greedy weeds,</P>
    <P>Perhaps he'll hear her low at morn</P>
    <P>Lifting her horn in pleasant meads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> Here were two great ordinary talented Irishmen, both of whom found themselves answering the call in 1914, questioning why they were fighting in the Great War and each explaining in his own way.  Today we, as a nation, are coming to a maturity.  We can recognise that to pay tribute and give honour to the memory of those Irishmen who died in that war is not to threaten the place of those who sought our independence in a different way.  All of them wanted a sovereign Irish state and an independent Irish parliament.  In some ways they came by different routes but all had the same objective in mind.  Above all, today is a day when we honour the memory of the dead without quibble, equivocation or any sort of reservation, we salute their memory and we hope this is the beginning of genuine reconciliation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, 11 November, at 11 o'clock, we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the conclusion of hostilities in Europe and the end of the Great War.  It is a matter of considerable regret that it has taken us 80 years to adequately commemorate and express our admiration for the 50,000 Irish men who fought and died in that war and for the 250,000 men who fought, many of whom came home.</P>
      <P>It was appropriate that the President went to Flanders yesterday.  One of the enduring memories we will always have is of her standing before the Irish peace memorial with the Queen of England and the King of the Belgians as an expression of our sovereignty, independence and maturity.  That is an image I will remember for a long time.  It was moving to watch it yesterday evening on our television screens.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we recognise the sacrifice made by so many in that conflict.  For too long an essential part of our history and our heritage has been virtually submerged.  At times that was done deliberately, even to the extent of creating divisions which otherwise might have been resolved more easily, and the country has suffered as a result.  It is a measure of our maturity, self-confidence and of the fact we see ourselves as an independent sovereign nation, equal in every respect to other European and world nations, that we could express our sorrow and regret, remember the fallen and give official recognition &mdash; there was widespread recognition but it was quiet and subdued &mdash; to those people who died and the unimaginable slaughter which took place in the Great War.</P>
      <P>It is one of the less savoury aspects of our recent history that the survivors and families of the fallen were reduced to a silent and lonely commemoration and that so few were there to see something they must have dreamt about for many years.  The President put it eloquently when she spoke about redeeming their memory with pride.  That should be what yesterday was all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We express our delight that the President could stand side by side with Queen Elizabeth and the King of the Belgians in Flanders yesterday.  We <Col N="102" /> should pay tribute to the contribution made by former Deputy, Paddy Harte and Mr. Glen Barr to the realisation of a dream.  It underlines what politics can do and how constructive it can be to be part of the political process, even if one is not called to high office.  There is a message for Members of this House in that respect.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Irish band could not be at the Menin Gate yesterday for the ceremony where the fallen have been remembered, not for 80 years, as was reported in <i>The Irish Times,</i> but for 70 continuous years at sunset.</P>
    <P>The President said yesterday that we have been in denial about what happened in the Great War. It is easy with hindsight for us to ascribe motives to the dead which may not have been their motives at all.  We are not entitled to question the motives of people who went out, some in the belief that it would or would not lead to the unification of their country, or of people who fell in other places at other times with beliefs which were genuinely held, even if in some cases we believe those beliefs were mistaken.</P>
    <P>One of the great things to emerge from this is the fact that the different strands which make up the Irish story should be recognised and should have their place in the sun.  None of them should be submerged in a subconscious or conscious attempt to deny them.  Had we recognised those legitimate strands in our identity and not tried to suppress them for an extended period, we would have been nearer to a resolution of the problems because the other side would have seen that they were held in respect.  Respect and a consideration for the other person's point of view is central to reaching the type of resolution we have seen and which we hope will bring peace to this island.  If those different strands had been duly recognised, that process would have been advanced.  It was wrong to airbrush part of that from our history.</P>
    <P>I come from a town, which was one of the major British garrisons in Ireland, where there was a large cavalry presence and where many people, including my family, were involved in providing remounts for soldiers in the First World War.  It is only recently that we have come to recognise that as a central part of our history.  I was at a moving occasion on Monday where a local person described their memories of their mother at the turn of the century, which had been put down on tape, and what it was like to live in a garrison town.  Many men from Kildare fought and died in the Great War.  Some 550 of them fell at Passchendaele alone, there was a huge sacrifice. There can hardly be a family in this country, of whatever political persuasion which cannot say they had a relative who fought and died in the Great War.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned Francis Ledgwidge and Tom Kettle.  I had also written down the reference from Tom Kettle which Senator Manning quoted about the secret scriptures of the poor.  It is an eloquent testimony to those people and a fitting epitaph for the many who died.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> We have not been fair to the survivors and it is regrettable that so few of them survived to see this day.  Yesterday, the central importance of as many of our citizens as possible visiting those areas became clear in the context of the young people who helped to construct the peace tower. One has only to stand in one of those cemeteries for a short period of time to understand what detestation of war should be.</P>
    <P>When I visited Flanders, which is a quiet pastoral place, it was difficult to believe that so many millions of people died there.  As a farmer, I kept thinking about the people who farmed that land and who had to leave in 1914.  Their land was destroyed when they came back in 1918 and within one generation they had to leave again. Their entire livelihood and everything that was important to them was taken from under their feet.  It is part of the European experience and the lesson we can learn that these people could put such death, destruction and hatred behind them in a common purpose to achieve a peaceful European dream, which has been largely achieved.</P>
    <P>Ireland must also learn that some of the things we believe to be hugely important and which we regard as major national slights in the context of the European story are perhaps not as hugely significant as we believe them to be.  If we viewed many of those things in the greater European context, not just in the context of the Great War but also of the Second World War, perhaps our outlook might be different.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to how the two traditions become intertwined.  Last night the story of the death of Willie Redmond was portrayed on television. A southern Nationalist, Mr. Redmond was lifted from the battlefield by a northern Protestant, carried to a field station where he was tended to by an Anglican minister in the absence of a Catholic chaplain and was cared for by people who, in another context, might have been regarded as enemies.  There is an enduring message to be taken from that small story which emerged from a global catastrophe.</P>
    <P>It is important and correct that the House recalls today the events of 80 years ago, acknowledges the sacrifice that was made and regards that sacrifice as a central part of the Irish story.  When that sacrifice is fully accepted, we will be the better for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate those who took the initiative to arrange for statements on this matter. It is more important than we realise that the House should unite in debating and making statements on issues of this sort in a serious way which will indicate to future generations that while we <Col N="104" /> may disagree about many things, we do not differ on issues of this sort, where life and death are at stake and where tribalism and bigotry are under discussion.</P>
      <P>I was struck by the comments made by Senators Manning and Dardis.  I perceive this issue partially but not completely in the same way they do.  I agree with everything they stated about the historical significance of yesterday's meeting but, while we should not belittle the contribution of those who died in either world war, that meeting had far greater symbolism in terms of the future than of the past.  The unveiling of the monument at Messines points the way forward rather than back because it draws on the great deeds of Irishmen, Englishmen and Scotsmen in the past.  Having used the events of 80 years ago to bring together the President and the Queen of England, I hope we will soon see the sacrifices of the Second World War commemorated in the same way, perhaps at Normandy.  I hope also it may prove the forerunner to our seeing these two individuals appear together at Enniskillen and Derry to commemorate Bloody Sunday and the Enniskillen bombing.  I accept that such events are more difficult to foresee because the wounds are still tender, but I hope that is the context in which the meeting of the President and the Queen will be remembered.</P>
      <P>I pay particular tribute to President McAleese because she comes from a strong Nationalist background and it was perhaps more difficult for her to appear so early in her term of office with the Queen of England to commemorate the Irish dead who fought side by side with their British counterparts.  This is something on which we should congratulate her because that is the nature of leadership.  Whether we like it or not, she is sending out a signal to the entire Irish nation that, for her, the meeting represents the end of hostilities in the current phase of the conflict.  We hope that conflict is finally over.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge the difficulties the President may have experienced and we pay tribute to her courage and leadership in carrying out what could not have been an easy task.  As Senator Manning stated yesterday, the sacrifice of Irish troops in the First World War has been airbrushed out of history for political reasons.  We need people from the other side to lead us and to show us the way forward.  We, in turn, must show political courage and abandon the prejudices of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pleasure for me to speak on this issue. My father served in the British Army in the Irish Guards.  To some extent, people who served in Irish regiments in the British Army believed that was in some way incompatible with being Irish.  I do not share that view but it is something which people in Ireland were made to believe.  Until recently &mdash; within the past ten years &mdash; it was unsafe for men from the Republic of Ireland to return home if they were serving in the British Army and their commanding officers advised them not to do so until the conflict in Northern Ireland came to an end.  It was unhealthy and <Col N="105" /> unsavoury that Irishmen could not return home because of their beliefs or career choices.  As a result of yesterday's events, I hope that will no longer be the case.  The House should pay particular tribute to President McAleese for what she has done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing time.  I also believe particular tribute should be paid to President McAleese.  Yesterday's ceremony was all the more poignant because of what she suffered during the past 30 years in Northern Ireland.  We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Paddy Harte and Glen Barr and to those who conceived of the idea of using a Christian symbol in memorial park which predates any of the divisions that mark our history.  Symbols are important Someone stated yesterday that the symbolism of the First World War had been taken over by one community on this island.  If that is the case, that community did not encounter great difficulty in doing so.  It would be good for everyone if we reclaimed the symbols which belong to us.</P>
      <P>The names of the war dead are also important. One of the most striking aspects of lists of the war dead revolves around the repetition of names.  I do not know whether Members have looked at the memorials at Connolly and Heuston Stations dedicated to those who worked on the railways and who died in the Great War.  If they have, they will have noticed the recurrence of surnames of men &mdash; Murphy, McDonald, etc. who obviously came from the same families.  On seeing those memorials one can only contemplate the futility of war and the suffering which must have been inflicted on the families of those men.  It was stated on one television programme that three McDonald brothers from Bride Street died in the First World War.  When one recalls that the average age of those who died in that conflict was 19 &mdash; in the Second World War it was 26 &mdash; one can only presume that the men who went to war in 1914 must have been extremely idealistic.</P>
      <P>I am glad the people in Bandon erected a war memorial.  The repetition of surnames on that monument is similar to that which occurs on memorials in French villages where brothers and cousins died in a short space of time in a small area.  When one sees the reflections of the living reflected against the names of the dead at the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, one realises the names of those who died are important.  I would be glad if more cities, towns and villages could follow Bandon's lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My family's experience of the First World War was fortunate.  My father had three brothers who served in the war.  All were under 19 when they enlisted; one of them was 15.  I once asked that uncle if anyone objected when he turned up to enlist, because they were supposed to be at least 19, and he replied: &ldquo;A fine young Sligo fellah and with a horse, do you think the cavalry would refuse that?&rdquo;.  There must have been many more people <Col N="106" /> like him.  At the same time one of his cousins was fighting in the College of Surgeons along side Countess Markiewicz.  There are interesting parallels within all of our families.</P>
    <P>I commend all those who developed the concept of the peace park in Flanders, particularly Paddy Harte and Glen Barr who did a great service for all of us.  I wish Gordon Wilson, who was propelled into our midst by the tragic event in Enniskillen on Armistice Day in 1987, had been here to see this occasion.</P>

      <P>I join with the sentiments expressed today.  I have always believed it is a noble gesture to remember those who died in any conflict and particularly to remember them and their families in our prayers.  We should do this with a sense of dignity and that dignity was exemplified by the deportment and independence of the President in Flanders yesterday.</P>
      <P>As someone who has an English mother, I grew to appreciate and respect her tradition and came to know the better points of the British character. This took place against a background of misdeeds perpetrated by the British Administration in Ireland.  Anyone committed to reconciliation is involved in a positive exercise.  My father, however, played an exceptionally active part in the War of Independence and I always appreciated his role in fighting British imperialism and coercion in our country.</P>
      <P>In recent times, with regard to the Flanders commemoration and associated developments, I have been disturbed that some commentators are reading a broader political significance into it than it warrants.  By so doing we create further confusion and possibly even acrimony.  It would be wrong to use such an important occasion in our own and world history &mdash; a sign of our maturity and of a world fraternity &mdash; as an instrument of revisionism.  I agree fully with Senator Dardis.  We do not have the right to question the motives of any individual unless that individual has expressed his or her motives to us.  Some of the poetic contributions which have been read out today demonstrate that there were motives which were ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also be fair to our own tradition to ensure a balance upon which we can build a more positive approach to our neighbour, Britain, in the future.  We have to accept that during the Great War, which we might see in different ways but which we all agree was a most brutal episode in world history, the British Administration was executing our Nationalist leaders.  It endeavoured to put down the aspirations to independence of a small nation during that war.  I am not saying that to detract in any way from the motives of what is happening now.  I genuinely believe it is part of a bigger picture related to the British-Irish Agreement. It is not possible to achieve a solution to the historical problems in Ireland, which have caused so much tragedy for so long, without an exceptionally broad landscape.  Each and every one of us has something to contribute to that <Col N="107" /> landscape.  Nothing would please me more than to hear the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair &mdash; for whom I have a great admiration because of his role in the Agreement &mdash; apologise when he addresses the Houses of the Oireachtas in the same way the British Administration has apologised in so many other countries, not for the sake of achieving something in a grovelling manner but to put another piece of that landscape together which is necessary to build co-operation and understanding.</P>
    <P>Millions of Irish people have gone to Britain and intermarried.  I have had the opportunity to meet many of these people down the years and it is evident they have become integrated into British society.  At the same time they have a love for their homeland.  One might say these are conflicting emotions.  Of course they are, but in the same way that there are conflicting emotions in Irish history generally.  There is also strong leadership and it is possible to reconcile those emotions.  If we do not, we will do an injustice to those millions of people of Irish extraction living in Britain.  In many ways they are our focus to bring about a final solution.</P>
    <P>I join with other Senators in extending sympathy to all those who suffered in the Great War. Many of their families in Cashel are involved with me in cultural activities.  They are no less Irish than any other Irish person I have known and I have no doubt their parents or grandparents were not any less Irish than anyone else.  I genuinely believe, however &mdash; I say this with no sense of acrimony &mdash; to move forward to the next stage of the final solution of the relationship between this island and Britain, we must do so with a sense of integrity.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh gach éinne iarracht pearsanta chun sin a bhaint amach.</P>

      <P>I was one of the people who attended the ceremony at Messines Ridge yesterday and earlier ceremonies at Ypres, a town so accursed by the war in Belgium.  I pay the greatest possible tribute to a former Member of these Houses and a good friend, Paddy Harte, and to Glen Barr for the initiative which brought about what we saw unveiled at Flanders fields yesterday &mdash; a magnificent round tower built with stone from a building in Ireland, and containing a stone from each of the 32 counties of Ireland.  It is higher than any of the ancient round towers in this country and because of the stone with which it was built it has an aged and weathered appearance. It is a magnificent feature on the landscape. It is an enormous achievement and a fitting tribute to those unfortunate Irishmen who died in that most terrible of conflicts, the Great War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often forget that the young men who went to Flanders, the Somme and all the other awful places in that war were encouraged to do so by their political leaders in Ireland.  There was great resistance to conscription in Ireland at that time, but the political leaders of the Irish Parliamentary Party encouraged young men to go and fight in <Col N="108" /> what it saw as a war against the naked aggression of Germany, although historians now might not agree.  Others fought for the ideal of freedom for small nations.  My grandmother told me she remembered priests in the pulpit telling young men to go to war to fight for &ldquo;Catholic Belgium&rdquo;. Many thousands answered that call and many thousands died.</P>
    <P>I join in the tributes to President McAleese.  I was in the town hall in Messines last night when she made her inspiring speech.  She spoke about how official Ireland forgot about these unfortunate people and how this added to the grief of those who lost sons, as is the nature of war, in that terrible conflict.  On Tuesday I listened to Commissioner Flynn make a fine speech to an assembled gathering in the Cloth Hall in Ypres. He referred to how we had forgotten these brave and gallant young men and apologised for how official Ireland did that.  I complimented him on his speech and said I was delighted to hear him say something he could not have said ten years ago when he was part of Irish public life.  That is how far we have progressed in the intervening years.  As Seán Lemass said over 30 years ago in the other House, there can be no questioning the nobility or the motive of the people who went to fight in that war.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Dardis, I am a farmer and I have been in Flanders fields, after an awful political experience in 1997 when I lost my Dáil seat. However, when I won my Seanad seat I treated myself to a holiday based in Ypres and I toured the battlefields on a bicycle.  As someone who knows and loves the land, I looked at the peaceful fields there today and thought back to what happened there 80 years ago.  Somebody described it as a woeful moonscape of woeful hollow woe. From Tyne Cot cemetery one looks out on the main battlefield of that awful place, Passchendaele, which was well named.  Hundreds of thousands were shot or died from injuries from artillery shells or shrapnel and thousands drowned in the mud.</P>
    <P>That battle was ordered by General Haig in July.  By Christmas the British Army had advanced a couple of kilometres and General Haig called off the battle because of the futility of it.  The German forces then quietly reoccupied the land which had been taken from them.  A few months afterwards a senior officer from the British high command looked at the field of Passchendaele, broke into tears and asked why they had sent men to fight in that awful place.  Many of the men who died there were Irish.</P>

      <P>I was proud to see the President gracefully walk between the British and Belgian monarchs yesterday.  I was also delighted that so many local authorities were represented.  The chairperson of practically every county council was there, along with other members of the local authorities.  They were by far the most numerous public representatives there.  They answered the call made by the Journey of Reconciliation Trust, chaired jointly by the former Deputy, Paddy Harte, and Glen Barr, that as many public figures as possible should be there for the ceremony.</P>
      <P>I congratulate those who brought about yesterday's events.  It demonstrated what politicians, even those who are out of office, can achieve when they are constructive and extend their hands across borders in common friendship.  It was a privilege for me to attend the ceremony which moved me a great deal.</P>

      <P>We were all pleased to listen to Senator Connor's report of his attendance at the ceremony at Ypres.  I regret I was unable to be there and I hope to travel the route taken by Senator Connor by bicycle.  However, in researching this contribution, it was salutary to learn that since 1945, 620 people have been killed from walking on unexploded shells in that area. About 600 unexploded shells are ploughed up every year.  A special Belgian army unit is employed full-time to ensure they are destroyed. In a way, the legacy is still with us.</P>
      <P>This is a welcome debate.  We have finally emerged from the shadows of history and have rapidly matured as a nation in the past 12 months. Like many of my colleagues, I grew up in a small town in Catholic Nationalist Ireland, in a Border county where Nationalist republican activity and the tradition of physical force which brought this State into existence was the dominant feature of our young lives.  It was the history we learned and anything I knew about the First World War came from veterans of the war who lived in my town. Many of them were members of the Connaught Rangers, including Tom Friar and Willie Reilly. Tom Friar &mdash; an elderly man when I knew him as a small child &mdash; lost his two brothers.  One of them was killed beside him as he went over the top in the first Battle of the Somme on 1 July in 1916. His second brother, who was awarded the Mons Star and was a corporal in the Connaught Rangers, was ironically killed in the second Battle of the Somme.</P>
      <P>Tom, like many of the veterans of that period, rarely spoke in any great detail about the horrific dimensions of war.  It is a matter of some regret to me now, many years later, that I did not have a tape recorder beside me to record the detail of how he got involved and the mood of Ireland at the time.  It is perhaps a sad reflection on all of us that we have so many fragments of information from that period but we do not have the complete picture.  At least part of the picture has been reclaimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I said yesterday in the House that I felt Nationalist Ireland was reclaiming its birthright in this regard.  I do not believe my remarks were misinterpreted.  I would not wish them to be interpreted as being disrespectful to northern Unionist members of the 31st Ulster Division who fought alongside the 16th Irish Division, particularly in the closing years of the war.  However, I sometimes felt terribly frustrated that Ulster unionism claimed almost exclusive right to this sacred memory, that the only contribution made in the Great War came from the Unionist side of the family on this island and that it stemmed from motives which were somehow higher than the motives of those who took up physical arms against the British Empire to forge a new republic.</P>
    <P>I know that is all in the past now, but those who ignore the past are condemned to repeat its mistakes.  It is salutary to put in context the conditions of the time.  It is important for an entirely new generation of Irish people to be reminded of the heroic sacrifice of those who went to war in 1914.  It is time this Republic acknowledged the heroic sacrifices of our fellow Irishmen in World War I. That acknowledgement was articulated in moving fashion yesterday by President McAleese.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 116,900 Irishmen fought in the war, 65,000 of whom were Catholic and 53,000 Protestant.  Approximately 60,000 lost their lives.  The largest number died on the Gallipoli campaign in 1915 and in the first Battle of the Somme during the summer of 1916. One of the most famous regiments was the 16th Irish Division which fought with the 36th Ulster Division in the closing stages of the war.  The exploits of the 36th Ulster Division continue to be remembered, mainly in Unionist circles.  However the brave and dutiful men of the 16th Irish Division are not often remembered because the Ireland from which they joined to fight for the freedom of small nations had undergone a sea-change in Nationalist aspirations by 1918.</P>
    <P>It is salutary to remember that royal ascent to the Home Rule Bill was given on 18 September 1914, four weeks after the declaration of war on 4 August.  It is obvious that John Redmond of the Irish Parliamentary Party which represented the mainstream of constitutional nationalism in Ireland at that time, encouraged Irish Nationalists to join the war.  This was mainly to ensure home rule would be protected, the main political agenda of the time.  Perhaps it is difficult to be mindful of that 80 years later.  It was a major political development at that time and would rank alongside the recent peace agreement.  Those who fought done so for the highest of motives.</P>
    <P>There are many families in Ireland with memorabilia such as old medals, ribbons, documents and letters relating to World War I tucked away in cigarette tins.  They are often hidden.  I discovered this when I attended the Dublin Fusiliers Association exhibition 18 months ago in the Dublin Civic Museum.  Incidentally, I exhort school children in particular to visit the exhibition which <Col N="111" /> is currently taking place there.  It is part of our history.  I met people from County Leitrim there who had kept quiet about their families' involvement because it was not politically prudent to do otherwise.  All that should now come into the public arena.  A number of research and heritage centres would welcome memorabilia from World War I. I strongly encourage those who have family memorabilia, such as letters and medals, that relate to the World War I and the Irish contribution to it, to bring them to those centres and into the public domain.  It is time we all came out of the shadows of history in this regard.</P>
    <P>Those who wish to further their interests in members of their families or communities who were involved in World War I may be pleased to know that in recent days a database for the Commonwealth Graves Commission went on the Internet.  One can now access a database which will identify the Irish soldiers killed and where they are currently buried with directional maps. The public records office in Kew, South London, has a huge database of information on Irish soldiers and their involvement in the 1914-18 war.  I know there is a renewed interest in that period, particularly as a result of events in recent days.  It is important that people know where to look for information on family members and people from their communities who served in the war.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe the youngest living veteran is 95 years old.  We are now seeing the last generation who fought in that period.  It is estimated that there are 4,500 World War I veterans still alive.  Those figures may not be absolutely correct, but it is likely there would be that many across the world.  It is a small number set against the figures I quoted for the Irish contribution in the 1914-18 war.  In total 10 million people were killed in that war.</P>
    <P>Those who have no real comprehension of the horrors of the 1914-18 war and trench warfare should go to see a movie currently showing, called <i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>  The opening 30 minutes of that movie relate to the Normandy landing of American forces on Omaha Beach in 1944.  Veterans of that period generally agree it is the most accurate description of the scene.  That action took place over a period of two days. Senators should try and imagine what it was like from 1914 to 1918 when a similar situation continued for four years.  This gives us a small insight into what soldiers had to suffer during that period.</P>
    <P>I, too, pay my deepest respects to all Irish men, North and South, who fought for the freedom of small nations, the noblest of motives, and who believed sincerely their actions would contribute to the freedom of this country.  I would like to think they are now at rest.  They are no longer restless souls.  Their families can get some small solace from what we do in this House in a humble modest way and from what our President did yesterday. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anam.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with all the statements that have been made.  I am glad to have this opportunity of saluting and commemorating the memory of those fine Irishmen who fought in World War I, the most horrific, awful and brutal war.  One fifth of the 250,000 people who fought in that war died.  That is an indication of how much they were at the centre of the fighting.</P>
      <P>It was a memorable and historic occasion to see our President, the Queen of England and the King of Belgium honouring the Irish dead in unity at Messines yesterday.  I applaud and congratulate the organisers, including Paddy Harte who was a member of the Oireachtas for so long and Glen Barr from Northern Ireland.  They came together with a small idea that bloomed into one of enormous historical importance for the entire island.  Its reverberations extend well beyond this island.  It was a remarkable occasion and its influence will continue to have an impact for many decades.</P>
      <P>The question of those who fought and their motives has been at the heart of this.  They are the forgotten soldiers, and their families are the forgotten families of Irish history.  We must remember that the beginning of the century was a brave new age, an age of idealism.  It would be very wrong to impugn the motives of anyone who fought in the 1914-1918 war.  By and large, these people were Nationalists and, ironically, very often subsequently Nationalists impugned their memory.  John Redmond, the leader of the parliamentary party and the Irish Volunteers, had sought Home Rule and they saw participation in this war as a means to obtaining that.  They did not fight for the extension of the empire, they fought so that Home Rule would be established in Ireland.  The famous speech by John Redmond at Woodenbridge for Irish Volunteers and Irish Nationalists to go where the firing line extends was made with the best of intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Francis Ledgwidge and Thomas Kettle were poets and idealists who fought for the freedom of small nations.  Others felt that the freedom of this small nation came first.  That was the difference which caused the split.  A similar division took place following the Civil War in 1924 between the Nationalists and volunteers.  James Connolly had emblazoned in Liberty Hall: &ldquo;We shall not fight for king or kaiser, but for Ireland.&rdquo; That was an equally valid idealistic principle and objective.  It must be remembered that people were not fighting for king, kaiser or the empire; they fought because their interpretation of their place and the context in history was that this was the way to protect democracy, to protect small nations and to do their bit for Home Rule or for Ireland itself. We must remember that history passed them by. While they were fighting in the trenches, the 1916 Rising occurred.  By the time they returned in 1918 attitudes had become inflamed.  Subsequently they were forgotten, and despised in many cases, because it was perceived that they had sacrificed themselves in the wrong arena and <Col N="113" /> a new nationalism had taken over.  To understand this it must be seen in all its context and comprehensiveness. It is important we recognise that these people who were part and parcel of Irish history and sacrificed so much have been forgotten for far too long.</P>
    <P>This ceremony was an attempt to do justice to those to whom justice was not done in the past by our country, historians or politicians.  It is a model and a symbol for the future that peace and reconciliation can come about in the context of all this island by reflecting on the unity on the battlefield and the subsequent divisions.  We can now look back at this shared experience and look forward with the new peace agreement in Northern Ireland.  It will give an impetus to the British-Irish Agreement and to attempts to bring the Unionist and Nationalist traditions together in a new shared experience and a new working relationship.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the future the history books will be rewritten and revised.  This needs to be done in order to honour the memory of these people but, more importantly, to honour their memory for their families.  Those who died paid the ultimate sacrifice but for decades their families have lived with a shadow and question mark over their motivations and intentions.  For this reason it is important that every side in this House puts on record their salutations, commemoration and remembrances of those brave men who went out between 1914 and 1918 and fought honestly and with integrity for the freedom of small nations in what was probably the most brutal of war experiences.</P>

      <P>I feel strongly that I should contribute to this debate having been at the opening of the Irish Peace Park yesterday.  This was a joint venture of former Deputy Harte and Glen Barr. Former Deputy Harte said that this event was his mission in life.  It put in context his reason for discussing this venture at parliamentary meetings in the past when more pragmatic issues were being discussed.  He kept hammering home the importance of this venture.  His quotation in relation to the commemoration is: &ldquo;You have forgotten us too long&rdquo;.  Glen Barr said it is a fitting monument to the young men who died.  I will try to put it in context by quoting President McAleese's foreword which reads:</P>
      <P>The Island of Ireland Peace Park not alone commemorates all those from the island of Ireland who fought and died in the First World War, it also seeks to use their tremendous sacrifice as the basis on which to forge a deeper understanding and respect between traditions on the island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday it was extraordinary to witness so many members of local authorities &mdash; I was representing Limerick County Council &mdash; and the representatives from urban and district councils in Northern Ireland coming together for this event.  I told David Trimble that I was glad to see <Col N="114" /> him there.  He quickly said in a pleasant manner: &ldquo;Yes, but it took you a long time to be here.  As southern politicians you are here today.&rdquo;  I replied: &ldquo;We are here.&rdquo; It was one of those extraordinary moments.  Apart from being at the Peace Park, what hit me most was going to the museum in Messines and looking at the memorabilia. I remember a letter to the parents of a Private Daly from the King and Queen of England at the time stating that he was dead. There was a lot of treasured memorabilia in that museum.  I read poems by war poets Francis Ledgwidge and Wilfred Owen giving horrific descriptions and outpourings of hope that this would be the last war.  The most harrowing experience for everyone who visited the museum was realising that there had been a Second World War.  It is shocking that people did not learn from that extraordinary four year war of torment.  Subsequently there was the Vietnam war and there are many more wars around the world at present. It was extraordinary walking through that tiny village and seeing every house with a green, white and gold flag, a Union Jack and in between them the Belgian flag.</P>
    <P>Communities from villages with little relevance to my area of Cappawhite, County Tipperary, were cheering.  They were joyful on a day of reconciliation.  Little children gave flowers to President McAleese who was very dignified.  One would know by looking at her expression that it was one of the most important days of her life. She was followed by Queen Elizabeth, King Albert and Queen Paula.  The enmeshing of the three countries whose representatives were there in solidarity to commemorate both the Catholic and Protestant Irish dead was extraordinary.  To rub shoulders with all who were there was to commemorate the contribution of the Irish.  Some of my husband's family fought in the First World War.</P>
    <P>There were old men on the coach.  I saw veterans aged 89, 91 and 92 years decked out in all their regalia who had made the journey assisted by their nephews and nieces.  It must have been the most painful journey of their lives but they made it and were able to mingle with us and explain their medals.  It would have been their last journey out of Ireland because they had little time left; a person in their 90s is not going to live much longer.  Nonetheless, they stood erect and proud.  It was wonderful they had the opportunity to return, knowing they were not alone.</P>
    <P>My last image was extraordinary; the sun was setting and poplars which had lost their leaves and an extraordinary round tower in the Flanders fields were etched against that sky.  It was an extraordinarily peaceful atmosphere to which we were invited to return to think, reflect and be at peace and at ease.  People on holiday will feel compelled to visit the Peace Park at Messines to pray for the souls of those who gave unselfishly, among them 14 year old youngsters who lied about their age.  Names were given and experiences and recollections exchanged between the <Col N="115" /> veterans and ourselves.  It was extraordinary to drive from that village knowing this was a modest step which will go a long way to bringing the peace process to fruition.  I am glad a little lump of County Limerick limestone, which was part of St. Mary's Hospital in Mullingar which contained the old workhouse which housed many Famine victims, is the mainstay of the round tower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The First World War is often euphemistically referred to as the Great War but it was anything but that.  It was an appalling carnage of a generation and an appalling loss of young lives across Europe.  It is only right and fitting that we recognise that many of our young people of that generation went to the Continent to fight the war as part of the British Army.  At the time, they went with many different ideas as to what they wished to achieve.  The war was referred to by Senator Cassidy earlier as the war to end all wars and the war to free small nations. As people from a small nation pursuing its own independence at the time, it was obviously in the minds of many who went to fight that this would be their input.</P>
      <P>Some speakers referred to yesterday's events as a rebuke to old intolerance and surmounting years of neglect.  While it is regrettable it was not commemorated before now, it is also understandable. The history of the country and of the relationship between it and England has been one of regret, especially when there was a significant Nationalist campaign for independence and some took a different route to those who went to the fields of Flanders to pursue Irish freedom.  In many ways, we are not as good as we might be in commemorating various historical events.  This is one prime example but there are others.</P>
      <P>The 75th anniversary of 1916 was appallingly commemorated in this part of the island.  This was probably because the historical situation and the struggle at the time inhibited people.  It is a sign of our growing maturity as a sovereign and independent nation that these events can be put in perspective and that we can honour those who played their part in making a better world.  For that, we owe them a great debt of gratitude and it is appropriate we honour them.</P>
      <P>My knowledge of the First World War came from a neighbour who had one leg.  For a child, this was interesting because not many people in the town had lost a limb.  He lost it in the First World War and was one of many who suffered for life as a consequence of his participation.  His name was Packie Finn and he lived in William Street in New Ross.  His family are gone from the area now but he was an example of many who left the island, some never to return and those who did bore an indelible mark for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July I was invited to visit the fields of Flanders by a group from the North, mostly of the Unionist persuasion although there were some Nationalist councillors.  The fact I went with them was surprising from their perspective.  We visited <Col N="116" /> Major Willie Redmond's grave at Loker where he had fallen during the war; it is near the Messines ridge.  His grave is outside the British war graveyard.  I was asked to place a poppy wreath on it which was a challenge as it is something I would not have seen myself doing previously. Equally, the other members of the group were challenged by the fact that this was someone who fought in the British Army as a major and whose family subsequently removed his body because they did not want it interred in the British graveyard. They felt discomfort with it being there. That is an indication of the complexity of the thinking at the time and of the aspirations of various people who fought in the war.  Willie Redmond was an MP for Wexford and for Clare and he and his family were very involved politically in the pursuit of Home Rule for Ireland. Had we achieved Home Rule, our independence might never have reached the extent it has.</P>
    <P>All that is happening now is a clear indication of the change of opinion on this island.  At that event in July, a wreath was laid at the memorial for the 16th Irish Division by Councillor Francis Casement who wore his sash as a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.  A wreath was carried by Councillor Albert Comber who wore his Orange sash because he is a member of the Orange Order and I read the exhortation.  It was interesting that the Unionists present felt that we were breaking new ground and making history.  I said on that occasion, and I will say it again here, that we should look at the example given by the Protestants and Catholics, the orange and the green, who fought side by side in the trenches in the most appalling conditions and set aside their political differences.  If we can now do the same future generations will acknowledge that we too have played our part by bonding the various cultures and traditions on this island.</P>
    <P>The step taken yesterday by Glen Barr, Mr. Paddy Harte and our President is an example of how both our cultures and traditions are learning to set aside their differences and an acknowledgement that we have far more things that bond us together than divide us.  The President has also been acknowledged as representing us extraordinarily well yesterday, as she has done so on all her trips abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for agreeing so promptly to my request to address Seanad Éireann on the very important subject of railway safety.  I asked both the Dáil and Seanad if they would hear me this week and only the Seanad <Col N="117" /> replied in the affirmative.  I will address the Dáil on this matter next week.  Therefore, the Seanad is first into the fray, so to speak.  I welcome this early opportunity to outline to the Members of the House the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the independent consultancy review of the safety of Irish railways.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that following the derailment of a passenger train at Knockcroghery, County Roscommon, in November 1997, I commissioned, with Government approval, an independent review into all aspects of railway safety.</P>
      <P>Over the years, various safety reports have been carried out but there has been no Government sponsored, Dáil and Cabinet approval for an absolutely independent international study on rail safety.  I wanted such a study to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I drove to Knockcroghery on that Sunday in November 1997 and saw the rail crash in which, thankfully, no lives were lost.  It has now been 15 years since there was a fatality on a passenger rail service.  Sadly there have been fatalities involving people who have chosen through great depression to seek a way out of life by committing suicide on the railways, but that is a separate matter.</P>
      <P>In comparison with European railways, we have a very safe line.  The study shows that the safety standards of Irish railways are high in comparison to other European rail networks.  It is important to recognise that and to state it.  When a report such as this is published there are &ldquo;shock, horror&rdquo; reports around the country, along with worry and disturbance.  I hope, however, that everybody who gets the report will read it carefully.  It warrants such consideration and people should read the report, not the review.  In saying that there is no point in reading only the review of the report, I know I will sound like a school teacher, a profession I share with the Acting Chairman, Senator Costello.</P>

      <P>Absolutely not, but some people use it as a denigratory term when they are speaking to women.  &ldquo;School ma'am&rdquo; can be a sexist term.  There is, however, no point in reading the review like one would read the potted précis or critique of a poem without reading the poem itself.  People should read the main rail safety report itself.  Luckily it is written in a jargon-free, lucid, highly interesting and objective manner.</P>
      <P>When I drove to Knockcroghery that Sunday evening, I said to my husband, Enda, that I could not let this continue.  I decided then to request an international study on rail safety.  I could not genuinely live with the premise that I did not know the exact extent of safety needs on the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us come from railway towns.  I was born and brought up within 50 yards of the railway <Col N="118" /> station in Athlone.  As children we grew up with the family of the late lamented station master, Mr. Lally.  The shunting noises of that major railway station are the sounds that linger in my memory.</P>
    <P>The crash occurred on that Sunday and I brought a report seeking this study to Cabinet on Tuesday.  Deputy Yates of the Fine Gael Party asked if it would be a detached, international study, not a CIE study.  I was glad that my thoughts and his coincided.  From time to time CIE undertakes its own studies but I wanted this study to be done in a certain way and it was.</P>
    <P>This report was undertaken by a consultancy team led by International Risk Management Services. The commissioning of this independent study was supported by the Opposition and welcomed in a Dáil resolution in December last year. Therefore, the report has the imprimatur of the Dáil, the Government and the Cabinet.  Following the derailment at Knockcroghery, I made a statement in this House commissioning the report and laying out its terms.</P>
    <P>I have sent copies of the consultants' report to Members of this House and of Dáil Éireann and it has also been published.  I will also be making it available to every worker in Iarnród Éireann. This is not a report for top or middle management; it is for everybody who works on the railways. I want its ownership to comprise those who work on the railways and through them the people who travel by rail.</P>
    <P>The report is clear and unambiguous in its analysis and I urge Senators to consider it very carefully.  The report is very detailed and it would be impossible to cover every aspect of it here today.  I will, therefore, concentrate on providing Members with an outline of the main findings of the report and the Government's response to them.</P>
    <P>There are probably few issues on which we will find greater unanimity in this House than that the avoidance of death or injury should be the paramount guiding principle of all railway operations. I am satisfied that Iarnród Éireann is committed to this principle.  It is important to acknowledge at the outset that Iarnród Éireann's safety performance over the years compares well to other national railway systems.  That is not just my view, you will find that statement made by the consultants in the first sentence of their conclusions.  The good safety record of the Irish railway is due in large measure to the skill and experience of railway staff over the years; a point also acknowledged by the consultants.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is clear from the report the consultants have concluded that there is a need for significant improvement in the safety of the railway.  The task, therefore, of the Government and of the boards, management and staff of CIE and Iarnród Éireann is to use the analysis, findings and recommendations of the report as a springboard to create the conditions for a major improvement in rail safety.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Railway transport has an enviable safety record worldwide and in Ireland, especially when compared to the competing mode of road transport. The last major railway accident in Ireland was in 1983 at Cherryville when seven people died.  Yet, sadly, similar numbers are killed on our roads every week and sometimes over a single weekend.  However, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.  We must never lose sight of the fact that, although the nature of rail travel makes it inherently safer than road travel, rail safety ultimately depends on safety conscious railway personnel working with safe infrastructure and rolling stock and relying on rigorous safety management systems and procedures. Even then we cannot take rail safety for granted.  No matter how good the infrastructure or how vigilant the staff of the railway, it is a sad fact that even on the best railways accidents will occur.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, absolute rail safety can never be guaranteed.  In this regard I am mindful of the recent high speed train crash at Eschede in Germany, which occurred on a state-of-the-art railway system and resulted in over 100 people losing their lives.</P>
    <P>The consultants' brief required them to consider the adequacy of Iarnród Éireann's existing safety policy, systems, rules and procedures and the adequacy of the company's arrangements for implementing these rules and procedures on the ground.  They also considered the adequacy, from a safety viewpoint, of the existing railway infrastructure and facilities including track, signalling systems, rolling stock, bridges, embankments, telecommunications systems, level crossings, etc. They carried out their work in a very rigorous way and looked at best railway practice worldwide. They inspected over 60 per cent of the network. Their examination was very thorough and they looked in detail at samples of all the infrastructure including track, signalling, structures, level crossings and rolling stock.</P>
    <P>They interviewed many Iarnród Éireann staff and, of course, talked informally to many others as they travelled in locomotive cabs with drivers or visited signal cabins.  They sent a questionnaire to all Iarnród Éireann staff.  One in eight replied across all departments and grades in the company. The consultants were full of praise for the unstinting co-operation which they received from the company and all its staff.  Very interestingly, just as a cigire inspects a school, they did not make prior announcements of their visits.  I think this was the right way to do things.</P>
    <P>The consultants concluded that the condition of much of the track, signalling and other infrastructure was poor while the condition of the rolling stock was, on the whole, satisfactory.  They also acknowledged that a shortfall in investment in recent years was impacting on safety.  They found that recently laid continuous welded rail track was in excellent condition although in need of a safety management system to ensure its continuing <Col N="120" /> safety over time.  They concluded that large sections of the older jointed track was in poor condition, particularly on the secondary lines.  They found eight serious safety failures on the signalling system when they would have expected to find none.  This finding was particularly disappointing and very shocking.  Much of the mechanical signalling was in an unacceptable condition and much of the telecommunications equipment was in poor repair.  They also identified some problems with level crossings, such as inadequate braking distances from the signals protecting the crossing to the crossing itself and poor signposting and road surfaces.  They noted the lack of formal systems for preventive maintenance and inspection of structures.  Fencing was poorly maintained in many areas.  The condition of the rolling stock was largely satisfactory with no major safety concerns noted.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the impression created by some media reports, the DART was found to be in reasonably good condition but concern was expressed about some aspects, such as the need for greater attention to the electric power supply system as it gets older.</P>
    <P>While safety related investment in the railway infrastructure is necessary it will not be enough in itself.  The consultants found that Iarnród Éireann needs to urgently tackle the management aspects of safety as well.  Indeed, IRMS went so far as to say that the benefits of infrastructural investment would be transitory if not accompanied by a programme to improve safety management systems.</P>
    <P>If we are to take one lesson from this report it is that we must distinguish hard and soft safety issues.  The hard issues relate to the condition of the infrastructure including the permanent way, level crossings, rolling stock and so on.  The soft issues relate to management, safety training, continuous monitoring of safety measures and the daily implementation of good safety practice.  The report makes the point very cogently that an investment of many millions of pounds in railway infrastructure will be useless if what I refer to as soft safety issues are not tackled.  Both aspects of safety must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The most serious safety management deficiency that the consultants found was a lack of a systematic approach to identifying safety hazards and prioritising and implementing remedial action where this is necessary.  They stressed the importance of improving the company's approach to safety management on the railway and of instilling a safety culture throughout the organisation from general operative to top management.  They emphasised the value of better training and improved documentation and procedures.  They acknowledged that an encouraging start had been made at senior management level in implementing a systematic approach to addressing safety on the railway but stressed that much more needed to be done, especially to ensure that the systematic approach applies at all levels in the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> Senators are aware of the complexity of the rail service.  It involves locomotive drivers, service engineers, track maintenance teams, level crossing operators, station staff and many others.  The service will not work satisfactorily if these elements do not co-operate perfectly and this too is one of the report's most important messages.</P>
    <P>The consultants estimated that a 15 year safety investment programme costing of the broad order of £590 million will be required.  This overall expenditure requirement includes about £230 million for a programme of improvements to rectify safety deficiencies in the railway infrastructure, including track, signalling, bridges and level crossings.  Of that £230 million, about £60 million is earmarked for improved management of infrastructural safety.</P>
    <P>The consultants suggested the expenditure of a further £60 million to improve safety management systems generally throughout the railway and £20 million per annum over the same 15 year period for ongoing renewal of the permanent way.  About £23 million of this £590 million needs to be spent immediately and about half the total should be spent in the course of the five year plan.  The plan lays out what must be spent immediately on urgent safety measures and the systematic follow through over the course of the five year plan.</P>
    <P>The programme for improvement is carefully mapped out.  The programme for the first three months is broken down month by month and thereafter on a six monthly and yearly basis.  It presents a challenge to this and future Governments. Successive Ministers will be obliged to regard this report as the bible of rail safety.  It will be extremely difficult to find the money to implement the findings of the report but it will be even more difficult to maintain the present momentum and to continue with the safety plan as time goes on.  However, the report was commissioned by the Government and must be implemented by this and future Governments.</P>
    <P>I intend to commission an annual audit of the safety programme and to publish those audits so that the public, those who work and travel on the railway and those who govern it will see clearly what is being done by Government and by CIE to implement the safety measures proposed in the report.</P>
    <P>IRMS concluded that this investment programme would be sufficient to restore the railway to a condition where it could operate at existing timetabled speeds and with a substantially reduced risk to the safety of passengers, staff and the public.  The report has pointed out what must happen now.  Iarnród Éireann must get the £23 million immediately.  The Minister for Finance has said the company can increase its borrowings which are currently at £150 million.  The £23 million will come from an immediate increase in borrowing.</P>
    <P>The report also provides that a high level group must within three months &mdash; that is, by the end of January &mdash; produce a detailed plan for how the <Col N="122" /> remainder of the money should be procured over the following years.  I cannot predict what will happen after the first three years because my term of office will have expired.  However, the group will lay out a plan for how the money will be secured in the next five, ten and 15 year periods and how it is to be used.  A detailed implementation timetable will be required.</P>
    <P>Despite Deputy Yates's remarks to the contrary, I did not suggest a timetable of three months to produce the plan.  The IRMS report recommends that the implementation forum complete its work within three months and I have insisted on that.  Two weeks of that three months will be taken up by Christmas but that is too bad. The group is due to have its first meeting next Monday.  It comprises officials from Iarnród Éireann, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of Finance.  This is consistent with the consultants' recommendation that implementation plans should be agreed within three months of the publication of the report.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, CIE has been requested to begin implementation of the report's recommendations, giving particular attention to the immediate safety needs identified by the consultants. Pending consideration by the Government of the task force report, CIE will be authorised to undertake borrowings to finance the implementation of the immediate safety measures.</P>
    <P>The consultants also paid particular attention to the role of the railway inspecting officer within the Department.  The inspecting officer, Mr. John Wesley, is in the House today.  He is essentially the Government's railway safety regulator and currently that job is done by just one person.  The consultants recommended a significant expansion of the functions of the inspectorate and called for additional staff to meet both existing and future commitments.  My Department will immediately begin the process of recruiting two additional railway inspecting officers, as recommended by the consultants.  They will obviously have support staff when required.</P>
    <P>I am determined to make progress on improving railway safety.  With that in mind, I have asked the CIE board member who chairs the company's safety committee to report to me directly at regular intervals on progress.  I have also decided there will be regular independent audits on the progress being made on implementing the safety measures.  This is in line with the consultants' recommendations and I will publish the results of the audits.</P>
    <P>The consultants have clearly identified what must be done to address railway safety.  Responsibility for the implementation of the bulk of the recommendations rests with Iarnród Éireann but it will have the full support of the Government in that task.  At the Cabinet meeting on Monday the report was formally presented to each member. I met the CIE board on Monday to discuss the outcome of the review and I met 18 CIE unions on Tuesday.  I intend to tour the country and to participate in a number of regional workshops <Col N="123" /> over the next few weeks at which the findings of the review will be presented to staff at all levels in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is their safety report and it is not right that it should be given to just a select group and not to every worker on the railways.  I particularly look forward to hearing the views of individual staff members.  They, more than anybody else, will be critical to the success of this venture.</P>
    <P>I see this consultative process as a first step in bringing the CIE board, Iarnród Éireann management, the trades unions and every member of the railway staff together to work, with a sense of urgency and common purpose, to fully implement the recommendations of the consultants.  The IRMS report provides a clear framework within which we must all work to improve the safety of the Irish railway network.</P>
    <P>When I and my husband, on Sunday, 8 November 1997, drove away from Knockcroghery, I gave a great deal of thought to this issue.  It was then I decided to commission an international study independent of CIE, although I am sure its studies on this subject are also valuable.  I was anxious to have a detached and professional study of the railways.  Within two days of that decision I brought it to the Cabinet and it was agreed.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues told me I was storing up a great deal of trouble for myself.  They predicted that the report would cost a great deal of money and wondered what I would do with it.  I am glad to have this independent and comprehensive report.  I will ensure that its recommendations are implemented during my term of office. After that, the task will fall to other Ministers and Governments.  I will rest easier, as will the public, with this charter for action.</P>
    <P>Having received the study, the onus is on all politicians to ensure that the annual timetable of work is completed and that the audits are published, debated in the House and disseminated throughout the country.  There are about 5,000 workers on the railways and each will be given a copy of the report.  I hope to meet as many as want to meet me.  I cannot force them to meet me.  Eight meetings are scheduled &mdash; two in Dublin and one in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Athlone and Sligo &mdash; at which I will speak with, not to, the workers.  Ownership of this process must be vested in those who work the railways.</P>
    <P>This is a major challenge not just for this Government but for all Governments.  It would have been easier for me to claim that the legislative responsibility for safety rests with Iarnród Éireann.  It runs a good system which has good safety measures that are comparable to those in Europe.</P>
    <P>Nobody can guarantee safety, much as one might wish it.  The German example is amazing. The Germans spent thousands of millions of pounds on the most advanced rail system in the world and, within three months of it being operative, <Col N="124" /> 100 people were killed as a result of a signalling failure.  We have put a great deal of emphasis on the permanent ways but the report makes it clear that signalling is potentially far more important than defects on permanent ways.  That is right; a signalling failure can plunge everything into chaos.</P>
    <P>When the railways were first constructed, great excitement gripped the country, even during the Famine years.  Great work went into building the system.  The railway gauges in Northern Ireland and the Republic are the same and that will allow transport to be one of the implementation bodies the Northern Secretary, Dr. Mowlam, and I will pursue.  The excitement of those years and the tremendous work in consolidating the system is due to be relived.  At present, our roads are crowded and are causing environmental and safety concerns but there are more hazards attached to private transport.  I believe a love affair with the railways is beginning again and I want to encourage it.  I wish everybody in the land who aims to travel on the railways would read it.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I wrote to both the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip asking for Dáil and Seanad time and the Seanad replied positively immediately.  I thank the House for that.  I recommend the report to the House and look forward to the debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I agree with her that this is an important report.  As the Minister stated in her final remarks, the reality is that there is a major change taking place in Ireland.  The road transport system is practically collapsing.  In major cities like Dublin, Drogheda and Cork the roads are clogged up. People are voting with their feet and moving to what Iarnród Éireann can offer them.  This report is a good audit of the date and time at which it was carried out.  It gives us a picture of what needs to be done and, as the Minister said, where the money must be spent now.</P>
      <P>There is increasing frustration among the travelling public at the dreadful conditions which they must face on some trains.  In particular, the overcrowding on the Drogheda-Dublin train on the east coast is utterly incomprehensible, unbelievable and highly dangerous.  There is a need for immediate changes in the transport system and the way in which we manage the train service.  Let us take, for example, the matter of overcrowding on an early morning train from Drogheda to Dublin.  When it leaves Drogheda there are some hundreds on it but by the time it gets to Dublin there is absolutely no space anywhere.  People are crowded in like sardines.  It is unbelievable. Trains are late because they are trying to crowd the people on board.  The trains cannot keep to the schedule.  That is the biggest danger facing Iarnród Éireann today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen if there is an accident where there are hundreds of people standing in a trains? There is no facility for those people standing to <Col N="125" /> hold onto structures in the train as they can on the DART.  I am worried about that.  The public is getting worried and angry about it.  The public want action now.  This report is a start but a great deal more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>How many of the safety features of the trains are intact?  For instance, if there is an accident and a passenger wants to knock out the window, where is the special hammer which is supposed to be in each carriage?  In many carriages it is not there.  There is a need for a more vigilant system of ensuring safety in transport by clearly identifying the safety facilities.  The company should make sure these facilities are on every train.  If they are stolen, the company should get more of them.  They must be in every carriage.  That is where they are needed and that is where they must be.</P>
    <P>Longer trains and longer platforms are needed. There is a need for new rolling stock.  These are major issues which must be addressed to increase the efficiency and safety of the transport system. Some of the mainline stations are under review and are being improved.  However, at Connolly Station, which I accept is under reconstruction at present, the platform is extremely dangerous when it is wet.  I have seen people slip and fall on it.  This needs to be addressed immediately because that is a safety risk before one gets on the train.  There is a need to look at all the platforms and all the stations to make sure they are safe for people to walk on.</P>
    <P>In Connolly Station there is a sign indicating that somewhere there is a lift while the station is under reconstruction.  Elderly people have to carry large pieces of baggage up and down stairs and they are not able to do so.  Iarnród Éireann needs to have a more vigilant, attentive and customer oriented policy towards people when such changes are taking place.  It is a disgrace that that is happening.  There should be much greater clarity about these matters and there should be many more visible signs to indicate locations.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann operates a two-tier system. There is the Enterprise Express, which is a first class train from Belfast to Dublin and Cork to Dublin, and then there is what I call &ldquo;the Tralee train experience&rdquo; which I encountered on travelling from Dublin to Tralee not too long ago. There is some excellent rolling stock on the east coast and some poor rolling stock such as that of the train to which I referred.  Certainly the carriages were clean but there was no catering service available.  One could not even get a cup of tea.</P>
    <P>There is the question of dirt on the outside of the trains.  If we are safety conscious, the cleanliness of the vehicles is important.  I cannot understand why the outside of trains and the windows are filthy.  To have these cleaned is a simple matter and it is not being done.  It indicates to me that there is a need for a policy or charter of rights for people who travel on trains.  Safety must be the number one issue, but a quality service must be provided to the individuals and groups who use the trains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The windows in trains in America are easily removed.  If there is an accident, one is told the window can be opened completely and people can get out.  If there is an accident here, how will people get out of the train?  The trains are crowded, with hundreds of people in the carriages and one may not even be able to open the window because the implement is not there.  I worry greatly about that and the public are very angry about it.</P>
    <P>We are asking the public to move from personal transport to Iarnród Éireann and buses.  A representative of Iarnród Éireann told me that the company cannot cope with the hundreds of people on the east coast who are travelling by train and the system is about to break down.  Like everybody else, people want to make the move to public transport but the facilities do not exist.  I agree with the Minister that investment is urgently needed now.</P>
    <P>On the Continent there are the equivalent of double deck trains in which passengers are carried at two levels within a carriage.  This morning I asked an Iarnród Éireann rail inspector about this and he was not sure whether that can be done here.  The demand is so great on the east that there is a need for new modern European-style carriages, provided they can be carried and bridges do not pose a problem.  That is a technical question which I cannot answer.</P>
    <P>The people will wait no longer for an improved service.  People going to work by train are utterly frustrated.  The system is breaking down.  I accept that Iarnród Éireann now has a mandate to improve the rail service.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important report.  It is important that Iarnród Éireann executives pay attention to its contents.  I accept that the Minister is being proactive in bringing it before us.  People are very angry and I must listen to them.  As I am not a Minister yet, I must travel in a different mode of transport, and I am not being facetious.</P>

When the people on the east coast &mdash; my colleagues will deal with the west and the south, etc. &mdash; go to Iarnród Éireann, that is the issue.  This is part of the answer but it is not enough.  There is a need for a further debate as soon as possible after the Minister has consulted with Iarnród Éireann.  I want to know what Iarnród Éireann will do about this matter.  In particular, I want to know how it will tackle the clear issues which I raised.  These are essential matters which need to be addressed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend her for the fact that when this report was published she immediately notified the Seanad, indicated her willingness to address the House and gave us a forum for debate on this important report entitled &ldquo;A review of <Col N="127" /> Railway Systems in Ireland.&rdquo; This report is an indictment of our national railway system and the way it is run.  The public transport service is charged with the onerous responsibility of carrying thousands of people to and from work daily. While the report describes the network as fairly safe, it highlights glaring inadequacies in its strategic management systems which suggest a malaise had set in.  It is reassuring to hear the Minister say that is no longer the case and that things are changing.</P>
      <P>The report states there is no systematic approach to identifying safety hazards.  The failure to prioritise and implement remedial action points to a failure by the company to instil a safety culture.  The efficacy of a safety management plan is eroded by the fudging and blurring of roles and responsibilities.  The disappearance of scarce expertise exacerbates an already weakened system.  It is disconcerting to read in the report examples of the fire fighting role of management in its daily response to major emergencies or failures in the system.  I agree with the Minister that a total change of culture from top to bottom is necessary to ensure that new structures work and bear fruit in the interests of promoting safety.</P>
      <P>When the Minister took office there was a record of fatalities on the railways and a number of derailments and near misses.  She reminded us that early in her term of office she confronted the task of commissioning an independent report on the railway system.  This job was given to International Risk Management Services in April with a ministerial directive to complete it at an early date.  Within months the Minister received the report, brought it to Government, published it and informed management of the Government's response to its recommendations.  She has taken swift, decisive and comprehensive action to establish a culture of safety from top to bottom in the company.  That is her immediate term strategy.</P>
      <P>CIE has been instructed to start implementing the report's recommendations and to give priority to the safety needs identified in it.  The company has been given authorisation to borrow £23 million to start upgrading its services.  The high level task force set up by the Minister, comprising officials from her Department and CIE, must report to her before the end of January with a programme of implementation.  She has authorised the immediate recruitment of two additional railway inspectors and she has asked the company to submit a safety report to her annually which she will publish.</P>
      <P>Most important of all is the Minister's decision to participate in a number of regional workshops which will involve workers at all levels.  That will inevitably engender a complete change in the safety culture of the company.  It will promote a sense of common purpose and urgency among the workforce to fully implement the report's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that the DART is in good <Col N="128" /> overall condition but that major faults have been identified on a local basis.  It points to serious problems such as missing bolts and insufficient servicing of equipment.  It will not be possible to retain the high level of quality, service and reliability if the current structures are not improved.  The DART service only came into operation in 1982, so it is worrying that split sleepers are decaying and the coarse stone on the line is nearing the end of its useful life.  If this report had not been commissioned by the Minister, we would not be aware of these danger signals.  The staff of the company were not aware of them or, if they were, they did nothing about them.</P>
    <P>Other problems highlighted in the report are the number of missing bolts and the absence of broken bolts, which suggest they are not of recent origin.  According to the report, a number of deficiencies in the welded rail track present a safety risk.  The ballast was found to be inadequate over lengths of up to 15 metres.  The slab track, which is bedded in concrete, had failed in several locations between Sandycove and Dún Laoghaire.  Other locations were also identified where similar problems arose.</P>
    <P>The report expresses concern about the long-term safety of overhead conductor lines.  It states that overhead lines are inadequate and appear to be deteriorating.  It highlights the fact there is no formal overhead line inspection and maintenance programme.  The report emphasises that the DART has neither the level of skilled manpower nor the safety access equipment for the maintenance staff to cope with a system as it degenerates with age.  It recommends a thorough revision of all DART electrification safety documentation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that overcrowding was not mentioned in the report as a cause of concern.</P>
    <P>However, there are glaring examples during peak rush hour, particularly on the DART line from Howth to Westland Row where overcrowding is a serious issue.  Many commuters are worried about overcrowded carriages.  Concern has been expressed about the manner in which thousands of people on suburban and DART trains converge on the station platforms at Tara Street and Westland Row and then try to make their way through the narrow exits to the streets.  I have received many complaints from constituents about this, but no significant action has been taken to address it.  I will leave it to my colleagues to refer to the rural rail network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I am discussing safety on the rail line in question.  In 1992, the Government of the day, of which the Minister was a member, put together a structural funding package for the period 1994 to 1999 but it neglected to make funding available for repairs to the Athlone-Westport-Ballina line.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>To add insult to injury, when the Minister had the golden opportunity to decommit Luas funding she did not see fit to allocate any of that money to facilitate repairs of the rail line in question.</P>
      <P>The Athlone-Westport-Ballina line is the slowest rail route in the world and the trains are never on time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When the £114 million of Luas funding became available, the Minister &mdash; contrary to statements she made in recent articles about her commitment to the western rail route &mdash; did not take the opportunity to make any of that money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no early bird train on the Athlone-Westport-Ballina line at present.  Will the Minister <Col N="130" /> ask the management of Iarnród Éireann to provide such a train, even if only on Mondays?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give me the opportunity to speak without interruption.  I welcome the publication of the report which is easy to read because it is couched in layman's terms and does not require in-depth analysis.  I am glad the Minister took on board the Opposition recommendation in the Lower House that the report should be an independent report.</P>
      <P>I did not have sufficient time to read the entire report but I was struck by one glaring fact.  In dealing with limitations in data collected, the report states that as the review progressed it became apparent that there were major shortcomings associated with the data collected and collated by Iarnród Éireann.  It also states that these shortcomings related primarily to the absence of information as to the extent of injuries incurred, double counting of incidents across different databases and a failure to break down the data into meaningful categories.  As a result the consultants concluded that the results obtained from the analysis are subject to a large degree of statistical uncertainty.  This indicates that the analysis carried out by Iarnród Éireann was extremely deficient.</P>
      <P>I am glad the report includes many recommendations, the introduction of which will not require the provision of excessive amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that a financial package will be put in place in the near future to fund some of the urgently required risk reduction measures?</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 of the report refers to value for preventing fatalities.  In this chapter the consultants make an excellent comment which shows that it is not immediately necessary to expend the £500 million required for repairs.  They state that the cost of a project must be in excess of £2.1 million for a 50 per cent reduction.  That is not a large sum to include in the Estimates to ensure that the first step is taken.  We could then make projections into the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister will note that I have not referred to specific rail lines.  That does not mean I am satisfied with the Dublin-Galway line but I will not open a debate on that matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one alights from a subway train in England, one will notice a sign which states &ldquo;Mind the gap&rdquo;.  On the first two occasions I saw it, I thought it was an advertisement for a clothing shop.  I later realised it referred to the gap between the station platform and the train which in England is only four inches.  In Ireland, however, the gap between trains and station platforms can be anything up to 18 inches and, as a previous speaker pointed out, those platforms can become dangerous in wet weather.  There must be <Col N="131" /> some way to reduce the gap between trains and station platforms.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the rail accident at Cherryville in 1983.  One would have thought that a major investment would have been made to improve facilities there following the fatalities in 1983.  However, the report only recommends that such improvements be made.  Those improvements should have been made immediately after the accident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this initiative on rail safety.  Members on all sides have already acknowledged the wisdom of her approach in having an independent survey carried out.  Following the accident in County Roscommon, the Minister took immediate steps to ensure that a blueprint will be put in place to address rail safety requirements.  I welcome that she has a broad view in terms of implementing the policy by having all employees of Iarnród Éireann accept ownership of it.  That is a good management principle and it will bear fruit.  If everyone subscribes to the necessity to improve the plan, progress will be accelerated.  That is a welcome development, as is the suggestion that there should be an annual public audit of progress regarding the recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>A number of Members, particularly Senator Burke, criticised the lack of investment in our railways over the years but their arguments could relate to all forms of transport infrastructure. Within the last week we have discussed the road network and the need for an improvement in public transport.  There has clearly been a dearth of investment but it is disingenuous of Senator Burke to suggest that is the responsibility of any particular Government.  It is fair to say that successive Governments have not put the required investment into the road or rail networks.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that this report was carried out against the background of the European common framework for establishing risk criteria. One of the principles, that risk should be as low as is reasonably practical &mdash; the ALARP principle &mdash; is being implemented and was part of the backdrop to constructing this risk study.  It is noted that if we are above the upper levels of tolerability where the risks are identified as unacceptable they must be reduced irrespective of cost.  There is an inherent commitment being made within that to address deficiencies which are at an unacceptable level.  The intolerable level is 1:4,000 for passengers and public and the acceptable level is below 1:400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the rail lines are in excellent condition but there was a wide variation in standards.  As the Minister said, the main body of the report specifies where the lines will need to be improved and expenditure will be necessary.  I noticed that the Waterford-Rosslare route is identified as the one in worst condition.  It is not above the level of tolerability, but at 93 per cent it is closest to <Col N="132" /> that level.  One would hope that line would be utilised to carry much of the tourist traffic entering the country.  It is a line with great potential but it needs investment.</P>
    <P>On the same line there are many complaints from the public about signalling and level crossings. People in the vicinity of level crossings find themselves waiting for 30 minutes while the level crossing is closed because the system is not sufficiently modern to enable a closer timing of the opening and closing of the crossing.  As a consequence when the train leaves Waterford the level crossings are closed and remain closed until the train passes.  Often from the time they get the signal to close the level crossing until the train passes, there are delays.  This is a nuisance and should be addressed from a public relations point of view.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt signalling and level crossing systems are the two areas which require real attention according to the report.  Many accidents in the past have been caused by them.  Where there is a braking distance which is not acceptable between the signalling and the level crossing, there is an accident waiting to happen.  I have no doubt the Minister and Iarnród Éireann will address that area.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is structure.  Senator Coogan mentioned the gap between the platform and the train.  Things can be done to highlight that and lessen the risk involved.</P>
    <P>The control of contractors within the vicinity of the railway line is a weak area according to the report and there have been accidents arising from that in the past.  That needs a management initiative which could be implemented without spending a large amount of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the DART and the rolling stock have come out of the report well.  While this report deals with the equipment we should remember that there is a need for driver training. The report itself says that it did not address the issue of human error.  The equipment can be in pristine condition but if someone makes a mistake there can be many fatalities.  The training of drivers should be examined.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Iarnród Éireann, the report, particularly the study of the adequacy of the safety management systems, concluded that the overall score arising from the management audit was 64 per cent, a score representative of an organisation which is starting to manage safety proactively, albeit with much room for further improvement.  It has been acknowledged that a start has been made and hopefully this will provide the framework for a much improved reduction in the risk area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, the alacrity with which she has come to present the report to us and the alacrity with which she commissioned the report from the International Risk Management Service after the potential disaster at Knockcroghery.  The fact that <Col N="133" /> the report is by independent consultants is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has an enviable record on safety.  It is a quarter of a century since there has been a fatality on the railway and it is unlikely that could be equalled by many other western countries.  That being said, however, any fatality is to be avoided and this report indicates that there could be a fatality at any time.</P>
      <P>The report points to many areas in which there are failings of investment and management and serious matters are raised in it.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that there should be eight serious safety failures on a signalling system when none would be expected.  It is too much that such a situation should exist and it is a serious deficiency on the part of management in not ensuring that a system is in place.  It was also discovered that there was no formal system of inspection or remedial work on safety or preventative maintenance.  The combined lack of any of these is dangerous in terms of what might happen in the future in a disaster.  The safety failures were discovered by the consultants because there were no systems in place to determine them adequately.  That gives rise to the potential for disaster at any given time.</P>
      <P>I was surprised and disappointed to hear that only one in eight of the staff responded to the questionnaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of response is comparable to the levels of response in other studies. I was aghast at that myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree but we are talking about an in-depth study in which the management team went out and examined 60 per cent of the network.  That must have engendered enormous interest among the staff.  Everyone must know there are problems.  That was the reason for the study in the first place.  There had been complaints about the lack of investment in terms of rolling stock and infrastructure.  I am worried that this reflects a lack of morale.  It was mentioned that Iarnród Éireann employs around 6,000 workers.  That is a large and important workforce which should be well motivated.</P>
      <P>Without dwelling on the deficiencies discovered, the report's recommendations are comprehensive and the manner in which the Minister proposes to proceed with them is laudable.  A high level task force has been established and this will determine an implementation process by January. There will be regular independent audits of the implementation and the unions and CIE staff will be consulted by the Minister who will take their views on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem with funding.  The Minister has only indicated from where the first £23 million will come.  That will be immediately borrowed within Iarnród Éireann's remit.  Approximately half the money, £250 million, will have to be front-loaded for the 15 year programme.  It would be appropriate to plot that period.  It is unlikely <Col N="134" /> the Minister will be in office for the next 15 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so &mdash; not that I would not be able for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash; regardless of whether her party is in Government.  A plan for the first five years would be a good legacy as well as earmarking from where the £250 million will come, whether it will be borrowed, financed by a joint venture or funded by the EU.  The Government is proposing a new regionalisation policy and Objective One status will remain in certain counties which have the worst rail infrastructure.  The east coast has better quality rolling stock and rail-tracks &mdash; from Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Belfast.  Perhaps the Minister will include that in her implementation strategy.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the report which is desirable and necessary at this stage.  Its contents are serious and it is important that we deal with it in the short term so the current failures, which should not be there, are addressed in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise I was not here to hear the Minister's speech.  I welcome her to the House and I am grateful for the opportunity to address the report.  I welcome the announcement of the £56 million investment in public transport which is an indication of the Government's firm commitment to a better public transport system. I welcome the report which contains a great deal of information on breakdowns in the system and on a company which has not come to grips with the needs of the public.  Its transportation policy needs to be attractive from the point of view of competition and long-term sustainability.</P>
      <P>The report highlights the total lack of investment for many years and over many Governments. This report which was initiated by the Minister is opportune and has presented a <i>fait accompli</i> to the Government to do something about the national rail system.  The report indicates systems and procedures breakdowns, a complete lack of maintenance and management in the working conditions at ground level and the lack of a system for the appraisal and provision of investment in safety.  The publication of the report provides an opportunity to set out a plan for the development of the rail system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to highlight the Westport to Athlone line.  The report states that the safety of those travelling on that line is not a major issue. However, this is because of the slow pace of the train.  The service is used a great deal by the public and I used it on a monthly basis prior to this year.  The train is always packed.  It normally arrives in Westport at 11.30 p.m. and recently there have been nights where it has not arrived until 12 midnight.  Unless there is some investment in this service it will no longer be attractive for people to use.  I welcome the Minister's interest and her positive approach.  She has indicated <Col N="135" /> her commitment to implement plans within three months, which is positive.</P>
    <P>The rail network should be supported by semi-State agencies such as Coillte.  They should invest in the rail service, particularly in the west.  Transportation policy should be looked at as a result of this report and we should investigate how we can transport bulk loads, particularly from the west where there has been substantial State investment.  The Minister is preparing proposals for Europe as regards Cohesion Funding.  This should be used to support the Department's investment in the rail system.  We will be able to identify the shortfalls in funding in the long term and the Government may be able to use Exchequer funding to invest in those areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's quick and decisive action in response to the report &mdash; the appointment of two safety inspectors and her instructions to Iarnród Éireann to fund the necessary initial investment.  I question the role of Irish Rail in the implementation of policy.  There is a huge commitment involved in modernising rail transport. An investment policy across semi-State bodies would help long-term investment.  I thank the Minister for her commitment and her speedy response to the publication of the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  She has shown determination and vigour in attacking the problems of the railway system. It is regrettable that the Government as a whole does not share the same sense of commitment and purpose in bringing our rail system into the new millennium.  As Senator Burke pointed out, it failed to invest any of the Luas money in a system badly in need of investment.  I also commend her for this report before the House today.</P>
      <P>The consultants who examined the system used the ALARP principle which is defined as &ldquo;As Low As Reasonably Practicable&rdquo;.  This principle states that above a certain level, known as the upper level of tolerability, risks are unacceptable and must be reduced irrespective of cost considerations. If on the other hand risks are already broadly acceptable, then no further precautions are required.  Where the risk lies between these two extremes, it is necessary to seek means to reduce risk towards the broadly acceptable levels so long as the costs are not grossly disproportionate to the benefits gained.</P>
      <P>This is a fine principle but it is very vague.  I suggest Iarnród Éireann operates on the same principle but I would interpret it differently.  I would say Iarnród Éireann exist on the principle of &ldquo;As Long As the Ratepayer Pays&rdquo;.  It got £90 million of taxpayers' money last year and the system is creaking, especially in the west.  I do not want to reiterate other Senators' statements on the line to the west but it is in a deplorable state and badly in need of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a golden opportunity to bring the railway system into the new millennium.  It is only a few years ago since our telecommunications <Col N="136" /> system was archaic.  It was a Third World system.  After a few years with major investment, I would venture that the Celtic tiger is riding on the back of the telecommunications system in Ireland.  It has been the foundation of all advances in information technology in recent years.  We all remember the old black telephones and one would have to go to the local post office to make a call.  In trying to telephone America, one could wait a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The local postmistress knew what everybody in the parish was doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The local postmaster or postmistress knew everyone's business.  That is only a few years ago.  The Minister should avail of the opportunity to bring our railway system into the new millennium.  It will be a monument to her in the next century.  It would be of enormous benefit to our road system and reduce congestion on it.  As we know, the number of cars is increasing rapidly every year.  We must get people to travel by rail. It would be a very acceptable way to travel if there was a guarantee that one would arrive on time and the journey would be reasonably comfortable.</P>
      <P>The feel-safe factor has gone out of Irish rail. There was a time when one could board a train and feel as safe as at home by the fireside. However, now that has gone and it is a pity.  It is a disincentive to travel.  I know from travelling west, particularly on the lower end of the line, if the train speeds up, the carriage I am sitting in does a hornpipe while the one in front does a slip jig on the same line.  That cannot be safe.  I do not need to be an expert to decide there is something essentially wrong.  The track has been there for 70, 80 or 90 years without being changed.  The report has identified that there is now a high level of risk.  That is unacceptable in this day and age. The Minister must convince the Government and get the money needed for massive investment.  It will be well worth it in the long run.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we are only talking about major things here.  Iarnród Éireann cannot even get the small things right.  I was in Heuston Station recently and the lady on the tannoy system may as well have been speaking Russian.  Nobody could understand what she was saying.  The system should be intelligible in any position within the precincts of the station.  That is a very small and simple thing.  CIE is notorious for getting the simple things wrong all the time.  It would be part of the overall improvement in the system.</P>
      <P>I am glad to welcome the Minister to the House.  I know she believes in the system and is approaching this with a sense of commitment.  I commend her for that.  It is a pity the Government is not as committed as she is to the overall development of our railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Caffrey reminisced about the postmistress or postmaster and I remember that she or he could have been joined <Col N="137" /> by the parish priest at that time.  Sadly neither are as well informed any more on what is happening.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am impressed with her approach to the difficulties she experienced on 8 November 1997.  It is the hallmark of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to apply a structured approach.  Other Ministers may have used small reports and addressed it on a piecemeal basis but she went about it in a very organised way and brought an international study on board.  She has now published the study and has given instructions to CIE to raise £23 million to address the immediate problems.  She has put in train the process of appointing two extra railway inspectors, demanded an annual audit from Iarnród Éireann and invested a quarter of £26 million in mainline rail for 1999.  I consider that to be a very positive and structured approach.</P>
      <P>She acted in the same way in other situations regarding both education and health when she had to deal with national problems.  If I could make one decision tomorrow morning and it was within my remit, I would decide to have a minister for transport and I would have no doubt about who that minister would be.  Inland transport should be co-ordinated between rail and road.  We are one of few countries in Europe that does not have a department of transport.  It would be in the best interests of this country to have such a department.  Perhaps this could be considered by the Government.  I welcome the report which clearly identifies that there are safety problems on the rail network.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello thought that not enough employees of CIE had responded.  If the figure given by the consultants of approximately one in eight is correct, we are talking in terms of up to 600 people responding.  This is a sizeable number of people out of a workforce of approximately 5,000 people.  These people had a great interest in the workings of the railway and felt it was their responsibility to make a submission in this regard. The Minister's response is also a hallmark.  She has decided to set up eight regional meetings throughout the country to talk to the employees of CIE.  Employees want to be involved in these decisions.  The Minister's approach is very welcome and could be taken on board in other cases. The availability of a Minister to deal with employees in both the State and semi-State sector was not evident to any great extent in the past. Employees felt that decisions were taken over their heads and they had to implement them.  If they had become part of the process, many of the difficulties that arose in the semi-State sector over the years would have been avoided.  I compliment the Minister on her approach of involving the staff of Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contains some disturbing statements. Someone mentioned that the Minister is not doing enough.  I would say to people not to shoot the messenger, the Minister is doing what is appropriate.  She has made public all the inadequacies and shortcomings of the rail system <Col N="138" /> through the international consultancy firm.  In the past reports were put under lock and key in an office of a Department and there were calls to have them published.  The Minister did not wait for that to happen; she published the report as soon as she received it.</P>
    <P>The inadequacies and shortcomings of the system are all there for the public to see.  The report is now the charter of Iarnród Éireann which must respond to the shortcomings contained in it.  The Government must also respond to these shortcomings. I compliment the Minister on the great work she has done.  I would like to say much more regarding this report but my time has almost run out.</P>
    <P>On railway stations, some station masters take pride in their railway stations by painting them and so on but other stations are depressing.  A little refurbishing, painting and providing comfort by way of a few seats would make them a bit more comfortable for the public.  I compliment station masters who take pride in their railway stations.  CIE should set up a competition for the best kept railway stations such as local authorities do for the best kept shop fronts, housing estates and so on.</P>
    <P>There are two railway lines through north Roscommon from Carrick-on-Shannon to Boyle and into Sligo.  Money has been committed for the upgrading of the line as far as Carrick-on-Shannon. I wish that would continue throughout County Roscommon and into Sligo.  Hopefully this will happen during the Minister's period in Government.  On the other line a major disaster could have happened near Knockcroghery, the line from Athlone through Roscommon town, Castlerea and into Westport.  I am pleased with Iarnród Éireann's response this week that it will address the first 11 miles of this line which is dangerous.  Some 84 miles of this line needs to be upgraded.  I hope that the Minister's discussions with CIE and the Minister for Finance will enable the shortcomings of this line to be addressed.  The line is not unsafe but that is as a result of the low speed of the trains.  If that line was upgraded throughout, the speed of the trains would be increased and more people would travel on the trains rather than bringing their cars to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Hopefully we will have another opportunity to discuss this matter, perhaps in three months time when the Minister receives the specialist report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on taking statements here this evening.  I also congratulate her on commissioning the report on rail safety in Ireland.  As other speakers mentioned, it is the first such independent report to be compiled.  It is a most comprehensive report dealing with every aspect of rail safety.  It is realistic in the manner in which it outlines the shortcomings, problems and difficulties of the rail system.  The realistic timescale outlined for the necessary improvements is achievable. It is encouraging to know that as we speak some of the recommendations in the report have <Col N="139" /> been implemented.  In the past some reports have lain on shelves and gathered dust in Departments, local authority offices and so on.  This is a most encouraging first step.</P>
      <P>It is worrying that the report found eight serious safety failures in the signalling system.  I welcome the proposed improvements to some of the highest risk areas in the signalling system, particularly on the Limerick Junction to Mallow line.  I travel on this part of the rail network on a regular basis.  Many people from the west Limerick area travel on this section of the rail line because Charleville is the most convenient station.  Charleville station, which was once threatened with closure, has been extensively upgraded in recent months.  This is most welcome from the point of view of the convenience of the travelling public and the staff.  It is important for the travelling public to be able get a cup of tea and use the toilet facilities on the train.</P>
      <P>The report states that within three months of publication agreement must be reached between the Minister's Department, CIE and Iarnród Éireann on the capital and revenue costs necessary for the full implementation of the plan, thereby making the rail network acceptably safe. This is very important because without the necessary finance and co-operation nothing can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to prioritise all other recommendations and timescales.  I know it is the Minister's intention to oversee the implementation of these recommendations during the coming months and years.  I commend the Minister on the inclusive manner in which she has initiated discussions on this report in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Her discussions with trades unions and planned meetings with the employees of Iarnród Éireann at various locations throughout the country are very welcome.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the contribution of the entire workforce of Iarnród Éireann under extremely difficult circumstances over the years.  When people have to work under difficult and trying circumstances, it is not always easy to be pleasant and courteous. From my experience, I have found the vast majority of the workforce to have these characteristics in abundance.  Something which should not go unnoticed is that the rail network, given its shortcomings, compares very favourably to its European counterparts.</P>
      <P>Our rail network is a tremendous asset, economically and socially, and it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that, in co-operation with Iarnród Éireann, the necessary investment is made for the travelling public.  I know from having spoken to the Minister how serious she is about fully implementing this detailed and comprehensive report and that she will not leave it on the shelf to gather dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report mentions that the condition of rolling stock is satisfactory but I am sure it is recognised that more is needed.  I have noticed the <Col N="140" /> serious overcrowding on trains, especially at weekends when large numbers of people travel, or on match days when large numbers of supporters travel.  It is worrying.  I listened recently to the <i>Liveline</i> programme and a passenger, a GP, on board a train leaving Heuston Station contacted the programme and spoke live on air.  His outline of the situation was very frightening.  He spelt out in great detail the difficulties he and other passengers and staff were experiencing.  It was a Friday afternoon and the reason given for the overcrowding was shortage of rolling stock. The sooner the problem is tackled, the better because, in the short-term, it could lead to a catastrophe and a tragedy.  I hope it does not and I know the Minister thinks likewise.  CIE has an excellent record on rail safety comparable to the rest of Europe and it is to be commended on that. I compliment the Minister for taking the initiative in commissioning the report and attending the debate on it here.  I wish her well in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is like a good doctor; she has diagnosed and prescribed.  There has been a great deal of rí rá about the rail system but this is the first time significant account has been taken of its deficiencies.  These have been appropriately addressed by the Minister by way of substantial investment.</P>
      <P>Between 1955 and 1983, 35 people died in rail accidents but it is because of a series of incidents and near misses in recent years that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, commissioned the current report on Iarnród Éireann.  In the wake of those incidents, serious concerns were expressed.  The report pinpointed the outdated nature of the signalling system of Ireland's neglected rail network as the most likely cause of accidents.  When the report was published, the Minister said, and I appreciate the responsibility she felt, that unless she did something, she would not sleep.  I am told the railway compares favourably to other rail networks throughout Europe, but that is no case for sitting back and doing nothing.  In 1984 the situation was going from bad to worse.  The review stated that while Irish railways have historically been safe, a shortfall in recent years was impacting on safety.  It also said it was realised that the skill and expertise of staff members was being undermined as many of the older generation left the service through retirement or company downsizing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damning independent consultants' report has highlighted the massive underfunding of Irish rail which has resulted in major safety implications for the travelling public.  The report contains a number of alarming findings including serious faults in the signalling system and some tracks being in an unacceptable condition.  The consultants acknowledged that, while the condition of much of the track signalling and structures was very poor, the condition of rolling stock was on the whole satisfactory.  However, the most serious shortcoming was the lack of a systematic <Col N="141" /> approach to identifying safety hazards and prioritising and implementing remedial action.  That is what this report is doing and what the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>The report also made clear that, if safety management was not adequately addressed, the benefits of safety investment in the infrastructure would be useless.  The consultants recommended that £590 million be spent over the next 15 years and that £230 million of this should be spent on tackling safety deficiencies.  It is estimated that, if this sum is spent on safety measures, risk levels to the travelling public could be reduced by 50 per cent over a 30 year period.  That is a huge reduction and everyone should recognise that. Approximately £60 million is required to improve safety management systems and £20 million per year over 15 years for ongoing renewal on the permanent way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responded with alacrity following publication of the report.  She announced CIE is to begin an implementation of the recommendations of the review immediately, paying particular attention to the immediate safety needs identified by the consultants.  The Minister also met the CIE board following the publication of the report and gave it permission to borrow £23 million towards the cost of tackling safety deficiencies.  As recommended in the report, a high level task force comprising officials of the Departments of Public Enterprise and Finance and CIE is being established which will report to the Government by the end of January.  This will prioritise recommendations to address the issues identified in the consultancy review.  Pending consideration by Government of the task force report, CIE is to be authorised to undertake borrowing to finance the implementation of safety measures.</P>
    <P>The recruitment process for two additional railway inspector officers in the Department of Public Enterprise will begin immediately.  This is a step in the right direction because it was frightening to discover that only one inspector was responsible for rail safety throughout the country. In 1998, that of itself speaks volumes and it is clear why the Minister said if she did not do something about it, she would not sleep.  If I were in her shoes, I too would suffer from suitable insomnia.  I am delighted she has provided the money.</P>
    <P>I will be parochial for a minute.  The Mullingar to Carrick-on-Shannon line is a particularly bad stretch of railway.  The delay for people commuting by rail from Mullingar to Dublin, as I do, is unacceptable.  The measures being taken will ensure the travelling public will regain the confidence it once had in the railways.  The Minister can take a well earned bow in that regard.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report stressed the need to create a safety culture.  The Minister stated her intention to participate in a number of regional workshops at which the findings of the review will be presented to Iarnród Éireann staff at all levels. They will have the opportunity to present their <Col N="142" /> views to the Minister on all aspects of rail safety. Upgrading the rail network, replacing archaic signalling systems, improving an aged track structure and providing adequate rolling stock to meet demand are all essential measures for ensuring the safety of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>Senator John Cregan referred to the Minister's discussions with the unions.  If the Minister is good at anything, it is dialogue.  It is clear she has brought all on side with her and she deserves credit for that.  I wish her well.  The Minister deserves credit for recent investment in public transport. Up to now everyone complained about the railways but no one did anything about them.  I hope she retains the portfolio and that the Mullingar to Athlone rail track will re-open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment briefly on the report and on the Minister's promptness in coming to the Seanad to discuss it.  In this instance she has made copies of the consultants' report available to Members of both Houses and other interested people and I thank her.  A major complaint by this House is that when reports are published they are not circulated to Members and I have often complained about this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard the use of railways more and more people will use them in future because the road network is crowded.  To have an efficient service and for people to use it, we must have a railway that is punctual, safe and competitive.  I will list some of the reasons that discourage people from using trains.  For instance, most Friday nights I travel to Tralee or Killarney to collect my family from the station and the train is seldom on time. It is also very rare for anyone to be on the platform to inform people that the train is delayed. Many other people have experienced the same problems.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd referred to his recent visit to Dingle but it is really his homeland because his father originally came from beside Dingle &mdash; dúthaigh mo mhuintire.  I cannot find fault with the direct train from Dublin to Tralee.  Unfortunately, if one travels during the afternoon on the Dublin to Tralee train one has to change at Mallow and the train used for the rest of the journey is in a very bad condition.  For someone like me who travels from Dublin to Dingle by train followed by an hour's journey by car it would be nice to have an opportunity to get something to eat between Mallow and Killarney or Tralee. There are no facilities on that train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining about the direct train from Dublin to Tralee.  I am complaining about the Dublin-Mallow-Tralee train or the one used to take passengers from Mallow to Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to refer to the safety aspect of this train because there was a derailment within the past year.  The incident was highlighted on television <Col N="143" /> by an independent member of Kerry County Council.  The report showed that the sleepers were rotten and that if a person put his weight on them they would bounce.  Unfortunately, I have not had enough time to peruse the report to see if works will be carried out on that line.</P>
    <P>Kerry people are worried by a rumour that the Tralee/Killarney train service might cease.  The Killarney station is rather unusual because every train has to reverse into it.  At the moment extensive work is being carried out but there are no signs that the approach will be changed.  This leads people to believe that Killarney may be the end of the line in the future.  This would be a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>Killarney is the main tourist destination.  It is gratifying to see a train crowded with tourists, backpackers, etc. heading for the kingdom.  The Killarney people are not letting CIE down because at weekends they organise the honeymoon express to Killarney where couples are met by a fanfare of bands and people are wined and dined for a cheap rate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke for half an hour at the beginning of this debate.  I have noted each point made by the Senators and they will be of great interest to Iarnród Éireann.  Senator Burke asked for an early train to be supplied.  He also stated that we had not received money from the EU for some lines.  I do not make those kinds of decisions and I did not make them in 1992.  The EU carries out <Col N="144" /> studies on the rail network and decides which lines to recommend.</P>

This is a safety charter and indicates what must be done.</P>
      <P>No Government can dodge the issue from now on because the report outlines what has to be done on a yearly basis.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The research department of the National Rehabilitation Board recently produced a comprehensive booklet on respite care facilities for people with disabilities.  Respite care has been defined as &ldquo;the temporary care of people with disabilities of all kinds to relieve their social, physical and emotional stress and to provide relief to their primary care givers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The booklet lists, on a health board by health board basis, those homes which can offer respite <Col N="145" /> care.  Looking at the lists one would believe there was plenty of help available but this is not the case in practice.  The booklet is also divided into sections of establishments which will cater for people with learning disabilities, physical disabilities and a combination of both.</P>
    <P>My research assistant, Ms Erin Dunn, telephoned a cross section of these homes, on my behalf, to ask about the availability of places and I discussed her findings with the National Rehabilitation Board.  The response from the agencies was, in the main, depressing.  The vast majority could not tell when respite care would be available nor for how long.  Some said they had admissions committees which decided on the individual circumstances.  Certainly there was no one who said &ldquo;Yes, of course, help is available&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was very much in line with the comments the Minister may have heard made by parents on television and in the press recently.  Mr. Joe Little did an excellent interview on RTE's &ldquo;Six-One&rdquo; news a couple of weeks ago, showing the severe difficulties of a woman with an adult daughter with learning and physical disabilities and her problems in finding respite care.</P>
    <P>The programme &ldquo;Would you Believe&rdquo; last week interviewed four mothers with younger children with similar disabilities and their plights would move a heart of stone.  All wanted to care for their children but all longed for just a little life of their own.  Parents are now starting to get angry and this issue will be raised more and more. We profess to be a kind, loving and caring population. Now we have money at last and I am glad to see the increase for the Department of Health and Children in the recently published Estimates for the Public Service.  Surely people like these are the first we should help.</P>
    <P>About 40,000 people are involved in caring for others in the home and about 9,000 are caring for children.  Some of these people are dealing with relatives who are doubly incontinent as well as having severe medical problems and they are being ground down.  Sometimes when I meet carers I do not know which person is more in need of care &mdash; the carer or the one to whom the loving care is being given.</P>
    <P>No matter how parents try dealing with a disabled child it affects the other children in a family and, indeed, it may lead to the breakdown of the family because the stress may be too great.  Some people simply want breaks for things like family weddings or to be sure they can go on holidays with the other children.  Frequently, however, even these small requests have to be refused.</P>
    <P>We are desperately short of residential accommodation and any that is available is immediately taken up by emergency cases so that planning respite care is impossible.  About 1,500 places are needed at the moment.  Agencies can only cater for their own clients so that those cases which may fall outside district groups are in a very difficult situation.  There are lay people who are good and kind and take children who are not too difficult to deal with on a charitable basis.  They are <Col N="146" /> to be much applauded.  Such people have made some sort of normal life possible for the parents of such children.  The most severe cases, however, need professional help.</P>
    <P>The agencies are there and if they had the money they could respond.  At present, they have to ration help.  Surely it is time, with the increase in money that has been given to the Department of Health and Children, to expand the facilities to a level which will cater for all those who need residential care.</P>
    <P>About 1,500 places are needed.  Recently I was contacted by a man in his eighties about his 47 year old son to see if I could get a place for him. His wife is dead and he has cared for his child without help for nearly 50 years.  If beds were available they would free up facilities for respite care.</P>
    <P>A society should be judged on how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.  The Federation of Voluntary Bodies has run an advertisement in recent days in the newspapers asking for money to be taken from the budget surplus to support the needs I have mentioned.  It is dreadful to see the added stress of raising awareness and money to run organisations being put on carers.  If the Government does not respond to requests for help now, it will end up paying for care for the carers as well.  Does it have to come to this before we will support their reasonable requests?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the Government's policy on this important issue.  The report referred to by the Senator is a directory of available respite care facilities throughout the country and makes no recommendations or comment about the adequacy of such facilities.  However, I am conscious of the fact that respite care is a service in need of on-going development.</P>
      <P>The Govemment's policy, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, is a commitment to ensuring that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities and those of their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed through a wide range of measures in the health, social, leisure and sporting areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of health services, the overall objective in relation to the development of services for people with disabilities &mdash; that is, people with physical and sensory disabilities and those with mental handicap &mdash; is to enable each individual to achieve his or her full potential and to live within the community with the maximum degree of independence possible.  This involves the provision of a broad range of support services, including respite care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, published in December 1996, and &ldquo;An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001&rdquo;, published <Col N="147" /> in April 1997, set out in detail the requirements for the development of these services.</P>
    <P>On foot of the review group report, the previous Government made available an additional £3.695 million in the early part of 1997 for the maintenance and development of services in this sector.  Since coming into office, the Government has invested an additional £19 million in these services, £10 million in the latter part of 1997 and a total of £9 million this year.  The £10 million in 1997 included a capital grant of £600,000 to the Irish Wheelchair Association for the development of its national residential respite care centre, Cuisle, in Roscommon, which provided an additional 60 places for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of the £3 million made available for development of these services this year £500,000 is being allocated by health boards to the development of respite care facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the development of services for people with mental handicap in line with &ldquo;An Assessment of Need&rdquo; and to this end the Minister for Health and Children has provided an additional £25 million for the development of these services in the last 12 months.  He has also put in place a £30 million capital programme which began this year and will run over the next four years.  At the end of this year more than 200 new residential places and more than 300 day care places will have been provided for the mental handicap sector and services will continue to be expanded and enhanced as a result of the allocation of these resources.  While the additional residential places include some respite <Col N="148" /> facilities, further development of specific respite care services has been identified as a priority development.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Henry that the Minister for Health and Children who is in Brussels today and cannot be here is very conscious of the need to expand respite care services.  Indeed, such services are regarded as one of the priority areas for development in services for people with disabilities. Respite care services have been highlighted in the reports &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo; for people with physical and sensory disabilities and &ldquo;An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with Mental Handicap 1997-2001&rdquo; and the Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of these reports.</P>
    <P>This question was discussed last night in Dáil Éireann and I met some of the parents later.  I have no doubt that the needs of mental and physically handicapped people must be at the top of our priority list.  Even within the Department various needs are competing for resources but when one hears the parents of handicapped people speaking about their children &mdash; and a good friend of mine is the parent of a severely mentally and physically handicapped 14 year old &mdash; one is left in no doubt that they must be our top priority.  I hope the Government will devote the necessary resources to this area in this year's Estimates and in the budget.</P>
