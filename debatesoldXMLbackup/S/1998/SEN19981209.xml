      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to direct the local authority to issue a special amenity order for the Tolka valley.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a Garda station in Castletroy, County Limerick, in view of the expanding population in the area and the need for a Garda presence based in the area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to approve the Terryglass sewerage scheme as part of the Lough Derg submission for EU funds in order to ensure that the badly needed scheme begins in 1999.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator Costello and Senator Jackman and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 2, 3, 6, 4, 5 and item 20, motion 32.  Item 2 will be taken without debate.  Item 3, Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken today.  Item 6, Report and Final Stages to be taken at 12.15 p.m., and item 3 to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.  Item 4, statements on under-age drinking, to be taken at 2 p.m., with the contributions <Col N="906" /> of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, and all other Senators seven minutes. Senators may share their time.  Item 5, statements on 1798, to be taken from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons and all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes.  Item 4 to resume thereafter if not previously concluded. Item 20, motion 32, to be taken from 6 to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a number of queries on the Order of Business before any agreement is reached.  Why is item 2, Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order, 1998, being taken without debate?  Why are these elections being postponed?  We cannot agree to that unless we have an adequate explanation from the Leader.</P>
      <P>As regards item 5, the amount of time allowed, particularly for spokespersons, is not adequate so we ask the Leader to consider increasing it to at least ten, if not 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>There is a major crisis in the clothing industry. In the past few days over 1,000 jobs have been lost in County Longford, with which I am sure you, a Chathaoirligh, are familiar, and in County Donegal in what was a main industry not only in that county but in the region.  This serves as a warning of a serious crisis in the industry which still employs thousands of people.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come into the House to discuss this before Christmas. We do not know what announcements may come next week about other operators in the apparel industry which could have serious consequences similar to those in County Longford and County Donegal.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Senator O'Toole, who is recovering from his exertions on behalf of his constituents yesterday, we accept the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification why elections to the regional fisheries boards have been postponed. We do not object to passing the Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order, 1998, provided we understand the reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate tomorrow on the 50th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  It was a milestone that both sides got together after the Second World War and made such a declaration on human rights. However, human rights are still flouted in many corners of the world.  It is important for us &mdash; particularly as a former President of Ireland is the UN High Commissioner for Human Right &mdash; to express our determination that human rights are respected everywhere.  The 50th anniversary is on 10 December, but on 11 December the United States will execute its 500th person since it restored the death penalty in 1976.  It is as though it is snubbing the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  It is important that we have an opportunity <Col N="907" /> to put on record our position on human rights.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to come into the House to clarify the position on Christmas bonuses for a vulnerable section of our community? The Minister denied any responsibility for the circular issued by a civil servant.  He responded with a press statement which further muddied the waters.  Nobody seems to know what is the position at present.  It is important that the Minister comes into the House to assure the 5,000 to 10,000 people they will not be affected by this backward decision and that they will benefit from the Christmas bonus scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the request by a former Tánaiste and the Chairman of the Victims Commission, Mr. John Wilson, to release the Garda files on the Monaghan and Dublin bombings in 1974 to the families of the victims.  The people in Monaghan and Dublin feel they were ignored when we discussed victims in recent years.  It is important that these people are recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Costello in asking the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to come to the House to explain the confusion and mess caused by contradictory remarks from his Department about circulars, press releases, etc., on the Christmas bonus scheme.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to schedule a debate in the new year, if not before Christmas, on child care in light of the Government's inaction in the budget last week and the imminent publication of the report of the expert working group on child care which was set up under Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss the recent horrific murders in County Tipperary, where a young man was brutally beaten and in the Galway area where a teenager's body was found.  We are concerned about the number of unresolved murders and the list of missing women.  There is no doubt that women are afraid.  This type of news seems to make the headlines one day but is forgotten the next.  I hope the Minister comes to the House to tell us what he is doing to ensure there is a sufficient Garda presence in all areas so that people are not afraid on dark nights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Costello for a debate tomorrow on human rights as this is an important 50th anniversary.  This country has played a significant role in framing these various conventions and administering human rights worldwide.  Since the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is a former <Col N="908" /> President and Member of this House, it would be appropriate to have this debate.</P>
      <P>I join in the calls for further information to be made available about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I welcome the initiative of the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, but I would like to see him becoming involved in something else on behalf of other relatives.  I am talking about the relatives of those who have disappeared, such as the family of Mrs. Jean McConville who was brutally murdered by the IRA.  I find it sickening to discover that representatives of the IRA say they are appealing for information about it.  These are the people who tortured and murdered her and who know where the bodies are.  Mr. Adams and his colleagues should be given a clear and specific instruction that the least we require in terms of basic human rights and decency is that they get off the fence and tell the unfortunate families where these corpses are so they can be given a decent Christian burial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet another damning report on the widespread litter problem on our beaches was published by the European Union today.  Given that we rely on tourist revenue, it is appalling that another report condemns this country.  We are at the bottom of the league yet again.  I suggest that the Leader makes time available in the new session for a debate on waste disposal.  This would give Members on all sides of the House the opportunity to make a contribution on an extremely serious matter as we go into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>This is also a problem in small towns and villages. We have become an increasingly dirty race. Recently I was told about an incident in County Leitrim where someone who is very well off was observed taking their personal rubbish out and putting it beside a public bin in a main street.  I am sure this is happening across the country.  It is long past time that we addressed this problem.  It would be opportune to debate this issue with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government because the necessary resources must be provided.  For example, there is only one litter warden for County Leitrim and she is doing the best she can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by my colleagues for a statement by way of clarification from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  Yesterday, I visited a health centre and utter confusion reigned among staff and claimants about the situation. It would be helpful if the Minister could come here and tell us what will happen as regards the payment of Christmas bonuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a request I made last week, can the Leader clarify what is the Government's intention regarding the promised legislation from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on planning?  This time last year we introduced a Bill to allow for the record of developers who had not completed works properly to be taken into <Col N="909" /> account when deciding future planning permissions. The Minister opposed the Bill on the grounds that he was fundamentally reforming the planning legislation himself, the results of which are not yet before us.  This is a matter of great urgency and I would like the Leader's assurance that legislation will be forthcoming as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Mooney in calling for a debate on waste but I would extend it by calling for a debate on pollution of rivers and our shoreline.  A fortnight ago we had a debate on the Shannon river and it highlighted pollution and the importance of testing.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come here for a full discussion on waste, waste management and the pollution of our rivers and coastline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to item 2.  Arrangements are not ready for an election. However, if the House will agree I will allow time for it to be discussed further at a later stage rather than putting it through this morning.</P>
      <P>In relation to item 5, there is only one hour allocated to take statements on 1798 but I am prepared to extend the contributions of Members to ten minutes.  If there are Senators still offering we will allocate extra time for this item next week.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Connor's sentiments and his great concerns regarding the clothing industry and its future.  I will try to get the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to come to this House to hear the concerns of Members and brief the House on the current state of the industry at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, O'Meara, Norris and Gallagher expressed a wish that we would have statements to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights tomorrow.  I will see if we can have time for this debate and I will discuss it with the leaders of the various groups after the Order of Business.  Those Senators also want the Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs to clarify the position with regard Christmas bonuses.  The Minister clarified the situation in the Dáil last night and I heard his statement on radio.  He said that anyone who received their Christmas bonus in previous years will be receiving it this year.  However, I will seek further clarification and I will inform Members about the current position.</P>
      <P>Senators Leonard and Norris called for Garda files on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to be released to the families concerned.  We would all like to see this happening and I will pass on the wishes of the Senators to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara requested a debate on the work report.  I will allocate time for it at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come here <Col N="910" /> to discuss and debate the serious increase in crime and those dreadful murders.  I could not agree more and I will see if the Minister can facilitate a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senators Mooney and Cooney requested a debate on waste disposal and pollution.  I agree with this request and I will facilitate a debate on it in the first three to four weeks of the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher called for a debate on planning and he urged the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to bring forward the necessary legislation.  I will pass on the Senator's wishes to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I asked the Minister for Health and Children the following questions. Can the Minister of State now indicate the amount of money the VHI spend on cars for their executives, how many executives have cars and what type of cars they have?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The VHI's fleet consists of 48 cars and one van.  The majority of cars are the standard 1.3 to 1.6 litre models.  Over 60 per cent of the fleet is permanently on the road and used by sales staff, customer service, hospital relations, technology support, distribution and for commuting between VHI's offices in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Col N="911" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very incomplete answer because all the Minister of State has told me is what he wants to tell me.  I do not expect him to tell me what he does not want to tell me.  He has told me that the majority of cars are between 1.3 to 1.6 litres and 60 per cent of the fleet is used by sales staff. Are we getting normality on the remaining 40 per cent?  What amount of money is being spent by the VHI on this fleet?  Are these people paying benefit in kind on those cars?  I am trying to establish whether this company is being run in a loose manner.  The VHI receives public money and it is being run on a commercial basis.  The Minister of State's incomplete answer indicates that 40 per cent of the fleet is unexplained.  We do not know how much money the VHI is spending on these cars.  The public is entitled to this information.  I am not accusing the Minister of State of being evasive, but his answers are incomplete. He should inform the House of the models of these cars, the cost of running them and who is entitled to them.  The public is entitled to this information because the VHI is a semi-State body.  I do not expect the Minister of State to give me the information now, but perhaps he will give it to me before the end of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the international healthcare plan providing for medical, surgical or related services, will this result in an additional cost for existing plans?  In other words, will it cost more if one travels abroad for three or six months or will it be part and parcel of one's existing plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an increase in the cost.  This will be a specific plan because different conditions will apply outside of the country.  The VHI will act as an agent in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises out of yesterday's discussion about facilitating the inclusion of universities and higher education institutions in Northern Ireland within the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund scheme and legislation which was sponsored by Senator Quinn.  We had some debate yesterday on the advice I had received.  It was good that we decided to adjourn and give time for reflection and discussions with the parliamentary draftsman in the Attorney General's Office and other competent authorities.  I am glad that the result is an improvement to the Bill which facilitates the inclusion of universities or other institutions of higher education in Northern Ireland with the consent of such universities or institutes of higher education and with the consent of other relevant competent authorities, that is, the funding agencies, etc.  This morning we had consultations with the competent authorities who see no difficulty with this.  It does not oblige anybody with financial implications or anything like that.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn and Senator Manning for their contributions to the debate yesterday.  It just shows the value of pausing for reflection and introducing another provision because it is an improved Bill as a result of this.  I am happy to commend this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 1, which amends the Long Title.</P>

      <P>Yesterday we spoke about the speed at which the Minister introduced the Bill. He was even complimented on the speed of his speech.  Even more commendable is the fact that he listened and took into account the case being made.  His response shows that he is able to retain information, respond and listen.  I compliment him on the action he took and the manner in which he took it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank Senators Henry and Manning who made strong cases in support of this amendment. I also compliment this House.  A number of amendments were put to the Minister during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  He took those amendments into account and improved the Bill.  However, the subject of this amendment had not been noticed.  This is a reminder that the Seanad has a part to play.  I compliment the Minister on his listening ability and his ability to respond so rapidly and with such intent.  He has <Col N="914" /> achieved more than anyone else set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused me of using words which may have suggested that I was speaking about him.  My concern is that sometimes, in the nation as a whole, there is an attitude that people north of the Border are not part of us.  That does not happen and my comments were never intended to reflect on any one individual.  However, there is a mindset which I would like to see changed. As an island we should remember that we are one people.  It is worthwhile examining every Bill to ensure we do not fall into the mindset of thinking that those north of the Border are not part of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be improved by the acceptance of this amendment.  It will give more explicit effect to the Minister's intention which was not previously explicitly stated.  The Bill will also better incorporate the inclusive spirit personified by Senator Mitchell.  For these reasons I welcome this amendment.  I also compliment Senator Quinn on spotting this lacuna and fighting to have this change made.  He made an eloquent case.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister.  He is under pressure but listened carefully to what was said. When he saw the force of the arguments being made on this side of the House, and the general support from his own side for these proposals, he agreed to postpone Report Stage.  He has taken further advice and introduced changes which please all Members.  I compliment him on being so fair and open minded during this debate.</P>
      <P>The lesson from this is that, perhaps we should be less reverential when listening to legal advice. When Fine Gael was in Government, legal advice frequently overruled common sense, often with bad consequences.  One of the virtues of a parliament is that legal advice can be one of the factors taken into account.  However, it does not always have to be the overriding factor.  Attorneys General will come at a particular issue from a strictly legal and constitutional point of view.  As politicians we have to take what they say into account, but that need not necessarily be the only consideration.  I am glad it has been possible to find a formula of words which meets the needs identified by Senator Quinn to the satisfaction of the House.  I compliment the Senator and thank the Minister.</P>

This shows the importance of the second Chamber and the careful manner in which Senators carry out their business and handle legislation.  I agree with Senator Manning that political common sense must always prevail.  The acceptance of this amendment is a great example of this and I congratulate all those, including officials, for bringing this issue to such a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Farrell and other Senators for raising this important issue for discussion in the House.  I am very pleased to take part in the debate and to listen to the views which Senators have on this matter.</P>
      <P>As a topic of conversation, the subject of under-age drinking is one on which almost everyone has an opinion to offer.  Some of our opinions can be formed by personal experiences and some by experiences which have been related to us by others.  Some people can even have an obvious and easy solution to suggest, but Members of this House will agree that resolution of this problem is not an easy one.</P>
      <P>As a parent myself it concerns me that our young people, however many or few, would be turning to alcohol at an early age.  For this reason I do not approach this matter with a closed mind. However, what is needed is a clear, calm look at the systems, including legislation, which are in place and decisive action to remedy any shortcomings.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a substantial body of legislation in place already.  It might be useful in the first place for me to briefly outline the legal position on the sale of alcohol to under-age persons in particular.</P>
      <P>The licensing laws contribute, and must continue to contribute, an important part to the overall effort of curbing the supply of alcohol to persons under the age of 18 years.  The statutory provisions specific to addressing the problem of under-age drinking were the subject of review in the Bill which led to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  That Act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>Those provisions make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years to purchase alcohol lawfully, or to be in possession of it or to consume it, other than in a private residence.  Section 31 of the Act makes it an offence for a licence holder to sell or deliver alcohol to a person under 18 years of age or to permit consumption of alcohol by, or the supply of alcohol to, such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law also recognises the possibility of persons buying alcohol for under-age persons and provides for specific penalties in this regard.  It is <Col N="917" /> an offence, under section 32 of the Act, for any person to purchase alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 years in any place other than a private residence.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Act provides that it is an offence for any person under 18 to purchase alcohol, whether in an on-licence or off-licence, or to consume it in any place other than a private residence.</P>
    <P>Section 34 makes it an offence for a person under 15 years of age to be in a bar at any time. There are exceptions provided for in this section, however, such as the children of the licensee or those otherwise resident in a licensed premises, or where a child is accompanied by his or her parents or guardians.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides that if a licence holder allows an under 18 year old to be present in the part of the licensed premises where an exemption is in force, an offence is committed.  A licensee is also prohibited from employing under 18 year olds other than 16 and 17 year old close relatives and apprentices.</P>
    <P>Breaches of any of these provisions attract penalties by way of fines.  However, the seriousness with which a breach of the laws in relation to under-age drinking is viewed is made more forcibly in that any infringement of these laws will result in the holder of an intoxicating liquor licence, on conviction, having his or her licence mandatorily endorsed.  As Senators will be aware, a third live endorsement results in automatic forfeiture of the licence.</P>
    <P>In so far as legislation can contribute to combating abuse of alcohol by young persons, the controls provided for in the 1988 Act were generally regarded as going as far as criminal legislation could reasonably be expected to go. Enforcement of the legislation is, of course, a matter for the Garda Síochána and I am told by the Garda authorities that the legislation is enforced in a uniform fashion countrywide. However, I am sure Senators will agree that legislation, and the enforcement of such, alone cannot be the only solution to the problem.  There are, of course, other non-legislative measures which can be taken.  For example, the gardaí are involved in identification card schemes for persons aged under 18 years.  These schemes are operated by the local gardaí in conjunction with the Licensed Vintners Association, with funding in most cases from local publicans.  There are over 100 of these schemes in operation.</P>
    <P>In general, these schemes have been considered to have been reasonably successful and to have assisted in reducing the level of alcohol use by persons under the age of 18 years in the areas in which they were introduced.  I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the agencies, voluntary and statutory, which have contributed to these local schemes.  It is in part because of the success of these schemes that I have now moved to introduce the national voluntary scheme.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the introduction of a national voluntary age card scheme on the basis <Col N="918" /> of provisions in the Act of 1988 are in the course of being drafted in my Department for introduction in the new year.  I have taken a personal interest in this matter because of the importance I attach to tackling the problem of under-age drinking.  I have also had a number of meetings with the Garda Commissioner on the subject and have discussed the matter again with him within the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>On a wider front, Senators will be aware that I have recently received the report of the Sub-committee on Legislation and Security of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights in relation to a review of the liquor licensing laws.  As would be the normal case, any reform of the Licensing Acts would require the matter be the subject of consultation with interested parties.  In this regard I decided to allow for a limited period of consultation in which to allow parties to respond to the report, or make other observations regarding the licensing laws. The closing date for such contributions was 30 September 1998 and in excess of 60 submissions were received.</P>
    <P>My objective in this was to ensure that any legislation that is brought forward by the Government in due course will take into account the many views of people in this complex and difficult area.  Additionally, I received the interim report of the Competition Authority in September.  This report, while not relevant in its specifics to the problem of under-age drinking, also has important implications for the licensing code.  The reports, together with the submissions received, are in the course of being examined as part of the consultative process which I have engaged in with a view to careful and in-depth examination of the question of amending legislation.  The specific recommendations contained in the Oireachtas committee's report in relation to under-age drinking are receiving particular attention.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I am at present giving consideration to a proposal that, in proceedings against a person charged with the offence of selling or permitting the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 18 years, the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; that the person served was over the legal age should be abolished.  This, in conjunction with the introduction of the national age card scheme, to which I have already referred, will further strengthen the hand of all agencies in the fight against the scourge of under-age drinking.  While the national voluntary age card scheme, together with penalties for breach of the law, should help with the supply side of the under-age drinking problem, they do not tackle the problems on the demand side.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will appreciate that legislative measures and Garda action alone cannot provide the solution to the problem of under-age drinking.  They will not, for instance, deal with the ever decreasing age at which young people commence drinking.  I understand that recent surveys have claimed that some youngsters become regular drinkers from their early teens.  Like any parent, <Col N="919" /> I have to be concerned at this situation. There is a perception that there is widespread flouting of the law in this regard and that the level of enforcement is not as rigorous as it should be. The Garda Síochána has a difficult job to do and I know that it actively enforces the law in this regard.</P>
    <P>The annual crime report of the Garda Síochána for 1997 shows a total of 1,397 referrals to the national juvenile office for drink related offences and also that a number of prosecutions were followed up.  The Garda Síochána community relations section also runs a schools programme throughout the country.  The objective of this programme is to make young people aware of the dangers of involving themselves in crime generally. Included in the programme would be discussions about the dangers inherent in under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>To be effective in dealing with this issue we must also look at the packaging of the product. Modern day television and other advertisements lead to drinking being seen by more and more young people, including those in their early teens, as an accepted and desirable way of life.  It is clear that under-age and excessive alcohol consumption cannot be effectively addressed by concentrating only on law enforcement measures &mdash; though law enforcement clearly has an important part to play.  It is an area which needs to be dealt with on a cross-agency basis and it requires significant community input and support.</P>
    <P>I should also mention at this stage the national alcohol policy which was launched in September 1996.  This policy document is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems in Irish society through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption.  The document covers a broad range of alcohol related issues, including historic, cultural, economic and legal factors relevant to the use and abuse of alcohol.  It also covers matters such as education, advertising, prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies. The problem of under-age drinking is given particular attention in that both the issues of youth and alcohol and the role of parents and family, and their part in any solution to the problem, are adverted to.</P>
    <P>It is clear that legislative measures, Garda activity or even Government action alone will not solve the problem.  It is up to all of us, parents, teachers, those involved in the licensing trade and public representatives, to share the responsibility to tackle the problem.  That is why the Government will introduce the national voluntary age card scheme.  It is time this was done.  The regulatory power to introduce this scheme was contained in an 1988 Act.  It has not been introduced in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>With a view to buttressing and helping others involved in the fight against under-age drinking, it is entirely appropriate, desirable and necessary that I introduce this measure.  It will not resolve the problem on its own.  However, it will be of <Col N="920" /> assistance.  In so far as we can assist, we must do so.  That is why I am giving consideration to eliminating the defence of reasonable belief.  This, together with the introduction of the card, should be of assistance in the fight against under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>We owe it to our young people to help them to lead full and productive lives as valuable members of our society.  I acknowledge the fact that the vast majority of publicans would not, under any circumstances, wilfully serve drink to a young person.  I also acknowledge the help given and the work done by the representative associations of publicans in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important subject and I am glad we are discussing it.  I compliment Senator Farrell, who is a licensed vintner, for being so forward in requesting a debate on the issue.  I supported him as Opposition spokesperson on such matters.  It would have the almost unanimous support of all parties and groups represented here.</P>
      <P>Under-age alcohol consumption is a major problem about which there is no doubt.  A great deal of survey and study work has been done on the problem in recent years.  The ESRI produced a report on the problem in 1994 and the psychologist, Mr. Neil Johnson, recently published a study conducted in Galway and in the Galway area.  In my locality, the Roscommon Regional Youth Service conducted a survey on alcohol, tobacco and other drug use.  Some 2,632 young respondents all under 18 years of age were chosen on scientific grounds taking into account a comprehensive regional spread of the area of County Roscommon and east Galway where the survey was conducted.  All the other factors needed to make such a survey reliable were deployed in this particular examination which was done in 1993 and published in 1994.</P>
      <P>There is one consistent outcome from all the survey and study work done to date which is that under-age drinking is widespread and has rooted itself very deeply in modern youth culture.  Generally speaking, surveys on the subject show that there is equality between boys and girls in relation to the main manifestation of the problem &mdash; in other words, the number of teenagers under 18 years of age who use alcohol is evenly divided between boys and girls.  All surveys show that about 55 per cent of teenagers under 18 years of age who have been surveyed drink alcohol on a regular or an occasional basis.  Most worrying is the very high figure in all the samples who admit they drink often or regularly and more than just occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Roscommon-east Galway survey which I mentioned showed that 32.3 per cent of young people who started drinking under the legal age of 18 years of age did so under peer pressure &mdash; in other words, they were with friends when they had their first whole alcohol drink. When asked what effect drink had on them during the past year, which was I take 1993, 17 per <Col N="921" /> cent of respondents indicated that they had been sick, 72 per cent indicated loss of memory as a result of drinking, 6.8 per cent or almost 7 per cent said they got into fights, 4.8 per cent or almost 5 per cent fought with their parents and 4.7 per cent damaged property.</P>
    <P>Respondents were asked to indicate reasons for drinking: 41.1 per cent said they liked the taste of alcohol, 12.5 per cent said they drank because they did not want to feel left out, 22.4 per cent said taking a drink or drinking helped them to relax, which we all recognise, 18 per cent said &mdash; this would have a resonance with adults too &mdash; drink gave them courage, almost 20 per cent said that drinking helped them to mix more easily with the opposite sex, which is important for young people, 11.4 per cent said that they did not want their friends to think they were afraid to drink, 17 per cent said drink helped them to mix with friends of all sexes, 15.1 per cent said they drank because it made them more adult and 13.4 per cent said it helped them with their worries and problems.</P>
    <P>Another interesting set of figures emerged from this survey.  When respondents were asked about their usual source of alcohol 24.8 per cent, or almost one-quarter, said their source of alcohol was a public house while 10.8 per cent said they got it at home which begs some questions.  The Minister outlined that it appears legal under the 1988 Act for young people to consume alcohol within their private residences.  A high figure, almost 11 per cent, said they drank alcohol they got at home.  Obviously, there would be many cases within that figures in which the parents would not be aware their children or under age teenagers were taking drink from the home.  Nowadays I suppose there is drink in all homes.  Some 2.1 per cent of respondents said they purchased alcohol in off licences and 1.3 per cent said the supermarket was their source of alcohol supply. Almost 13 per cent said they had another source as their supply of alcohol supply &mdash; presumably they were given or treated to drink by friends. These figures paint a pretty frightening picture.</P>
    <P>All surveys, whether done by Dr. Johnson or the ESRI, while they often arrive at their statistical conclusion from different angles, arrive at the same conclusion at the end of the day.  That shows that over 50 per cent and as high as 55 per cent of children between the ages of 14 and the legal age of 18 years of age consume alcohol.  A high percentage of those kids consume alcohol regularly rather than occasionally.  We have looked at how well alcohol consumption is rooted in the culture of young people.  We hear about peer pressure and about how young people have their first drink in the company of a friend who had an influence over them and that they wanted to be as adult as he or she was.</P>
    <P>The other interesting factor is the even divide between boys and girls.  The same percentage of boys and girls of 15 or 16 years of age use and, very often, abuse alcohol in those tender years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> I sat on the subcommittee drawn from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It comprised seven Members, including myself and my colleague, Senator Bohan and five Members of the Lower House. We sat over several months and inherited the work of the committee of the outgoing Dáil. Many submissions were heard on the issue of under-age drinking.  If I have one criticism of our report &mdash; I speak personally &mdash; it is that our recommendations on under age drinking were not strong enough.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Minister will introduce a voluntary national age card or a national identity card scheme but it is not enough.  We are marrying that to the abolition of reasonable belief provided for under the 1988 Act whereby a person supplying alcohol to a young person must show reasonable proof that he or she did not know the person was under 18 years of age &mdash; usually it is a publican or a vintner who would find themselves in such a position.  This scheme cannot work unless we introduce a compulsory identity card scheme and the Minister can do so under section 40 of the 1988 Act.</P>
    <P>While I welcome what the Minister proposes to do from the beginning of next year, he should aim to introduce a national compulsory identity card scheme very soon.  Senator Farrell and Senator Bohan who are both present and are vintners have practical experience of what I am talking about but it would not be fair to a publican to abolish the principle of reasonable belief if the card scheme was voluntary because voluntarily issued cards may be tampered with.  I support the abolition of the principle of reasonable belief, but it should be accompanied by a compulsory identity card scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding the civil liberties element, no one is as fond of them as I nor is there anyone who supports and promotes them as I do.  However, some of the most socially advanced countries have introduced this legislation and it has not been a problem.  We need to bite that bullet.  I know the difficulties the Minister will encounter, especially the tidal wave of abuse he will experience. However, I assure him ordinary citizens, especially worried parents, will support him if he introduces such a scheme.  While I welcome his proposals, I strongly urge him to go a step further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the debate as it is a clear indication how seriously he views the problem.  I view seriously the problem of alcohol abuse in general.  No Minister has done more than this one to try to prevent the mayhem on the roads which brings death and destruction to so many homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem which is the subject of this debate is teenage drinking.  It is sad to see groups of children sitting in the Public Gallery whose parents believe they have raised to be lovely young people because they are at the stage where they are in danger of falling into the trap of teenage <Col N="923" /> drinking.  Nothing has caused as much heartbreak or as many problems.  Teenage pregnancy is a major problem in society and interviews with and surveys of teenage girls show that most pregnancies were caused because girls had drink taken and did not know what was happening.  Sometimes they did not even know with whom they went home, such was the state they were in.  That is sad and it is a sad reflection on society.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that no legislation will solve the problem because, if it did, it would have been solved long ago.  An awareness must be created and parents must be vigilant and it is to be hoped this debate will initiate that.  A trend has started in recent years of children not going home at night and staying with friends.  Parents should ensure their children are at home every night until they are at least 18 years old and that they are home at a reasonable time.  Schools and others cannot be blamed; we must start at the root cause.  Many years ago at a health board meeting I appealed to parents to lock their drinks cabinets because they provided too many opportunities for children to become involved in drink.</P>
    <P>Eminent psychologists or psychiatrists on a radio programme recently were unanimous that the drug of alcohol was a greater problem than all other drugs combined.  It was the single largest cause of problems among teenagers.  Garda figures show 54 per cent of juvenile crime last year involved drink, despite juvenile liaison officers and the efforts of parents, teachers, probation officers, social workers, welfare officers and a host of voluntary organisations to combat the problem.  We seem to be going nowhere, despite the fact that we know it is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Young people have money today.  Poverty may have been a blessing in our time because we did not have money to spend.  However, young people have money today and, no matter what identity card scheme is introduced, they will always get older people to buy drink for them. When I was a gasúr I smoked a little, although not too much, and there was always a senior citizen who would buy a packet of Woodbines for me.  Young people will get drink and no legislation or garda will prevent that.</P>
    <P>An awareness must be created among young people and it should be at the same level as the awareness about telephone masts.  People debate and argue about them, yet the single greatest killer in society &mdash; alcohol &mdash; is considered by all to be acceptable, despite the trail of destruction it leaves in its wake.  Advertising today is geared at younger people.  I would like to see a ban on alcohol advertising similar to that on cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The problem of teenage drinking only got out of hand in the past ten years.  The pubs did a good job, and still do.  I speak of ordinary, traditional pubs which care for their customers.  When I was growing up, if there was a sign of drink on a person, they would not be allowed into a dance hall. Now every dance hall and disco has a bar to sell drink to young people.  A curb must be placed on <Col N="924" /> this.  Drink is too readily available in centres of entertainment.  The stabbing and killing or injuring of young people in the past 12 months has occurred outside centres of entertainment where alcohol was sold, and not outside local, country or family pubs.  There are too many trails of sorrow and desolation for us not to face the fact of alcohol abuse, especially by teenagers.  Some statistics show children as young as ten go to school with hangovers.  That is a sad reflection on society.  No legislation or gardaí will cure that.  An awareness must be created and parents, teachers and others involved must play their part in making it a live subject.</P>
    <P>Back in the 1940s, it was usual to take the pledge until one was 21; the age was then lowered to 18.  I asked a bishop why that happened and he replied that youngsters today would not keep it. That is sad.  It is the line of least resistance and the lowest common denominator.  When children took the pledge, parents had a crutch whereby they could say to them that, since they took the pledge and made an agreement not to drink, they should honour that commitment.  It was a great help to parents in their appeal to their children not to drink.  If young people reach 18 or 19 without drinking, matters might not be so bad. However, if they get caught in the drinking trap at ten, 12 or 13, it is disastrous because they are heading down the slippery slope.  The awareness to stop that must be created.</P>
    <P>I contribute to this debate because I feel strongly about the subject and have done so for the 20 years I have been a member of health boards.  I often said I would like schools to bring children to Mountjoy Prison or St. Patrick's Institution to see the young inmates, or to the rehabilitation unit in Dún Laoghaire to see young people there lying strapped up in bed and unable to speak, all the result of the abuse of alcohol. That is what young people should be shown.  It is not good enough to bring them into the Seanad to see the beautiful architecture, we must teach them the realities of the world.  We should do more work in that area.  I would like to say a great deal more on this subject.  I am grateful the Minister has faced up to his responsibilities in a very open and honest manner and is in the Seanad today because he views this as a serious matter.  I hope the general public view it seriously.</P>
    <P>We are now entering the Christmas season and people who are hail and hearty today will be in coffins by the end of the year as a result of alcohol abuse.  I wish people would wake up, take off their blinkers and witness the terrible destruction caused by alcohol abuse.  Drink was available at the marriage feast of Cana; it is no harm to take a drink but one should not abuse it.  Alcohol is being abused by 10, 12 and 14 year olds.  I hope people wake up to the dangers of alcohol abuse.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to this House, I know he is a busy man.  It is hardly necessary for me to make a declaration; everybody knows I have a vested interest in this matter. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important subject.</P>
      <P>As a matter of principle and policy, the Licensed Vintners' Association has always supported legislative measures aimed at eliminating the extremely problematic issue of under-age drinking.  That is why the association supported the relevant sections on under-age drinking contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  It is also the reason the association recently took the view that the recommendations in the recent report of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Legislation and Security dealing with a review of the liquor licensing laws to set up a research group in conjunction with all interested parties to produce an immediate report on the options and strategies for establishing a national age card scheme and that the maximum penalties for conviction of holders of liquor licences and others for providing liquor to persons under 18 years be increased to £500 for the first offence and £1,000 for subsequent offences are eminently sensible and should be enacted in legislation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under-age drinking is a many faceted issue and is not capable of elimination by legislation alone. Much depends on parental control, especially in the affluent era in which we now live where drink is often freely accessible in the home and parental absence is a common experience for teenagers. Peer pressure is also a major factor.  It may demand depths of strength of character for a young person to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; when all around him or her are having, or seeming to have, a great time by drinking alcohol before they reach the legal age.  These are issues outside the scope of legislation.  Implementation of thoughtful and imaginative policies such as those proposed in the national alcohol policy and aimed at educating young people of the need to postpone drinking until reaching 18 years of age has an important role to play, as does the recent code of practice on marketing and labelling of single serve alcoholic beverages &mdash; alcopops in particular &mdash; which was developed and promoted last year by the Drinks Industry Group with the backing of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Responsible advertising and marketing policies also have their place in the overall policy mix. The interaction of all these and other social elements is essential if the incidence of under-age drinking is to be curbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until recently the licensed trade had divided views on proof of age cards.  Many of my colleagues were strongly in favour of such cards, while a significant minority saw cards as a potential licence to drink that should, on the grounds of common sense, be opposed.  The latter view is redundant, living as we do in a society in which identity cards proliferate.  A recent survey carried out within the trade indicates that 89 per cent of <Col N="926" /> publicans would welcome a national card scheme. However, there is a major administrative dilemma.  Who should issue proof of age cards? Should it be the Department of Education and Science, the health boards, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or some other completely independent organisation charged solely with this function?  I am open to correction, but difficulties over establishing who should have the final responsibility for such cards were the main reason section 40 of the 1988 Act, which provided for the issue of age cards, has not yet been implemented.  This administrative obstacle should be overcome as a matter of urgency.  There is no reason it cannot.</P>
    <P>The Licensed Vintners' Association believes the present system of fines and endorsements as proposed and updated, if rigorously enforced, would provide an adequate disincentive to that very tiny minority of publicans who knowingly sell drink to minors.  I place on record my opposition to any publican who serves alcohol to under-age customers.  The House can be assured that such people can expect no support or defence from the Licensed Vintners' Association. Conviction for such an offence would be grounds for expulsion from our organisation.  Members must realise that publicans are usually also parents, often of teenage children.  Quite apart from the moral issues involved, and these are great, publicans are not the sole, or even the main, source of supply of alcohol to minors and are professionally aware of the damage such practice has on the long term future of their businesses.  They will give no support to colleagues who knowingly jeopardise their livelihoods by dealing with under-age customers.  The House may be assured that the Licensed Vintners' Association and the Vintners' Federation of Ireland will, as a matter of ongoing policy, support any intelligent legislative measures designed to curb the problem of underage drinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this important debate.  It is accentuated by the fact that we are now entering the festive season when, as Senators have pointed out, abuse of alcohol by young people can become a real problem.  That does not mean it is not a problem at other times of the year, it is simply greater during the festive season.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to the question of the defence of reasonable belief and the introduction of the national voluntary age cards scheme which I proposed to proceed with in the new year.  At present, if a licensee appears before a court charged with the offence of selling drink to minors, he or she can plead the defence that he or she reasonably believed the person concerned was over 18 years of age.  I am actively considering the removal of that defence.  If it is removed, however, the licensee must be given some mechanism whereby he or she can ascertain the age of a person who orders alcohol on his or her premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> If the reasonable belief defence is removed, a licensee would be foolish &mdash; even though the scheme is voluntary &mdash; not to ask for the production of an identity card if he or she was in any doubt about the age of a person ordering alcohol on the premises.  That is how I envisage the scheme working.  If it is introduced in this way, the scheme will have the capacity to deal in a real and tangible way with the small minority of people who serve alcohol to those who are under age.  Let us be clear about one thing, that small minority does not merely relate to licence holders because others are also involved.  Senator Farrell is correct to state that some adults who are not licensees are involved in the sale of alcohol to under-age drinkers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Connor's comments on this issue.  I trust that my explanation of the manner in which I envisage the identity card scheme will work will allay the Senator's concerns in respect of the scheme's non-compulsory nature.</P>
    <P>I also appreciate Senator Bohan's comments and I acknowledge the input of the Vintners' Federation and the Licensed Vintners' Association in respect of the problem of under-age drinking.  On numerous occasions, the leaders of these organisations have resolutely opposed the sale of drink to young people.  In that context, Senator Bohan is correct to state that the vast majority of publicans have children and they are as concerned as others about this problem because they witness the effects of alcohol abuse.  It is only right to place on record that the associations provide considerable assistance to the authorities in trying to stamp out the abuse of alcohol by young people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments of Senator Farrell, it is true that a multi-faceted approach is required.  It is farcical to suggest that it is possible to deal with this problem through the enforcement of criminal legislation alone.  That is not possible.  The assistance of many agencies, parents, family members and responsible people will be required to solve this problem.  As Senator Farrell indicated, education is perhaps the best way to inform young minds with regard to the abuse of alcohol.  Education, particularly at a formative stage, can have a great bearing on the attitudes young people adopt towards alcohol and other matters.  Responsibility for that job should not be left to teachers, it must be extended to parents and into the wider community.</P>
    <P>The contribution my Department proposes to make in respect of tackling the problem of under-age drinking will be to introduce the regulations provided for under the 1988 Act.  Those regulations are at an advanced stage and I have been checking the drafts of late.  We are poised to introduce the scheme.  As Senator Bohan pointed out, things have moved on and identity cards have been introduced in a number of other areas. It is only appropriate that we take advantage of the provisions on the 1988 Act to try to stem the problem of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Since coming to office I have been concerned about this problem.  Senator Farrell correctly stated that the figures for reported juvenile crime increased last year.  That may be due to greater levels of reporting but it may also be due to various improvements in that particular area. Regardless of whether the figures have increased in terms of the number of crimes committed, it must be accepted that alcohol plays a part in juvenile crime.  Therefore, it is desirable that we should try to impact on the problem to the best of our ability.  That is the Government's intention.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to assist parents who are concerned about his problem.  However, while we will introduce the age card scheme &mdash; which I am sure will be complied with by licensees and enforced, in so far as is possible, by the Garda Síochána &mdash; it must be recognised that this problem must be addressed on a broader basis.  This problem will not be solved or minimised by the actions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or another agency because a multi-faceted approach is required.  If this debate has helped to engender an even broader discussion on that issue, it will have been a worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Farrell and others for raising this important matter and I thank Senators Farrell, Connor and Bohan for their valuable contributions. I also thank the Seanad Whip, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, who organised the debate, and the Cathaoirleach and his staff for their courtesy and efficiency.</P>

      <P>This has been a wonderful bicentenary year and I feel privileged to have served as chairperson of the Government's 1798 commemoration committee.  At the outset I wish to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Senator Avril Doyle.  I sought to build on the foundation of the work she had done and to ensure that the commemoration was dignified, appropriate and totally inclusive.  We set out to avoid what we identified as a flaw in the commemorations <Col N="929" /> of 1898, 1938 and 1948.  That is the excessive emphasis on the Catholic Nationalist version of the rebellion which saw 1798 only as a crusade for faith and fatherland.  Inevitably, that partisan approach alienated many others, including the descendants of the Ulster United Irishmen who had been so much to the forefront in the 1790s.  I wish to acknowledge again the work of Senator Doyle and congratulate her on her great work which made my task substantially easier. I tried throughout the year to refer to Senator Doyle's involvement because the bicentenary belongs to all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My committee sought to take advantage of the fresh interpretations of 1798 which have been offered in recent years, notably by Louis Cullen, Marianne Elliott, Tom Bartlett, Daire Keogh, Kevin Whelan and Nicholas Furlong. This new interpretation, broadly accepted by the main historians who work actively on the period, stresses the political rather than the purely military aspects of the 1798 Rebellion.  It emphasises that what happened in Ulster was of a piece with what happened in Leinster, restores Belfast and the Presbyterian United Irishmen to the centre of the picture, presents the United Irish movement as democratic, pluralist and forward looking and carefully exposes the propaganda which has infected so much of the received wisdom on 1798.  Yet, we did not seek to suppress or to occlude the less positive features of the 1798 Rebellion which was a bloody affair and was marked, regrettably, by atrocities on all sides.</P>
      <P>From the beginning the Government's 1798 commemoration committee sought to incorporate this fresh thinking into the commemoration programme and to work closely with the distinguished historians of the period.  In this sense, rather than the Government presenting an agenda to the historians, the historians presented an agenda to the Government.  Everything my committee did was firmly guided by a concern to be as truthful as possible in our interpretative programme to the history of 1798 as it is understood by the current generation of scholars.  The Rebellion took a grim toll of lives and saw some deplorable events but taken in the round, the period was essentially marked by a nobility of vision and action on the part of the United Irishmen in which we can legitimately take the pride which so strongly infused people and communities throughout the country in this bicentenary year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were concerned with accuracy and with bringing these new interpretations to public notice, we were also concerned that 1798 should not become the preserve merely of academics. We wanted local communities to take ownership of the commemoration and we wanted the message to spread as widely as possible.  We responded where we could to local initiatives and I am happy that there was a terrific community response and that we were able to help so many <Col N="930" /> worthy initiatives to get off the ground throughout the country.  Here I want to pay a personal tribute to the tremendous commitment which these local communities brought to the commemoration of the parishes' role in 1798.  I was deeply moved by the strength of feeling which 1798 still evokes and by the dignity with which communities honoured their ancestors' honourable pursuit of the democratic freedom which we take so much for granted.</P>
    <P>The degree of voluntary effort was amazing and there was a genuine grass root involvement, spanning the entire community.  Inevitably, the epicentre of the Rebellion in south Leinster, particularly County Wexford, was very much to the fore in this regard.  I am, however, happy to say that the commemoration caught the public imagination and that there were worthwhile activities across the whole island.  The Government's committee was able to help projects in more than 20 of the 32 counties.</P>
    <P>I want to single out for special mention the contingents of pikemen and women&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from the various parishes who did so much to add colour to the huge number of events which took place throughout the country.  I was delighted that so many women and members of many different religious groups felt sufficiently encouraged to become involved.  I was also very pleased that there was no knee-jerk association between the pike and the Armalite which would have sullied the ideas of the United Irishmen and their ideals.</P>
      <P>It was also remarkable that this year witnessed a momentous event in our history &mdash; one in which we can all take pride &mdash; the signing of the British-Irish Agreement.  The 1790s witnessed the beginning of our current predicaments; it was when unionism and nationalism split.  It was, therefore, highly appropriate that the bicentenary year should witness the most imaginative and farreaching effort to bridge that historic divide by trying to construct a set of complex political arrangements which would allow both traditions an honourable accommodation.</P>
      <P>I feel the British-Irish Agreement seeks, not unlike the United Irishmen, to create a pluralist, democratic and inclusive settlement and to rid our societies, North and South, of the cancers of violence and sectarianism.  In many ways the British-Irish Agreement is the single most fitting memorial to the principles of the United Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased, therefore, by the renewed interest which 1798 evoked in the north of Ireland this year.  A wide range of events and activities took place there and were very well attended, including outstanding exhibitions by the Ulster Museum and the Linenhall Library.  At an early stage my committee held a co-ordination meeting with relevant bodies and persons in Northern Ireland.  We sought to support cross-Border <Col N="931" /> initiatives where possible and the performance of the <i>Mozart Requiem</i> in Wexford, Dublin and Belfast was one such example.</P>
    <P>I was also delighted we were able to assist RTÉ in producing their three part documentary series <i>Rebellion.</i>  This attracted very high viewing figures and was, therefore, extremely important in communicating a sense of the historic events in 1798 and their significance and legacy to as wide an audience as possible.  I would also congratulate T na G and BBC Northern Ireland for their fine 1798 programmes.</P>
    <P>There were so many events that took place in this bicentenary year that it is invidious to single out any one of them.  I was especially pleased that we were able to unveil a very fine 1798 Memorial Park at Croppies Acre which put Dublin very firmly and permanently on the 1798 map.  I was pleased last weekend to open the conference to commemorate the convening of the Back Lane Parliament of 1792 in The Tailors' Hall.</P>
    <P>I am proud that my committee was able to fund fine projects, such as the Film Institute of Ireland's 1798 film festival, the National Museum and National Library's 1798 exhibition, the publication of Wolfe Tone's diaries, the Linenhall Library's exhibition and the Dublin/Belfast 1798 conference.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all who contributed their effort, time, imagination and money to ensuring that the bicentenary was appropriately marked.  In particular, I would like to thank and to pay a tribute to the members of the Government's 1798 commemoration committee for their dedicated and creative input; to Professor Kevin Whelan, the consultant historian to the National Commemoration, for his scholarly and balanced advice and, indeed, for his infectious enthusiasm; and to the secretary of the National Committee, Ms Alice Kearney and the colleagues who served with her in the commemoration office of the Department of the Taoiseach, for commitment way beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>In regard to the commemorations of both the Great Famine and the 1798 Rebellion, Ms Kearney has given a remarkable example of dedicated and effective public service, was always cheerful and courteous and has earned the respect and affection of all those throughout the country who have been involved in the commemorations.</P>
    <P>Senators, I think we have had a fine year.  We approached it with dignity, we learned a lot and we have come away with a renewed respect for the principles of the United Irishmen and a determination to put their ideals into practice in the modern world of 1998.  As the new millennium approaches, this is the most appropriate living memorial to the men and women of 1798.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind words.  As his predecessor, it was my great pleasure and honour to act as national chairperson of the 1798 commemoration committee. In borrowing his own words, I thank him for <Col N="932" /> the dignified, appropriate and inclusive way he continued the committee in the spirit in which it commenced.  The fact that a Government can hand a project across the House is a good example of what non-sectarian, pluralist democracy is all about.  The bottom line in terms of how we commemorated 1798 was trying to rediscover truth that had been buried in previous commemorations over the years.</P>
      <P>I would like to endorse what the Minister said in relation to the various 1798 commemorative projects, whether in Wexford, Dublin, across the Border or elsewhere.  This year has been a wonderful experience from the smallest local initiative to the major national and international projects which revisited and rediscovered the principles of 1798 which drove the United Irishmen and women.</P>
      <P>The 1790s was arguably the pivotal decade in the evolution of modern Ireland.  It presents an interesting interplay between Irish and international forces, when what happened on this island was inseparable from a wider global setting. The 1798 Rebellion linked Ireland in very special ways with America, France and Australia, in particular, making a permanent and indelible contribution to the evolution of the Irish diaspora.</P>
      <P>The year 1798 also casts a long shadow.  The resonant and romantic names of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Henry Joy McCraken, Beauchamp Baganel Harvey, Thomas Russell, Robert Emmet, Lord Edward FitzGerald, Father John Murphy and Myles Byrne, among others, were to reverberate down the echo chambers of Irish history.  While physically defeated, they achieved a remarkable symbolic victory which has ensured their undying fame.</P>
      <P>If the 1790s can be seen as the pivotal decade in the evolution of modern Ireland, then an honest and accurate understanding of it is not just of scholarly interest but has important implications for current political and cultural thinking.  It is precisely because of its enduring relevance that 1798 has never passed out of politics and into history.</P>
      <P>A window of opportunity was opened in Ireland by the impact of the American and French Revolutions.  That moment was brilliantly seized by the United Irishmen who imaginatively created a vision of non-sectarian, democratic and inclusive politics which could attract and sustain all Irish people in all their inherited complexities. By facing into the future rather than the past, they wished to heal the hurts of Irish history in a brotherhood of affection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enduring legacy of the United Irishmen was their momentous ability to bring Dissenter, Anglican and Catholic together in a shared political project.  We now know from more recent scholarship that that generous project was deliberately derailed by counter-revolutionaries in the 1790s, largely through the injection of sectarianism to break the United Irishmen's non-sectarian <Col N="933" /> appeal.  We are still living with the consequences of that defeat.</P>
    <P>The United Irish project of an inclusive, democratic, non-sectarian Ireland remains uncompleted today.  Understanding the reasons for its momentous defeat in the 1790s can help to ensure that history does not tragically repeat itself.  I fully agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, that the greatest commemoration of 1798 has been the British-Irish Agreement of Good Friday this year.</P>
    <P>One lesson we need to heed is the divisive role of propaganda and selective history.  The propaganda war which ensued after 1798 ensured that the real principles of the 1790s were buried in a welter of recrimination and political point scoring. In the acrimonious and anxious aftermath of 1798 and the Act of Union, control of the interpretation of the Rebellion became a vital component of many political agendas.  Considerable energy was invested in portraying the 1798 Rebellion as a mere sectarian and agrarian revolt of ignorant Catholic peasants, in an effort to detach Presbyterians from the emerging democratic movement.</P>
    <P>I hope that these deliberate falsifications have been swept away by our bicentenary commemorations and that we can once more see the 1790s in their true context.  By relieving the Rebellion of its oppressive weight of misrepresentation, 1798 ceases to become divisive.  The marvellous recent works on the period have begun to make 1798 available precisely in that fresh way, opening an invigorating and more generous space in which to consider it.</P>
    <P>Our commemoration has helped us to discard the now discredited sectarian version of 1798.  The Catholic Nationalist version, which dominated the 150th centenary commemorations in 1948, has largely been abandoned in favour of a pluralist, non-sectarian approach this year, which more accurately reflects what the United Irishmen envisaged.</P>
    <P>We also stressed the modernity of the United Irish Party, its forward looking, democratic dimension and largely abandoned the outdated agrarian or peasant interpretation of what it was all about.  We emphasised the essential unity of the 1798 insurrection.  What happened in Wexford was part of what occurred in Antrim and Down.</P>
    <P>Throughout 1998 efforts were made to relinquish our obsession with the military aspects of 1798, including pikes and deaths, murder, mayhem and martyrdom.  I concur with the Minister of State in complimenting the contingents of pikemen, women and children of all denominations who turned out in good weather and bad for the last 12 months.  They represented what the original pikemen actually stood for 200 years ago, when men and women, Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter held pikes in the battlefields.  It was an excellent representation by all those contingents, whom I congratulate for their accurate portrayal of what 1798 was all about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> We stressed the living principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen so notably formulated.  Too much emphasis on the gory details of the campaign can only distract us from the enduring legacy of the Rebellion &mdash; the political vision and moral choices which impelled men and women into the field in 1798.  It is that political vision we need to reclaim and remember, not the physical defeat of the revolution on the bloody battlefields of that time.</P>
    <P>During the year we also, particularly in Wexford, constantly reminded ourselves of the international perspective of the United Irishmen, linking Bunker Hill, the Bastille and Boolavogue, and stressing the enduring links which 1798 forged with America, France and Australia.  We constantly stressed that 1798 and Wexford were not cabbage patch skirmishes but part of a national campaign, indelibly linked to what happened elsewhere, and especially in Ulster.</P>
    <P>Our commemoration throughout the year was international and national as well as local.  We were generous in our acknowledgment of the Ulster dimension and especially of the enormous contribution of the Presbyterian tradition, with its enlightened emphasis on justice, equality and civil liberty.  I hope in all these ways we helped to make the bicentenary more open, inclusive and dynamic and that we made it speak to the people as a whole, including our diaspora.  We used the 1790s as a vision and inspiration for the 1990s.</P>
    <P>I can be forgiven for dwelling on the Wexford story in more detail having lived in that county for 27 years and been a democratically elected public representative of the people of Wexford for 25 years.  On 21 December 1792 the bearer of a great County Wexford name, a former French Army Officer, Captain Sweetman, announced to the Dublin Society of the United Irishmen the inauguration of a branch of the United Irishmen in Gorey in County Wexford.  The planting of political revolution and evolution had taken place in County Wexford, a county of extraordinary strategic importance on the Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean coasts.</P>
    <P>The Dublin society had already been joined by supporters of the liberal Protestant party in County Wexford, the best known of whom were the popular barrister and landlord, Baganel Harvey and his brother James &mdash; a direct descendent of both these men is a neighbour of mine in the village of Crossabeg, Mr. Robert Harvey &mdash; William Hatton of Clonard, Samuel Cooper, John Grogan of Helfield, Anthony Pursey of Inch, George Powell and Edward Sweetman of Newbawn.</P>
    <P>It is important to record that at that stage the initial political evolutionary aims consisted merely of parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation.  As it happened, evolution was frustrated and revolution resulted.  The early supporters of the United Irishmen in County Wexford included the Protestants, such as Anthony Perry, George Sparks of Blackwater, Captain Mattie Keogh, a former British Army officer, <Col N="935" /> Henry Hughes of Ballytrent, Robert Graham of Inch and John Boxwell of Sarshill, Kilmore. Prominent County Wexford Catholics involved were Dr. John Henry Colclough of Ballyteigue Castle in Kilmore, John Haye, a former French Army officer, and his brother Edward of Ballinkeele, Nicholas Murphy of Monaseed, Edward Fitzgerald of Newpark, Edward Roche of Garrylocke, Nicholas Sweetman of Newbawn, Esmond Ryan of Mount Howard and James Edward Devereux of Carrickmannon.  These are a litany of well known Wexford names.</P>
    <P>The early members of this new society of revolutionary political thought were all well respected and widely connected men of substance.  They were also possessed of one other vital political facility &mdash; they lived in well dispersed locations from the slopes of the Wicklow mountains to the Atlantic.  The gathering conditions for revolt were, not surprisingly, facilitated by vicious political antagonisms as the new ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity were digested rapidly in a county still simmering under a century and a half of humiliation, confiscation and professional deprivation.</P>
    <P>The United Irishmen, in alliance with the French, precipitated the insurrection which culminated in the south-east becoming a &ldquo;theatre of war of appalling ferocity&rdquo; in 1798, to quote a prominent modern day Wexford historian, Nicky Furlong.  I want to record not a ghastly aftermath but the new fresh admirable expression of generous political activity which accompanied the early overwhelming success of the insurgents in County Wexford in May 1798.</P>
    <P>When the capture of the administrative capital of the county, the port and town of Wexford, was effected by the insurgents, the United Irish Government, long discussed and agreed, took active and rapid shape in Wexford town on 31 May 1798.  A general meeting of the inhabitants of the town and county, numbering up to 500, took place in the largest of Wexford's buildings, Kenny's Hall, in South Main Street &mdash; a building of obnoxious memory to many in Wexford at the time as Cromwell's residence and headquarters in October 1649.</P>
    <P>Following the French revolutionary models, this Parliament of Wexford people, comprising two from each parish and totally different from the corporation and councils of factional privilege and impressive power in place the previous week, became what was variously described as the Directory, the Council of the People and more popularly the Senate of Wexford, representing broad popular support for the new Republic.  Its role was to administer the new county under the existing wartime conditions.</P>
    <P>What was the situation in Wexford on that remarkable birthday of democracy?  It was one of unbounded optimism, hope and certainty that right and justice would prevail.  The citizens army had swept across Wexford like a mighty wave with the amazing victories of Oulart Hill and the <Col N="936" /> garrisoned Enniscorthy town behind it.  Now it controlled the capital of the region.  Its self belief and determination were expressed in the fact that its army, under the elected Commander-in-Chief, Baganal Harvey, decided to divide into three divisions, one to march on Ross and Waterford, the other towards Arklow and the third to Newtownbarry and into the midlands.  We are therefore looking at a scene of powerful conviction that the old world had changed forever, that Ireland and each individual person would be free and that a Government representative of all the people would replace the corrupt power of the royal and ancient regime.  Was that dream too good to be true?</P>
    <P>From the assembled citizens of Wexford in Kenny's Hall, a Directory or Cabinet was elected. It could not possibly have been more representative or generous in impulse.  Eight members were elected to the governing council, four Catholics, three Church of Ireland and one Presbyterian.  Its presiding officer, or Cathaoirleach, was a Protestant, a former British Army captain and a United Irishman, Matthew Keogh of Georges Street.  It set about its citizens' business.  Sovereignty had been taken and employed by the people.</P>
    <P>Members of Seanad Éireann are their successors in ideals.  Their enterprise did not meet with success but with cruel reverse.  In less than four weeks the dream was swept away and havoc reigned.  With the defeat of the United Irishmen, this innovative experiment in democracy was suppressed with great brutality and obliterated from the historic record.  Its widespread support at all levels of Wexford society was denied in the anxious aftermath of 1798 and the Revolution was dismissively misrepresented as a mere peasant and sectarian event.</P>
    <P>However, there was success.  The men and women who were imprisoned, expelled, transported, sent by the boatload to penal colonies, such as the West Indies, Australia, North America or South America, brought with them the seeds of the ideals we take for granted.  However, these ideals formed the most formidable building blocks of the greatest nations on earth today.</P>
    <P>By recovering the real history of the Wexford republic, we reappropriate a profoundly democratic symbol and an inspiring example of an effort to construct a representative secular and pluralist politics on the island of Ireland.  Two hundred years later it can again serve to encourage us towards that imaginative inclusiveness which the United Irishmen identified as being essential to unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.</P>
    <P>One of the flagship projects of the bicentenary commemorations was the reconvening of the Wexford Senate in 1998 at Johnstown Castle.  I am proud to be one of those 500 members of the 1998 Wexford Senate who, together with Senator Maurice Hayes and Senator Walsh, are also Members of Seanad Éireann.  Comprising exciting, original and diverse thinking and experience, <Col N="937" /> but separate from the narrow ground of party politics, the Wexford Senate can rethink Ireland in a global society so as to fully exploit her unique position as a member of the European Union, a post-colonial State and a nation opening up to her diaspora.  It will fashion a distinctly Irish voice, confident and outward looking, born and nurtured in the wealth of the wider Irish experience.</P>
    <P>As the Minister responsible for overseeing the Government's contribution to the commemoration of the bicentenary, it gave me great pleasure to officially launch the friends of Comóradh 1798 flagship project and I thank them for their commitment to reconvene the Wexford Senate. I want to put on record the commitment of Comóradh '98, the committee that was set up in 1988 in Wexford to plan and programme suitable commemorative projects for the bicentenary. This committee was set up by Enniscorthy Urban District Council and Wexford County Council.  I congratulate both public officials and elected representatives for a decade of hard and committed work.  I remember the chairpersons of Comóradh '98, the late councillor Andy Doyle, councillor Michael Sinnott and councillor Charlie Kavanagh, the present chairperson &mdash; a Labour, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chairperson respectively, as befits the spirit of the commemoration.</P>
    <P>Together with the new national 1798 centre in Enniscorthy, the Fr. Murphy Centre at Boolavogue, the project at Oulart and the heritage centre at Ferns, I am extremely proud of the commemorative projects undertaken in every village and population centre in County Wexford to the memory of the United Irishmen and women and their efforts to bring popular and pluralist democracy together in a new nation in the 1790s.</P>
    <P>My thanks also &mdash; and I endorse the Minister of State's remarks &mdash; to the interdepartmental commemoration committee which like him I chaired during my time as Minister of State with responsibility in this area.  The Minister of State's comments are well made and I support them.  I wish to express my thanks for the service given to that committee over the years and through two Governments by Alice Kearney.  I thank her and her colleagues for all their advice and support over the years.  I also thank the historians from all over this island, particularly Kevin Whelan, Tom Bartlett, Nickey Furlong and Dáire Keogh for their help.  The Minister of State has already referred to those people.  I hope by listing people I have not omitted anyone.  I fully endorse what the Minister of State said about the wonderful support given by them and I am extremely grateful to them all.</P>
    <P>Again, I hope we have made the bicentenary open, inclusive and dynamic.  I hope it spoke to the Irish people as a whole, including our diaspora, and that we use the 1790s as a vision and inspiration for the 1990s and beyond into the new millennium.  Let us remind ourselves of the age old wisdom of the Book of Proverbs &ldquo;Where there is no vision, people perish&rdquo;.  The United Irish had above all vision.</P>

      <P>Before calling the next speaker I wish to thank the Minister of State and Senator Doyle for their planning and congratulate them on all that went on, in particular the Minister of State when he attended the recent event at the Croppies Acre.  During the summer I had the pleasure to visit that exhibition in Enniscorthy. It was one of the finest exhibitions of its kind.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for making time available for this important discussion.  I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, not only for his presence here but for his commitment and involvement in many events during the year all over the country.  I thank his predecessor, Senator Doyle, for her contribution in ensuring there was an appropriate commemoration of 1798 this year, unlike the paltry commemoration we had in 1991 for the 75th anniversary of 1916.  I hope people will realise the appropriate way to commemorate our historical achievements in the future.</P>
      <P>While I jotted down some comments today I noted the milestones of Irish history and only six or more years stand out.  These are as follows: the arrival of St. Patrick and the introduction of Christianity in 430 AD; the Norman invasion in 1169; the year 1690 would have been significant if I were a Unionist but it did not strike me as very important; 1798 undoubtedly is a milestone in our history because it spawned the concept of democracy in this country; the great famine in the 1840s which resulted in 70 million Irish disaspora scattered around the world who are ambassadors for Ireland and for what we as a people stand for; 1916 and the Easter Rising which culminated in our independence in 1922.  In modern times the accession to the EC in 1973 would be a landmark date.  As we become more removed from it its significance will be much more pertinent.  I hope 1998 will mark the beginning of a rapprochement between the islands situated on the north-west corner of Europe and a rapprochement between the different traditions on this island.  Inherent in the British-Irish Agreement are the ingredients that can re-ignite the vision and the flame that existed in 1798 between Catholics, Protestants and Dissenter alike.</P>
      <P>This year we celebrated the bicentenary in good style.  Tá an-bhród ormsa mar dhuine ó Loch Garman a bheith im sheasamh anseo i dTeach an Oireachtais i Stát saor neamhspleách chun imeachtaí 1798 a phlé agus a chomóradh.  Earlier Senator Avril Doyle mentioned that not only is she a Member of Seanad Éireann but she is also a senator in the Wexford Senate.  I can do one better because I am also a senator of the Junior Chamber International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we have witnessed an extraordinary series of commemorations in Wexford and throughout the country, as the Minister of State pointed out.  It has been an outstanding year of celebration.  The county committee of Comóradh <Col N="939" /> 1798 deserve great commendation for their efforts and initiatives, particularly for co-ordinating the parishes and arranging many very memorable public events during the year.  Senator Avril Doyle has already mentioned the chairman of the committee councillor Charlie Kavanagh and I join with her to praise him and his predecessors the late councillor Michael Sinnott and councillor Andy Doyle.  Both of whom in their capacity as former chairman laid the foundations for many of the events that took place this year.  I must also mention Donal Minnoch, Bernard Brown, Brian Cleary, Dave Bernie and a host of other people, all of whom have given unselfishly of their time to ensure we had a very important part of our history commemorated in a manner that attracted public attention which could not have been anticipated prior to the events.  The Minister of State has already mentioned the historians Dr. Kevin Whelan, Louis Cullen from New Ross, Nickey Furlong and many others.  They all made a big contribution.  Ach tá moladh faoi leith ag dul d'fhir agus do mhná na bpící a bhí i láthair ag gach morshiúl agus ócáid phoiblí i rith na bliana.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Bill Murray with regard the pikemen who at a certain stage late in the preparations decided to organise battalions of pikemen throughout Wexford.  His idea spread further afield because we had a battalion from Meath who travelled to New Ross in County Wexford to take part in commemorations.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 people were recruited as pikemen.  Mr. Joe Cullen was present when the Taoiseach attended commemorations held in New Ross on 5 June. He felt there was a battalion missing and along with Eddie Bennett they formed the Three Buller Gate battalion which was a very historic part of New Ross.  They ensured this area was represented in the overall parade of the pikemen. Their initiative and commitment is evident because they spent months training and marching so they could accurately represent and commemorate the pikemen of 1798.  Above all their presence enhanced our public events and made a very significant contribution to the dignity of the commemoration.</P>
    <P>It is good to remember and learn.  Today we remember the 20,000 or more who died during the summer of 1798.  We also remember 5 June for a number of reasons.  First, on 5 June the battle of New Ross took place and it changed the course of the rebellion.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 people reputedly died during that battle.  While the insurgents had made great gains at a certain stage of the morning they were subsequently repulsed during which a local temporary hospital that had been set up to care for the injured was burned.  We are led to believe that over 100 insurgents were burned in that inflagration.  I mention this because we must remember the unpleasant aspects of the rebellion.  For example, Scullabogue was a place where Protestants, women, children and elderly men were burned in a barn on the same day, 5 June.  In many ways our history <Col N="940" /> has always affected the various traditions on this island, inflicting pain on one side or the other.  I hope the British-Irish Agreement will lay the foundation stone so that events such as this or other events in more modern times such as the shooting, killing and torturing of innocent Catholics will never again be repeated here.  We learn from history that the coming together of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter is a challenge to us today to recreate a climate of common purpose. Above all, if the British-Irish Agreement means anything, it should be a priority to bring together all traditions on this island in a common cause.</P>
    <P>We learn also that the value of liberty, equality and fraternity &mdash; the essence of republicanism &mdash; is as important today as it was in 1798 or during the French Revolution.  Equality of opportunity must be given to those who are marginalised, the poor, the disadvantaged and the disabled.  We must ensure the Government creates policies for an inclusive society.  I am proud to be a member of the party that espouses republicanism.  This should be the cornerstone of all policies that emanate from the party and any Government of which we are members.</P>
    <P>The 1798 rebellion followed in the wake of the American War of Independence in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789.  It provided the roots for our modern democracy.  The rebellion was lost but the spirit lives on today.  Our espousal of the ideals of those men of 1798, and put into practice in the last century, has led to the modern Ireland of which we are so proud.  Many commentators stated that the recent visit of Tony Blair to this House was another watershed along that road. This is so, even though it may have been a lost opportunity.  I accept that if the Prime Minister was unable to apologise for past mistreatment of Ireland during colonial rule, a tacit acknowledgment would have been a valuable contribution to the healing and reconciliation process, which is so necessary.  There was a reference in his speech to forgiving and forgetting.  Perhaps this was less than required.  One must be mindful that events such as Bloody Sunday are close in proximity to the present day and we may have to wait a little longer for such apologies.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest last night to the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, addressing the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  As can be seen in South Africa, a very positive climate can be forged from past atrocities, pain and hurt by addressing them in an open manner.  This can lance the pain and create healing and reconciliation. It is necessary that this should take place on this island, and between our islands, in order to create the climate we all want to see flourishing.</P>
    <P>Leinster House should commemorate in a visible and lasting way its association with 1798.  This House was owned by the FitzGerald family &mdash; Lord Edward FitzGerald was the Commander-in-Chief of the United Irishmen.  It is important that the linkage we have with that family and with the events of 1798 should be commemorated.  This <Col N="941" /> House is now the seat of the democracy to which the 1798 leaders aspired.  This is another reason this House recognises the need for that tangible connection either by way of an exhibition, which has already been mooted, or an artistic or historical piece to portray the new Ireland envisaged by those who took part in the 1798 rebellion.  The bicentenary should not be allowed pass without a proper and lasting commemoration in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Ballyhuskard and other graveyards in private ownership in County Wexford and elsewhere.  There are no rights of access for relatives or the public to these graveyards. One can understand the concerns of owners of such properties regarding insurance liability in the event of such access.  Local people have made a selfless contribution this year to identifying and cleaning these nationally important graveyards. However, posterity cannot depend on voluntary effort only.  Consideration should be given to bringing this under the aegis of the Office of Public Works.  The Minister should provide the budget to ensure the restoration of these monuments takes place because they have a valuable role to play in the future.  Their preservation is essential and would be an ongoing reminder of the 1798 commemoration ceremonies which took place this year.  The historian, Joe Doran, and other local historians have visited many of these graveyards.  Mr. Doran listed graves of coach yeomen and rebels, and identified some of them.  All that information should be collated.  The graveyards should be maintained to ensure the inscriptions can be read and that they will be of interest to people who visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>On a more parochial note &mdash; Senator Doyle will be familiar with this &mdash; there is an historic graveyard and church in our town, St. Mary's Church and cemetery.  Like many Protestant churches with a Catholic graveyard beside them, it does not have the resources to be properly maintained.  This has connections with 1798, but the church dates back to the arrival of the Normans. William Earl Marshall, reputedly one of the authors of the Magna Carta, married Isabella, the daughter of Strongbow, in that church.  The Office of Public Works, or some such body, should have an input into the preservation of that part of our heritage.  Unfortunately, small local authorities such as New Ross Urban District Council do not have the resources to provide funding for schemes such as this.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, to consider extending the remit of these public agencies to ensure historic monuments are cleaned and refurbished.  It is important on the tri-centenary of 1798 that there is obvious evidence that our generation cared and contributed to the preservation of our historic and cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The bicentenary should not only be the catalyst for Leinster House to appropriately, if belatedly, mark the era of aspiring to a new beginning but <Col N="942" /> to conserving our graveyards and rich historical heritage.  We should dedicate ourselves to the ideals that inspired a generation to make the ultimate sacrifice by committing ourselves to ensuring that the last chapter of our bloody history has now commenced by bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the objectives of the British-Irish Agreement and by bringing Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter together in forging a new Ireland of which all traditions can be proud.  Only then can we begin to write a new history of a new, free, independent, caring and self-confident Ireland. Only then can we proudly take our place among the nations of the world as a constructive and valuable member whose contribution far transcends our size or population.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have moved remarkably far in the past 15 years, and perhaps even in the past five years. The courage of Deputy Albert Reynolds in particular, forced us to look at the whole of our story.  From about 1970 until almost 1990, we had with some exceptions developed a view of ourselves and our problems which was so one-sided as to make a solution impossible.  Wearing the engineers hat which I wear occasionally, I know the first thing you tell anybody is that you cannot solve a problem by leaving out half of it.  The British-Irish Agreement represented the culmination of a willingness to represent the complexity of our history, something which had been missing for most of the Troubles.  The complexity of our history was diluted into a one dimensional view that if only the Provisional IRA would go away, the <Col N="943" /> problem would be solved.  It was never as simple as that and neither was our history.</P>
    <P>It was an achievement for both Senator Doyle and the Minister to put together a commemoration which drew the strands of our history together while, at the same time, not denying any of our history.  It is extremely important that we should not deny any of our history and &mdash; I know it was a carefully selected word &mdash; that we did not have a celebration of 1798 but a commemoration. There are many reasons not to celebrate such events.</P>
    <P>There were many reasons for celebrating wars which I find distasteful.  For example, it is worth remembering that 30,000 people died.  Senator Walsh stated that it was 20,000 but I do not know whether it was 20,000 or 30,000 &mdash; I am not sure anybody knows, but it was a great many people. It represents one in every 1,000 of the population of the time and, most assuredly, one in every 500 of the adult population of the time.  It was an enormous number and, considering that there were sections of the country like my present place of residence, Cork, in which there was relatively little activity, the scale of the death and slaughter was enormous.  One British historian suggested that in fact more people died in absolute numbers as opposed to <i>per capita</i> in and after 1798 on this island than died in France in the reign of terror after the French Revolution.</P>
    <P>When we commemorate something like that we do ourselves a disservice if we let ourselves believe that all our wars were glorious as long as they are long time ago and it is only our recent activities which are distasteful, and that the more recent the war, the more distasteful it becomes. If we have anything to remember, it is that war and violence are always brutal and savage and there never has been a noble war.  No matter how noble the objective, warfare brings out the worst in all of us.  Some of the massacres mentioned are examples of this.</P>
    <P>We need not be apologetic.  The people of this island have been probably responsible for the deaths of fewer innocent people <i>per capita</i> than virtually any other country in Europe.  Far from being the most bloodthirsty nation in Europe, as some of our commentators would have had us believe over the past 30 years, we are probably the least violent and warlike.  We do not have this extraordinary tradition.  Some of the events we called rebellions, in particular the rebellion of Robert Emmet, the memory of whom I am not denigrating, were hardly much more than a riot in one street, the consequences of which were enormous.  We have built events into rebellions.</P>
    <P>The 1798 Rebellion has wonderful overtones of tragedy about it.  It enables us to follow a pointless exercise which is worth doing at a time like this.  There was a movement towards independence within the then Irish Parliament and that tendency was far from popular at Westminster.  It was being driven by those who had representation in that Parliament.  It is worth remembering <Col N="944" /> that it still took large scale bribery to bring about the end of the Irish Parliament in 1801 in the Act of Union.</P>
    <P>Although I would not argue with the Minister when he said that after 1798 came the division of Unionism and Nationalism, I would quibble about it.  That division was always there to a degree but it was never as easily divided between Catholics and Protestants as was stated by many of the historians who wrote and attempted to rewrite our history in the past 50 years.  One particularly eminent historian who was never a Member of this House wrote a colourful and interesting history of Ireland over the past number of hundreds of years.  The history is decorated with good pen pictures of eminent people but he never managed to mention in them that Thomas Davis, John Mitchell or a number of other such people were Protestants because that did not fit a particular objective which was to show that there were seeds of sectarianism in the impulse towards Irish independence from the very beginning, and there were not.  The impulse towards independence in this island was not a sectarian impulse.  It is undoubtedly true that it was tainted by people who had sectarian objectives. However, notwithstanding everything which has been said and done in the name of nationalism, it may be said that Irish nationalism is not sectarian in its motivation.  People who have been Nationalist have been sectarian and people have behaved in a sectarian fashion from within organisations which are part of the Nationalist spectrum. However, it is wrong to suggest that the GAA, Conradh na Gaeilge or even Fianna Fáil &mdash; I will be generous for once &mdash; are in some way sectarian. Irish nationalism is not sectarian.  It can be, and has been, insensitive to the feelings of minority religions and can be quite capricious. However, it is important to say that the impulse of those who drove the vehicle of Irish nationalism since the 18th century was never sectarian.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Ó Fiaich once said that people should understand the difference between the different forms of sectarianism on this island. He was promptly misrepresented when he said Catholic sectarianism was essentially political and Protestant sectarianism was essentially religious.  This was a perceptive remark for which he was hung, drawn and quartered by a large section of the liberal establishment. The point he was making was that Catholics do not have an inherent hostility to Protestantism, but there is a section of the Protestant tradition which has been brought up with an hostility to Roman Catholicism.  This is an important point if one is to understand our history and I hope this is what the commemoration of 1798 is about.</P>
    <P>We are not celebrating the deaths of 30,000 people.  No one wants to do that.  However, apart from the formality, an occasion like this helps us to understand ourselves.  This is a good time to understand ourselves better.  There has been a tendency to sneer at Irish independence.  I am as <Col N="945" /> good a critic of this State and its limitations as anyone and we will talk about that some other day.  However, there has been 700 years of an unequal relationship.  I am not sure I agree with Senator Walsh that Tony Blair should have apologised.  It is worth recording again that while dreadful things have been done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister of State's position.</P>
      <P>People on both islands have done things. However, that is not to say we should pretend the relationship was not far from equal.  It serves no historical purpose or the cause of reconciliation to leave the truth of the relationship out of the equation.  It was a very unequal relationship because of population, historical and religious discrimination and colonial attitudes.  It is probably too simplistic to describe the relationship between Britain and Ireland as similar to that of a colonial relationship between Great Britain and an African colony.  There was a slightly colonial attitude until recently.  One must remember that liberal parts of the British media were astonished when an Irish judge described Britain as a foreign country when attempting to ban a book.  Ms Justice Carroll said she could not understand how the interests of a government of a foreign country could be used as a reason to prevent the publication of a book in this State.  Large sections of the British media were taken aback at the idea that an Irish judge would see Britain as a foreign country.  She was not talking about some alien culture but about jurisdiction, and which government has jurisdiction in which area.</P>
      <P>We serve no purpose by pretending these differences do not exist, any more than any purpose was served in the past by a simplistic equation which wrote out of our history the existence of a quarter of the population who were not Roman Catholics.  Every week we see the difficulty with which we are now beginning to grapple, namely, attempting to reconcile those two traditions.  This is a difficult process and shooting people is about the worst way one could go about reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People can talk about destiny or fate.  The British-Irish Agreement happened in the year in <Col N="946" /> which we are looking back on the 1798 Rebellion with a detached capacity which we did not always have.  This allows us to talk about these issues without calling each other names or blaming one country or another.  There is no point in attributing blame to the present generation of British politicians for what happened before.  We are entitled to fully understand ourselves and events like the commemoration of 1798 help us to do so.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary commentary that Professor Kevin Whelan is the most prominent historical adviser.  It is not so long ago that he was an unpopular figure in Irish historical circles as he was one of the first to suggest there was a new balance to be restored in terms of understanding our history.  I am glad we are back to a position of balance.</P>
    <P>I hope we are moving on and can look back dispassionately.  I have always been taken by something in Seán Ó Faoláin's biography of Daniel O'Connell, <i>King of the Beggars.</i>  It is a book well worth reading.  One of the dimensions of our history which needs to be understood is the contempt in which the residues of the old Gaelic aristocracy held the ordinary peasantry.  Ó Faoláin notes this as one of the great shocks he experienced when researching Daniel O'Connell.  The leftovers of the old Gaelic aristocracy had abandoned their own people by the end of the 18th century.  It is extraordinary that so many of the leaders of the 1798 Rebellion were from the Ascendancy, so few of whom had any historical connection with the old Irish Gaelic aristocracy. The degree to which this disconnection had happened is one of the peculiarities of our history which we need to work through.  That is why O'Connell became known as &ldquo;King of the Beggars&rdquo; as he organised the ordinary Catholic population. Catholic emancipation was not his greatest achievement.  His greatest achievement was creating the willingness to once again aspire to it among a population which had felt abandoned for almost 150 years &mdash; a long period in history.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we have worked out a little bit of our history and now have an ability to reconcile ourselves with it.  It is also interesting that Scotland, one of our nearest neighbours, is beginning to realise that independence, properly developed, sensibly rooted and forward looking can often give a small state a dynamism not derived from participation in a larger entity.  It is therefore extraordinary that we commemorate 1798 when at last we have the prospect of a settlement on this island, a level of economic performance nobody dreamed the island was capable of and when the inspirational cry of <i>liberté, egalité, fraternité</i> perhaps needs to be vigorously reinserted in our vocabulary.  In this State we now have the most unequal income distribution in the developed world.  I do not believe in only equality of opportunity.  I believe in equality.  Equality of opportunity is a misnomer.  We could reinsert many of those slogans into our political debate. Otherwise we are likely to sow the seeds of other unpleasant disaffection on this island.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom tréaslú leis an Aire agus le Coiste Comórtha 1798 as an obair a dhein siad.  Dhein siad an obair seo go héifeachtúil agus go torthúil.  An rud is tábhachtaí ná gur tharla an comóradh seo ar bhonn an-leathan ar fud na tíre agus taobh amuigh di freisin agus gur i measc an phobail is mó a bhí an comóradh.</P>
      <P>Táimid go mór faoi chomaoin ag na coistí áitiúla toisc an obair fhiúntach a dhein siadsan freisin. Bhí sin soiléir i ngach áit gur theastaigh uathu comóradh a dhéanamh ar mhisneach agus ar dhúthracht na ndaoine a ghlac páirt sa réabhlóid seo.</P>
      <P>Beidh tuiscint níos fearr tar éis na bliana seo ní amháin ar '98 ach ar an stair i gcoitinne mar ní sheasann aon chuid de stair na hÉireann léi féin. Tá gach eachtra a tharla sa stair ceangailte le eachtra eile agus ní gá ach féachaint ar gach réabhlóid sa tír le 800 bliain anuas go raibh an scéal amhlaidh.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Coiste Comóradh '98 for the fine programme of events organised throughout the country.  One of the most important aspects of the commemoration was the fact that it happened at all.  It happened on a very broad base and largely grew from local community endeavours.</P>
      <P>Throughout the past year, I had the privilege of being invited to many parts of Ireland to deliver orations at 1798 commemorations.  These extended from Mayo to Cork and Clare to Dublin. In Clare, it was held in a very small graveyard where one individual to whom a monument had been erected 100 years ago was commemorated. His name was O'Donovan.  On hearing of the Rising in Wexford, he travelled by foot from Clare across the mountains and participated in the Rebellion and survived.  He returned home to find that his house had been destroyed.  He subsequently ended up in exile in France.</P>
      <P>There was a commemoration at the foot of Sliabh na mBan.  Many Senators are familiar with the 1798 aspect in the Irish language version of Sliabh na mBan.  We reminisced about what might have happened if things had been different.</P>
      <P>At all the commemorations it struck me very forcefully that they were organised on a community basis.  No particular organisation was involved; large numbers were not involved.  There were 300 or 400 people at each commemoration ceremony.  However there was a determination on the part of those involved to ensure there was a fitting, dignified and meaningful commemoration of the courage, commitment, sacrifices and the ideology of those involved.</P>
      <P>This year we also had the 150th anniversary of the Young Irelanders.  At all the events I attended, particularly in Tipperary, in connection with the Young Ireland movement, reference was made to 1798.  Reference was also made to the Famine and subsequent periods of Irish history, such as the Fenians in 1916 and the War of Independence. At all the events references were made right up to the peace process in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> The point being made was that if 1798 had not happened, subsequent risings in Ireland against oppression, coercion and interference in our affairs from outside the country might not have happened.  It was important that subsequent movements learned a lot from the events of 1798. If my statistics are correct, one-sixth of the population of Wexford at that time died in the 1798 Rebellion.  That is difficult to understand; it is difficult to engage statistics like that.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday night I attended a dramatised version of the 1798 Rebellion in Dún Mhuire Hall in Wexford town.  One line in the script by Nicholas Furlong struck home in a very deep way.  The line went something like &ldquo;You out there in the dark, someone belonging to you died in '98.&rdquo; That is the one of the reasons 1798, more than any other period in Irish history, struck a chord among ordinary people in Wexford, Mayo and other parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the early 1960s when I was a timire with Conradh na Gaeilge, Wexford was one of my counties.  I used to reside there from time to time. I was struck by the living history of 1798, even more so than the history of 1916 or the War of Independence.  It was not just the stone monuments which dot the towns and countryside throughout Wexford, it was the way people spoke about that period as if it happened only yesterday. Obviously part of it was folklore, part was a partisan interest.  However, given the short period of 200 years, most of it must have been accurate. Nobody would deny there is a propaganda aspect to 1798, as there is to every other aspect of Irish history.  However nobody in this House could point to an independence movement in any part of the world, small or big, which did not propagandise its own involvement in a war.  Over the years I watched various films in cinemas and it was clear that the makers of the films, depending on their origins, had bent a propaganda element into their explanation of the war subject.</P>
    <P>We do not need to be reminded too often that war is not glorious.  War is brutal.  War is tragic. War is devastating.  War is inhuman.  When we commemorate, we commemorate courage and ideals.  Particularly in relation to 1798 we can commemorate a raw courage which has seldom been experienced in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>For that reason, while it is right to set the record straight, we must always be careful not to have an in-built revisionism for the sake of political expediency.  The generosity of spirit of each individual who is motivated by goodwill will ensure we will not endeavour to build on hatred or bitterness.  However, we must recognise the sacrifices made for our freedom, sovereignty and control of our own destiny.  If we did not do that we would create a further division in society by inflicting hurt on the descendants of those people involved in all episodes of Irish history who suffered loss with no chance of personal gain &mdash; careers were ruined, lives were lost and families were hindered.  Those descendants would feel <Col N="949" /> hurt if we misrepresented what was done on our behalf.</P>
    <P>I read a letter in the <i>Evening Echo</i> written by Paddy Berry, an exceptionally fine ballad singer. The fact that we had so many fine ballads, particularly from County Wexford, kept the memory of 1798 alive and passed on an unabridged history &mdash; and perhaps an adorned one &mdash; from generation to generation.  In his letter, Paddy Berry paid compliment to the pikemen and women, particularly of Wexford, and the fact that they did not confine their endeavours to that county.  I spoke to a number of them at different commemorations and one group said they travelled to County Meath and attended no fewer than 12 different functions in one day.  They helped many areas and were not selfish in confining their activities to Wexford.</P>
    <P>Paddy Berry wrote of their enthusiasm, commitment and idealism.  I spoke to many of them and it was not an empty display on their behalf, there was a great comradeship among them.  I understand they were decommissioned to some extent last Sunday.  I missed that by a short period as I was in Wexford town.  However, I had the opportunity to meet them again.  Paddy Berry suggested that if they were not going to use their pikes they might replace them with mummer's sticks.  He focused on the Fleadh Ceoil in Enniscorthy next August.  It is a major event supported by all religious denominations and all political affiliations and is a great celebration of the diversity which exists in Ireland.  The involvement in this event of the people in Wexford who participated in this year's commemorations would be positive and ongoing.</P>
    <P>I agree that in many ways one can identify the British-Irish Agreement with past events.  That is correct and is the way it should be.  History should not be seen as sterile or as a maudlin type of exhibitionism. It should not salve consciences.  It must be used as a beacon for the future and that beacon must be one of hope.  If the men and women involved in 1798 and previous or subsequent rebellions could have foreseen the British-Irish Agreement, they would have been happy.</P>
    <P>We are privileged to have the opportunity of expressing our views in an official context.  I hope that if anything comes from the 1798 commemoration, it will not only be that we commemorated courage and idealism but that at the same time we proved ourselves to be worthy inheritors of those great men and women.  I congratulate everyone on the island of Ireland and abroad who participated in one of the most long standing and edifying commemorations in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago I was in a book shop before I went on holidays and I picked up a book by Marianne Elliot, an author I had not read before, entitled <i>The United Irishmen and France: Partners in Revolution.</i>  I read it and discovered the true history of 1798.  Marianne Elliot is one of the best writers I have read on the subject which she has researched in France, Ireland <Col N="950" /> and America.  Her work led me to wish to learn more about the United Irishmen &mdash; not just about 1798 but that whole period of Irish history, starting with the American Revolution and the French Revolution of 1789 and their influence on Ireland.  I discovered a great deal about that period.</P>
      <P>We have to remain politicians as we cannot be historians.  The history books speak to us about the facts of that time.  It is our job to draw the threads of those times together and make them practical and realistic in today's world.  These are two separate matters.  From a historic point of view, what have been missing in this commemorative year are articles on the Defenders.  It is true that in the 1790s, the United Irishmen eventually became the leaders of the revolutionary forces. However, it was the ordinary citizens and poor people of Ireland who became the first revolutionaries. The spirit and knowledge of the French Revolution was disseminated by Thomas Paine through the distribution of thousands of the pamphlet <i>The Rights of Man.</i>  Practically every citizen in the country was aware of the French Revolution and the revolutionary slogan of &ldquo;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity&rdquo;.  The impact of the French Revolution on the thinking of ordinary people is not clearly understood by present day commentators.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk about the Defenders in County Louth.  There was a small revolution in County Louth in the 1790s.  It was not nationalism, although it was driven by the ideals of the French Revolution.  However, economic conditions and increasing poverty brought people from being passive absorbers of information about changes in revolutionary France to becoming active participators in bringing about a revolution in their own country.</P>
      <P>In those days the majority of the poor were Catholics who had no rights, no parliament and no vote.  The emerging Catholic middle class was becoming stronger and more wealthy, particularly in cities such as Dublin, Cork and Belfast and in towns such as Drogheda in County Louth and Navan in County Meath.  They wished to make an economic argument.  Because the Catholic middle class did not have the right to sit in parliament or to vote, they led a demand for political change. In many ways, they gave the Defenders leadership and funding.  In County Louth there is evidence of the importation of arms to places like Termonfeckin and of guns being imported in stone chests.  There are all sorts of wonderful and weird stories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people were changing because they wanted equality which was the main issue of the day and it remains the issue today.  Equality, brotherhood and liberty were revolutionary traditions at that time.  The 1792 Defender uprising took place not only in County Louth but also in Counties Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Down.  If one reads the newspapers of the day or the columns of <i>Faulkner's Journal, Saunder's Newsletter</i> or other press, the activities in Counties Louth, <Col N="951" /> Meath, Cavan and Monaghan dominate the headlines for as long as two years.  The way that revolution was put down in County Louth impacted greatly on public opinion and changed the concept of how equality and liberty could be brought about under the system which was in place at the time.  The United Irishmen filled that void much later in the day.  They were just about founded in 1792 when the Defender rising took place in County Louth.  From a historical perspective, we should pay due homage to the people who were not United Irishmen but who made sacrifices in their lives to bring about the changes they wanted.</P>
    <P>The idea of liberty, equality and fraternity provided leadership to the United Irishmen who, together with the Catholic middle class, were able to bring about a change in thinking and to unite Catholics and Protestants in the enlightened tradition of the day to fight the forces of reaction which were epitomised by John Foster.  He was the last speaker of the Irish House of Parliament and his portrait hangs downstairs.  He was one of the leaders of the forces of reaction and was a Louthman who lived in Collon.  Evidence of the conflict of the time may be found in the history books of County Louth and in the trial of the Drogheda business people in 1792.  From reading that trial, one may see how the national question was crystallised in a local trial.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see emerge from what we call the commemoration of 1798 is that we encourage scholarship and debate and for schools in particular to get involved in this area in the years ahead.  I note the National Library makes some material available on-line.  One may go on-line to find material if one wishes to study this area.  To study local history properly, all the national newspapers of the day and the local journals need to be put on-line so that a student or a group of students in transition year who wish to study what happened in 1794 or 1795 may go on line, access the National Archives, down load material and study it.  This cannot be done at the moment.  A person must come to Dublin to access this material.  Obviously, this is very difficult for students in second level schools.</P>
    <P>Following our debate, a request should be made to the Minister to look at investment in a scholarship so that this area is actively promoted in post-primary schools and that money is given to the National Library to bring these important documents, which may only be seen by researchers, alive and bring them to children in schools who would be in a position to make good use of them.</P>
    <P>The recent visit of Tony Blair was significant and important.  I was delighted he came to this House, and I was delighted with his speech.  It is true Ireland has made significant progress.  The cause of unity is to the fore.  People are working together economically, politically and socially and not under any flag so they may reach their true potential and become fulfilled in our society, <Col N="952" /> North and South.  Mr. Blair's visit brings the ideals of that time to us.  This country has made a great leap forward in the recent past and both this and the last Government have done much to bring that about.</P>
    <P>When we talk of the men of 1798 we talk about the issues of the day &mdash; equality, brotherhood and working together.  The British-Irish Agreement brings together the different traditions in this country which also existed in 1798.  Those were extremely difficult times and it is very hard for us to understand or even comprehend the difficulties of those days which still exist.</P>
    <P>Politicians in the South have shown leadership, fraternity and brotherhood to our Protestant and Catholic friends in the North.  In particular, I pay tribute to my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, who, more than any other leader of a modern Irish political party, has held out the hand of friendship to the Unionist community, this is terribly important.  We must come together and there must be a meeting of minds and cultures. We must offer true and positive leadership and this must also be offered by those on the other side.  The Unionist people and their leadership must show an even greater willingness to co-operate and work together.  I pay particular tribute to Deputy John Bruton for the work he has done in this area which will, in the future, be shown to have been a very brave and important thing to do.</P>
    <P>This is an important debate and I enjoyed listening to the excellent contributions.  Where do we go from here?  This should not be an empty Seanad debate sitting in someone's office gathering dust.  That is not what we want; we want to bring it alive.  What better way to commemorate that period than by learning more about it?  We should have a properly funded scholarship or whatever.  Transition year students are ideally placed to do this work, study their local history, get the information and produce interesting, informative and lively documents relating to the past.  History is as dead as a doornail, or as the Seanad volumes, unless it is brought alive and this may be done by learning about it, by making it positive and by making constructive use of the knowledge we have so that in years to come the benefits of the past may be used.  There is nothing as bad as people being caught up in the whirl of history, going around in circles and blowing their own trumpet all the time.  Politics is about bringing about change.</P>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle who, as Minister, was responsible for starting the commemoration of 1798 used the romantic names of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Henry Joy McCraken, Edward FitzGerald and so on.  I compliment her on the work she did. This is an important debate and I stress again that we must continue to do something positive and constructive about it.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Avril Doyle for initiating the debate.  It was worthwhile and I share her off the record view that an hour is ludicrously short.  Whoever decided that must have thought there was little interest in the debate.  The downside is that the Minister of State was not able to stay for all the debate.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on its work in this area and endorse Senator O'Dowd's remarks about Senator Doyle's role when Minister of State in initiating the national commemoration committee.  I remember casting envious eyes from my fastness in Leitrim at the money pouring into local organisations in Wexford, but Senator Doyle had perfect justification for it.  First, she was from Wexford; I would have done the same for Leitrim.  Second and more important was the historical justification.  It is important the Government was involved and that a continuity was lent to the commemoration given the change in Government.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the outstanding local involvement. While the Government, being able to provide some funding, provided an incentive, it was the spirit in which people involved themselves which was important.  I pay special tribute to the ordinary people of County Wexford, those to whom Mark Killilea referred as people who eat their dinner in the middle of the day.  Their contribution was best exemplified by a comment of one of the pikemen interviewed on RTÉ at the closing ceremony last weekend.  He spoke passionately about the children around him and finished by saying he would die for them.  I do not think he meant it literally but he was caught up in the passion and emotion of the moment.  I was told at the start of this wonderful year of commemoration that the Wexford people saw 1798 as something which happened yesterday and not 200 years ago, that other irrelevant world events such as the First and Second World Wars and the 1916 Rising did not have much of an impact but what happened in 1798 did and lived on in every village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having justifiably complimented the Wexford people, my other reason for contributing to the debate is to acknowledge the work of my people in County Leitrim.  I was fortunate that Leitrim County Council agreed to set up a commemoration committee in the county, of which I was chairman.  We drew together many local historians and received tremendous assistance from the county librarian, Seán Ó Súilleabháin, who was able to provide all the necessary historical documents and perspective on the role of the county in 1798.  It was different to that of Wexford in that it centred almost exclusively on the arrival and passage of General Humbert and his army from Killala through the entirety of County <Col N="954" /> Leitrim, which is unusual, from the Sligo border in the west to the Longford border in the east, and further on the ill-fated march to Ballinamuck. It was an attempt to inform the new generation to ensure the spirit of 1798 and all it stood for would not be forgotten and might act as a catalyst in the new millennium.  I am sure the motivation was the same for Wexford and other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>That was the reason we tried to have every town and village associated with the Humbert march involved, and we were successful.  There was a magnificent response from local communities stretching from Dromahair to Drumkeeran to Drumshanbo to Keshcarrigan to Cloone, where the Humbert army camped overnight before going on to Ballinamuck, and from other towns which had an indirect association, such as Car-rick-on-Shannon, to where many of those hunted down and captured were taken and unceremoniously hanged.  Historic evidence indicates the English, true to form, were not satisfied with killing them.  They put the prisoners through the gruesome process of handing each a note on which the word &ldquo;execute&rdquo; was written and every 21st person was then selected to be hanged.</P>
    <P>That leads back to something Senator Walsh said about the visit of Prime Minister Blair.  It is sometimes not politically correct to state it but Irish people have always been aware of the appalling savagery the yeomanry and other English forces visited upon them.  I remember the song &ldquo;The Croppy Boy&rdquo; as a small child and the infamous Major Sir.  It may seem to outsiders as perpetuating the bloodletting but it is part of our history and is what happened.  Our people were treated in the most appalling manner.  It would have been timely and acceptable for Prime Minister Blair to have acknowledged that savagery inflicted on the vast majority of innocent people in Ireland, who were hunted down and had no response to the savagery, and that he would have apologised for it.  The Japanese have belatedly and reluctantly done so to the Chinese and Koreans. It would have been a right and proper thing for the Prime Minister to have done and I endorse Senator Walsh's remarks in that regard.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the group of historians associated with the Leitrim committee, especially Father Liam Kelly.  Out of the deliberations of the committee emerged a book, <i>A Flame Now Quenched,</i> published by Lilliput Press and widely available in all bookstores.  It adds to the knowledge of 1798 and, while it is one of many publications now available on the era, it not only tells the story of the Humbert march through Leitrim in 1798 but also sets in historical context the years preceding 1798.</P>
    <P>People from Wexford might be interested to know that the people of Leitrim and of the Border counties already had the most awful experience prior to 1798 and that their revolutionary ardour had been literally beaten out of them by that time.  It is one of the sad reflections of history that, if Hoche had been successful in landing in <Col N="955" /> Bantry Bay in 1796, the course of Irish history would have changed, and this would have affected the entire country rather than as happened in 1798, uprisings only occurred in certain parts of Ireland.  While it resulted in the military failure of the Irish forces, it also resulted in the ultimate success of the establishment of democracy and a republic.</P>
    <P>The debate and the year of commemoration have been important.  I acknowledge the outstanding work of <i>The Irish Times</i> in its publication of the 1798 diary compiled and edited by Ruan O'Donnell.  I had the pleasure of meeting him last Saturday at the reincarnation of the Back Lane Parliament, which was the start of political agitation.  It was the first time Catholic Ireland came together and set up a representative parliament to submit to the king the proposal that the penal laws be relaxed and that some be eliminated. It spoke for Nationalist Catholic Ireland against the Protestant establishment.  Sadly, the war of 1793 between France and England intervened and the men of peace were swept aside leaving the way clear for 1798.</P>
    <P>It is a fascinating period of history and one which has been rekindled and reawakened by the initiative of people such as Senator Doyle in her capacity as Minister, continued by the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, and by all those associations and organisations across the country. I agree with Senator O'Dowd that it should not be lost to a new generation of students, be they at primary, second or third level.  I hope a collection of the events and the literary work about 1798 and the nineties in general will be available on CD-ROM.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for sharing his time with me.  I will begin by referring to a point raised by Senators Mooney, O'Dowd and others.  We must ensure we do not forget the events of 1798 once the bicentenary celebrations are over.  We should find a mechanism to enshrine it in a useful educational fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We witnessed the decommissioning of the Pike in Enniscorthy last Sunday.  At the conclusion of the ceremonies the pikes were put back in the patch.  Perhaps there is a message in that about how we might do business in the North.  I am thinking of how we might bring forward the message, principles and celebrations of 1798.  We debated the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund yesterday whereby the State will provide an investment fund of £2 million which will be augmented by private sector funding and is open to various donations of property, etc. to enable American scholars to come to an Irish institution and benefit from the type of vision, in educational terms, that inspired the successful negotiations of the British-Irish Agreement.  The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund was inspired by that success which in many ways reflects the basic principles of 1798.  I wonder if what we are trying to achieve <Col N="956" /> here could be attached to that fund?  We are talking about conflict resolution, principles of equality, liberty and fraternity.  This is the bicentenary of 1798 and is the year in which I hope we will reach a solution to the seemingly irreconcilable problems in Northern Ireland.  A solution to that problem would be a continuation of the principles enshrined in 1798 as a result of the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Rights of Man &mdash; written by Thomas Payne &mdash; and that maelstrom of thinking in the United Irishmen that swept across the western European world and America.  Perhaps we might look at this in those terms.  The Government might assist in a scholarship or educational fund as it has in the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund to commemorate the British-Irish Agreement and the people behind it.  That is one way we might progress.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Doyle who initiated the commemorative committee during her term of office as Minister in the last Government and who determined the parameters under which that committee would work.  She set in motion the process of commemorating 1798.  We owe her our congratulations.  I am glad she is here today; she made a substantial contribution to the debate because of her Wexford background and her knowledge of the area.  I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, for continuing in the same spirit of commemoration and for not taking a triumphalist approach like many of our previous commemorations of Irish history. The centenary celebrations in 1898 were militant, gave rise to the establishment of Sinn Féin and led to the 1916 Rising.  In 1998 we are benefiting, not from the military side of 1798 or the militancy it engendered, but from the guiding principles which lay behind it.  We have come full circle.  We have a much more balanced view of what happened for democracy at the end of the 18th century in relation to principles of liberty, equality, fraternity, the rights of man and human rights.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that tomorrow, 10 December 1998, we will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  That document was put together to reconcile the different ideologies of east and west &mdash; western democracy and eastern Communism.  People were able to meet on the basic principle of human rights.  Human rights and the rights of man are very much at the core of what happened in Ireland in 1798.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the slaughter which took place or try to hide the fact that this was an extremely brutal period.  In 1798, 30,000 people were slaughtered in a few months.  That gives an indication of the substantial nature of the conflict. In 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland only 3,000 people lost their lives &mdash; and I do not mean that in a derogatory sense.  In the context of 1798 30,000 people &mdash; most of them in Wexford &mdash; lost their lives in a couple of months.  That was preceded and followed by the pitchcap, the bayonet, <Col N="957" /> the gibbet and the rack in many parts of the country and precipitated some of the rebellion.</P>
    <P>Dublin had a much quieter commemoration than other parts of the country.  It is a pity we did not spend more time commemorating 1798 in Dublin.  I attended the Croppies Acre commemoration two weeks ago outside Collins Barracks. That is the only established memorial to the events of 1798 in Dublin.  The Back Lane Parliament in 1792 was also part of the ceremony.  It is a very fine memorial and I am glad we established it.</P>
    <P>Wexford has been well rehearsed here today by Senators Doyle, Walsh and others.  When the French landed at Killala they marched up to Collooney, across to Ballymote and on to Leitrim.  It is interesting that everywhere they went ordinary countryfolk flocked to their standard.  We have no proper concept of how extensive the ideas were abroad.  People witnessed this liberation and came from the fields, grabbed the pike and assisted them.  At that time anybody in their right mind would have seen that the small force of Frenchmen was unlikely to overwhelm the country and that the superior British forces were likely to be successful.  Afterward, slaughter occurred on a massive scale at Ballinamuck.  That part of the 1798 rebellion must also be remembered.</P>
    <P>It benefits no one to become involved in revisionism or to try to play down the awfulness of the events which occurred in 1798.  However, it is important to concentrate on what lay at the heart of the Rebellion, namely, a people who had been oppressed for centuries grasping at the wonderful new ideas which gave them a sense of equality, freedom and liberty.  These people were prepared to meet any challenge and face certain death in support of their beliefs.  That shows the extent and power of the ideals of 1798 which remain at the heart of democracy, justice and, in the long term, peace.  Using such ideals is the only way a peaceful resolution can be reached.</P>
    <P>I am glad we had an opportunity to debate the 1798 Rebellion, place on record our pride in what people did &mdash; some in extremely difficult circumstances &mdash; at that time and to recognise the importance of the insurrection to the history of this country.  We hope that the ideals and principles of 1798 continue to remain a part of our heritage and that they will not fall into disuse.  We must find a mechanism to ensure that they become a vibrant and educational set of principles to inspire future generations.  Perhaps we can now contemplate writing the epitaph of Robert Emmet who died not in 1798 but in 1803 and who requested that said epitaph should not be written until this country was free.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the 1997 Annual Report of FÁS; recognises its major contribution to Irish life; and calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>FÁS is one of the few agencies which reaches into every town and village and makes a significant contribution to Irish life and society.  As an organisation, FÁS has developed and changed enormously in recent years.</P>
      <P>One of the great things about FÁS is the way it adapts to changing circumstances.  If we consider that in the 1970s and 1980s Manpower was responsible for job placement while AnCO was responsible for training, we can see how those two organisations merged to form FÁS and bring together training and job placement services under one umbrella.  Since the early 1990s the economy, the employment market and the training culture in Ireland have changed and FÁS has managed to adapt and continue to serve society in carrying out its role.</P>
      <P>On the training side, FÁS has responsibility for apprenticeship schemes, CE schemes, external and internal training programmes and the certification of many other programmes.  The organisation has been responsible for major improvements in the area of certification and has become the trend setter in terms of the education standards which obtain in its internal and external programmes.  FÁS has participated in developing Ireland's current training culture which, even in terms of Europe and the United States, is second to none.</P>
      <P>The services to business section of FÁS provided many important services to the manufacturing industry.  My one criticism of it is that service organisations were ignored by FÁS in so far as it was unable to supply the supports they required during the period in question.  However, that section of FÁS was transferred to Enterprise Ireland and perhaps the situation to which I refer will be reversed.</P>
      <P>The recruitment or job placement section of FÁS has responded well to changing circumstances in recent years.  I compliment the dedicated staff of the recruitment division who, for many years, were obliged to deal with people applying for jobs or seeking assistance in that regard at a time when no jobs were available. Fortunately, the situation has changed and there are now many jobs on offer.  This has changed the focus of FÁS which can now concentrate its efforts on the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years FÁS has operated a computer database and it has been able to respond to the needs of employers by checking that database in order to select suitable candidates for particular vacancies.  I welcome the initiative introduced a number of years ago to focus on small groups of people by taking a &ldquo;mind the pennies and the <Col N="959" /> pounds will look after themselves&rdquo; approach.  It is important to address the issue of long-term unemployment on an individual basis because no two people have the same problem.  People are on long-term unemployment for different reasons and they have different needs and requirements.</P>
    <P>Only by using an approach geared toward the individual will we be able to effectively address the issue of long-term unemployment.  This will enable us to remove people from the culture in which they may have grown or in which they have languished for a long period and encourage them to enter the world of employment where they will receive a weekly wage in appreciation for the work they do.  FÁS has done great work with these people in terms of confidence building, developing their assertiveness skills and providing them with counselling.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties for long-term unemployed people &mdash; this is recognised by FÁS and it is apparent in its training and placement courses &mdash; is that they find it difficult to return to work for a variety of reasons.  It is sometimes difficult for these people to get out of bed in the morning or to be on time for an appointment.  If you are not used to the discipline of the workplace it is difficult to acquire the habit of keeping to schedules or getting to work at a certain time each morning.  The difficulties of people who have been unemployed for a long time need to be sensitively addressed and FÁS has been successful in addressing this issue.</P>
    <P>I commend FÁS for addressing the problem of skills shortage which our growing economy is experiencing.  Within the last year FÁS has established a database of the skills which are required by international companies based in Ireland.  This is a pool of people with high skills and is an effective marketing tool for Forbairt or Enterprise Ireland when they sell Ireland to prospective employers.  FÁS has a website and the organisation's information is updated daily on Aertel. Job vacancies can be advertised in local FÁS offices throughout the country and on the TV page.  This is an excellent service for employers seeking to fill vacancies.  Applications for the jobs which are advertised can be channelled through FÁS offices.</P>
    <P>Many FÁS offices provide a telephone so that people seeking jobs can make local telephone calls.  Those of us who have phones on our desks or in several places in our homes may forget that many people do not have access to this essential service.  It is not always appropriate to answer a job advertisement from a call box and this basic service can be vitally important to job seekers.</P>
    <P>In the year 1997, 96 per cent of participants in CE programmes were recruited from the designated long-term unemployed group.  Many participants in CE schemes go on to full-time or part-time unemployment so that the cycle of long-term unemployment is broken.  The Jobstart and Workplace schemes which are designed to help employers take on workers are vitally important <Col N="960" /> to the employment sector.  Some have been very successful.  For example.  workers have been recruited by the Cadburys plant in Coolock, Dublin, under these schemes and have been reintegrated into the workforce.  FÁS has also provided child care training.  We have had very few child care training programmes and its provision is very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>FÁS has been involved in cross-Border initiatives in the areas of unemployment, training and apprenticeships.  This is particularly welcome in this new era of co-operation between North and South.  FÁS has been particularly responsive to the needs of people with disabilities and special needs who wish to reintegrate into the workforce. They have made services available to individuals, encouraged employers to participate in schemes and co-operated with the National Rehabilitation Board and other organisations in the disability sector.</P>
    <P>FÁS has done a marvellous job over the past number of years.  However, I would like to see better co-ordination between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and FÁS, continued emphasis on individual attention for the long-term unemployed and greater access to training programmes for women.  Many women have great difficulty getting on FÁS training courses.  I would also like to see access to training courses for people who want to change their jobs. The FÁS budget of approximately £479 million is considerable but it is money well spent.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome my good friend and colleague from Dublin South, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House.</P>
      <P>I may be handicapped this evening but I will try to sharpen my other faculties to compensate. I congratulate FÁS on this fine document which deserves our praise.  The Director General's summary sets a positive tone which is no more than one would expect.  I compliment him on the work of his organisation.  Much work has been done to promote specific skills training, foundation training and guidance.  I was very much involved with FÁS in my previous career and I am aware of the great service provided for young people by the Jobstart programme.</P>
      <P>I congratulate FÁS on the success of the Opportunities 97 &mdash; Careers Planning Exhibition, an excellent exhibition of the opportunities offered by FÁS and of links with the national and international business world.  While I congratulate FÁS on the Opportunities 97 exhibition and on the previous annual careers exhibitions, I wonder why these are only held in Dublin.  I know guidance counsellors throughout the country bring students to Dublin to attend these exhibitions but why can they not be held in regional centres so that the excellent service provided by FÁS can be more widely spread?  FÁS deserves praise for providing this great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> I wish to focus on the reorganisation and remodelling of the FÁS apprenticeship scheme, about which I have serious misgivings.  This scheme has see-sawed many times as regards how it has worked in the past and will operate in future.  The old school of thinking on apprenticeships was the best, where one went into the local school and provided education and training. Students then emerged into the world of work while returning to school to follow training modules. The system now appears to fluctuate between three days on and two days out.  Even the business community does not know how the apprenticeship scheme is supposed to operate; even in my other professional role, I still do not know how the scheme operates.  The Minister of State should remodel it, perhaps in the old fashioned way.  The students were brought in for training and then they get jobs.  When the jobs dried up that system did not work because apprentices who had been trained had nowhere to go.  Responsibility was then switched to the business community.  FÁS trained the apprentices on condition that employers provided a place for them.</P>
    <P>Now that employment is increasing again, I cannot understand why the Minister for State cannot create a panel of trainees, regardless of whether jobs are available.  He should bring in a percentage of trainee plumbers, electricians, carpenters and metal workers.  We have not looked at the service area either.  They should be trained for training's sake.</P>
    <P>If I need a plumber tonight, I will not be able to find one.  I cannot look for a plumber in the business community.  I cannot understand why FÁS cannot have a panel or list of plumbers, electricians, painters, etc., so that when necessary I can phone for one.  There should be a panel of such people in each FÁS branch area, be it in Finglas, Clondalkin or Rathfarnham, so that local residents can avail of their services.</P>
    <P>There was a time when trades people were highly rated.  Now we have third level courses and one does not think about apprenticeships any more.  That is considered to be a substandard type of work and we are told that people must be trained for entry to third level education, including the technological area.  I would like to see young people being trained after the junior certificate. A link could then be created, involving co-ordination between the education sector and FÁS as to how best our school leavers can take up an apprenticeship in the areas they wish to pursue as a career.  I do not wish to be negative because I am aware of the work FÁS is doing. However, I would like to see FÁS remodelling the apprenticeship scheme in the manner I have outlined.  I could speak for another half an hour on this subject but I only have ten minutes.</P>
    <P>I also wish to mention the service trades because I think the Minister of State has slipped up when it comes to the catering sector.  There may be an overlap between catering and the apprenticeship scheme because something is not <Col N="962" /> working properly in that area, which I would like to see tidied up.</P>
    <P>Why can the Minister of State not do a hard sell in schools concerning trades?  That is not being done, but if it was we might take a fresh look at reorganisation of the apprenticeship scheme.  Great work is being done and big money is being spent on the scheme.  While some areas can boast of success stories, I am not convinced that the apprenticeship scheme is one such area. I would like to see it being remodelled; perhaps we can discuss the matter on another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad. I thank my colleague, Senator Ormonde, for her warm words of welcome.  I wish her a speedy recovery and wish her well in the forthcoming elections.</P>
      <P>I also wish to thank Senator Cox, from my county of Galway, who opened the debate.  I noticed that she was accompanied by a major touring party from Galway.  I am glad she found the time to attend the House for this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on the role of FÁS, the national training and employment authority, and its contribution to Irish life.  I want to assure Senators that any proposals and suggestions arising from this debate will be filtered through both the Department and FÁS.  I found it a very enlightening experience to have worked with FÁS over the last 18 months and getting around the country to places as far away as Donegal and Sligo.  I have seen what is happening throughout the country.  I will try to address many of these issues but no doubt, as Senator Ormonde said, we will discuss them again.  We will continue to monitor how things are operating, especially now that there is a huge drive in the economy, and will ensure that all the services are working to their full potential.</P>
      <P>FÁS's role is well reflected in its recently published annual report, to which Senators referred. I would now like to outline to the House some key features of the report.  Approximately 92,000 people completed FÁS employment, skills and enterprise programmes in 1997 compared to 84,000 in 1996.  One of the most positive developments of 1997 was the sustained improvement in the levels of apprenticeships being offered by employers.  This was referred to by Senator Ormonde.  A total of 5,569 new apprentices were registered compared to 4,135 in 1996.</P>
      <P>FÁS continued to make progress in establishing traineeships.  This skills development programme, which is run in partnership between FÁS and employers, addresses equally the skill needs of employers and the training needs of new entrants to the labour market.  A total of 58 traineeship courses were piloted in 1997. Approximately 500 people completed traineeships in 1997, of whom 402 subsequently secured jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> During 1997 a total of 11,921 unemployed persons completed specific skills training courses.  On completing their training, 73 per cent secured employment in a diverse range of sectors.  Specific skills training courses are focused on the specific needs of local employers, with special attention being given to the software, computing, electronics and related high-technology areas.</P>
    <P>Targeting of community employment on the long-term unemployed resulted in a significant shift in the profile of participants.  At the end of 1997, 96 per cent of participants joining community employment programmes were recruited from the targeted long-term unemployed group.</P>
    <P>The Jobstart and Workplace schemes, developed in 1996 as part of the Government's employment support measures to help unemployed people secure work, expanded significantly during the year with a total of 2,083 jobs being supported.  The training support scheme provided assistance to 2,084 firms for the training of 21,889 people in key business skills.  The scheme gave special consideration to small enterprises with fewer than 50 people.</P>
    <P>During 1997, FÁS embarked on a major programme of reorganising its service delivery structure in its ten regions.  These structural changes were aimed at achieving a better focus on key customer groups and improving the efficiency of its support and administrative activities.</P>
    <P>I would now like to reflect on some of the economic and labour market factors impacting on FÁS's role and the challenges facing it as a consequence. Ireland's gross domestic product &mdash; GDP &mdash; grew at an annual average rate of just under 7 per cent between 1990 and 1997.  This compares with a growth rate of less than 2 per cent in the EU overall.  As Senators can appreciate, that is very impressive indeed.</P>
    <P>Our GNP achieved a cumulative growth of over 60 per cent in GNP between 1990 and 1998. It is gratifying that we have been successful in translating this economic growth into jobs growth.</P>
    <P>In recent years, employment has grown by a yearly average of 4 per cent.  This year we have exceeded that and have created an additional 95,000 jobs.  Unemployment has been halved from the 1993 level of 15.7 per cent to a current 7.8 per cent.  Proportionately, long-term unemployment has fallen even more dramatically &mdash; down from 9 per cent in 1993 to 3.9 per cent now.</P>
    <P>This provides the backdrop against which FÁS is working.  It is different from that which prevailed in the years immediately following the establishment of FÁS.  In the 15 years from 1975 to 1990, we barely matched the EU in economic growth and our employment performance lagged behind that of other member states.  Irish employment levels were falling for much of the 1980s and unemployment and emigration had reached critical levels by 1987-8.</P>
    <P>In the climate of the 1980s the overriding goal was to tackle the significant unemployment problem. <Col N="964" /> Fighting long-term unemployment and social exclusion in particular remains a key policy priority, but the context has changed.  The challenge now is not just to address the unemployment issue but also to ensure that our human resources and labour market policies support continued economic growth and rising living standards.</P>
    <P>Human resources fuel the engine of growth. We are moving into an era where, as the economist Paul Krugman put it, trade is becoming lighter. Old heavy industries are being supplanted by brainware businesses, such as software and electronics. For example, jobs in international services have trebled since 1990 from just under 10,000 to almost 30,000.  This transformation is taking place in the context of globalisation, which can be described as the increasingly free movement of goods, capital, information and ideas across national and continental boundaries.  All this creates threats and opportunities.</P>
    <P>On the upside, our commitment to education and training has helped us develop young people with the skills and flexibility to succeed in these new industries.  This is graphically illustrated by the increase in the numbers of people working in international services.  The skills of our workforce have been critical to the development of this sector and to our entire drive to secure foreign direct investment.  The downside is that many traditional sectors will face continuing competitive threats.  We are seeing that now in County Donegal. In addition, the pace of change in knowledge based industries is such that they too must constantly upgrade and adapt to survive.</P>
    <P>A second concern is that we will become victims of our own success.  The strength of manufacturing and international services can be encapsulated in the fact that we trade more than 140 per cent of our GNP.  The increased wealth and living standards which arise from this out-performance is driving a massive increase in domestic services demand.  People are spending more money on consumer goods and buying more domestic services.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue to grow, we need to have the human resource base which can respond to these demands across all sectors of the economy. Unless we can do this, we run the risk that the Celtic tiger will cannibalise itself.  We must, therefore, ensure that unemployed people are provided with pathways back to employment and with the skills to access them; that new labour market entrants have the right skills mix and that enterprise constantly upgrades its base of skills and competencies.  FÁS has played, and will continue to play, a key role in all these areas.</P>
    <P>It has been a major concern of the Government since it came to office to see FÁS focus on the needs of the long-term unemployed.  This is particularly important at a time of economic well being.  Probably for the first time in the history of the State it is within our grasp to redress the problem of structural unemployment, provided we pursue the right strategic mix of policies.  This <Col N="965" /> means we should increase participation by long-term unemployed and socially excluded persons in those programmes with the best employability outcomes, reduce participation in those programmes with poorer employability outcomes and enhance the training and progression element in those programmes.  We should increase the participation by long-term unemployed and socially excluded persons in specific skills training, reduce participation in community employment and enhance the progression and training element within community employment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has in excess of 80,000 active labour market programmes and supported employment programme places.  There is a ratio of one such place for every two persons in receipt of an unemployment payment and looking for a full-time job. This is a much greater quantum of support than envisaged in the 1995 report of the task force on long-term unemployment which provided much of the rationale for expansion of community employment in different employment circumstances. The Government has no intention of reducing such supports but it has the objective and the duty of refocusing such supports.</P>
    <P>FÁS and the economy do not operate in isolation. I have already mentioned globalisation and, in that context, we must have regard to the operation of labour markets in other countries and to the operation of the benefit and job broking functions.  This is particularly the case with regard to our EU partners.  Like the other member states, we have signed up to the EU employment guidelines and this is given effect by the adoption and implementation of a national employment plan each year over a five year time horizon.  The guidelines and the employment action plan represent a critically important development in Government policy on unemployment. For the first time we are adopting a policy of preventing people from falling into long-term unemployment as well as providing supports and progression to persons already long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are the key agents of delivery of the employment action plan.  The first phase of the systematic activation programme, dealing with 18 to 25 year olds approaching six months on the live register, came into operation on 1 September this year.  Under the programme, the persons concerned are provided with quality supports on the basis of individual need to help secure a job or other employability support as appropriate.  The intention is to extend the systematic activation programme to over 25 year olds approaching one year on the live register.</P>
    <P>It is too early to come to a definitive conclusion on the success of the activation programme but the initial results are promising.  For example, the position at the end of October 1998 of persons referred to FÁS in September is that almost 41 per cent, or 345 out of a total of 852, had signed off.  Of those interviewed by FÁS, 12 per cent <Col N="966" /> were in jobs and a further 30 per cent were in training or about to take this up.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the employment action plan requires significant resourcing of the placement service within FÁS and this has taken, and is taking, place.  Programme places have been ringfenced for the 18 to 25 year olds and a similar approach will need to be adopted for the over 25 year olds.  This will be in addition to the positive action programme on training for the long-term unemployed which aims to double participation by the long-term unemployed in mainstream training.</P>
    <P>As regards developments for the future, it is relevant to note the recommendations of a review of our public employment service by the OECD which was published earlier this month.  It makes the case for better linkages between FÁS, the local employment service and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  These trends are already under way in national policy. It also calls for proactive engagement with employers with regard to vacancies and for more frequent interviews with unemployed persons. The report calls for the scaling down of large scale job creation programmes in the public and community sector as the economy improves and for greater emphasis in programmes on progression to unsubsidised work and on job search supports.</P>
    <P>FÁS has shown itself to be flexible and responsive to labour market circumstances in the past through, for example, greatly increasing the proportion of women on both training and community employment from a low base to a point where there is parity of participation with men. Similarly, it has been possible to resource the drug strategy teams in part through FÁS.  I expect FÁS to be equally responsive both to supply and demand in the labour market in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a need for us to constantly review the needs of clients, job seekers and customers to see if we can respond to them in an imaginative way. It is this position of reflecting on how to deliver more targeted supports that is leading us to introduce a dedicated social economy programme from early next year.  This will replace an element of community employment with a programme which is more flexible from the point of view of the employer or sponsor and we hope it will develop economic activity in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>I reiterate a continuing commitment to a substantial community employment programme with a more focused element of progression for participants. The resources devoted to FÁS are vast; they will be substantially in excess of £400 million in 1999.  For that investment, it is critically important we get targeted programmes attuned to labour market conditions and responsive to the need for measures which tackle long-term unemployment and enhance social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The strategic direction of this policy approach is reflected in the budget.  In addition to supports for ongoing programmes, the budget saw 8,375 <Col N="967" /> additional active labour market programme places in targeted initiatives at a cost of £13.75 million.  These are directed at supporting the integration of groups at most remove from the labour market, such as over 35 year olds who have been unemployed for five years and lone parents.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to address them.  I regret I do not have time to speak for longer, but I appreciate the restraints on my time as Senators are anxious to get involved in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the fact that his presentation is very different to the FÁS report because it means that he recognises there are areas within the structure of FÁS that need to be restructured. He also said that over £400 million will be allocated to FÁS in 1999 so they can continue to do their work and diversify their activities in certain areas.  We must acknowledge that £479 million was spent in 1997 which was 9 per cent more than the 1996 figure of £43 million.</P>
      <P>FÁS has done what was most needed during the 1980s and the early 1990s but there is now a need for a big change.  I do not want to see glossy reports which give the impression that everything is rosy in the garden because we had a growth rate of 7 per cent per year from 1990 onwards and job increases in every sector of the economy. Unfortunately, I have witnessed cost increases in many areas, particularly in the construction industry where there is not enough skilled labour. I wonder why this is not happening even though we are spending almost £500 million or perhaps more indirectly.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde made very strong points.  In many ways we may think we are old fashioned but I do not.  I can get a doctor for £20 within ten minutes, I can get an accountant within an hour, I can see a dentist if I am prepared to pay £25 to put a filling in my tooth and I can also employ someone indirectly or from the black economy to look after my child if I require child care.

      <P>The Senator should not give the impression that this area is being looked after; it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State knows skilled people are not available in the general services area.  That is very worrying.  This is not emphasised but glossy reports are produced.  I welcome the section on the training sector.  That has helped many people and provided the facilities for people involved in the high technology area.  Are we training FÁS tutors?  Are the skills of FÁS trainers being upgraded?  In the old days teachers did not receive extra training and they lagged behind, but that was not their fault.  Unfortunately, I do not <Col N="968" /> have enough time to talk about facilities that are not available.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to community services and schemes.  We should be considering if we can provide these services for areas where there are real jobs.  There are many real jobs out there.  There are many real jobs available in the services sector, even the construction industry, and they are not being taken up.  There are vacancies in CERT, in the service areas such as hotels, restaurants, etc.  This problem is not just in Dublin.  Senator Ormonde correctly pointed out that there may be centralisation and the impression may be given that there are no problems elsewhere.  There are jobs available but people are not taking them up.</P>
    <P>There is a 40 per cent drop-out rate from FÁS schemes.  This is very serious.  Why is there not a proper relationship between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and FÁS? There should be more co-operation; there should be a proper linkage.  I know people who have gone to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs but they did not meet anyone who had worked in FÁS.  This is a very important point.  In my day everything was done in the one place.  You went to one place for a job, they told you if you got it and then you were referred back to them.  Now you get social welfare payments in one area and you get training, or a job, at another location.  Things are not as rosy as Senator Cox said.  The impression is given that you can go to a FÁS office and everything will be available but that is not happening in the Cork area I represent.</P>
    <P>When I talk to FÁS people I am left with the impression that they do not have the answers. They cannot provide what people are looking for and these people want to go to work.  The Minister of State said that between £400 million and £500 million will be spent this year.  Let us split the difference and say £450 million will be spent this year because £479 million was spent in 1997. We need to ask what are we getting in return for this outlay.  I am not saying there are no opportunities within FÁS but the way I see it the chairman and chief executive officer say they can provide facilities but at cost.  I do not think they are providing the skilled people who are badly needed.  Are we saying we are on top of the problem? I do not think we are.  Are we saying we can provide services for people in the private sector or in the services area?  There are many jobs available and not enough people to take them up. What is the answer?  How can we tell the public that we are in the process of spending £500 million but we still cannot provide the services or the people?</P>
    <P>I am delighted the percentage of long-term unemployed has decreased from 9 per cent to 3.2 per cent but it will still cost us £450 million to look after them this year.  Is that what we are saying? The cost should be reducing.  The problem is we have set up a structure and the people <Col N="969" /> involved will enhance what they are doing.  That is unfortunate in a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>FÁS did excellent work providing community services and community works schemes when there were no jobs available but that was filling in a hole just to empty it again.  FÁS continues to run these schemes but employers cannot get people to work for them.</P>
    <P>There is need for a big change.  We should not be afraid to change because if we do not the Celtic tiger could cannibalise itself and I would not like to see that happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for responding to this debate.</P>
      <P>I have always believed that the main reason FÁS has been able to create such a huge empire was due to the flow of European funding.  I am sure the Minister of State has been exercising his mind and that of his Department as to where the money will come from post 2000, what will happen to all the wonderful offices, all the personal structure that has been put in place and all its expertise.  I am sure the Minister will come out fighting when the occasion demands and will be able to maintain and continue the success story of FÁS in certain areas.  FÁS is a bit like the curate's egg in that the Minister of State's statement and FÁS themselves confirm that it has been remarkably successful in a variety of particular areas, especially the focused approach that it has taken over the past six months.</P>
      <P>I have often wondered why FÁS services have never been expanded to create what they started. For example, I was involved in the employment agency business in London for four or five years in the early 1970s.  I dealt mainly with professional Irish people seeking jobs in the banking and insurance sector.  One of the attractions of going through an employment agency is that one is given a one-to-one interview.  I had a professional qualification in that area, as did my colleagues. The advantage of this process is that one has the academic qualifications of the applicants available to them and, therefore, can develop their personalities.  I was in a position to find out what made the applicant tick and spend time with him or her to decide what type of job he or she should apply for.  As a member of a large group, one could use contacts to set up interviews.  This was a very successful process and many hundreds of Irish people passed through during my time in the agency.  I would like to think they were all successful subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe FÁS developed that type of system.  An attempt was made in the mid 1990s to establish a local employment service to incorporate the various local agencies, including FÁS. This included the education sector and those in the corporate sector who operated in the area in which the local employment service was being set up.  It would have involved an inclusive approach by all those concerned.  However, the concept did not get beyond the pilot stage.  It certainly did not get blanket coverage throughout the country and <Col N="970" /> it came under the Minister of State's Department. Perhaps he will reflect on the worth of that service in light of the changes that will inevitably take place in funding mechanisms and the conditions Europe will place on us in terms of how we use our money in the area of skills and employment post 2000.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the employment action plan, which reads as follows: &ldquo;The persons concerned are provided with quality support on the basis of individual need to help secure a job or other employability support as appropriate.&rdquo; Perhaps there is a need for further expansion in this area.  I am thinking of areas where people are fortunate to have jobs on tap and where there could be a correlation between local industry, the educational establishment and FÁS offices.</P>
    <P>I read with horror the report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul published in the last few days. We had a very successful budget &mdash; the Opposition must pick holes in any budget.  There were legitimate criticisms of certain aspects of budgetary policy.  This is only right because much needs to be done.  Nevertheless, the report came as a shock to me, given the unprecedented economic growth.  The biggest complaint, apart from the lack of adequate child care facilities, was about VRT &mdash; a row about affluence and cars.  Yet the Society of St. Vincent de Paul stated that it spent more than £16 million last year on the socially disadvantaged, dysfunctional families and the long-term unemployed.  The report stated that a significant number of people have difficulty finding employment because of family and personal problems and lack of proper skills.  Are those people falling through the net?  Are organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul discovering problems that FÁS and other State agencies are not?  Surely this needs to be addressed.  Perhaps organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul could become more involved in FÁS, rather than operating as a net-minder.  There are many other fine organisations, but I am quoting the Society of St. Vincent de Paul because it has a high profile and operates in almost every town and village.  In the context of this report, there is a great need to identify those individuals who could be given help to enhance their job skills or obtain new skills.  This would address some of the problems referred to in the report, but we will never be able to solve the problem in its entirety.</P>
    <P>This is a social issue as well as a sound economic argument.  People who, for whatever reason, do not have the personality or motivation to request help from State agencies and rely instead on organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul represent a loss to the economy.  They also contribute to the social problems in society. FÁS is doing other good work, not least the local community employment schemes.  Coming from Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, I must say that if community employment schemes were not sponsored by local voluntary organisations and local <Col N="971" /> authorities, a great deal of work would not be done.  There is a shift in focus in the Department which suggests these schemes should not be seen as little more than environmental clean-up schemes which contribute very little.  It is felt these people should be given managerial skills that would lead to other jobs.  What does one do in a rural environment where there are no other jobs, where the only option is to either stay in bed all day or go out and work in the interests of the community?  Consequently, I support the concept of community employment schemes.  These schemes have contributed to environmental enhancement, improved towns and villages and contributed enormously to the success of the tidy towns competition.  They provide a valuable social as well as a sound economic need.  I hope the Minister of State will not disband this service.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State's work in this area.  He has brought an individual style and philosophy to the job which will continue to bear fruit.  I wish him well.</P>

      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate because I am a fan of FÁS.  I am rather distressed that so far my colleague, Senator Ross, has not materialised.  I anticipated a certain division of opinion on this side of the House.  I have been reading some of the articles he wrote in the last year or so which consistently attacked FÁS. For example, he referred to the creation of fairyland, a place in which one would imagine I would feel quite at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Costello) Acting Chairman (Mr. Costello)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Acting Chairman drew attention to the fact that the Senator is not present.  I wish it could be removed from the record, but that is not possible, even with the assistance of a FÁS scheme.  However, the absence may not be permanent.  He might arrive and make an important contribution.  Perhaps he is listening.</P>
      <P>I know from reading Senator Ross's articles that he is concerned about waste in the system and no doubt, there is some waste. This is inevitable in an operation of this size.  Not everyone is as prudent as Members of this House.  It is worth putting on the record that I have access to figures, the details of which are confidential.  It is interesting to note that while FÁS made an important contribution to the industrial and commercial life of this country, nearly £80 out of every £100 goes directly to FÁS trainees as allowances, job subsidies or as wages and materials in community employment projects.  That point needs to be made up front so that people realise we are getting value for money from FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to laugh at these kinds of agencies as times and circumstances change.  I well remember an item on <i>The Pat Kenny Show</i> where somebody, <Col N="972" /> who may have been on a FÁS scheme, stated that they there being trained in how to apply for jobs.  I see by his expression that Senator Mooney appears to remember this one. There were not enough telephone instruments around so they were given a banana and an orange.  This may be an urban legend, it indicates a certain wry humorous approach to FÁS, but it is a deeply serious operation despite these comic remarks.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that it is a European requirement that we have an employment agency funded partly by the State and partly by European money.  Ireland has been pretty successful in its management of this kind of scheme to such an extent that a major European training centre in Trieste is run and managed by FÁS.  In other words, our European colleagues in training their trans-national operatives in this area feel that the Irish expertise is sufficient to be considered useful to run this particular enterprise in Trieste.</P>
    <P>Having read the annual report and the various other reports &mdash; in fact, there is so much material from FÁS that it is not possible to deal with all of it in eight minutes &mdash; I would say that the authority has proved itself to be responsive and flexible to the changing needs of the Irish labour market.</P>
    <P>There were times when community employment and FÁS schemes of various kinds were over-subscribed and the people involved were of a high calibre.  Now it is much more difficult if one is involved in community employment schemes because the employment situation has changed and a FÁS or CE scheme is no longer the first option for many young people.</P>
    <P>It is also useful to point out the manner in which FÁS has intervened in areas at times of high unemployment by providing the resources for individual entrepreneurs, co-operatives and local communities to develop and provide much needed jobs.  It has offered alternative routes back into gainful employment to those who, through no fault of their own, find that vacancies require a particular range of skills which are in short supply.  There is hardly a town, village or urban community which has not had experience of this.</P>
    <P>From my own experience, we have had a successful community employment scheme in the James Joyce Centre in North Great Georges Street.  We are grateful to FÁS for assisting us in this way.  We have noticed the changes.  We have noticed that it is now not always easy to get the right kind of recruits but that is a tribute to the energy of this economy and we have no complaints with it.  As chairman of the board of the Joyce centre, I would say that we have been constantly looking forward to the day when we will no longer be relying on the FÁS scheme.  It was enormously beneficial to us when we were starting up but the time is coming when we must rely much more on ourselves.  That is better for everybody in one sense because one of the difficulties <Col N="973" /> with FÁS schemes is that you have the person for a section of the week so you cannot slot the person into a schedule so easily.  There is not always that degree of consistency.  Then you get talented people and they must move on to something else. At least 50 per cent of our people went on within the allocated time to full-time paid employment in the community.  That is the triumph of the FÁS scheme but it also creates headaches for the sponsor.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, through its intensive and wide ranging programmes of well focused industrial training, FÁS is supplying the type of staff employers need while its traditional role of apprenticeships has been redefined and developed.  I understand there are a record 16,000 plus young people registered in the different phases of apprenticeship training.  This augurs well for the increasing skills demand in the construction industry and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, over the past few years it has been obvious that the construction industry did not have the kind of prophetic powers of FÁS.  It did not anticipate this boom.  FÁS anticipated the boom and produced the apprenticeship schemes. It is out looking for skilled people as is evident from the FÁS advertisements in the newspapers looking to bring people home from England.</P>
    <P>FÁS has recently enhanced its recruitment service with placement consultants availing of third level courses in modern placement and career guidance techniques.  FÁS placement service handles about 70,000 vacancies a year.  FÁS cooperates with its sister agency in the North of Ireland, the Training and Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>The remarkable round tower and peace park inaugurated by the President at Messines Ridge in Flanders in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and the King of the Belgians was built by FÁS people.</P>
    <P>By and large we must accept that FÁS has played a significant and vital role in the changing economy and has shown its capacity to anticipate these kinds of alterations in the economic structure. It continues to play a vital role with the apprenticeships and traineeships about which there is so much more to say than time allows.  It can be probably determined from these few words that I support FÁS and welcome the report.  Both partners in Government have played a significant role in strengthening this useful agency of State enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not improve on the compliment paid to FÁS by a local commentator and satisfied sponsor who said that if anything happened to FÁS, rural Ireland could close down. It is obviously an exaggeration but it is motivated by admiration and gratitude for the work FÁS has provided to so many local communities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every village and town we can find a landmark relating to FÁS.  It may be the restoration of a local historical building, the building of walls, the building of a community centre, the beautifying <Col N="974" /> of a town or landscaping.  There are so many things which we take for granted and we forget it was FÁS who made all those things possible.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons FÁS has been so successful is that most of its officials come from the real world of employment and business.  They do not arrive in the context of theory.  They understand the difficulties of keeping any project or business viable.  They understand the difficulties of finding trained people for jobs when they become available and they understand what it means to motivate.</P>
    <P>The image of FÁS has changed immensely since it came into existence with the merging of a number of agencies.  It no longer has an image of cutting nettles in graveyards &mdash; not that I object to that.  It has a much more progressive image because FÁS has been far seeing in regard to the changes which were taking place in social, sporting, cultural and community life.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to suggest that FÁS has not kept step with the changes in technology and new approaches to employment.  I have experience of a number of young people who have come through secretarial courses, for instance, and they would be quite well trained theoretically. However, they do not have the exposure to the work ethic and the responsibility which goes with occupying a post which is particularly important to them.  I have seen those people come through the computer course, take the examinations and receive City and Guilds certification.  Placement rates in these cases have been as high as 95 per cent.  If the quality of life has improved so much in those communities, and if we have become dependent on FÁS, what would happen if there is radical change, a diminution funding or an overhaul of the organisation?</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that local GAA and soccer clubs, cultural bodies and social services have become dependent on FÁS.  There should be an informed and lively debate on FÁS, but negative comments about the organisation generally relate to the amount of money involved &mdash; £400 million or £500 million &mdash; as if someone wants to centralise that money.  As a result of FÁS, the spin-offs of the Celtic tiger have been decentralised.  No other structure could be put in place which would ensure the smallest villages, towns, townlands, cities and rural Ireland would benefit.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting we should not keep pace with change.  However, it has been correctly mentioned that one of the difficulties is the availability of personnel.  This is a tribute to the Government and our economic standing. However, we cannot define this as progress on the one hand, while undermining that progress on the other.  We should look closely at the initial vision for FÁS and how it evolved.  Was it a reaction to demands for training?  Was it an overview of requirements at the time?  Was it a result of demands from local communities which required some means of subventing their work?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I know many dormant communities which, through the existence of training, community employment or response schemes, were energised and often united by the existence of FÁS facilities. How does one put a social value on that? FÁS is not given over to excessive red tape or constrained by the official bureaucracy of which some centralised agency are victims.  Were it not for that flexibility, it would be impossible to achieve much of what has been achieved.</P>
    <P>We talk in terms of 11 month training schemes. It is not correct to select an arbitrary number of months.  There is nothing sacrosanct about that figure.  I have seen young people with talent, ability and potential who would have benefited if there was flexibility with regard to the 11 month embargo.  In responding to this annual report, it is important that the House acknowledges the improvement in the quality of life in Ireland and the commitment of the entire FÁS organisation, and to encourage it in word, legislation and funding to ensure it can continue its work.</P>
    <P>I sound a note of warning.  I would be concerned if there was a radical overhaul or change in FÁS for the sake of it.  There is always a danger that the negative aspect of the organisation will float to the top and all the positive work would be taken for granted.  I cannot praise FÁS enough for its wonderful work at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>There was little said by Senator Ó Murchú with which I could disagree.  I support his remarks on the role of FÁS, particularly in rural life, and the contribution of community employment schemes to supporting voluntary and community organisations.  FÁS is a wonderful and highly successful organisation.  It is probably more successful than could ever have been envisaged when it was established and when the concept of the social employment scheme was mooted by Deputy Quinn as Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>The development of community employment schemes and their take-up is testimony that communities and voluntary and community organisations need support.  When they get that support from an agency as flexible, creative and imaginative as FÁS, and with such a brief, they put it to positive use.  There are monuments to this around the country &mdash; community centres, fabulous looking villages and heritage centres.  A huge body of work has been carried out by the partnership between FÁS and the community it serves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his fine speech.  We are discussing the annual report of FÁS which has a wide brief.  I was disappointed that the Minister of State did not spend more time discussing FÁS's brief concerning long-term unemployment.  Neither did he mention, to any great extent, the recommendations contained in the recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  I had to contact the Department to obtain a copy of this report even though the recommendations were published in the newspapers.  Journalists were briefed on the report, yet it was not circulated to <Col N="976" /> Members of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Department could take that into account.  It has a habit of leaking reports to journalists before publishing or circulating them.  In this case the report was not even circulated.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report is excellent in that it is highly analytical and well based.  I agree with a number of its recommendations, but disagree with others concerning the operation of community employment schemes.  It is extremely important at this stage of our economic prosperity to remind ourselves that the market is not king.  Feeding the Celtic tiger is important to our continued economic prosperity, but it is not the priority.  The priorities are people, the social fabric of society and communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the potential cannibalising effect of the Celtic tiger.  However, in constantly seeing the market as the first and major priority, we can easily loose sight of people's needs, particularly those of the long-term unemployed.  This thinking seems to underline the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, although that is hardly surprising given its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Despite our superb economic record, unparalleled job creation figures and an economy which is operating to the best of its ability, we still have long-term unemployment.  In every community, rural and urban, there are those who are not touched by economic prosperity and who, despite everything, are not in a position to get a job.  This is where the role of FÁS and its commitment to the long-term unemployed comes in, as does the Government's commitment to the long-term unemployed and our determination to ensure those who have not succeeded in getting work, through no fault of their own but because they were not well educated and were badly placed in terms of family circumstance, are not failed or forgotten.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is important to remember that long-term unemployment is due to poverty and exclusion and not to people sponging and not wanting to work.  The success of the community employment scheme and the fact that people want to get on the schemes show that people want to make a contribution to their local community and they want to work.  Over 80 per cent of the schemes are managed by voluntary committees. Without intervention, support and training, those who are low skilled &mdash; and the vast majority of long-term unemployed are &mdash; will never be in a position to get a job, particularly in the current market.  The Minister talked about the hi-tech economy.  People with no skills, training or support will never be in a position to get any of those jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a case for increased services for the long-term unemployed, particularly when we have a buoyant economy and the ability to invest in the long-term unemployed.  We should not wait for a period of high unemployment to do that. The response of successive Governments through FÁS in terms of meeting the needs of the unemployed, particularly long-term unemployed, has <Col N="977" /> been very valuable.  However, there is still a core group which we must constantly consider and ensure they are not made to feel they are left outside as spongers because they are not currently working.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a cut in intervention or training.  I would like to see greater assistance to the long-term unemployed.  The community employment scheme is one of the most effective ways of doing that.  I am concerned about the recommendation in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report to cut places.  I would like to ask the Minister if that recommendation is being taken on board.  Is the number of people on schemes being cut?  Are county councils and local authorities being told not to use these schemes in the future?  The report recommended that under 25 year olds should not participate in schemes.  Is that recommendation also being implemented?  It is too easy to say they should get training.  Someone living in Borrisokane or Borrisoleigh is a long way from a training centre in Limerick and getting there would not be easy.  This is an issue in rural communities and it should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very good recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  Perhaps the Minister could let me know if the recommendations are being implemented and if an announcement will be made in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also offer my support for and acknowledge the contribution of FÁS to society. I have listened to other speakers and there are a number of points to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  Some are slight criticisms and others are very positive.</P>
      <P>An extremely important aspect of FÁS is the part it plays in the housing aid for the elderly scheme.  This is administered through health boards but the work is actually carried out by FÁS.  It has low funding.  In my county there are unfortunately hundreds of people on a waiting list.  The foremen and workers are from FÁS. There are two teams in my county.  Unfortunately the numbers were cut so that where we had three teams carrying out the work, there are now two. The scheme is for those who have contributed so much and get so little back.  Many elderly people are prepared to pay for the work.  FÁS carries out the work and provides training for those involved.  It may be slower than a contract worker but in the long term it provides employment and it provides an essential service and comfort for elderly people.  Due to the way FÁS is changing, unfortunately people such as the elderly are left behind.  I fully support the work it does but I criticise the number of people involved in the scheme being reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes we forget the role the FÁS community employment scheme plays in our education system.  Schools get classroom assistants, caretakers and secretarial assistants through FÁS. We forget the value of their role.  At this stage we have become totally dependent on them.  They are not assistants but an integral part of our education <Col N="978" /> system.  I am sure this was not originally intended.  In some cases this is being reduced because it was not initially intended to be their role.  However they have become an essential part.  With a shift in the role of FÁS, I would not like to see such services being reduced in the education system.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have quite rightly stated that FÁS is part of the nuts and bolts of local communities. Small rural areas are totally dependent on it.  Twenty or 30 years ago all work carried out in local communities was voluntary.  Local halls were built and football fields were prepared by voluntary work.  Unfortunately there is no such thing as voluntary work in any community now. As a result, we are totally dependent on those who carry out work under FÁS community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>In my home town, those involved in this work take great pride in it.  We are living in a booming Celtic tiger economy and everybody wants to have high power jobs with big titles, but the work on the ground which copperfastens the community spirit is disregarded.  Sometimes we forget its important value.  Every tidy town and football club relies on the work carried out by FÁS and the pride those people take in it.</P>
    <P>On community employment schemes, the Minister stated that 96 per cent of those participating are long-term unemployed.  These people were forgotten by society and were not really wanted. Often they left school early and did not have the education, skills, self-confidence and self-belief to push themselves forward for any job.  In this day and age there is no scarcity of work but often they do not have the confidence to put themselves forward. FÁS has been very important in getting these people back into the frame of mind to work.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in people working for their money.  It does not matter whether they are painting the seats in the local village or, as another Senator stated, cutting the nettles in the local graveyard.  It does not matter what they do.  I firmly believe that if people work for their money, they appreciate it all the more.  That is the idea behind the FÁS community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>Although one hears negative things about FÁS, it is important to remember that often those involved, particularly the long-term unemployed, never had a chance at any other work.  This gives them a start and makes them confident.  They are recognised for their skills.  They may not be academically minded, but through training they have developed skills and shown potential.  They are recognised by employers and often go a great deal further than someone with a number of degrees or letters after their name.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of FÁS, which has done terrific work in rural communities and urban areas. However, the only aspect of FÁS of which I have a slight criticism relates to mothers in the home. They are discriminated against as they are not considered long-term unemployed.  Many mothers working in the home are not aware they <Col N="979" /> can sign on for credits and that they may be entitled to enrol on schemes.  Women's groups are being set up around the country to give a service to women in the home.  FÁS is discriminatory towards women in training and recruiting.</P>
    <P>I welcome the annual report of FÁS.  It has changed a great deal with the times.  With our tiger economy we sometimes forget that basic jobs have to be done, regardless of how affluent is society.  In that regard, FÁS makes an amazing contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  I compliment FÁS on the work it has done through the years.  One of the criticisms I have is that it did not go far enough with its training programme in earlier days when we were looking for trained people.  Twenty years ago I started a community scheme of four old folks' homes in my village, which are now a credit to our parish.  It took us a great deal of time to convince FÁS that this scheme would be practical in training young people in carpentry, blocklaying, plastering, etc.  I am glad to say this scheme has progressed and has gone from strength to strength.</P>
      <P>I would be critical of the restrictions in FÁS where a young person developing a skill must be taken on by an employer.  While that is understandable, in a rural area in some trades, particularly electrical, carpentry and blocklaying, employers are reluctant to train young people as they feel that as soon as they are trained they will be competing with existing contractors.  There is a lack of skilful people in the labour market.  FÁS should have been helping to train people. Younger builders would encourage competition in the market which would be very beneficial.</P>
      <P>I have experience in one field in particular.  It is virtually impossible to get a fitter at the moment.  At the same time, it is virtually impossible for a young person to get an employer to take them on as a fitter.  We are now bringing fitters into the country.  Semi-State bodies, such as the ESB and Iarnród Éireann, take on a few young people every year.  They should be taking on more young people and training them as fitters, toolmakers or whatever skills are needed.  At the end of their four or five years' training, the company would not be obliged to take them on unless a vacancy arose.  At least they would be trained to move elsewhere.</P>
      <P>For example, it is virtually impossible for a young person to train in the electrical trade unless they get a sponsor.  Every day there are advertisements seeking commis chefs with two or three years' experience.  Once they have that experience, employers are anxious to take them on. However, they will not take them on to train them initially.  FÁS should take people on for a year or a year and a half to give them basic training without needing a sponsor.  I look forward to that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be more improvement and expansion of FÁS training schemes in local authority <Col N="980" /> areas.  They have been successful.  Many communities have changed their image as a result of FÁS schemes.  The appearance of towns has improved and they have better footpaths and entrances.  A great deal more work can be done in this area.  More flexibility should be given to local authorities to try to secure more FÁS training schemes.</P>
    <P>There should also be expansion in the area of renovating old homes for people who live alone or who qualify for disabled person's allowance.  It is now virtually impossible to get contractors to do any of this work.  FÁS should get grants to do this work and take on young people to help. Contractors are shying away from smaller jobs which cost £4,000 to £8,000.  However, these benefit the old and needy we should be supporting.</P>
    <P>FÁS has played a leading part in developing community centres.  I compliment and congratulate it on that.  I would like the Minister and the Government to look at the expansion of semi-State bodies so they can take on more trainees, particularly in toolmaking, fitting and the electrical trade.  Many young people cannot get sponsors and have to travel vast distances &mdash; sometimes 250 miles &mdash; for someone to take them on.</P>

      <P>This has been an excellent debate and there have been a number of valuable contributions. If they are taken in the manner in which they were made, there is a great deal of helpful information for FÁS.  Knowing how responsive it is to constructive criticism and new ideas, it will probably react well.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde suggested the regionalisation of the career guidance, planning and employment exhibition.  That is an excellent idea and I hope something will be done about it in the future.  As regards the apprenticeship schemes, there has been a massive increase in numbers to more than 13,000 places this year.  Training is substantial and consistent.  Thirty weeks training is provided by FÁS and further substantive training is provided in institutes of technology.  A new framework has been put in place to provide a flexible approach to apprenticeships.  We need to get skilled people into the labour market faster. This is one of the reasons for the changes in the framework and the manner in which we are providing training.  People will become available to work much sooner.</P>
      <P>The idea of preventative maintenance for people who are long-term unemployed tries to address the issue at the beginning rather trying to fix the problem after a person has been on the live register for four, five, six or seven years.  Substantial measures are being introduced for those over 25 years of age and who are heading towards one year on the register.  The Tánaiste announced some of those measures recently.  We are becoming more proactive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, there will be a small reduction in the number of CE places planned for 1999 from about 39,000 to 40,000 to around 37,500.  It would be unfair to say <Col N="981" /> this reduction attacks opportunities for the long-term unemployed.  As the Minister said, it is a measure which refocuses the resources of FÁS on schemes with better employability prospects.  At the end of the day, the objective of any scheme is to address the issue of the long-term unemployed and to facilitate and encourage them to get back into the work environment so they feel they are making a contribution and are getting paid for it.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste secured an additional £0.5 million for FÁS to enable it to employ more placement officers.  Some £2.5 million is being provided to facilitate 4,800 new job club places for the long-term unemployed; £4.35 million is being provided for 1,500 new places on bridging programmes for the long-term unemployed while £4.9 million is being provided to create 875 new places on the jobs initiative.</P>
    <P>Some £1.8 million is being provided to create 800 new places on a specially tailored training programme for lone parents.  Lone parents carrying the burden of bringing up a family on their own need special help and assistance in getting back into the workforce.  It is only by getting back into the workforce that they will be able to provide the type of upbringing they would like for their children and perhaps ensure their children do not end up unemployed and unable to get into the labour market.  Some £0.2 million has been announced to facilitate the provision of 400 new job club places for lone parents in the FÁS regions of Dublin North and Dublin West.  All these initiatives underline the commitment of the Government and the Tánaiste to addressing long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>A Member mentioned the need for big changes in FÁS.  FÁS is an organisation which has enjoyed big changes.  It is very flexible and adaptive and we can see how it has changed.  FÁS is training the trainers and it has a good programme which sets the standard for many training organisations to follow.</P>
    <P>A number of Members mentioned CERT.  It is important to point out that CERT comes under the auspices of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and maybe we need to look at whether it should be under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That is an issue for consideration at another time.  The Minister of State indicated his willingness to come back to discuss this subject in further detail and perhaps we will take him up on it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we can debate the Deloitte &amp; Touche report when it is published in the manner in which this debate has taken place.  It has been a very constructive and progressive debate and has rightly given credit where it is due.  These measures and Members' ideas are certainly welcome. It has been a great debate and I commend the motion to the House.  I thank Members for taking part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government direct the local authority, Dublin Corporation, to issue a special amenity order for the Tolka River Valley. As the Minister of State knows, Dublin is delightfully situated with the sea one side, the mountains on the other and rivers and canals. There are over 20 rivers in the city of Dublin, some of which are underground.  The canals have been the subject of a special task force under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  A study was done on the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal and they are now in the process of implementing the findings of that study and survey.  Much work will be done upgrading and maintaining the canals.</P>
      <P>The River Liffey is the largest river in the city and the Fingal local authority is looking for a special amenity order for the River Liffey valley as well &mdash; and I am sure it will be successful in getting that matter resolved.  The second largest river in the city is the Tolka River which is unique in that it is the only river in the city of Dublin which has a river valley.  The River Liffey valley is outside the city but the Tolka River Valley is within the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation. There are panoramic views from Cabra to the Navan Road between the Royal Canal and the Tolka River.  It is a very fine wild scene in terms of the beauty of the river valley.  The river runs through Cabra, Glasnevin, Drumcondra past Richmond Road to Ballybough and into the sea at the East Wall and Clontarf, the area in which the Vikings were supposedly defeated in 1014.</P>
      <P>We want to ensure the work is done to prepare for the special amenity order and that the order is granted.  It is three or four years since a request was first made by councillors to the local authority that a special amenity order be prepared.  I understand some work has been done by the local authority but we are frustrated that it is taking so long.  I understand the special amenity order for Howth Head was issued very quickly.  It is difficult to understand why we must spend so long doing the scoping and the preparatory work to present to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in preparation for this particular special amenity order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the Tolka River Valley is wild, agricultural land and has not been developed.  Residents in the area had hoped that stretch of the Tolka River would be developed as a millennium project. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful last Monday with the casting vote of the chairman, <Col N="983" /> the Lord Mayor of Dublin, in getting the land retained in its existing zoning, which was agricultural, where it could have been developed.  There is a huge amount of land which could be developed and there is still scope for a millennium project to be developed on the site.</P>
    <P>There are a number of millennium projects in Dublin, all of which are comprised of bricks and mortar, so this would be the only one which would have green grass and would act as a green lung for the city.  It would be a facility for citizens which would add to their enjoyment of life.  It would be an ideal area for the development of nature trails, trekking and picnic areas and the possible development of an interpretative centre, an equestrian centre and an organic farm.</P>
    <P>However, little can be done unless there is some protection, the best of which is the issuing of a special amenity order.  Perhaps the Minister could direct Dublin Corporation to complete the work and grant such an order for the Tolka Valley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, regrets he is unable to be present in the House and has asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>A planning authority may make a special amenity area order &mdash; SAAO &mdash; under section 42 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, declaring a specified area to be of special amenity by reason of its outstanding beauty, special recreational value or the need for nature conservation.  Such an order may state the planning authority's objectives regarding the preservation or enhancement of the character or special features of the area, including objectives for the prevention or limitation of development in it.  The making of an SAAO is a reserved function.</P>
      <P>Where a local authority decides to make an SAAO, it must publish in a newspaper circulating in its area its decision to make the order indicating the area to which the order relates, where it may be viewed with any relevant maps and specifying the period, not less than one month, during which objections may be made against it.  All SAAOs require confirmation by the Minister. Every confirmation order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within 21 sitting days, the order shall be annulled.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government may direct a planning authority under section 42(1A) of the 1963 Act to make an SAAO for a particular area within its functional area.  However, it is primarily a matter for the planning authority to consider the making of an SAAO, given its responsibility for deciding land use policies in its area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> The power given to the Minister to direct a planning authority to make special amenity area orders is one which has been used very sparingly by Ministers over the years and only where special circumstances applied.  Ministers have issued such directions on only two occasions over the 35 years since the 1963 Act came into operation. The Minister is not aware of any circumstances bearing on the Tolka Valley lands which would cause him to consider taking the action sought by the Senator or intervene in the city council's business of providing for the proper planning and development of its area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for answering the series of letters sent him recently on this subject; I had raised the issue before sending them.  It is an urgent matter and I will give reasons the Castletroy area should have a Garda station and a Garda presence based there.</P>
      <P>It is an area of expanding population.  The greater Castletroy area has roughly 20,000 people which, when compared to Nenagh, Newcastlewest or any other town in the mid-west region which has a Garda station, means it also should have one.  The population will continue to grow and the projection is that it will double by the year 2010.  The population is young because the University of Limerick is in the area and has 10,000 students and 600 staff.</P>
      <P>The matter came to a head two weeks ago when I was invited as a local representative to a meeting in the university with the local superintendent, local residents and the president of the university.  There had been six attacks on young people which were not within the confines of the university but in the suburban area adjoining the Dublin road.  They were serious because they were on young men as well as young women and on foreign students as well.  The meeting was held because students, especially young female students, were fearful for their safety in walking to and from the university.</P>
      <P>As a result, the president improved the lighting within the campus and is installing cameras.  The county council, of which I am a member, is ensuring all lights within surrounding housing estates are checked and replaced, if necessary, by the ESB, because we felt we had to show our support for greater security.  While the attacks were not within the confines of the university, the president felt so strongly about them, he spent approximately £240,000 improving security and safety in the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern is with what happens outside the college.  Apart from the university, there is a huge young population in the national technological park, known locally as Plassey.  For example, Dell has shift workers coming and going throughout the night, a significant number of whom are young women.  Some excellent work has been done by the local superintendent and the local community garda, Séamus O'Neill.  The recently <Col N="985" /> appointed university president, Dr. Downer, intends writing to the Minister, as do students. The area has high technology industrial development which needs security.  Local residents, of whom I have not yet spoken, are also extremely concerned.  The area has businesses, including three banks, so it is crying out for a Garda station. There has been a huge increase in the number of new cars and there is tremendous traffic on the N7, which is the gateway to the mid-west.</P>
    <P>When the issue was to the forefront and the emphasis was on dealing with the attacks, additional gardaí were redeployed from the city out to Castletroy, something the superintendent and local community garda obviously welcomed. However, when gardaí are relocated from the city to Castletroy, it obviously depletes force numbers in the city and that is unsustainable.  The concern is that, if a guarantee is given for an increased Garda presence in the area, it means they will be taken from the city.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries and found that, between 1990 and 1991, the Garda strength in the city appears to have fallen.  There has been a decrease in the Limerick area overall and any further decrease because of an increased presence in Castletroy will interfere with the support the city needs.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister cannot produce a Garda station tomorrow morning, but we have reached crisis point.  The matter is extremely urgent.  It is in the Minister's interest to have a crime-free city and to ensure people have a good quality of life.  I have been receiving representations on this matter for a long time and they have increased as a result of the most recent attacks.  I know local gárdaí, from the newest recruit to the Chief Superintendent, are behind me in seeking a Garda station in Castletroy.  In the local authority's view there would not be a problem in obtaining a site or getting planning permission.  The area is developing rapidly and the most centralised sites will not be available later.  We must take action now.  I appeal to the Minister to respond positively on this matter and to give me a specific date for the building of a Garda station in our area.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for her contribution to this important issue.  I favour informed discussion on all issues, particularly those that can have a significant bearing on people's lives.  I am also conscious, as is the Garda Commissioner, of the many demands on existing resources and the continuous need to improve and enhance policing service where possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman has written to me about the establishment of a garda station in Castletroy.  I sought a report from the Garda authorities in this regard as they are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel to particular areas. I held off responding to the Senator pending receipt and consideration of this report.  I am still awaiting the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have, however, <Col N="986" /> informed me that Castletroy is situated in the Garda district of Limerick city north.  Policing of that area is divided between the Garda sub-districts of Henry Street and Castleconnell.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the records for 1996 indicate a population of 8,256 persons.  This figure does not take into account a population of 8,000 third level students from Limerick University &mdash; 90 per cent of whom are resident in the Castletroy area for 36 weeks of the year.  I also understand the area has a very low unemployment level.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with crime figures for the Henry Street and Castleconnell Garda sub-districts from 1995 to 31 October 1998.  The statistics in relation to Henry Street show that a total of 1,708 offences were reported in 1995, 635 of which were detected.  These offences include offences against the person, burglary, robbery, larceny, forgery and others.  There were 1,633 offences reported in 1996, 596 of which were detected; 1,303 were reported in 1997, with 555 being detected and 1,255 reported to the end of October this year, with 534 being detected.  The percentage detection rate increased from 37 per cent in 1995 to 43 per cent in 1998.  The statistics in relation to Castleconnell show a much lower level of crime. A total of 58 offences were reported in 1995, 19 of which were detected.  These offences include offences against the person, burglary, larceny, forgery and others.  There were 61 offences reported in 1996, with 23 being detected; 63 were reported in 1997, with 30 being detected and 60 were reported to the end of October this year, with 23 being detected.  The staffing strength of Henry Street Garda station is 160.  This figure includes chief superintendent, superintendent, inspector, sergeants and gardaí.  One sergeant and three gardaí are assigned to Castleconnell.  I have a more detailed breakdown of the statistics referred to with me and I will make them available to the Senator if she so wishes.</P>
    <P>Castletroy is policed by gardaí drawn from Henry Street and Castleconnell subdistricts.  A second community garda was assigned to the area in July 1998.  Following a meeting with local representatives, the strength was increased further to one sergeant and five gardaí between the hours of 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. This was subsequently reduced to four gardaí, including two community gardaí, as a result of a quietness in the area. Mobile patrols, both plain clothes and uniform, are also on constant patrol in the vicinity.  I understand that neighbourhood watch, business watch and campus watch schemes also operate in Castletroy.</P>
    <P>This week Garda strength in the area has been increased to six gardaí, including two community gardaí as the students are celebrating the festive season.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the matter is being monitored constantly and that the needs of the Limerick division will be considered in conjunction with divisions throughout the country when resources next become available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> The Garda authorities have also advised me that research is currently being undertaken regarding the feasibility of establishing a Garda station at Castletroy.  The results of this study are not yet available.  In the circumstances, it would be remiss of me to make any judgment or decision in advance of completion of this research.  I can, however, say that the results will be forwarded to me together with the Commissioner's views as soon as they are available.  I will then be in a position to make a decision and respond further to the Senator.  In the interim, I am prepared to take into account any further views or observations which Senator Jackman would like to make on this matter.</P>
