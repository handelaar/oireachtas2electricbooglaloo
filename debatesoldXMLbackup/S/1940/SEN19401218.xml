      <P>The orders which this Bill seeks to confirm are seven in all. Four of these orders, Nos. 209 to 212, inclusive, are orders which were made arising out of the agreement which was arrived at between our cotton manufacturers here and cotton manufacturers in Great Britain, whereby the reference to the Prices Commission under the London Agreement of 1938 in respect of the protective and quantitative restrictions on the import of cotton goods was withdrawn.  As result of this withdrawal an arrangement was made by which a certain portion of our market here, which formerly had been supplied by imported materials, was reserved to British cotton manufacturers, while, at the same time, our own cotton manufacturers received assurances in regard to supplies of raw materials which will be beneficial not only to them but to the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the orders, notably Orders Nos. 209, 210 and 211, provide for a reduction in the preferential rates of <Col N="2626" /> duty, that is to say, in the effective rates of duty.  The former duty in respect of these orders was, in general, at the rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with, in some cases, a specific duty of 4d. per square yard on articles covered by the order.  In the case of Order No. 209, the duty falls upon bed ticken, bed mattress cloths, bed sheeting of a width not less than 48 inches, shirting and pyjama materials which were not less than four ounces in weight per squares yard and which were without pattern and colour, and cloth for the manufacture of dungarees and similar protective garments for men which is not less than four ounces in weight per square yard, all of these being woven piece goods containing not less than 60 per cent. cotton.  The new duty in the case of these articles is at the general rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 20 per cent. in the case of products of the United Kingdom and Canada.</P>
    <P>The same rates duly apply to the cloths covered by Order No. 210, which refers to woven piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. cotton and not exceeding ten ounces in weight per square yard.  In the case of Order No. 211, there has been a modification in the duty, but, in the case of certain materials covered by this order, there was formerly no specific duty, that is to say, there was no minimum duty as in the other cases of 4d. per square yard.  There was a duty of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> on woven piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. cotton and again of a weight not less than four and not more than ten ounces per square yard, but, in these cases, the goods covered by the order had a pattern woven in colour and also were used in the manufacture of shirts and pyjamas.  The new duty in the case of Order No. 211 will be at the rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential duty of 20 per cent. in the case of United Kingdom and Canadian products.</P>
    <P>Order No. 212 imposes a duty of 45 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 30 per cent. in the case of <Col N="2627" /> products from the United Kingdom and Canada on woven piece goods containing, as before, more than 60 per cent. of cotton and not exceeding ten ounces in weight per square yard.  The articles concerned in this case are not chargeable with the duty imposed by Orders Nos. 209, 210 or 211.  Order No. 213 imposes a duty of 60 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preference rate of 40 per cent. in the case of the United Kingdom or Canada, on piece goods not chargeable with the duty imposed by any of the emergency orders I have cited&mdash;Orders Nos. 209, 210, 211 and 212.  The goods covered by Order 213 are woven piece goods, cotton or union piece goods consisting of a combination of two or more fibres such as cotton, flax, jute and artificial silk.  The materials covered by the order were formerly liable to a duty of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  It will be seen that, so far as these orders are concerned, the effective duty remains the same but, in order to give a preference to goods of United Kingdom or Canadian origin, the general rate of duty is increased to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 214) Order, 1940, imposes a duty on linen piece goods as follows&mdash;linen piece goods which are terry or are the type used in the manufacture of dungarees or similar protective garments for wear by men, bed sheets, ticken or mattresses.  The duty imposed is at the rate of 40 per cent., or 4d. per square yard.  All other linen piece goods carry a general duty at the rate of 40 per cent. without the specific duty of 4d. per square yard.  There is in this case, as in the other cases, a preference in favour of goods produced in the United Kingdom or Canada to the extent of 20 per cent.  Originally, the linen piece goods were liable to duty under Order No. 131 of 1937.  This order also applied to cotton and union piece goods.  The Revenue Commissioners have expressed the view that it would facilitate their administration of their duties if there were a separate order in respect of linen piece goods.  Order No. 214, which we are now making, is merely in substitution of the remanent <Col N="2628" /> part of the original Order No. 131, which would remain after the modification of the duties on cotton piece goods to which I have referred.  Order No. 215 imposes a duty at the rate of 37½ per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 25 per cent., on candles, tapers and night lights.  There was formerly a duty of 30 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> with a preferential rate of 10 per cent. in the case of the United Kingdom and Canada and 20 per cent. in favour of other Commonwealth countries.  In addition to the duty, there was a quantitative restriction, but that quantitative restriction has now been removed and the import of candles and night lights is no longer subject to quotas.  Instead, as I have said, our home manufactures are being afforded the increased tariff protection for which Order No. 215 provides.</P>

      <P>The Senator is, perhaps, unaware that the new duties, with the removal of the quantitative restriction, have been imposed in consequence of a decision made by the Prices Commission and that, under the statute and under Article 8 of the London Agreement, all we are empowered to do is to implement the decision of the Prices Commission in that regard. Whether I had made the necessary inquiries or not&mdash;I hope the Senator will not ascribe to me responsibility for investigating all the allegations, sometimes baseless, made by interested parties in either House in these matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to learn from the Minister what benefits he considers these modifications are likely to confer.  He said that the implementation of this London Agreement was going to allow certain raw materials to come in on a new basis and that that would confer benefits on the public.  I do not know how anybody, unless he was an expert in the trade, could assess the implications of all these duties.  The code of regulations governing trade is now as complicated as the code governing income-tax. We have a very large and highly expert staff of officials operating these duties.  I see, incidentally, that we are erecting a new palace of torment up the street in which a further lot of officials is to be housed.  That is by the way.  I ask the Minister to stand apart from the picture and not view it merely in the light of these current matters that come before him from day to day.  Is he, or is his Government, satisfied with the general trend of this tariff policy?  Almost the major test is the effect of this policy on the ordinary, humble consumer&mdash;the man who is having difficulty in making ends meet. If you relate that to any official figures, you get a growing increase in the cost of living.  To put it in general terms, for some years the &ldquo;spread&rdquo; between Northern Ireland and Eire was about 12 per cent.  That is the increase on the 1914 basis of account.  Next year, so far as figures can be forecasted at all&mdash;because the cost of living is based on the average of the previous year&mdash; there is going to be a spread in the region of 20 per cent.  That appears to be largely due to increases on nonfood products.  The trend of food products, from the published figures, appears to be somewhere in the region of 180 to 183, whereas the total index figure is in the region of 206.  It seems as if this country would be very fortunate if it escapes with less than a 16 <Col N="2630" /> per cent. rise in the cost-of-living figure.</P>
      <P>All that is very serious and I ask the House to say that it calls for a general overhaul of the whole of our tariff policy.  I am afraid we are drifting into a state of acquiescence and satisfaction in regard to the whole of these trends.  Periodically Ministers do say that industry must show efficiency and those who do not show efficiency will be asked why, but the public see little or no definite move in that direction. I ask the Minister whether he would not consider a graduating and decreasing scale in the rates of protection afforded.  The theory of the whole of this tariff policy was that high rates of protection were required to put these infant industries on their feet and as they got on their feet that they would be able to stand an increasing measure of outside competition and be able to do with less protection.  There is no evidence of that, whatever, that I can see.  I would ask the Minister whether he has considered the case of industries which are not taking full advantage of the rate of protection afforded, and industries which have not put up their prices to the full extent of the protection they are afforded?  These are general remarks, I know, but the real seriousness of this matter is on general terms, not specific.  I am profoundly dissatisfied with the whole trend of our tariff policy as it affects the consumer and the poor man.  Large sections of capital have been placed in a privileged position and it is the duty of the Government to examine from time to time how those people discharge their responsibility to the public and, if necessary, to remove the protection that is afforded to inefficient industries. I am sorry to periodically raise this question in the House, but this is the only constitutional opportunity one has and, although I am very doubtful that anything will ever be done, I feel, as a public representative, that it is my duty on every occasion to call attention to the dangers that are involved in the whole of this reckless policy of protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters which are covered by these orders are practically <Col N="2631" /> the same as those with which I dealt at considerable length a few weeks ago. I do not propose, therefore, to follow on the lines on which I spoke then, but there are one or two points made by Senator Sir John Keane to which I would like to refer.  In the first place, it is not my function here to defend the Minister or to defend the Government, but I do not think there is anyone engaged in the manufacturing industry who would for one moment agree with Senator Sir John Keane when he says that nothing is being done with regard to keeping prices as low as possible.  If there were any complaint it would be rather that too much is being done and that some of it is not being done in the wisest or the best way.  As the Minister pointed out, all these orders may be taken together except the last one, because the two that are not specifically part of the agreement are simply re-enacting the position as it was before in regard to linen goods which were combined with cotton previously.  As to the benefit to the community, I would say, with a good deal of intimate knowledge, that there is a very definite benefit.  In the first place a larger quantity of a lesser number of goods will be made here with, I think, in that case every probability of an easement in price.  I have had occasion during the past six months to compare cotton goods with Manchester and&mdash;I think it may be to some extent due to war conditions&mdash; the fact is that the margin by which the prices are higher here is very much less than it was 12 months ago.  Prices are higher in both places because of war conditions, but the margin is definitely less.  I say that after pretty careful examination and with certainty that I know what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane also pleaded for a general revision.  It is not easy, without speaking for possibly two or three hours on every detail, to satisfy the House in respect to a rather complicated agreement, but the fact is that it is a simplification of what existed before, and it does represent a general revision in consultation between all the cotton manufacturers here and representatives <Col N="2632" /> of cotton manufacturers on the other side who were very much concerned to see that their interest was looked after and that they would get a fair share of the trade.  But the principle was accepted that where goods could be made here and could be made at a reasonable price and according to a standard, it was the essence of the Eire-British Trade Agreement that the goods should be made here, but equally it was the essence of that agreement that in the case of goods not being made here, there should be a British preference for goods of this character.  This was an attempt&mdash;I think a successful attempt&mdash;on the part of two groups of manufacturers to carry out what they believed to be the spirit of the agreement in a way which would be mutually beneficial.  The public were also benefited.  This is a matter on which I do not feel free to speak with too much detail in public for pretty obvious reasons, but the arrangements which were made with regard to supplies have enabled an industry employing about 3,000 people here to continue up to the present and, as far as we can see, for a considerable distance ahead, with adequate supplies. Anyone in industry knows how extremely difficult it is at the present time for some manufacturers to obtain supplies.  They realise that to maintain an industry of that kind with supplies is of considerable benefit to the industry and also to the public.  If you had a number of persons, even half that number, suddenly thrown on the labour market at the moment, it would be a very serious matter indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, I am afraid, has such an inveterate horror of tariffs that it blinds him to the real national advantage of the tariff policy.  It would be absolutely impossible for this country to remain in industry at all were it not for tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Even tariffs as high as 50 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that.  For a country such as this, beginning industrial life, with practically no experience, <Col N="2633" /> it is absolutely essential to have even a prohibitive tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these industries have had experience.  Some of these industries have had at least eight years' experience now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight years' experience now, admittedly, but even eight years' experience is nothing compared with the experience of the competing countries.  Let us look at the national advantage.  Senator Douglas has just told us that these industries engaged in the cotton trade are giving employment to probably 3,000 people.  We, in common with other countries, have a vast unemployment problem and anything that keeps 3,000 of our people at work is surely worth a sacrifice on the part of the people as a whole.  If we ask the people of this country to pay what Senator Douglas has told us is, after all, a comparatively small difference in price, it is well worth it to the Irish people.  Then we should realise that we have a body watching these people.  We have the Prices Commission.  That surely will see that there is no chance of any industry profiteering at the expense of the people.  I think, on the whole, we should be satisfied that every effort is being made to safeguard the people from being overcharged while protecting what are only infant industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I omitted which is of considerable importance. It is this: except where there is quantitative restriction, any industry here which makes a practice of charging the full British price or the price at which a thing could be bought outside, plus the tariff, is bound to fall. You cannot do it.  If it is continued it means you will be beaten because from time to time there will be cheap lines, clearance lines, and various quantities offered and actually the goods will come from outside and the public will buy them in preference.  I know that from being a member of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, and I can speak of the general experience.  The price must be well below the price for which it can be bought outside, together with the tariff, if they are going to carry on.</P>

    <Col N="2634" />
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to butt in on this matter, because I have no expert knowledge, but my own experience satisfies me that wide, general statements, such as those made by Senator Goulding, can be very misleading&mdash;and I think even Senator Douglas's statement is.  My own experience has relation to a number of things manufactured in this country and I suggest that it would be more economical to pay the tariff on an imported article. I am not now generalising; I am merely giving instances of which I have personal experience.  I find that after buying a certain article made here, making every allowance for the fact that in this country industries are just being established, and so on, one is constantly obliged to renew it.  In such circumstances it is practically impossible to compare prices with imported articles.  One knows that if the two prices are, roughly, the same, by buying the imported article, on which a tariff has been imposed, one is giving money to the Government and reducing taxation generally.  If there are 3,000 people employed in a business, Senator Goulding assumes that there is a complete gain, and the alternative is that the 3,000 will be unemployed and thrown on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question requires much more careful examination than we can give it here.  Senator Goulding says that after eight years, in which a tariff has been applied, it is quite right and natural, and to be expected, that a tariff at the rate of 60 per cent. or 80 per cent. must be maintained.  We have to consider that when men are working their first concern is to maintain themselves and their families.  But the value of their work is that they are producing something useful.  I think that in a number of these industries it would have been better to give men the dole.  I do not want to be taken as making too wide a statement, but I do suggest that it would have been better to give them the dole and import the articles.  I should like to give my experience in regard to certain small things.  I could not, I admit, compare the prices.  When the tariffs first came on there was one article that we had to buy once every 18 <Col N="2635" /> months.  We bought that article, and if it turned out to be unsatisfactory we notified the shopkeeper and he took it back and supplied another, because he could return it to the British manufacturer. I do not want to generalise too much.  Under the new system we bought the same type of article in the same shop.  It was broken within a week, but we could not return it and the shopkeeper would not supply another article because the Irish manufacturer would not make the same arrangement as the British manufacturer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>These cases are exceptional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they are widespread; I could give a dozen other experiences.  There was another article of household necessity and I remember when it was manufactured here how often we had to replace what had been worn out.  There is no use talking about relative prices because that would require a very exact examination. You have to take into consideration the period of usefulness of the manufactured article.  Senator Douglas says that if you put the price of the home-manufactured article up to the full price of the imported article, which is the British price plus the tariff, the firm would then go out of business because of job lots which would come in periodically.  When a thing is manufactured in this country and the Irish manufacturer intends to hold the market, the shopkeepers, whose time is valuable to them, take the line of least resistance and it is much easier for them to get the Irish manufactured article.  In the beginning I think they erred on the other side.  Their buyers went to Bradford. They were used to going there and to some extent they resisted having to change their methods.  Once you have the system established here, the ordinary Irish dealer is not going to be so alert that he will be on the look-out to see when a job lot is available on the English market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter requires much more careful examination.  If 3,000 people are employed and, as a result of that <Col N="2636" /> number being employed in the manufacture of a certain article, the cost to the consumers is put up, you have a complicated sum as to whether nationally we gain or lose.  We could, if we liked, grow all the tea we require in Ireland under glass.  But no one suggests we should do that.  We import it.  It is cultivated by poorly paid people in India and China.  No one is so mad as to talk about growing tea under glass here, because the increased cost of the tea would be much more than any value that would be obtained from growing it here.  I give that extreme instance because Senator Goulding and so many other people talk about the great national advantage of having things manufactured here.  That may apply in some cases.  In many cases there would be a national advantage in not manufacturing things here when it can only be done with a tariff of 60 or 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding says we are at a disadvantage because we are only beginning industrial production.  I am not going to dogmatise about history, but in a way we may assume that the fact that we got so little advantage out of the industrial development of the nineteenth century was partly due to political causes, but some element of natural causes probably entered into it. We produce from the surface of the soil and, as far as discoveries have gone, there is not much to be produced from under the surface.  We have not supplies of coal, iron or steel in any commercial quantity.  We are making a beginning if you like.  Senator Goulding's statement seemed to be an eminent justification for the tariff policy before the present Government came into power here.  I am not now comparing the two Governments.  It seems that the fact that a thing was not manufactured here was not <i>ipso facto</i> clear proof that nature intended it should not be manufactured here.  At the same time the system then established was a careful and rigid examination of the pros and cons, a strictly limited tariff to be put on, with an understanding that even that tariff was at its maximum then and, as the industry became established, so the manufacturer must recognise that <Col N="2637" /> equity and justice to the consumer would require that the tariff would be periodically reduced until, if it did not get down to the level of no tariff at all, it would be so small that it would not have any really adverse effect on the conditions of life in this country.</P>
    <P>Then the present Government came into power and went ahead with a full tariff policy.  I should like to give instances from my experience.  I remember one time at an election meeting telling people that even if we were elected we would have to maintain these tariffs after election.  A minister of the Government said we were running away from our previous position.  It was nothing of the sort.  When the tariffs were not on, there was one condition, but when they went on, and people put capital into factories, there was a new situation and it would have been against justice if people under one régime were induced to put their savings into industry and another régime could wipe out everything and ruin them.  Even accepting the present policy of beginning with enormous tariffs, it certainly had the effect of giving employment in certain directions. On the other hand, I think it had the effect of creating unemployment in certain other directions.  It had an adverse effect on the agricultural producer, who had to bear the increased cost of the tariffs while he was competing in a world market and nobody would give him the same facilities as were given to the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Now, one can always say, during a period of experiment, that it is reasonable that people might be asked to suffer for a time in order to produce a permanently better condition thereafter, but if we are going to get up after eight years, and talk about an 80 per cent. tariff as a reasonable tariff, then I think it is time that some of us protested.  You might begin with an 80 per cent. tariff and, after a number of years bring it down to 60 per cent. or even 40 per cent., but if commodities are to be produced in this country for the mere purpose of their production without any special point&mdash;in some countries, for instance, it happens that they require to produce armaments&mdash; and if, after eight years, we are still to have an 80 per cent. tariff, then failing <Col N="2638" /> expert examination of all the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the case, I say that, <i>prima facie,</i> that tariff is a complete failure, and instead of being a national advantage it is, and is likely to continue to be, a national disadvantage.  I want that point made clear.  The Minister possibly going through each individual case, which would take a very long time, could show that weighing everything for and against, the balance is in favour of the tariff as it stands.  I am not arguing that but I do say that generalisations to the effect that 3,000 people have been employed and that, therefore, the tariff is a national advantage do not follow at all.  I think that sort of doctrine has done, and is likely to do, a great deal of harm.  It has misled people.  We see them scrambling for whatever local benefit may accrue by a little industry established in a small town without adverting to the fact that the satisfaction of these demands might lead, and I think to some extent is bound to lead, to economic disadvantage for the whole people of the country.</P>

      <P>I think that, after the able explanation of Senator Douglas, the House is quite satisfied in giving the Minister the powers he asks for in this Bill.  As a worker, I certainly say that workers throughout the country, particularly those in districts where industries have been established, are very grateful for the tariff policy in general.  The conditions under which workers are employed in most of these industries are entirely Christian and Catholic.  Senator Fitzgerald, referring to the fact that 3,000 people had been employed, said that if we could import the article which these people produced more cheaply than it can be produced here, it would probably be as <Col N="2639" /> good, if not better, if we put these people on the dole and imported the article.</P>

      <P>When we hear all this talk about higher prices, we forget the point that the Government had to take into consideration the fact that many of the articles formerly imported were not produced under normal conditions but were surplus goods that were dumped in this country.  We have all heard of instances where large quantities of goods were dumped here from Japan.  These goods were not made under the ideal conditions which our workers enjoy here.  Even the worst conditions known here are much better than the conditions under which the vast majority of these goods were made. As regards a comparison in prices, what I personally would like to see&mdash; and I think it would meet Senator Sir John Keane's point&mdash;is some standard established which our manufacturers should work up to, rather than a price to work down to.  I think if there were some method by which an article could be examined on its merits, or if some standard were established to which that article would have to conform, we should be doing much more good for the country than by trying to compel our manufacturers to compete with manufactured articles abroad in relation to price.</P>

      <P>Of course if the Senator has any doubt as to whether he was in order, perhaps he will forgive me if I err on the side of order and do not follow him into the very general discussion which his remarks have opened.  I should like to say that in this case what we are concerned with is not the question whether we shall be able to secure home-manufactured products at a price equivalent to, or even at a price higher than we might be able to get similar products abroad, but whether we are going to be able to get these products at all, whether of home or of foreign manufacture. The duties which are now before the Oireachtas for confirmation are duties which are imposed as part of the arrangement whereby our native cotton manufacturers will be reasonably assured of a supply of raw materials which will enable them to meet the requirements of our people in cotton piece goods.  If they are not able to get that supply of raw materials, I do not think there would be easily available to us a supply of such materials from any other source and that is really what is involved in these Orders.  I think that the arrangement is, from the point of view of the general public interest, a very valuable one to the community as a whole.  It was because of that that my predecessor approved of it in the first instance and that I am now giving practical effect to that approval.  I do not think it would be wise or fair in view of the condition of the Order Paper, that I should venture into the wider field which has been opened up for us by the remarks of Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>In one of these orders there is a definite increase of duty provided for, and I wish to avail myself of my constitutional opportunity to reply, within the ambit of that order, to certain remarks which were made earlier.

      <P>It has been stated during the debate&mdash;I am sorry that I attributed it wrongly to Senator Douglas&mdash;that the Prices Commission reviewed the charges of these protective firms.  But there is one element which the Prices Commission cannot deal with.  My remarks really hang on to what Senator Goulding stated. He said that the Prices Commission was there to prevent profiteering. There may be excessive profits made and distributed in dividends, and the Prices Commission can exercise a certain very effective control.  But how is the Prices Commission going to test efficiency in production?  There is the point.  If an industry is sheltered, it can by all kinds of inefficient methods of production unduly enhance prices, and no Prices Commission can ever detect that flaw.  The only way in which you can get efficiency in production is to have competition, and the only way to get effective competition is gradually to narrow the margin of protection afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am entirely in sympathy with the remark made by a previous Senator with regard to quality.  Several times in this House I have suggested that the Government should set up a bureau of standards in order that the public would be informed as to the quality of articles produced.  In the case of candles, for instance, I have no doubt that there are quite large quantities of candles.  But it is quite possible that, while maintaining the price, they depreciate the quality, and nobody except experts examining the matter technically can ever exercise an effective control in that respect.  It is one of the great dangers in any policy of protection that the price may be <Col N="2642" /> maintained, but the quality may be depreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has two main purposes&mdash;to provide authority for the Minister for Finance to advance further moneys to the Electricity Supply Board and to clear up a doubt which has been raised by the legal adviser to that board as to whether it had statutory power to build and operate a power station using peat as a fuel for the generation of electricity. There are a few other sections in the Bill which are all more or less of a routine character and which I do not think will present any great difficulty to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, in view of the discussions which have taken place elsewhere and to prevent possible misunderstanding, to make a statement on the circumstances which have made it necessary to provide further moneys for the board's operations.  After the Shannon works were handed over to the board, the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 empowered the Minister for Finance to advance up to £2,500,000 for the general purposes of the board.  In addition to this sum, there was a sum of £156,000, representing the interest and arrears of interest on sums advanced under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925.  This sum of £156,000 was specifically allocated for the purpose of discharging those obligations.  Subsequent to the 1927 Act, there were four other Acts under which the Minister for Finance was authorised to advance moneys to the Electricity Supply Board.  Those Acts were passed in the years 1931, 1932, 1934 and 1936 respectively, and together they empowered the Minister for Finance to advance to the board up to £6,259,000. This is the sum which is mentioned in Section 5 (1) of the Liffey Reservoir <Col N="2643" /> Act, 1936, the Act which it is proposed to amend by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted, however, that this global sum of £6,259,000 did not include the £2,500,000 advanced under the original 1927 Act.  If this latter sum be added to the global sum, the total sum of money which the Minister for Finance was authorised to advance to the board was £8,759,000.  All the sums which I have mentioned&mdash;and it is important to keep this point in mind&mdash; were to be advanced for the general purposes of the board and could be so used, subject to the authorisation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for the execution of all or any of the capital works connected with the undertaking with the exception perhaps of the works for which certain moneys, to which I shall now refer, were specifically provided.</P>
    <P>Now, in addition to this £8,759,000 which the Minister for Finance was authorised to advance for the general purposes of the board, I might mention that under one or other of the Acts to which I have referred the Minister for Finance was entitled to advance sums for a specific purpose or purposes: among these being a sum of £530,000 which he was empowered to advance under the Act of 1934 for the specific purpose of improving and developing the storage capacity of the Shannon Lakes.  I have mentioned that the Minister for Finance was authorised to advance the sum of £8,759,000 for the general purposes of the board.  The whole of that sum has not been advanced so far by the Minister for Finance, nor has it been applied for by the board.  In fact, the position is this: that at the outset the Minister for Finance felt that he ought to set aside and to reserve the sum of £756,000 odd against the liabilities which the board had assumed when it acquired certain electricity undertakings, and that sum of £756,000 has been so ear-marked and held in reserve by the Minister for Finance against these undertakings.</P>
    <P>I should like, in that connection, to emphasise this point: that that has been an administrative act of the Minister for Finance, that he was not <Col N="2644" /> obliged to make that reservation by statute, and that the £756,000 would be at his disposal, if he saw fit to reverse his decision in connection with it, and would be available to him, if he wished to advance it to the board, to meet any emergency condition which might arise. In addition to that sum of £756,000 there was a further sum of £1,014,000 which, so far, the board have not requested the Minister for Finance to advance, even though the board may have incurred commitments to the full extent of that sum, but so far, in so far as they have carried out works which have cost £1,014,000 or more than that sum, they have been able to finance the expenditure on those works out of the reserves or out of the cash balances available to them.  I may say that it has always been envisaged that the board, from time to time, would be able to utilise their reserves and their cash balances for such purposes in the way which appeared to them to be most advantageous.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the fact that the total of the amounts which the Minister for Finance was authorised by statute to advance to the board came to £8,759,000, that out of that sum he had reserved £756,118 against the liabilities which the board took over when certain electricity undertakings were acquired; accordingly after making a deduction for this reservation we are left with a sum of £8,002,882 as the amount which, in the view of the Minister for Finance, he holds free as available for advancing to the board to meet the general purposes of the electricity supply undertaking, and I propose, in what I have to say further, to relate my figures to that figure of £8,002,882.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to intervene for a moment. The Minister speaks of £8,000,000 odd and says that that sum or some other sum was for the general purposes of the board, and then at another time he says that it is for capital works and then speaks of that £700,000 odd and says that the Minister could give that to the board for incidental things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that the Minister could give it for incidental purposes but that he could at any time hold himself free to advance that sum to the board, in case of emergency, to meet capital obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And that applies to all the sums the Minister is mentioning &mdash;all for capital works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, all for capital works.  I assume that that is understood and that no part of this money is available to meet the ordinary running expenses of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about £750,000, which I gathered was to pay the interest which had accrued, but which was not capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is, in fact, regarded as a capital liability because it is interest which accrued through the construction period&mdash;part of the ordinary capital structure of the undertaking. Now, of this total sum of £8,002,882, the Minister for Finance, as I have indicated, indirectly, has made advances amounting to £6,988,081, thus leaving, as I have said, a balance of £1,014,312 available for issue to the board, as and when requested by the board.  I think I ought to emphasise at this stage that this is a net figure. It is not a gross figure, because, in accordance with the several Acts, the Minister still has power to advance a sum of £756,000 for the general purposes of the board and, in addition, the sum of £530,000 to the board for the specific purposes of improving and developing the storage capacity of the Shannon Lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I should, perhaps, at this point, explain to the House that the board have a right, under the Electricity Supply Acts, to request the Minister for Finance to advance any sums up to the total amount authorised by the Oireachtas subject to previous authorisation having been obtained from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, granted by him after examination of the purposes for which the moneys are to be used.  The policy of the board <Col N="2646" /> so far has been to use any moneys at their disposal, subject to the conditions laid down in the Acts, for the purposes of financing any of the capital works for which the necessary authorisation has been received from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Consequently, the total amount which the board have authorisation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to spend must necessarily be greater than the amounts which the Minister for Finance has actually advanced at any given moment.  That is to say, the commitments are entered into, and the money is only asked from the Minister for Finance, as and when it becomes necessary for the board to make their payments in respect of the extensions which they have undertaken, and, as I have indicated earlier, the position now is such that the board, under the existing statutes, have still a margin of £1,014,000 of unutilised authorisations which they may ask the Minister for Finance to implement at any time by making the necessary advances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with a complex question, and I hate to interrupt him.  As far as I can follow the case, he says that the board only applies after the commitment is made.  The money is voted by the Dáil for capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister is made responsible for deciding whether the capital expenditure is to be undertaken. As the Minister stated, it seems to me that the board on their own decide on new development and commit themselves to it.  As worded, it meant that the board has control and merely says: &ldquo;We are committed to this&rdquo;.  I presume the Minister has to sanction that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator overlooks the fact that I stated the board could ask the Minister for Finance to advance to them any moneys which were required for works authorised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Before the board can go to the Minister for Finance they must apply to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for authorisation in respect of <Col N="2647" /> works they contemplate.  That authorisation, I may say, is never given without consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Naturally the two Departments work in harmony in these matters, and the only question that arises, so far as the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are concerned, is at what point they feel it incumbent on them to go to the Oireachtas for authority to make additional advances to the board.  As I am coming to that point, I might as well repeat this, so that the House should be familiar with the procedure.  Under the 1931 Act, before moneys can be advanced by the Minister for Finance, up to the limits laid down in the statute, a certificate is required from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the moneys are &ldquo;reasonably and properly required by the board for any purposes arising in the performance of their functions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Thus there is a duty cast on the Minister for Industry and Commerce which he performs in such a way as to satisfy himself that the sums are, in the words of the Act of 1931, &ldquo;reasonably and properly required&rdquo; by the board for any purposes arising in the performance of their functions.  So far as the Legislature is concerned, the control is exercised through the statutory limitations which are imposed upon the advances which the Minister for Finance may make to the board.  The present Bill asks for the sanction of the Legislature for an increase in the total amount authorised by £4,000,000, which it is hoped and believed will cover the board's estimated capital expenditure to the 31st March, 1942.  Accordingly, this Bill proposes to increase the global amount of £6,259,000, which is set out in the 1936 Act, to a total of £10,259,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should make it clear to the House that the position in regard to advances this year is somewhat abnormal. This Bill normally ought to have been introduced perhaps not later than the autumn of 1938, but the House will remember that the international situation at that time was somewhat obscure and somewhat critical.  It was not possible, by reason <Col N="2648" /> of the attention which the then Minister for Industry and Commerce had to devote to the question of the maintenance of our supplies in the emergency conditions which might suddenly arise, to formulate a clear idea of the board's requirements as they were likely to be in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>If war were to break out, it was possible that certain commitments which the board had entered into would, by reason of war conditions, prove to be more onerous than was contemplated. At the same time a question arose as to what extent it was possible in the Bill to implement what I have said was the earlier intention of the Oireachtas, to provide a satisfactory pensions scheme for the staff of the Electricity Supply Board undertaking. By reason of the preoccupation of the Minister and the Department at the time with the possibility of a critical situation arising here by reason of the international tension, and also by reason of the difficulties which the Minister for Industry and Commerce had with the board on the one hand, and his colleague, the Minister for Finance on the other hand, the negotiations in respect of the proposed pension arrangement for the Electricity Supply Board staff were somewhat prolonged.  It was not possible in the autumn of 1938 to have introduced a Bill which would provide for an increase in the statutory authority of the Minister for Finance to make advances to the board.</P>
    <P>The situation was no easier unfortunately in 1939, and with the actual outbreak of war, the difficulties which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was labouring under became more intensified, and it was only in the summer of this year that either the board and myself were able to come to an agreement as to what would be the amount likely to be required for a reasonable period in advance, and what sum we would be justified in asking the Dáil to grant additional authority to the Minister for Finance to advance, for the purposes of the board's undertaking. Accordingly, both the board and the Ministers concerned found themselves in this difficulty: they had either to say <Col N="2649" /> to the board: &ldquo;We are not in a position to go to the Oireachtas at this moment and ask the Oireachtas to give the Minister for Finance additional authority and, therefore, you must close down upon all possible extensions, whether of generating plant, transmission lines or distribution network,&rdquo; or they had to say to the board: &ldquo;We are prepared to authorise additional works which, in your view, are essential for the proper development of the undertaking and maintenance of the electricity supply, provided that you are in a position at this stage to finance these works out of your own immediate resources and then, in due course, if you desire that the moneys which you have invested in the development of the undertaking should be set free for other purposes, we shall go to the Oireachtas and ask them to grant to the Minister for Finance the necessary authority to enable him to make advances to the board accordingly.&rdquo; Naturally, the only reasonable thing for the board to do in those circumstances, and the only reasonable course for the Minister as well, was to take the latter alternative.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the board went ahead, entered into commitments and carried out certain extensions which have had the consequence that, out of the £4,000,000 of additional expenditure which we are now asking the Oireachtas to grant to the Minister for Finance, the sum of £2,150,000 is in respect of commitments which have already been entered into&mdash;commitments, which as I have said, have been financed by the board out of its own reserves and cash resources.</P>
    <P>You might ask me what were the nature of these commitments and the nature of the extensions undertaken by the board.  Here are some of them: First of all, they had to instal new generating plant at the Pigeon House costing about £209,000; new transmission lines were erected costing about £302,000 to date, but ultimately to cost, when the contemplated extensions have been finished £352,000; new distribution networks have been provided costing £204,000; for extension of existing networks, we have £126,000; new consumers' services, with meters, have been installed, <Col N="2650" /> costing £130,000.  When I say that these services have been installed, that might not be strictly correct.  It may be that the board has accumulated reserve stocks of meters which will enable them to instal new consumers' services to the value of £130,000.  There has been an extension of hireage schemes, £46,000; new public lighting has cost £10,000 and new areas of supply have been opened up, costing £77,000; new buildings have been erected for the purpose of the undertaking and improvements have been made in existing buildings, at a cost of £54,000; improvement of the Shannon fisheries has cost £6,000; excess expenditure has been incurred on items provided for under the Liffey Reservoir Act, £283,000; and an increase in the anticipated expenditure on the Liffey Hydro-Electric Scheme accounts for £267,000.  It will be seen, however, that with the possible exception of the last two items all these were expenses which would have been incurred by the board in the normal way if they were to try to develop the undertaking.</P>
    <P>With reference to the last two items, I do not wish it to be assumed, because of the phraseology which I have just used, that the excess commitments which have been incurred there were any less essential than any other commitments on the part of the board.  I mentioned the last two items arising out of the Liffey Hydro-Electric Scheme.  Included in that sum of £2,150,000 expenditure which the board has financed up to the present out of its own resources, there is £280,000 in respect of the increased cost of the Liffey Hydro-Electric Scheme.  The original total cost was £760,000 and the revised total estimate for the cost of the scheme was £1,041,000.</P>
    <P>It would be quite wrong to assume that the difference was due to an error in estimating the capital cost of the scheme.  In fact, the increase is due mainly to a decision which was taken to enlarge the size of the generating plant which was to be installed at the Liffey.  The capacity of that plant is now to be 34 megowatts&mdash;34,000 kilowatts&mdash;instead of the 23,000 kilowatts originally provided for.  Owing to an increase in the load, as compared with the figures on which the experts' <Col N="2651" /> report of 1935 was based, it was apparent, on a re-examination of the project by the experts in 1938, that by the time the Poulaphouca project would be completed a larger capacity for the Liffey plant would be justified. Accordingly, as I have said, they recommended the installation of two 15,000 kilowatt sets in Poulaphouca in addition to the 4,000 kilowatt set which has been installed at the Golden Falls.  This increase in the generating plant renders the Liffey hydro-electric station a much more valuable unit, from the point of view of the general electricity supply, than it was originally anticipated it would be.  Apart, however, from the increase in the capacity of the plant, there has been, during the course of construction, a considerable increase in the cost of materials and electrical equipment and, as the trend was continuously upwards during the period of construction, this fact has manifested itself in the general expenditure on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The sum of £800,000 which has been ascribed to that, has made very generous allowance for appreciation in the cost of plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the section of the Bill which has received greatest attention in the other House has been Section 3, which is intended to clarify the position of the board in relation to its statutory power to erect a peat fuel generating station.  As I have already indicated, it is the present intention to erect such a generating station on a site contiguous to the bog at Clonsast and in the neighbourhood of Portarlington.  In that connection, I think I should emphasise, so far as the utilisation of peat as a fuel for generating steam to drive prime movers to generate electricity is concerned, there is no reason to anticipate any technical difficulty whatsoever.  That is a problem which has been successfully solved in other countries by means which our engineers have had an opportunity of fully investigating, and they are satisfied, as indeed must any <Col N="2652" /> person who is familiar with this problem be satisfied, that it can be done quite successfully here.  The only question that arises is whether we shall have a sufficiently dependable supply of fuel available for the generating station when it has been built, and on that I can only say that I do not see any reason to anticipate that such a supply of fuel will not be available.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether members of the House have had the advantage of visiting Portarlington, or the bog at Clonsast, and seeing for themselves what has been done on the bog within the past three or four years.  It is a bog of 4,000 acres in extent.  Speaking subject to my recollection being correct, I think about 363 miles of drains have been laid down on the bog.  A network of electrical power mains has been erected over the bog, and this year, with only half of what would be the full complement of machines required for an output of 120,000 tons of standard turf from the bog, 50,000 tons of such turf have, in fact, been won. Now, let me define what standard turf is.  It is turf with the normal calorific value of turf, having a moisture content of 30 per cent.  If the Turf Development Board can supply 120,000 tons of such turf to the Electricity Supply Board, the station at Portarlington will be an economic unit.  The kernel of this problem lies in the &ldquo;if&rdquo;. If the Turf Development Board can supply the turf, we need have no doubt whatsoever that the Electricity Supply Board will be able to generate electricity upon an economic basis at Portarlington.</P>
    <P>Now, what are the prospects in that regard?  I have mentioned that, with half the full complement of the machines necessary to give an output of 120,000 tons, the Turf Development Board, in the present year, have actually cut, dried and made turf to the extent of 50,000 tons.  That achievement was attained under conditions, some of which might be described as better than normal, but some of which were undoubtedly worse than we might normally expect because these machines went into production on a bog which is as yet only partially drained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2653" /> The normal drainage period for a bog is five years.  I gather that on the Continent they do not put machines on a bog until five years after the drainage works have been practically completed.  The drainage at Clonsast has only been proceeding for three years.  Our engineers came to the conclusion that the surface of the bog would carry their machines, and that, if they proceeded to win turf from the bog with the machines, the drainage operations would be considerably improved, and perhaps the drainage period shortened.  They put three machines on the bog last year, stripped the bog, and this year won turf from it.  They started these three machines with untrained crews.  Now, I am not in a position to say exactly how many men go to make the crew of a machine, but I can tell the House that it is a considerable number: that these machines have to be operated the 24 hours through, that the crews of them were operating not merely during the hours of daylight but during the hours of darkness; that, at the outset, the communication system over the bog was not as good as it might be on occasions, that when a shut down occurred, due to mechanical repairs and mechanical difficulties, it was longer than would normally be the case with an experienced crew.  Nevertheless, with the crews on the bog not fully trained, the Turf Development Board this year have reaped 50,000 tons of machine-won turf of a very high quality from Clonsast, so high a quality that, in fact, I think, all going well, they will have no difficulty whatsoever in disposing of the greater part of that turf, not for ordinary household uses, but for industrial uses, for uses similar to that to which the Electricity Supply Board will put the turf when the generating station is built at Portarlington.</P>
    <P>In the light of what has been done this year with half the normal complement of these machines: with the fact that the crews were inexperienced, with the fact that the bog was not fully ripe for exploitation, and even making allowances for the fact that the turf-winning season this year was longer than usual, I see no reason to anticipate that the Turf Development Board <Col N="2654" /> will not be in a position to meet the full requirements of the Electricity Supply Board for fuel at the Portarlington generating station, and if that anticipation is fulfilled, then I think we shall have made a considerable advance in solving the problem of developing and utilising the peat resources of this country.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with that but, as a matter of fact, my recollection is that the German firm working here were provided with a record of rainfall over a period of, I think, about 30 years.  They also knew that, whereas in continental countries there is a great irregularity between the period of the thawing of snows and so on, our rainfall is more or less evenly spread over the year.  It was not just a matter of their coming over and assuming that everything was going to be identical.</P>

      <P>In case I may have misled the House, I do not want it to be assumed at all that the original contractors for this scheme proceeded on the assumption that &ldquo;conditions in Germany are such and conditions in Ireland ought to be such&rdquo;.  In fact, they were fortified by a considerable number of records here taken over a long period of years, but&mdash;perhaps it would not be unusual because the records <Col N="2656" /> were not as complete as they might have been and, in some cases, they were not subject to verification&mdash; they may have, on the whole, assumed that if there was any room for doubt, the benefit should be given rather to the belief that conditions here might approximate to those with which they were familiar on the continent than otherwise.  I do not want to put it any further than that.</P>
      <P>Our experience has been that, although we have a reputation for a rather humid climate, since the Shannon development was initiated and since there has been a more careful measurement of our rainfall and run off conditions in this country, the view, founded on the facts, has tended to be the other way, that is, that our climate is less humid than the average continental climate and less humid, I think, than that to which the continentals who have been utilising turf for the generation of electricity have been accustomed.  I have already said that perhaps there may not be such a great difference between the continental climate and our climate in regard to the total quantity of rainfall in the year, but we have undoubtedly a very definite advantage in the length of the turf-winning season. In Germany, the maximum length of the season for cutting turf is from April to the end of July, whereas I am advised that turf can be cut and won by machinery here from late February until the end of July.  Whether that fits in with the ordinary farmer's working economy in this matter I do not know, but the two problems are not at all similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter raised the question of the cost of generating electricity at Portarlington compared with the costs at the existing undertaking.  That, of course, is not a question to which it is easy to give a precise answer, because the costs of generating electricity by such water-power installation as we have in this country at the moment are very variable.  In 1938-9, for instance, out of a total delivery to the Electricity Supply Board network of 367,000,000 units, Ardnacrusha, that is, the Shannon works, supplied, in round figures, 284,000,000 units, or 77.4 per cent. of the whole, while the Pigeon <Col N="2657" /> House delivered only 81,000,000 units, or 22 per cent. of the whole.  Naturally, in that year, if we were to take the figures for the Pigeon House and to load them with the full capital cost of the Pigeon House undertaking, the cost per unit generated at the Pigeon House would be very high because of the fact that it was necessary to produce only 81,000,000 units, since we were able to get 284,000,000 units out of Ardnacrusha.  The position was the reverse in 1939.  That was a much drier year than 1938 and the total output from Ardnacrusha in that year was only 208,000,000 units, or 51 per cent. of the total delivery of 388,000,000 units.  As against the 208,000,000 units for which Ardnacrusha was responsible, the Pigeon House plant was responsible for 179,000,000 units, or 41.6 per cent. of the total.</P>
    <P>These variations in output and their reactions upon the generating costs are reflected in the cost per unit delivered from the plant.  In the case of the Pigeon House, in 1938-39, the cost per unit delivered was .6994d.&mdash;the Senator can make it .7d., or almost ¾d.  In 1939-40, it fell to .4457d. or less than ½d.  For Ardnacrusha, on the other hand, while the average cost per unit delivered was only .2725d. in 1938-39, the figure rose to .3723d. in 1939-40, but it is not to be taken that the figure I have given represents the upward limit of the possible cost of generation at Ardnacrusha in a very dry year.  I have not with me at the moment the figure for the year 1934, but in that year the output from Ardnacrusha was very limited indeed. I think it fell to a figure of the order of 102,000,000 units and the cost of generation then would be very much higher than anything I have given.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the Portarlington station is that the board anticipate that the plant to be installed there will be used as a base load unit. The total capacity of the plant will be 90,000,000 units per year.  It will be a 20 M.W. plant and its capital cost is taken at £800,000 which, I think, even in present circumstances, can be regarded as an outside figure.  It would be about half that if circumstances were normal.  On the basis of these figures&mdash;an output of 90,000,000 units <Col N="2658" /> per year and a capital cost of £800,000 &mdash;it is estimated that the cost per unit generated at Portarlington will be, approximately, .426d.  We may compare this figure with the figure for the Liffey development where, with an anticipated output of 30,000,000 units and a plant having a capacity of 34 M.W., the cost per unit generated will be about .568d.  It will be seen from these figures that the cost of the station at Portarlington will not, stated as conservatively as possible, be unfavourable as compared with that of any other generating station in the country, taking one year with another. That is, I think, a very strong argument for proceeding with the generating station at Portarlington.  It is true that this favourable position may be ascribed to certain special circumstances which are only now beginning to manifest themselves in the evolution of the national electricity supply.  That undertaking has now reached a stage at which it is profitable to instal a large-size unit and run it continuously.  It will not be possible to operate, say, the units to be installed at Poulaphouca in the same way as it is proposed to operate Portarlington station.  It is not, I think, on the whole, economically the best thing to operate the units at the Pigeon House in exactly the same way as it is proposed to operate the station at Portarlington.  We are not likely to get from the Shannon output the same all-round constant efficiency, year in and year out, as it is hoped to get from the station at Portarlington.  At the stage to which our electricity undertaking has now developed, we expect to be able to construct the station and operate it in a way which ought to give very satisfactory results from the point of view of economic generation.</P>
    <P>The only question is whether we are unduly optimistic in believing that we shall be able to maintain the essential supply of fuel to that station when Clonsast bog has been fully developed and is in full operation.  I do not think that there is any very grave risk facing us on that account.  In saying that, I do not want at all to be taken as minimising the unforeseen difficulties which the Turf Development Board may yet have to face. So far as their work has shown us <Col N="2659" /> up to the present, there is no reason to fear that great or insuperable difficulties will arise.  They have had very many difficulties to overcome but a survey of the bog has been made and they have gathered a good deal of information as a result of draining the bog.  When you cut 363 miles into a bog of varying depth, you get to know its nature.  In addition to that, a considerable number of experimental bores have been sunk, so that the board know the stratification of the bog.  I take it that proper stratification maps have been prepared for the whole area, so that they are as reasonably assured in their knowledge of the bog as a person can be who has to rely upon these experimental and trial borings.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we shall be able to put in hands the construction of the station for about 18 months.  This difficulty of the board's power must be cleared out of the way.  The Turf Development Board are proceeding with the development of the bog and, in the meantime, as I have indicated, they are finding a ready sale for the product of Clonsast.  The people are beginning to realise that there is a very valuable national asset there and that fuel at a price which, compared with the present price of coal, is industrially economic, is obtainable from the bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In asking the House to clear up this doubt and put the Electricity Supply Board in a position to proceed with the erection of the Portarlington station, we are not asking the House to enter into an undue speculation. The prospects are reasonably certain and, if there were greater doubt in regard <Col N="2660" /> to them than, in my view, there really is, nevertheless, in present circumstances it would be worth taking this chance.  It would be worth taking the chance from another point of view, too.  If the undertaking prove a success, it will be possible to develop other bogs on the same lines and resources which are at present not being utilised will be developed for the common good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We should congratulate the Minister upon his frank and full statement on this rather complicated matter.  He has, certainly, done his best and taken great pains to make the whole thing clear.  He put figures in great detail before us.  The Bill is a small Bill of six sections and it involves the expenditure of £4,000,000. Commitments for roughly half of that have already been entered into and the other half, the Minister calculates, will be spent within the next 15 months&mdash; before the 31st March, 1942.  The Bill&mdash; and this is a point the Minister did not make&mdash;&mdash;marks the success of the Shannon scheme, and shows the wisdom of the development of the Shannon, as distinct from other rivers, first and also the wisdom of the type of board which was set up, of the statutory powers given to it and of the type of personnel of which it was composed. The Minister reminded us, incidentally, in the course of his remarks that the peak load for the Shannon scheme was calculated by the experts to reach 110,000,000 units, sold by 1932.  That point was, in fact, reached in 1932.  In 1939 more than three times that amount was actually sold.  That marks, I think, a very substantial achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill contemplates an addition to the Shannon, the harnessing of the Liffey, and, in addition to that, what is a novelty, that is to say, the erection of a generator for peat at Clonsast and a supply of electricity generated from peat.  The Bill is not a Bill which could be opposed because the board requires more electricity; the Liffey scheme has already begun, and the Clonsast scheme, as the Minister made it clear to us, has gone so far that it would be very difficult, I think, now to stop it.  But in the other House the Minister said that this particular peat <Col N="2661" /> scheme was a risk and an experiment. It has always seemed to me that in considering this question of turf the Minister and his colleagues seem to be of the belief that there rests upon us a national duty to develop turf, independent altogether of economics.  I do not agree with that view.  I think one can be a very sound nationalist and can be in favour of the development of our resources without taking the view that, whatever may be the costs, we must develop turf for electricity, for example.  The scheme is not a national one.  It is a local one.  One point the Minister did not mention was what employment it is contemplated will be given at Clonsast.  I did not like to interrupt him because, as I have said, he was doing a very difficult thing and we will have in Committee plenty of opportunity of going into the matter. When the Shannon scheme was being put forward a contract for the carrying out of the work was got from a firm of world-wide reputation; four European experts were then asked to report on it, and the report of the firm and the report of the experts were both before the Oireachtas when the scheme was being debated.  With regard to the question of Clonsast, upon which £800,000 or perhaps more&mdash;it may amount in the end to about £1,000,000 &mdash;is going to be spent, we have no such information.  The Minister did not say upon what expert advice his figures rested.  The Electricity Supply Board obviously has taken care, in so far as it can, not to commit itself to an approval of this particular turf scheme. The paragraph of the report of the board dealing with it makes it clear that the board has had the turf scheme, so to speak, thrust upon it, and the Minister in the other House did make clear that in his view the board ought to undertake what the Government of the day regards as a matter of national policy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the electricity supply experts have not supplied him with these figures, one wonders where he actually gets them.  The Turf Board contains, as far as our information goes, one engineer&mdash;I am sure a very competent person&mdash;but apart from that particular engineer it contains nobody who has expert knowledge.  It is <Col N="2662" /> served by a clerk&mdash;and I am not using the word in any depreciatory sense but simply as a label or description&mdash;and other persons who have no particular competency in the matter of turf development or engineering.</P>

      <P>In any event, we have had considerable discussion of foreign development of peat.  A good deal of what is called peat in foreign countries, I think it is clear, is not peat at all but brown coal, and a good many of the foreign countries that try to develop peat are not in the position of being able to get coal or are not in the position of being able to pay for it.  Normally speaking, apart from the war, we are in the position that we can get it and also in the position that we <Col N="2663" /> have ample exports to pay for it.  I may say, incidentally, that our industrial development has reached a point at which, if we have to import things by way of payment for our exports, coal may be the simplest and easiest thing for us to import and the most profitable.</P>
      <P>With regard to this whole question of cost, what the Minister gave us was what the cost would be per unit of electricity generated at Clonsast, but the question of the cost of turf itself is a much more difficult one.  I do not want to delay the House on it because we will get an opportunity in Committee of dealing with the whole matter.  The Minister said that the Turf Board, with only half the machinery necessary, have, roughly speaking, reached an output of half the amount which it is calculated they will need.  They have produced 50,000 tons as against 120,000 tons, which is what they need for the generating station.  But I find in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, for example, of the 18th December, the following reference to the use of turf:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On a circular from the Department&rdquo; (that is the Department of Local Government) &ldquo;being read at Cork Mental Hospital Committee directing attention to the failure of public authorities to use turf as a substitute for imported fuel, the clerk stated that he had been referred to a supplier, but on inquiry could get no definite assurance that a supply of turf would be available. The supplier could not quote definitely, but said he thought the price would be about 35/- per ton. Several members said coal would be much more economic at this price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On yesterday's paper also there was the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No turf tenders.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Louth Board Plaint.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Difficulties of complying with the Government's suggestion that turf should be used in county institutions and offices were mentioned at the meeting of Louth Board of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2664" />&ldquo;Mr. M. Campbell said Ardee Mental Hospital Committee advertised for turf but the only tender asked 52/- per ton.  The board of health had also advertised but never received a tender.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to reconcile that with the statement made by the Minister in the other House that turf could be won for 10/6 a ton&mdash;on the bog, I think it was&mdash;because if my memory serves me right the Railway Tribunal actually fixed 6/- per ton as the cost of transport.  I know transport is a great difficulty but if 6/- is the cost of transport it is very difficult to see how it costs 52/6 a ton.</P>

      <P>In any event, what is really difficult to understand about the whole business is that a great deal of money has been spent&mdash;it is difficult to find out how much; the Minister has said he will supply the figures&mdash;but, in spite of that, the amount of turf actually won in 1939 is not substantially greater than the amount won in 1931, so that we are spending a great deal of money and not getting a substantially greater amount of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Electricity Supply Board, I have an uncomfortable feeling from reading the Minister's statement in the other House&mdash; he did not make any mention of it here&mdash;that the Minister and his colleagues have no conception at all of an independent board, and that the board which has made such a success of the matter up to the present moment is now going to find itself, at the behest of the Minister, involved in other considerations which may make a very considerable difference.  The Electricity Supply Board has 2,300 odd employees. They are for the most part permanent. <Col N="2665" /> They are for the most part reasonably treated, and it is to be remembered about that, that that kind of employment of over 2,300 people does not cost the taxpayer anything, as distinct from other employees in other places and industries who, in fact, do cost the taxpayer something to keep them in employment. I hope the Minister does not intend that the board should become more and more over-ridden by the Minister and by civil servants because, if that were so, it would be a very very serious setback.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the development of Clonsast is, apparently, put forward by 18 months, the Minister said, in reply to a question.  I do not know how that squares with the previous statement that £2,000,000 out of the £4,000,000 advanced will be spent before the 31st March, 1942.  I am sure the Minister made that clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only the anticipated requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing that is good is that the Minister has given an undertaking in the other House that the expenses attending the development of electricity from water power will be kept in a separate account from those connected with the turf development. It will, therefore, be possible for members of the House and the public to see, when the Electricity Supply Board presents its accounts, what precisely are the costs of the Clonsast undertaking. It may prove, and I hope it will, a satisfactory one, but it is a risk and an experiment and it is important that the Minister should keep the accounts of that particular transaction separate from the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point&mdash;about rural electrification.  When the Shannon scheme was introduced, promises were held out that electricity would eventually go to the remote parts of the country.  There have been difficulties about that, but seeing that the board has prospered and is costing the State nothing at all&mdash;in fact, I think the Minister for Finance makes a slight or, as was recently said, a casual profit on the undertaking&mdash;one would like to hear from the Minister what efforts are <Col N="2666" /> going to be made to extend light to areas with 500 of a population, such as was stated to be the ideal.  I think there is, in the original Act, a certain restriction upon the board which compels the board to let every area stand upon its own feet, so to speak.  We may have got to the stage when the board could be more venturesome and when the statutory restrictions should be removed so as to enable light to be supplied to places where, on a strict basis, it would not appear to be economic.</P>
    <P>The experience of the board has been that, wherever they have gone in, the number of consumers has increased and the consumption of electricity has increased out of all proportion even to the consumers.  Some very interesting figures were given in the Dáil, and there was an indication that when the board took over in a small town the consumption increased tenfold.  In the light of these circumstances, if there is a restriction on the board to keep it from going into certain other areas, that restriction should be removed and the board should be allowed to exercise its discretion as to how far it will go into various places.  I think the Bill does show the success of the Shannon scheme.  It contains another particular scheme which is a risk and an experiment. I wish that risk and experiment well, and I think the Bill is one which must be supported.</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board has given very general satisfaction, I have listened to Senator Hayes and I think that in his main line of argument he was more or less sceptical as to the merits of the Clonsast scheme. He termed the proposal a novelty.  I do not think that is a fair form of criticism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, we must give a certain amount of credit to the technicians who have assured us that this scheme is a sound, economic one. I think we should also be prepared to accept this, that from an engineering point of view we have as much ability in this country as can be found elsewhere and that we are quite as capable as other people of studying the possibilities of turf development.  Unfortunately, we seem to have some people amongst us who are continually sceptical, who do not think we are capable of investigating the possibilities of development in our own country.  I think it is time that that type of argument should cease.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes talked a lot about the Clonsast scheme and he said that the risk should not be undertaken.  Everything is a risk; all business is a risk, and, if the Minister were to listen to every person's point of view, he probably would not take definite action in regard to any proposals that would be submitted.  If a person is to get on in life, he must think for himself and, if he believes that he is doing the right thing, he must be prepared to go ahead and not be deterred by the views of others.  If any man who is now in business were to take advice from others before he set out on his career, he probably would not be in business at all.</P>
      <P>Let us take the Clonsast scheme on its merits.  From what I have seen of it, it has good prospects and I think the Minister was very moderate and, indeed, he was almost unfair to the House, when he said that there was a risk in the undertaking.  Probably he was right and tried to be as fair as he could in suggesting that there is a risk. Senator Hayes talked about the price of turf.  You have all sorts of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had called this turf scheme a white elephant, I wonder <Col N="2668" /> what would Senator McEllin be saying? I did not say anything at all about Irish engineers.  I merely asked was there expert advice got and what was it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not be oversensitive, at any rate.  The Senator talked about the price of turf.  Nobody can talk fairly on the subject of turf unless from the point of view of its heating value.  You have various types of turf, brown turf, black turf and what is known now as Clonsast turf. The ordinary medium grade of turf has at least 35 per cent. of moisture.  That is hand-won turf, and obviously that has not the same heating value and cannot be compared with the heating qualities of coal.  From inquiries I have made, I understand that the moisture content of the Clonsast turf is only 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 30 per cent. for standard turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood it was 15 per cent. of a moisture content.  Any turf with only 15 per cent. of a moisture content would have the same heating qualities, or practically the same, as coal.  Even if you take Senator Hayes's figures as to the value of turf with such a low moisture content&mdash;and his figures were altogether wrong in my opinion&mdash; the heating qualities of Clonsast turf are sufficient without any doubt whatever, to generate as much steam for producing electricity as can be generated by any average grade imported coal.  If that be so, there is no reason why we should not agree that this scheme possesses all the essentials of success, particularly at a time like the present when there are such great possibilities of dislocation in supplies of imported commodities.  An industry, be it the production of electricity or anything else, which is dependent on imported coal runs a far greater risk, and is likely to run a still greater risk in future, than an industry in which the machinery has been adapted to use native fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main object in speaking is to join with other Senators who have <Col N="2669" /> appealed to the Minister on the question of rural electrification.  Nothing could give more confidence, more heart or more pleasure to the people in rural areas than to place a supply of electricity at their disposal, not only for lighting purposes but also for power which might be utilised in driving small crushing machines, for grinding oats, barley or even wheat in present circumstances.  Undoubtedly the electrification of rural areas may not be economic.  I believe it would be very hard to make it an economic proposition.  The Minister would require a tremendous amount of moral courage to go wholeheartedly into the question of the electrification of rural areas but, even so, I believe he would be well advised to face this question, admitting from the start that the scheme may have to be subsidised, in its initial stages at any rate.  In my opinion nothing would do more to bring people back to the land, to use a phrase that is popular nowadays, or to make those who are on the land remain there, than a general scheme of rural electrification.  I would appeal to the Minister very strongly to have this project examined immediately and to face the economics of it boldly.  In initiating a scheme like that he would be doing a better day's work for the country at large than anything that has been achieved so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the good wishes expressed by Senator Hayes towards what might be called the Clonsast experiment. Whether we have large resources of valuable minerals in this country, as Senator McEllin is inclined to think, is, at any rate, highly doubtful but we, all of us, know that there are great reserves of peat.  It has always seemed to me that one must view with a very sympathetic eye experimental expenditure, even considerable experimental expenditure, in order to make sure once and for all whether the utilisation of our vast resources in turf can be made permanently an economic proposition from the point of view of industrial fuel.  Therefore, I am very glad to see such experiments taking place, always provided that they are not being undertaken rashly or ignorantly, but with the assistance of <Col N="2670" /> the best expert knowledge that can be got and taking account of the lessons of experience that can be derived from other countries.  These remarks are pretty platitudinous, however, and I really rose, not to make a speech, but to ask a question which I hope the Minister will find it possible to answer when he is replying.  That is, why is it that so long a period as 18 months is allowed for the construction of this generating station, once it has begun?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to keep the House very long but a number of questions came into my mind when the Minister was speaking. He spoke in great detail on a very complex matter and dealt with the subject with extreme skill.  I cannot guarantee that I have got all the details in my mind of the matters with which I propose to deal.  Before the Shannon scheme was started, we were producing electricity in this country largely from imported coal.  We had a certain amount of water in this country at the time, just as we had a certain amount of turf.  Before the Shannon scheme was embarked upon, the firm who undertook to carry it through ultimately, made an elaborate examination and a report.  That report had to be submitted to three European experts of our choosing and it depended on the report of these experts, whether the scheme would be adopted.  You had first a report from the firm who made the survey, which report was submitted to three independent experts from three different countries in Europe. The terms were that there would be a board set up as we say, metaphorically, at arm's length from the Government controlling it, that that board would be debited with all capital costs, that they would then produce electricity and sell it to the public at a price which would pay the cost of production, the interest on the acutal sum advanced to them by the Government and sinking fund charges.  The Minister referred to the sum that had been previously advanced and to the sum to be advanced now, and added these two together to show the indebtedness of the board.  It was such a complex statement that I may easily have missed some of the details but, as the original proposal stood, the <Col N="2671" /> adding together of these two sums should not represent the indebtedness of the board now because in the intervening years the board have been not only paying interest on the capital advanced but they have been paying into a sinking fund to liquidate the debt to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will have noticed that there is a sort of triple control.  There is a board at arm's length from the Government; there is the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Judging from the Minister's statement the board itself decides whether a certain form of development would be desirable. They report to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the money is advanced by the Department of Finance on an assurance from the Department of Industry and Commerce that they are satisfied that such expenditure is necessary and is desirable. There has been a question about experts. One does not condemn a civil servant in any way by saying that he is not an expert physician, an expert engineer or an expert lawyer.  This is a job for engineers.  It seems to me that the Electricity Supply Board has expert engineers, and when they make a proposal to the Department of Industry and Commerce, I am not aware that the Department of Industry and Commerce has such experts, such specialists, as are able to decide whether or not a proposal of that kind from the board is what it purports to be.  I doubt, therefore, that the Department of Industry and Commerce is really technically competent to advise the Department of Finance that it should advance the money.  I have spoken about the provision of a sinking fund.  The Minister referred to a further sum of £150,000 odd advanced to the board in 1927.  One understands that perfectly well.  The structural works at Ardnacrusha took some years to complete.  The expenditure had to begin the moment the works began, although the remunerative production from those works would only begin after they were completed.  Consequently, during a period of years the electricity business was responsible for interest and sinking fund although it <Col N="2672" /> had no money coming in.  That money was advanced then.</P>
    <P>At a later date, a complex sort of crisis arose in connection with the whole matter, which I would not be competent to go into and which is irrelevant.  That was, I think, about 1931.  Since that further development has taken place.  The original understanding was that all the time the electricity produced would be sold to the people at such a price as would pay the running costs of production presumably, pay also for a reserve fund for wear and tear of machinery, pay interest to the Government on the full amount of money lent, and provide a sinking fund to liquidate that debt.  When we come to compare costs, the Minister gave the cost of electricity generated at the Pigeon House, at Clonsast and on the Liffey, etc.  He did not give us the way of arriving at that cost.  For instance, a unit of electricity consumed by a man in Cavan which has been generated in Ardnacrusha actually costs more than a unit of electricity consumed by a man in Limerick, Nenagh, or Cork, because you must take into account the capital involved in arranging for transmission to Cavan.  That transmission would be higher than if the area to be served was nearer to Ardnacrusha.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be. Actually in the matter of these costs there are a number of things to be taken into consideration, such as the cost of selling electricity from the Pigeon House works and how it compares, say, with Ardnacrusha.  We have to take into account the capital and the machinery and all the rest of the installation for producing.  Then we have to take the area over which it is to be transmitted.  The Minister calculates for electricity generated in Clonsast.  I did not gather from him over what area that is going to be transmitted.  If it is going to be transmitted over Connaught and so on, then you would have to calculate the cost in relation to the capital expenditure involved in providing for that transmission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2673" /> I do not like the bringing in of this Clonsast business for this purpose. This is really a departure from the original intention.  Originally it was decided, after a most exhaustive examination, that electricity could be generated, transmitted and distributed in this country from the water power of the Shannon at a price favourably comparable to the previous generation by coal, admitting that, so far as the Pigeon House was concerned at the time, as it was only distributing to Dublin, it might have been able to deliver to a local and concentrated body of consumers at a cheaper rate than could be done by Ardnacrusha, which was going to undertake to transmit all over the country.  It was worked out, so far as it is humanly possible to consider the conditioning influences, on a purely business basis practically at that time.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, there are three controllers&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance.  Now we bring in this matter of peat development.  The Department of Industry and Commerce are interested in quite a number of other things.  They are eminently concerned with the question of unemployment.  I do not like, if I may say so, the operation of the Department of Industry and Commerce in this.  I feel that, instead of what you might call that cold-blooded, unhuman, business-like, financial and mathematical consideration that was given to the original scheme, their warm-blooded, kind-hearted concern for a section of the community is going to come in and change the situation. Presumably, the electricity generated in Clonsast is going to be bulked in with that from the Liffey and the Shannon and, actually, if it costs more, it is not going to be registered in the price so much.</P>
    <P>The Minister then gave a reassuring statement with regard to the possibilities of Clonsast.  I do not pretend to be an expert in this matter, but it was rather ominous that what was aimed at reassuring us rather disconcerted me.  I happen to know that during the last war about £5,000,000 was expended <Col N="2674" /> by the Government of Sweden in the hope of developing peat.  The reason for that was that Sweden imported coal and during the war period they were unable to import coal there. Therefore, they turned to see if anything could be done by peat.  Sweden was particularly rich in water power. Therefore, I presume the importation of coal was quite independent of what could be provided by water power, as, for instance, electricity.  When the war ended, the Swedish Government did not say: &ldquo;We have spent £5,000,000 on peat; we must go ahead with this&rdquo;. They said: &ldquo;We can now get coal; the experiments with regard to peat that we carried out have been a failure, and we will wipe the £5,000,000 off as a bad debt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister compared the sort of consideration given to the Clonsast scheme with the earlier consideration with regard to Ardnacrusha.  It may be that I did not follow his detailed explanation sufficiently well, but, so far as I gathered, the analogy did not hold. As I have said with regard to Ardnacrusha, a very elaborate programme was set out to give every reassurance beforehand that the money we were going to spend was not going to be wasted.  We did not tell the engineers who came from abroad that they must assume that things here were just the same as in Germany, because things were very different.  We gave them&mdash; possibly they were not perfect&mdash; the records of rainfall over a long period.  There were certain advantages here.  On the Continent you have peak periods and low periods.  As I said in an interruption, on the Continent you have the melting snow period and you have rivers that are rushing torrents in the summer and that are practically dry beds in the winter.  So far as the Shannon is concerned, it is a bit higher at some periods, and a bit lower at others.</P>
    <P>With regard to peat, the Minister told us that during this year, although the full period allowed on the Continent for drying had not operated in Clonsast, they were able to produce about 50,000 tons as compared with the 120,000 tons that would be required. Now, as a matter of fact, everybody <Col N="2675" /> who has a farm or a garden knows that this year was a year in which we suffered considerably from drought. I doubt if this thing would have been quite so successful if it had been carried out in a year such as 1924. Senators will remember the year when there was a fuel shortage in the turf-burning areas, when the sheep developed fluke and so on, and when there was no day during 15 months when there was not rain.  The Minister suggested that the rainfall here is no higher than in the other countries of which he has records and that from the point of view of the other incidental differences between this country and those countries the position in this country is more promising.  My knowledge, as far as it goes, is quite the contrary.  In a Continental climate you normally have a severe winter, when the ground and the water are frozen, you have a rainy period, and then you have a long, hot summer.  The peculiarity of the non-Continental countries, of which we are eminently an example, is that you have very little difference between summer and winter.</P>
    <P>We actually have cold summers and warm winters, whereas in countries like Sweden or Germany they have hotter summers and colder winters. Now, if you have visited these countries or know them any way well, you will know that with that hot, dry period, which we only get during an occasional year in this country, you have very rapid drying.  Turf, to a certain distance under the soil in this country, remains very moist all through our summer.  In fact, we do have summers here when the turf would be even wetter at the end of the summer than it had been at the beginning, because of the moisture it contained as a result of heavy rain.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the drying process on the Continent, or rather to drainage, which is in fact a drying process.  Now, there you can, generally speaking, calculate much better than you can in this country.  If you compare five years of drainage in this country with five years such as we had in 1924, I do not think it would be nearly as effective as a comparison with five years ordinarily operating in a <Col N="2676" /> country like Sweden or Germany.  The Minister talks about setting up an £800,000 plant, and he quite frankly admits that the thing has a large experimental element in it, which we all accept, but I did gather from his own remarks that he was rather underestimating the experimental nature of this thing.  If you take the last seven years, I think we have had abnormally dry summers&mdash;at least as compared with a fairly long period before that. The Minister talked about continuous operation of production, but what I should have liked to have known was what was going to be the effect, so far as that plant is concerned, in the event of a bad year such as the 1924 year. The Minister's costings and his whole calculations on the economic side seem to me to be based upon getting, every year, 120,000 tons.  It may be that even if you got 240,000 tons this year and none next year that would be economically something different from getting 120,000 tons this year and 120,000 tons next year.  His speech did not convince me that full advertence had been given to the vagaries of our climate.  He says that drainage has only been operating in Clonsast for, I think, two years or three years, or something like that.  We have to take the five-year drainage and then, over a period of varying years, see what exactly is the condition of the turf for the production of electricity. On that point the Minister's statement did not seem to be convincing.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no doubt about it, we are a little sentimental about turf in this country.  We have looked around about this country and said that in this latitude this is the one country that produces turf to such a large extent, and we feel that something ought to be done about it, but there is no good in letting sentiment come into that sort of thing.  A project such as this should be approached in the coldest and even the most hard-hearted frame of mind and there should be a complete examination of it before the start.  I agree that when we were starting the beet sugar industry we said that it was an experiment, that we would put so much money into it, and that we would have to face up to the possibility that it might prove to be a very costly undertaking and that the money <Col N="2677" /> might go for nothing.  I am quite willing to accept that, and I would not hold with refusing the Minister the money required here unless we could be guaranteed that all the best that could come of it would be certain to come of it.  I am doubtful, however, of anything into which sentiment enters to such a degree as in the case of turf.  I do not agree with the Minister's statement about the examination that had been made and the consideration that was given to this matter.  The Minister's speech was remarkably frank and able, but it did seem to me that in that part of his speech he tended to indulge in a certain amount of wishful thinking.  In such an undertaking as this I think our approach should be that, as you might say, we should hope for the worst all the time.  The Minister made reference to what has been done, but this year the farmers were shouting out for rain&mdash;in Wexford, I think, the people could not get water because everything was dried up&mdash;and when I compare that with the year 1924, which is still quite painful memory to some of us, I ask: did these people, when making their calculations, take into account several years close to each other of the time of 1924?  Accordingly, on this matter of costings I was not convinced by the Minister's statement. It may be that I was not able to follow the Minister well enough.</P>
    <P>Again, when we embarked on the Shannon scheme there was a very complicated business.  It had to be a sort of business undertaking, and, as a business undertaking, you could not have it under ordinary Government control, such as the Minister's Department is subject to, with power of examination of files and to report on them under various headings.  Now, however, you have this peculiar situation. You have the board and the two Departments.  The main weak point of the Department of Industry and Commerce, or the main point on which it is attacked, is in dealing with matters of unemployment and so on. I do not see how the Department can be expected to rule out of their minds the consideration of the possibility of this thing giving employment.  I have seen examples of this sort of thing in <Col N="2678" /> the Minister's own Department, although I do not think he was in the Department at the time.  For instance, when we vote money for relief works the tradition has been that that money should be devoted to works in which at least 75 per cent. of the money voted would go in actual wages to workers and not more than 25 per cent. in the necessary material that would be bought for the doing of that work. Some years ago, when I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, a matter was brought to my notice, under the heading of the Department of Industry and Commerce, in which it appeared that, although there was this well-established principle, that of money voted for relief works 75 per cent. must actually go in wages to the workers, a proportion of that money so voted had been directed to experiments with the Drumm Battery, of which about 75 per cent. was spent on material and only 25 per cent. on labour.  It is the inverse way that I am afraid of here.  I am afraid that, with the operation of the Department&mdash;nobody is independent here&mdash;if the board think, in a purely business way, what is the most practical way to produce electricity and supply it to the consumers at the cheapest price, this particular Ministry, having in mind its duty to unemployed men and various other considerations, will give a certain weight to these considerations, and if that is so we shall not really be in a position to judge of the success of the experiment.  If you tell me that this is being done for the purpose of relieving unemployment, then I judge it according to the extent to which it has relieved unemployment, but if you tell me that this is a production enterprise, the purpose of which is to provide people with a commodity which is useful to them, and to provide it to them at a reasonably economic price, I can then judge the project by the production costs and by the price of the commodity.</P>
    <P>As one might mingle the two, it is almost inevitable, owing to the failure of human nature in these matters, that we are going to have certain complications.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to mention <Col N="2679" /> in this regard is that a Government Department now is able to anticipate a Vote by the Dáil.  When a Department requires something to be done it is generally done, and that being the case they know that it can be covered afterwards by a Supplementary Estimate.  The Electricity Supply Board was formed to correspond as nearly as possible to a business firm, and although the Minister has to come periodically to Parliament to ask for further capital sums of money, it is roughly equivalent to an industry that proposes to go in for new development, or to issue new shares and enlarge its capital indebtedness. It did seem to me that the board might occasionally actually commit itself in that way.  While the Minister gave an assurance that it only did so with the assent of the Department of Industry and Commerce, it might commit itself to expenditure before the money was voted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Another question that I wish to raise concerns interest and sinking fund.  We know that during the period of construction at Ardnacrusha, interest and sinking fund could not be provided for, but was made an addition to the capital advanced to the board.  I can see the same thing applying now in the case of the Liffey development scheme where we advanced money which has been spent while the work was going on.  The return for that expenditure can only begin when the project is completed.  I should like to have an assurance that from whatever date in 1927, as far as Ardnacrusha is concerned, electricity was generated, it is being sold at a price which enabled the board, without fail, to pay interest on the amount due to the Government and that, as far as any further development that has taken place since, it has fulfilled the obligation to provide interest and sinking fund.  That was a point I had in mind because from something the Minister said it seemed that that was not taking place.  I have no intention of opposing this Bill.  My position is such that if the Clonsast scheme does not work out, it seems to me I would not be in a position to criticise any failure.  What he said went far from convincing me that in voting the <Col N="2680" /> money it was going to turn out as rosy as he suggests.  Of course, I wish every success to the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that the expenditure has been justified and that any criticism which may be made in connection with it is purely of a minor nature.  There is the outstanding criticism all over the country that the valuation charges are a cause of grave dissatisfaction.  If they could be done away with, the consumption of electricity would undoubtedly increase but I understand that, for the moment at any rate, it is not possible to put the whole country on a unit basis.  The dream of extending electricity to rural areas will, unfortunately, remain a dream for quite a long time, as the expenditure in running lines all over the country would be too excessive. However, I wonder if it were possible to extend the scheme to the smaller villages by erecting transformer stations somewhere along the main roads; and into the rural areas, where it might be possible to get local farmers within a reasonable distance of the supply to co-operate by taking part in the erection of the lines to their own farms.  I think this has been done in other countries, when the country people who get the current into their own homes co-operate with the electricity companies in the erection of the lines.  Whether that would be possible in this country or not I cannot say; but, unless some such scheme as that is undertaken, I think we will have to wait a long time before we get current into the farmers' houses.  It is undoubtedly desirable, it would brighten rural life marvellously, and would put labour saving machinery into the hands of many farmers now unable to avail of it.</P>
      <P>Most of the criticism so far has been directed against the proposed Clonsast scheme.  For many years we have been talking about turf.  We have had magazine articles, letters to the papers and lectures dealing with the undeveloped resources of Ireland; and amongst these resources we are told that the greatest lies in our bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2681" /> Now, when an attempt is made really to utilise the bogs, it has aroused a storm of criticism.  On the whole, the scheme is worthy of support.  In the first place, one of the reasons put forward in the past for the utilisation of the bogs has been that we substitute a local&mdash;an Irish&mdash;material for a foreign material in the provision of fuel and power.  The present moment is rather an opportune one to stress that point. At any moment, our supplies from abroad may be cut off.  To a great extent we are to-day dependent still on foreign coal.  We never know the moment when that supply may be stopped.  Perhaps we would then realise the value of developing our Irish substitute&mdash;turf.</P>
    <P>In regard to this proposed electricity scheme at Clonsast, I wonder how many Senators remember the film which was shown throughout the country a few years ago depicting what has been done in Germany in connection with electricity and turf.  Senators who saw that film will remember, probably, that from a bog in, I think, Northern Germany there was produced about one-third of the amount of electricity which we produce from the Shannon.  In addition to the production of electricity, they initiated a very interesting agricultural scheme.  They produced vegetables of all descriptions on the cut-away bog, and out-of-season vegetables were sold in Norway and other countries at very enhanced prices, by thus utilising the waste land in the places where they had generated electricity. It would be very interesting if that scheme were examined.  I suppose it would not be hard to get a copy of that film.  Many of us who saw it were very much impressed by it, and, if the scheme were to be taken on here, I believe it would have a very good effect.  Clonsast is a start in that direction.  Undoubtedly, the electricity generated there will be a very valuable stand by.  It will be independent of foreign coal, independent even of water power, and I think it will be one of the very best things we could do in making a start in the utilisation of our bogs.  When the Clonsast scheme is in full operation, it will be consuming 120,000 tons of turf in the year, and that is supposed to last about 25 years.  Four <Col N="2682" /> thousand acres of reclaimed bog land in those parts, as a consequence, will have become valuable agricultural land.  If, in addition to the generation of electricity and the provision of fuel, we were able, by means of this scheme, to add 4,000 acres to our present acreage of arable land, it would, in my opinion, be a very valuable thing.  On the whole, I think the scheme is very well worthy of support, and that any criticism of it should be sympathetic. In a matter of this kind, it is not alone the immediate financial return that should be looked to, but rather the valuable effect it is going to have on the economy of the country in the future.  As I have said, if, apart from anything else, we are going to add 4,000 acres to the area of our arable land, and turn what is now waste into good land for the production of food for our people, it must be admitted, I think, that the idea behind the scheme is a good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the plea made, first, by Senator McEllin, and afterwards by Senator Goulding, that consideration for the electrification of the country should have the Minister's attention.  I know, of course, that a proposition of that kind is not one that can be faced immediately.  Senator Goulding suggested a line of approach in connection with this matter that we should like to feel the Minister would keep in mind.  I am largely concerned with the effect of this measure on the lives of the women of the country.  Everyone realises that if we want to settle people on the land we must have the women's co-operation.  Their help is essential, and in no department of our national life is that more important than in the case of those who live on the land. Without an efficient help-mate, the farmer is in a very difficult position. When we ask and hope that women should become, not only farmers' wives but good farmers' wives, we should do everything possible to see that the drudgery of their occupation is not made too excessive, and hence should do everything possible to ease their burdens.  To do so would give them courage.  Skill and brains are needed in the making of good farmers' wives. <Col N="2683" /> If electric power were available on our farms it would, in my opinion, help to ease the burden of the farmer's wife a great deal and make life generally more attractive for her.  A number of Senators have referred to the use of electricity outside the farmer's home: how it could be availed of for different farming operations.  I am more concerned with the use of it in the farmer's house.  There is, first of all, the use of electricity for lighting purposes in the home.  If the war continues for a long period that, perhaps, is going to be a problem in the future, and we cannot go back to the Dark Ages.  A well-lighted home is usually a happy home, and the women cannot be expected to do their work if they have not proper light.  There is no reason, for instance, why the drudgery associated with washing, ironing, churning and various other tasks in the home should not be relieved by the help of electricity.  We have to get away from the old idea that a woman's time does not matter.  I remember reading many years ago, when incubators were first put on the market, of a man who called on a farmer to sell one. The salesman dilated on the qualities of the incubator, spoke of the time that it took the hens to hatch out the eggs, and said the incubator would do that in far less time.  The farmer's comment was: &ldquo;What do I care about the hen's time.&rdquo;  I am afraid that is the attitude of a great many to a woman's time.  Now a woman's time is most valuable.  I think it is one of the most valuable assets we have in the country.  Therefore, I would plead with the Minister to bear in mind, in any future development that takes place, that electricity should be made available, if possible, in every home in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Goulding spoke of the present system of charging for electricity on the valuation.  That is a matter which I also desire to refer to. I have heard a great many complaints in Galway about this valuation charge. A deputation came to see me about it, and asked me to mention the matter here.  In response to my request they promised to supply me with figures.  I <Col N="2684" /> have not the figures here, and, therefore, cannot go into them.  I feel justified, however, in referring to the matter, because if we want to make a success of the scheme we should not do anything that would leave anyone labouring under a sense of grievance. Galway should not be left with a sense of grievance in this matter, particularly as it is not very far away from the source of supply.  Senator Fitzgerald seemed to argue that the nearer one is to the source of supply the cheaper should be the charge for current. As I have not got the figures relating to Galway before me, I cannot say whether there is any truth in the contention that Galway is paying a higher rate than it should, owing to the operation of this valuation charge&mdash;a higher rate than, say, Leitrim is paying.  In the absence of figures I am not able to speak on that, but if Galway has a legitimate grievance in this matter, then I should like the Minister to bear the matter in mind, and perhaps make the necessary representations to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the plea made by Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich and a number of other Senators on the question of pensions for the staff of the Electricity Supply Board.  It may be more or less out of order to raise it because we have been given to understand that the question is one that does not come under the present Bill.  Senators have emphasised that the Electricity Supply Board is costing the taxpayer nothing. I think it should be within the power of the Electricity Supply Board to formulate a pension scheme for its officials and employees, even though that might perhaps require the sanction of the Department of Finance. On the general question, I think it would be a good thing for any large institution to make provision for its employees when they reach the retiring age.  It would be in the interests of the State that it should do so, for one thing it would have the effect of lessening the cost of old age pensions. The ideal situation would be that any large institution or society would make provision out of its own resources for its officers and staff on reaching retiring age.  A number of the officials of the Electricity Supply Board who were taken over from the Dublin Corporation have their pension rights secured.  The position, therefore, is this: that you may have two officials in the Electricity Supply Board working side by side, one with pension rights, and the other with none.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that the position of officials in the Electricity Supply Board who are without pension rights is taken into account as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The other point that occurs to me concerns the supply of electric power to the rural population, not merely villages or towns with a population of 500, but the rural parts generally.  In my opinion, a great service would be rendered to the country if some technician could devise some means of transforming the high voltage supply passing through the country so that it could be tapped by every farmer and by the rural community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I am speaking out of my ignorance of these matters, but if some <Col N="2686" /> electrical engineer could devise a scheme whereby the current passing through these wires could be on tap for the farmers, without the difficulty of having poles for transmission purposes, it would be a great boon to these people.  I am probably urging an impossibility, but, while it may not be easily possible and while it may be a little expensive, it would surely be a magnificent thing if power and light were available to the farmers throughout the country.  I suggest that we should concentrate not only on supplying electricity to villages with more than 500 population, but that some effort should be made to supply the farmers with this all-important lighting and heating.  There would then be a further argument against the flight to the cities and towns because, without these amenities I speak of, the difference between town and country life is accentuated.</P>
    <P>There is one point which does not seem to have been referred to, that is, the value of having three sources of supply in case of failure or of damage to any one.  We all hope that we will not be visited by warfare in any form, but it would be very easy to put the Pigeon House out of action with one bomb.  Ardnacrusha is also vulnerable, and could easily be put out of action, so that if other arguments did not hold in regard to the value of the Clonsast supply, I think it very important that, in these times of war, we should have a third source of supply.  I understand that at present the network can tap the two existing sources and Clonsast will likewise be linked up with that network, and I think it very important that we should have this current source of supply, whether the current be generated by turf, coal or water.  I want to emphasise again the position of workers and officials in a large employing body such as this, and to urge that their position should be rectified as quickly as possible.  It would be in the interests of the State that all large bodies such as this should provide for the old age and retiring time of their workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker in his references to the extension of the lighting supply to the rural <Col N="2687" /> areas, but, in the early stages of the Shannon scheme, we were led to believe that it was intended not only to provide light for the towns and cities but also to help industry.  As a creamery manager, I know cases where transmission poles are beside creameries, yet the creamery authorities cannot use the current to run these creameries.  Coal which, some 18 months ago, could be purchased for 36/- a ton is now practically £3 a ton and the only alternative which cooperative societies have is the installation of crude oil engines.  They cannot continue on the basis of the present cost of coal and it is surprising that, while power is available convenient to these places, no matter what representations are made to the board, the people representing the creameries are told that the initial cost of transferring that power to a creamery would be such that no body of farmers could attempt to have it installed.  As Senator Mrs. Concannon says that is one point in relation to the rural areas. Not only would this power be used for running creameries, but creameries would be in a position&mdash;a position of which they are prepared to take advantage now in view of the food the farmers have to produce and have to feed to their cattle&mdash;to instal small machines to grind oats, barley and wheat so that the farmer could go to the creamery in the morning, give them his stuff and find it ready for him the following morning.  I think that the more use they could make of this power, the more it would repay the board in the sense that overhead charges would be much the same and the more electricity consumed, the more it would be to the board's benefit.  I want to emphasise strongly that the people of rural Ireland are very much disappointed that they have got no facilities so far as the Shannon scheme is concerned. It was supplied to the big towns and cities but not to rural Ireland.  They are entitled surely to at least some concession in that respect and I hope the Minister will tell us that, later on, it will be possible to have that power diverted to the creameries and to the local industries of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very illuminating discussion on this subject. I personally do not object at all to the suggestion that the rural population should get all the illuminating facilities and advantages of electricity, and I endorse very largely many of the things said.  There is, however, one very important point which has not been touched yet, and I am very glad the Minister is here, because I hope that I may be able to make some impression upon him in relation to it.  We all remember&mdash;I think it was in 1925 or thereabouts&mdash;a great industrial strike which took place in England which resulted in the dairying industry, and particularly the butter-making industry in the country I come from and in the sourthern counties generally, coming practically to a standstill because of its dependence upon coal from another country.  It was the first time they experimented largely in the utilisation of turf for fuel and it saved the situation.  Otherwise, the position might have been disastrous.  At the time, I was impressed by the dependence of our people on the other country for fuel.  If there were alternatives capable of development, the whole initiative and energy of the State should have been thrown into an effort to avoid the danger of such dependence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of this question has not been touched upon to-day.  This is a burning question with my council over a number of years.  Seventy-five per cent. of the material which the country council of which I am a member uses in their institutions is native.  With the co-operation of the county surveyor, we have used the best turf we could get.  As I told the House before, we budget for about £100,000 for road work&mdash;the breaking of stones and so forth.  Yet 75 per cent. of our requirements in fuel is met from home production. That is a very important matter. Light is beautiful and advantageous. It brightens the towns and it is accommodating and economic in every way. One thing has not been touched upon, however, although it is fundamental&mdash; the provision of roads or boreens which will enable farmers and rural residents, generally, including the poor people, to go into the boglands.  In the western <Col N="2689" /> part of my county there are acres and acres of peat incapable of development because the roads only touch their fringe.  Anyone who knows rural conditions is aware of the appalling hardships imposed upon the people who cut and use turf.  I use turf myself.  You go to the bog and, as some speakers have said, you are dependent on the vagaries of the weather.  Last summer was most inviting and we had none of the trouble which is experienced in wet seasons.  In the wet seasons, you see farmers and poor men going in with donkeys and trying to haul out the turf. The donkey gets &ldquo;bogged&rdquo; and everybody has to go in and try to haul him out.  Half the load has to be taken off him and then has to be put up again.</P>

      <P>I admit that but there were so many irrelevancies that I thought I would claim the indulgence of the House to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter which, I think, is fundamental in the development of peat and which is very important for the rural population.  Thousands of pounds have been spent on the development of Clonsast.  An infinitesimal part of the amount spent would, if given to the county councils for this purpose, have made roads and boreens into thousands of acres of peat.  In the western part of my county, we cannot go near large areas of peat because of the lack of roads. The Cathaoirleach has called me to order.  I merely wanted to make a point which had not been made previously. As this House has been talking about the development of peat, <Col N="2690" /> some consideration should be given by the Minister to the aspect of the matter to which I have directed attention. Seventy-five per cent. of our people depend on the prosperity of agriculture and we would be accommodating them by giving them the roads which I have recommended.  My council could have bought a lot of turf but we had no roads on which the lorries could travel close enough to the turf.  The people had to cart it miles and miles to reach a road which the lorries could travel.  These few words of mine may not be pertinent to this Bill but they ought to be borne in mind in the interests of the agricultural community and of agriculture as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Shannon scheme has done nothing to brighten rural Ireland and it has been of no service to agriculture.  That is what one hears from every group of agriculturists. A huge amount of money has been spent and no good has resulted to the main industry of the country.  Several speakers have stressed the importance of developing this side of the undertaking and electrifying rural Ireland.  I wonder if the water power of this country has been fully utilised.  No power is cheaper than water power and I doubt whether our resources in that respect have been completely utilised.  If not, it would be well for the Minister to direct his attention to the possibilities, because we have creameries and other large concerns using huge quantities of crude oil for power and light.  The time may come&mdash;and it may not be far off&mdash;when their supplies will run short and it would be well to have schemes to take their place.  I have in mind the harnessing of some of the smaller rivers for the purpose of giving local supplies of power and light&mdash;something on the lines of what we read regarding the Swiss plan.  The Swiss appear to have a great many small schemes instead of one big scheme, such as we have here. I ask the Minister to direct his mind and the minds of his experts to the possibility of exploiting the water power of the country to the full.  On my own farm I have a small electric outfit, worked from a stream, and it <Col N="2691" /> gives heat, light and power to the house and farmyard.  It has made a complete change in the life of the family since it was installed.  I should like to see some scheme on that line developed.  There are plenty of mountain streams which could be utilised if the State would come along and give a lead.  I was 15 years trying to develop my own scheme and I could not get very wise direction from any of the electricians I consulted.  The State should come along and give a lead to people who may be in the position in which I was.  I do not know whether a leaflet could be published by the Department of Agriculture on the subject or whether the State could not give aid of some other kind, but certainly I think it is very desirable that some scheme should be in hand whereby creameries could operate water power for carrying on their work. The Clonsast scheme is a good scheme perhaps, but it is purely experimental and we will have to wait and see whether it turns out to be as good as we hope it will be.  If it proves successful, apparently, there will be turf mines, or gold mines, in Limerick and more in Cork.  Even apart from the generating of electricity, if the scheme is successful, it will be a great boon, and I think it is well worth the expenditure of the money and energy that will be put into it.</P>

      <P>I would like, too, to congratulate the Minister on his very magnificent explanation of this whole question, the question of the development of electric power in general and the development of electric power from peat in particular.  The debate here to-night brought forward some very interesting points, but from reading over the debate in the other House and from listening to the numerous speakers here, I am more than ever convinced of the truth of the old saying that there are none so blind as those who refuse to see.  It is significant that the speakers in opposition to this Bill who were particularly critical of the development of Clonsast were the very people who either politely declined or definitely refused <Col N="2692" /> to accept an invitation to visit the works at Clonsast.  I do not want to mention names, but I was amused to hear some of the speakers here to-day who were quite prepared to attack the Turf Development Board and all its works and pomps, knowing, as I do, that they failed to avail themselves of an opportunity to acquire the information which would be necessary for anybody who wished to make a sensible speech on this particular subject. It is quite obvious that many of the people who have attacked this Bill and who have attacked the scheme for turf development have done so because of their lack of sufficient knowledge of the problem.  Various speakers have pointed out the reasons why the thing could not be a success, and after the rather elaborate debate in the Dáil, led by Deputy Dillon&mdash;who was one of the people who failed to accept various invitations to go down and see the bog &mdash;we have numerous so-called experts, scientists and technicians of one kind and another rushing into the Press to find fault with what was being done.</P>
      <P>As we have had lectures from several people, I suppose it would not be out of place for me to deliver what might be styled another little lecture.  There might be a difference.  Some people would say there would not be any difference, but there would be a difference in so far as I would know what I was talking about and many of the other people who have already delivered lectures did not know what they were talking about.  The fact is that there are two types of turf being produced at the present time commercially. There is the one type of turf which is generally known as machine-won turf.  That turf in its finished state is very little different in appearance from the ordinary sod of turf with which most people here are familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The turf is won by machinery; it is spread by machinery; it is collected by machinery and the rest of the work is practically done by hand labour. That type of turf is at the present time being produced in Clonsast, at Turraun and at Lyracrompane. The other type of turf is the briquette turf.  Many people may not be familiar with the history of the briquette industry, <Col N="2693" /> which is located at Lullymore and, because of their ignorance of the facts, they are inclined to mix up one type of turf with the other.  As I pointed out, they are two different things altogether and the concerns were run by two different bodies.  The briquette is a compressed type of fuel, which would be very particularly suited for city dwellers.  It is a very excellent type of fuel and very convenient for small houses, for city flats and for places of that type.  I am not suggesting by any means that it would not be an excellent fuel for the production of power and the production of light or any of the other purposes which could be served by ordinary turf or ordinary fuel of any type.</P>
    <P>As I say, there have been numerous criticisms of the proposed development, and the peculiar thing about this criticism is that it is entirely contradictory. On the one hand we have people saying that they are not quite so sure that this turf development business will be a success; that the Turf Development Board should have consulted some experts before they went ahead, before they even started on the development of any one bog.  On the other hand, there are so-called experts telling us that the Turf Development Board should be properly advised on this subject, and that they should not treat the Irish bogs on the same lines as people have treated the bogs of other countries; that they were two different propositions altogether.  That may be excusable, if you like, for people who do not set themselves up as experts, but for people who would seriously set themselves up as experts on this particular problem I think it is unpardonable.</P>
    <P>Here to-day there were some Senators, probably influenced by this kind of what I would call &ldquo;anti-turf&rdquo; propaganda, who, with an air of superiority, an air of knowledge of this particular type of business, told us that we should take into consideration the rainfall in this country and the rainfall on the Continent, the various conditions here and the various conditions&mdash;presumably much better&mdash;on the Continent, apparently by way of advice to the Minister that he should be a little bit more cautious before <Col N="2694" /> allowing himself to be &ldquo;walked into&rdquo; something by these people, the members of the Turf Development Board.  I do not propose to set myself up here as a defender of the Turf Development Board or its very excellent secretary or its very excellent staff.  I propose merely to treat Senator Hayes' remarks with the contempt they deserve, but in connection with the conditions here as compared with conditions elsewhere, the only thing I can say is that the Turf Development Board has gone very deeply into all that business.  They have had the advice of experts on the Continent and everywhere else that they could possibly procure them.  They have had the advice of the most successful firm on the Continent at every step of the proceedings. They have had men sent over from the Continent by that particular firm and by other firms to advise them along every inch of the road until such time as a situation developed when it was no longer possible to have these experts.  Fortunately, the Turf Development Board were not cursed with the inferiority complex possessed by several members of this and the other House.  They immediately set to work, before any such situation developed, to procure the best available men in this country.  In fact, some Irishmen were brought back from foreign countries so that we would be in a position to carry on if and when anything occurred in Central Europe. As a result of that, we have to-day men who in any other country would, in my estimation at any rate, be called experts in this particular line of business. With regard to that subject, there are some points that Senators might find interesting.  It is a fact that the rainfall in parts of some continental countries, where turf is being produced, is greater than the rainfall here, even in a normal year.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also a fact that the periods of winning here are longer than in any other country in Europe.  It is a fact, too, that the conditions in the bogs here are better than the conditions on the bogs in practically any country in Europe.  When I say that the conditions in our bogs are better, I mean that we have less obstruction in the way of submerged wood.  When they have machines working on bogs in other countries, they often have to scrape up submerged logs and trees and shovel the liquid peat into the macerator.  In this country it is not unusual to run into some wood obstructions when working on a bog, but it is quite unusual&mdash;indeed, it can scarcely happen&mdash;to run into obstructions which tend to smash up the machinery or hold up the process of turf cutting for long periods.</P>
      <P>Even in this country the drying conditions vary.  There are people who may tell you that the drying conditions here are totally different to the drying conditions in other countries.  All I can say is that the weather here varies almost in every country and the drying conditions are definitely different on any of the bogs that we have worked so far. The difficulty in part of this country is that the turf dries too quickly.  The position is more or less the same as when you are saving hay.  When you have the turf spread, you have to go at it with a rush the same as with hay and get the turf harvested in the shortest possible time; otherwise it will crack and fray and deteriorate. Reference has been made to the possibility of a wetter season than we have had this year.  I admit that the last season was especially favourable for turf production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note an important feature in regard to machine-won turf. All machine-won turf is largely proof against bad weather.  I do not say that you could save turf satisfactorily if it kept raining all through the summer, but that never happens.  In the process of machine-winning turf a sort of skin is formed on it and while this will let moisture out, it will not take in any moisture.  It might keep raining for days and the machine-won turf will be almost as dry as before the <Col N="2696" /> rain started.  That may be thought an exaggeration, but if it is, the exaggeration is a very slight one.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald made great play with the Minister's statement that 50,000 tons of turf were produced this year and he pointed out that because this year was so terribly dry it would be most unreasonable to suggest that 120,000 tons could be produced in two or three years' time.  The fact is, as the Minister pointed out, that 50,000 tons of turf were produced by three machines and the total lay-out is to consist of six machines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you the other machines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in course of production.  They are being produced in this country, and we believe they can be produced satisfactorily in this country.  When the war started, machines were actually being shipped from the continent and they were turned back in mid-ocean, but the Turf Development Board was not so much asleep as some people in this and the other House seem to think.  They placed contracts for the machines in this country; they are being built here and will be available in due course.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the machines already in operation have been worked by men largely inexpert in that type of work.  Notwithstanding that the machines have been worked by men who never had training&mdash;some of them never saw a machine of that type until last year&mdash;and notwithstanding that the men who were expert were taken away in the middle of the job, the machines have produced almost all that was expected of them under the most favourable conditions.  That is a guarantee that turf can be produced. I believe it can be and the only question that remains is the price at which it can be produced.  There are several things that may interfere with the production of turf, beet, and other things within the next 12 months, but, so far as we can see, there is no reason why anyone should lie awake at night over the possibilities of developing turf in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Goulding pointed out, it is very easy to criticise anybody who proceeds to carry out a job; it is easy <Col N="2697" /> to find people ready to criticise anything of a positive or constructive nature.  The most remarkable thing is that we have the Press of the country ready to jump in and give publicity to growlers, groaners, and complainers. Anyone who is prepared to complain or criticise will get all the publicity in the world.  It is a pity that some people adopt that attitude rather than the attitude adopted by other people who have spoken here and who have pointed out that there is no necessity to be pessimistic, that turf has been produced in this country for centuries and will be produced in the future.  One would imagine that turf is something new and that it was never produced here before.  Everybody knows it has been used as a very excellent fuel here for as long as history can record.</P>
    <P>I believe we should go into the production of turf in a more energetic manner.  We should use native fuel and other native products to the greatest possible extent.  We should use turf as much as we can, particularly as we may be left without coal supplies.  I do not think a reasonable argument can be put up against the development of turf.  We have heard it argued that the expenditure is very great, but nobody has presented us with an alternative.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald has pointed out that before the Shannon scheme was put into operation there were many cities and towns in the country that produced their own electricity through the medium of coal.  Is anyone prepared to suggest that we should continue to make ourselves dependent on shipments of coal?  Is it suggested that we should enlarge on that particular system and increase our coal imports at a time when we cannot know when the next shipment will come in?  Is it the idea of some Senators that we should insist on employing the workers of other countries and continue to give assistance to our people when they are idle?  I do not think that is the idea of most of our people. I think the general idea is that we should employ our young people as far as possible to produce the necessaries of life for those who live in our own land.</P>
    <P>I see some Senators here who did <Col N="2698" /> not accept the invitation to go down to Clonsast bog and to learn a little about turf production before they started to discuss it here.  I renew the invitation to these Senators to come down to the bog.  I will bring them down in threes or fours any day they wish to go.  If they went down there and saw the conditions under which the workers are living in a sort of village scheme, with housing accommodation and a plot attached to each house, within easy distance of the bog, I think they would agree that if on no ground other than the fact that work was being provided for these men under such conditions, Clonsast has justified itself.  There are various other factors which could be put forward as an argument in favour of this turf development scheme, but I think that anybody listening to the speeches of the Minister here and in the other House could not fail to be convinced that it is a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>Some speakers here suggested that experts should have been consulted, and they pointed out that at the time the Shannon scheme was initiated, experts from abroad were brought in and consulted. They asked who was consulted in this case.  I am sufficient of an optimist to believe that the staff of the Turf Development Board, having had the experience that they have had in their own work, are quite as good experts in this work as the engineers of any other country.  The engineers connected with the Turf Development Board are all in their own way experts in this matter.  In any case, despite all the criticism we have had of the present system of developing turf, no alternative has been put up.  We have had any amount of suggestions that it should be done in some other way, but no speaker specified the way in which it should be done.  The fact is that the job is being done satisfactorily at present. The development of machine-won turf will, to a large extent, solve the problem of fuel in the rural areas. The provision of briquettes will, in my opinion, solve the problem to a large extent of fuel for the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Senator MacCabe I think it was, who, in his enthusiasm for rural electrification, <Col N="2699" /> suggested that creameries should provide themselves with crude oil engines.  He did not ask my views on that question but if anybody did, I would tell him that in my opinion the wind is blowing from a very bad direction at present for the provision of crude oil plant.  I would suggest that the Senator should get in turf-burning plant and, as Senator Madden pointed out, he need not go to foreign countries for a precedent.  He need only go to Limerick, where he would find that long before there was any propaganda about turf development or machine-won turf, the county council ran their steam-rollers on nothing else but turf. With regard to Senator Madden's suggestion about the old bog road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very much in favour of the old bog road, and I would be in favour of spending as much money as possible on old bog roads.  I would go as far as anybody in that direction.  Not very long ago, I was over in the Department of Finance to see if a grant could be obtained for that purpose, and I could not believe my ears when I heard what the man in the office told me.  He asked: &ldquo;Do you realise what you are asking us to do?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I do well.  I am asking you to repair a bog road, to make a passage for people in a very bad area.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;I want to tell you&mdash; and this is not for publication&mdash;we have spent more money repairing bog roads in the last three, four or five years than would float three or four outfits like Clonsast bog.&rdquo;  I do not know, of course, whether that is true or not.</P>

      <P>I am glad to admit that, unlike my attitude in regard to a great many schemes of industrial development we have had, I have very considerable sympathy with these efforts to develop the immense natural resources we have in our turf bogs.  I have more regard, however, for the economic aspect of the problem than Senator Quirke seems to have.  He gave me the impression that so long as <Col N="2700" /> it is a bog that is in question, it does not matter what it costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give a little illustration of what is in my mind.  He talked of briquettes as solving the problem of the urban turf consumer. I understand that the effort to produce briquettes so far has been a complete commercial failure and that the plant that was used for the production of briquettes is now closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of explanation, might I say that the briquette factory has been opened again by the Turf Development Board at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce? It is now hoped that, with a small capital investment, it will be possible to produce briquettes at an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything is a hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator Quirke that he is on rather dangerous ground in following that line of argument.  The production of commercial briquettes failed or, rather, the experiment was requiring more and more capital.  I understand that the capital involved up to a certain date has been written off as a loss.  Obviously, if you write off capital it means that that capital is lost; but if you use the assets which that capital purchased for a further venture you may be able to show a profit or rather to minimise the loss in future.  So far there is nothing but the hope which the Turf Development Board entertain that this briquette fuel is going to be a commercial proposition, to suggest that the Turf Board may be able to do what the commercial people failed to do.  That remains to be seen.  Another aspect of the matter has been referred to and, incidentally, I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to be specific on the point.  Was there any report by experts as to the possibilities of using turf to produce electricity <Col N="2701" /> and, if there was a report, why has that report not been made public like the previous reports in regard to hydro-electrification?  It may be said that there is nothing expert in it, that everybody knows that turf, like coal, can be made to generate steam and that that in due course will generate electricity.  I should like to ask the Minister, however, has there been any report on the technical and economic aspect of the production of electricity from turf and, if such a report has been made, why has it not been published?</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke rather suggested that nobody wanted to use coal for the development of electricity.  I should not be at all surprised if you went to the Electricity Supply Board, if they had complete freedom of choice without any national or political embarrassment and asked them to decide on purely technical grounds which is the cheapest fuel for the production of electricity, that they would say coal. I understand that at the present time the costings in regard to the Pigeon House generation show it to be cheaper than any other form, bearing in mind the capital cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I gave to the House do not substantiate that statement.  It is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to contradiction on the point.  One feature of the problem is that there is great difficulty&mdash;and I am sure the Minister experiences that difficulty&mdash;in reconciling the more or less sentimental or national aspect with the economic aspect.  It is undoubtedly desirable, if possible, even at a little extra cost, to use home fuel for the generation of electricity but the point is whether the sentimental, political or national side of the question counter-balances the increased cost.  For that purpose I think it is most essential to have the turf production costings quite separate from the electrical production costings. There will be a great danger that in order to show electricity production from turf in the most favourable light, they will charge any raw material at the lowest possible price.  Therefore, I ask the Minister: Is it intended to <Col N="2702" /> have accurate and complete costings, based on all capital charges and revenue, of course, as to the production of the turf the Electricity Supply Board will get as raw material?  Will those costings in due course be published in the report of the Turf Development Board and audited, not as general financial accounts, but as proper, separate process costings? That is essential if we are going to judge the economic value of the scheme.</P>
      <P>There is another point on which I should like the Minister's assurance, namely, that there has been no pressure, direct or indirect, put upon the Electricity Supply Board to use turf against their better judgment.  I admit that the Government are the masters. If the Government wish turf to be used, it is quite within their competence to instruct or order the Electricity Supply Board to use it.  But, as at present constituted, I understand that the Electricity Supply Board are an independent autonomous body set up to show results on their own judgment and unfettered by any outside control.  I hope we will have an assurance from the Minister that that formula, if we may call it so, still holds good.  If the Government in their wisdom as masters wish to impose any form of production on the Electricity Supply Board which the board do not approve of, the public should be so informed and, possibly, the Electricity Supply Board should be given some form of subsidy or extraneous grant to make good what the uneconomic deficit would amount to.  I understood from the Minister that there are going to be separate costings for all forms of electrical production, in fact for all stations; that the Poulaphouca scheme will be separately costed and also the Pigeon House and Clonsast.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me when he replies if I am mistaken on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a good deal of discussion on this question of rural electrification. On the face of it, it sounds very attractive, but it has to be examined from its economic aspect.  I understand that when the Electricity Supply Board was originally set up there was a proposal that electricity should be on a flat rate, and that there <Col N="2703" /> should be no difference in the charge paid by a rural consumer and an urban consumer.  That principle was not accepted, and now the cost has some bearing on the charge.  I understand&mdash; I may be wrong&mdash;that in the densely populated areas, where the cost is less, the charge is somewhat less, and in the more expensive areas the charge is slightly greater.  I should like to be put right if I am wrong on that point.</P>
    <P>Surely that principle must apply if you are going to embark on rural electrification.  It will be obviously much more expensive to carry the lines to distant farms, and there will be extraordinary overhead charges for very small consumption.  In that case it would be most unfair that the productive city consumers should pay, through an increased charge, for that very unproductive item.</P>
    <P>If the Government in their wisdom wish to develop rural electrification, I suggest that they should work somewhat on this basis: the Electricity Supply Board should be asked how much this rural electrification will cost and, if the charge is considered too high for the farmer to pay, the Government should give a direct subsidy out of the pockets of the taxpayers to pay the difference.  I do not say that that would be acceptable from the point of view of the taxpayer, but I think it is a sound method.  I do not think it would be fair to make the consumer in the cities, where distribution is cheap, pay a higher charge for the benefit of the rural consumer.  These are the only remarks I have to make on this measure.  I very much hope that this experiment in the development of electricity from turf will prove a success. I hope that at all stages the facts will be set before the public and that there will be no attempt to mask or cover the essential economic side of the whole business.</P>

      <P>Whatever Senator Quirke may think, I am quite sure the Minister will feel that Senators have been in a very sympathetic mood in listening to his statement and will watch with sympathy and hope the development of this scheme which he has put before the House.  If people <Col N="2704" /> are critical, I do not think that fault ought to be found with them, especially by Senator Quirke.  Of all men in public life, I am sure that there are very few who have denounced in all the moods and tenses as he has all the constructive methods of the men who have gone before.</P>

      <P>That is perhaps in our Irish nature.  It is not easy to make a saint out of a sinner in a day.  If it happens, it is so noticeable that we all sit up and take notice of the fact. I was a member of the other House when the Shannon scheme was introduced and, frankly, in those days I felt exhilarated at the prospects and the hopes that I thought were embodied in that scheme.  This Bill is not anything like on the same level.  One cannot be just as enthusiastic about it.  While the Minister gave a very full explanation, we had not all the wealth of detail and all the help that foreign experts could give in elucidating the possibilities of the scheme for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the people of the country are all anxious that whatever power resources we have got should be developed to the full.  Personally, it has always been my attitude that all our power, the power of our land, of our money, and of our men and women should be developed to the full.  In so far as there are possibilities and potentialities in the Minister's scheme we are all with him.  It would be well if Senator Quirke would approach the matter from that angle, rather than from the somewhat contentious angle from which he did approach the question.  It seems to me that, in a way, there are two separate questions in this Bill.  I find it difficult to know whether we are primarily concerned with the development of our peat bogs or with the generation of electricity from our bogs.  If we are concerned primarily with the development of our bogs&mdash;and Senator Quirke's speech would lead me to think that that is the principle or that that is his conception of what State policy is to be&mdash;that is one matter.  If we are concerned, then, about the development of our bogs, it seems to me that we ought to have a <Col N="2705" /> proper survey made of our bogs in a way which we have not done yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, my view is that we ought to have a bog policy, but we have not got it.  That is, if this scheme is a policy for the development of our bogs, I think we have not got a bog policy for the country as a whole. I shall just deal with that from my angle, and perhaps I know a good deal more about bogs even than Senator Quirke, with all respect to whatever technical information he may have got within the last couple of years.  I do not know if Senator Quirke has dug down as many spits of bog as I have dug down, in all kinds of bogs, both hill bogs and lowland bogs as well, but in regard to the problem of our bogs I suggest that we ought to have a bog policy.  You had one a few years ago and, in my view, that could very easily have been disastrous.  When you know the country, when you know the economy of the country and of the small farmers, when you know what a stretch of bog or a small portion of bog adjacent to, or perhaps even a somewhat remote distance from, a small holding may mean in the economy of that holding, and when you propagate a policy which will encourage a great many people to cut away the fuel, which for practical purposes may be regarded as being the same as food, when you cut away that turf, win it as we say, and export it out of these country districts altogether&mdash;and that is what you did encourage these people to do&mdash;nothing can be more disastrous, in my opinion, than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2706" /> Some Senators may not understand this problem, but I am sure other Senators do.  Perhaps Senator Hawkins understands it, but I myself have seen Connemara, which is inevitably being made into a desert by the inhabitants, but they have no alternative.  When you see them, in order to exist, cutting to the very tops of the rocks, you can see what it must reach some day.  The policy that you had with regard to bogs a few years ago, of cutting away these bogs and transporting the turf away from the districts&mdash;very often badly won turf, broken and just mould&mdash;was a very bad bog policy.  You cannot get a quotation for turf in County Louth to-day, and anyhow, when you know County Louth, you will know that turf is not a practical proposition there. In any case I suggest that there ought to be a bog policy, but there is not one at the moment.</P>
    <P>Now, on the question of the development of this particular bog, we have immense areas of peat in the country, and anybody who sees it and realises all the water and the moisture, the thousands of millions of gallons of water which the peat must contain&mdash; anybody who would think for any time of its consequences on the climate of this country as a whole, the humidity and all that, would be delighted to see anything done to let a great deal of this water away, and the development of such a policy is something that must appeal to us.  I put the question to the Minister: what is the depth of this particular bog?  He tells me it is 20 feet. I do not know whether the 20 feet includes what we call stripping or whether it is clean turf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes the stripping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  Well, that might be a couple of feet, or perhaps three feet in some of these bogs.  I do not know.  If that is so, that is a smaller quantity of clean peat.  I would have been anxious to know&mdash;Senator Quirke did answer the question to a certain extent, and anyhow that seems to be an average good type of peat with very little obstruction&mdash;something more on that from the Minister: just what the survey, the drainage operations and <Col N="2707" /> the borings would have revealed.  In my experience of bogs, when you go to lowland bogs it is very difficult to cut into these bogs without getting the ordinary bog oak, and when you go to certain depths, particularly where the peat is good, there you will get it.  I do not know what the borings have revealed with regard to that, but obviously, in your whole question of costs of production, it is of very material consequence indeed.  In addition, it is something which probably you will only discover as you go on working.  You will strike this in patches, perhaps, and at a point that may throw your whole plan very considerably out of gear.  At the moment, then, it seems to me quite impossible to stand up and say that anything has been established with regard to these things, any more than you can just say that you have worked for a 12 month and produced 50,000 tons of peat.  If you have got that for a year, that is all you can say, in my view.</P>

      <P>Well, it just happens that I was not told.  I did not want to make things difficult for the Minister, but I was anxious to know what the depths of these drains and the borings revealed with regard to the general character and average quantity of the bog all over.  I suggest, again, that you have worked in the most favourable year, probably, that we might ever see in our bogs again.  It was a most extraordinary year indeed.</P>

      <P>The Senator, again, must not be under this misconception that we have only worked one year on Clonsast bog.  We have, in fact, been working for over three years, and while 1940 has been an exceptionally good year, I suggest that 1938 was on the other hand, if anything an unfavourable one.</P>

    <Col N="2708" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, all I want is information, and I can assure the Minister that nobody is more sympathetic with him in this matter than I am, and I should prefer that the House should discuss this matter in a sympathetic manner&mdash;as, indeed, they have&mdash;since there are no Party differences involved. In my judgment, if the people of a country are out to develop the country's potential power there ought not to be Party differences on such a matter.  It is altogether too big a question, and I think that the spirit of this debate, as exemplified by the speeches of Senator Hayes and others, ought to be very encouraging to the Minister, but when you get to that position I think there is all the more reason for standing back from our problem, so to speak, and surveying it as a whole.  I submit that when you say you have got 50,000 tons this year, you must admit that you have had an extraordinarily good year from the point of view of rainfall and of the capacity of men to work.  Now, here is something that I do not know.  I did not accept the invitation to go down to the bog&mdash;perhaps because I had had so much of bogs and I was not curious, but I did not accept that invitation, like Senator Quirke and others, and I do not know whether you work wet and dry or not.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how men can continue to work through wet and dry weather.  If they work through wet and dry weather, you will not get the expected output.  Even admitting that the men were not as efficient this year as they will be next year, the conditions were so exceptional as regards rainfall this year that the output would probably not be surpassed next year even if the men were thoroughly efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that, on the Continent, five years are spent in draining the bogs before operations are commenced.  If it takes five years for effective drainage on the Continent before the machines can be put to work, it will be interesting to see how long the drainage work will take here before economic and efficient operation will be possible.  I tried to get information regarding rainfall.  Some other Senators had the same opportunity to <Col N="2709" /> examine the matter that I had.  My information is that, with the exception of the west of Norway, this island has about double the rainfall of any other country in Europe.  That may not be so in the case of the western parts of Germany but, on the Continent generally, they have a rainfall of from 15 inches to 35 inches, while our average rainfall is about 40 inches, and it goes up to 50 inches and 60 inches in parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In parts of the country but not in the part in which this bog is situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to have the rainfall in that area checked up. If the rainfall there is anything like the average, it must be from 30 inches to 40 inches.  That is about 10 inches or 15 inches greater than the rainfall on the Continent.  If drainage takes five years on the Continent, I wonder how long it will take here before the same conditions are reached as obtained on the bogs on the Continent after five years.  The Minister has not yet had a sufficient opportunity to test these considerations.  They are considerations which will determine the economics and costs of the scheme to a degree at present incalculable.  The Minister tells us that the cost of generation will be .14d. and that it will bear favourable comparison with ascertained costs elsewhere.  I suggest that the factors obtaining this year are not sufficient on which to form a judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke complained that men criticised and attacked the Bill who refused to go down and see what was going on at Clonsast.  I am sure the Minister would not stand for that line of argument.  You could be brought to a fairyland or to a hothouse where tea was being grown and you would be very much impressed.  To go down and look at the machinery operating at Clonsast would, no doubt, be impressive.  One would probably say that it was wonderful and that it was the sort of thing that should be encouraged.  If you are prepared to spend plenty of money, you can do a great many things of this type.  If I <Col N="2710" /> saw the machines and pulverisers at work, I should, no doubt, be impressed. I would not be so much concerned about the cost of the work as Senator Sir John Keane is.  In a matter like this, capital should be made much more subservient to the service of the public and to the rights of human beings than it is.  If that were done, human society would be better served and there would be more consideration for the equities and rights of the individual.  When we criticise this scheme, we realise that about £500,000 has been spent on our bogs already. When the Minister was acting in another capacity, he will remember how strongly I pressed him to put some money into agriculture.  Our agriculture is a much bigger asset than our bogs.  It would be a long time before you would lose £500,000 on agriculture. We would, probably, be all dead and gone before that amount would be lost if the Government took a chance and put money into agriculture.</P>
    <P>That is why people in the country are critical about the expenditure of this money.  It may be that you will lose more money before another group will come along and make the undertaking a success.  Risks are involved. I do not say that we ought not to take risks.  I think we ought but I put this consideration to the Minister: some of us supported the Shannon scheme in its initial stage when there was a great deal of criticism of it; that scheme was made possible by the credit of all the people of the State.  It was made possible because there, apparently, was a conviction that the earnings of our people would, after they had provided for themselves and their families, be ample to make provision for capital and interest until the undertaking would commence to pay its way.  The undertaking was mainly built up on the credit of this agricultural State but, as Senator O'Callaghan has truly said, agriculturists have got nothing out of it and they are going to get nothing out of this enterprise. If more electricity is generated under this scheme, it will be generated for the people in the towns and villages and not for the people of rural <Col N="2711" /> Ireland.  If we are to pledge the credit of the State and the earnings of our people for constructive schemes like this, at what point are we going to say that the amenities which these schemes provide should be reasonably and equitably distributed?</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane, who has left the House now, has made an argument on hard economics that you are going to make the town consumer of electricity pay for the very extravagant work of making it available to the farmer away out in remote parts of rural districts.  The thousands in the towns who are enjoying it to-day could not have had it but for the work and earnings of the agriculturists of this State.  That never seems to sink in.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of problems involved in such a scheme as this.  These should not be approached in a petty way: it will not get us anywhere to do that.  If we are going to look at it in a big way we are going to try to visualise a scheme that ought to be applied to the whole country.  We hear wailings and moanings from people who say the country is being depopulated and that it is necessary to brighten rural life.  What are we going to do about it?  I suggest that we say we are really going to tackle this and that, if it proves satisfactory, we are going to raise capital to develop the bogs, to get electricity out to the country, and to use whatever power we can generate there, either from bogs or water power, to make power available to the farmers to work the land, to make it more productive, and to help the people working on it to produce more than they can produce by their present efforts.  There would be backing for a scheme of that kind, but the people are reluctant to back this one because they feel that they will get very little.  That is the view in the country. People are sympathetic to any scheme which shows constructive thought, courage and enterprise.  We have gone on for many years pooling our resources to make possible a higher standard of life for people in towns and cities.  That is true.  The Minister himself will be the first to admit it, as regards people in towns and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1923 Act only completed what our fathers had fought for ages before that.  Talk about the 1909 Act or the 1875 Act, if it is a question of Land Acts.  I do not want to go into that.  I am supporting the Minister's scheme and am anxious that it should be a success.  I do not at all wish to engage in carping criticism, but am pointing out where I think there are certain undiscovered difficulties.  There are things about bogs of which perhaps I know a little more than the Minister, or even than the members of the board.</P>
      <P>With regard to this matter of the Turf Board and the Electricity Supply Board, apparently the Turf Board are going to sell turf to the Electricity Supply Board to generate electricity. Is not that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether or not there is anything in the idea that there ought to be on the Turf Board somebody from the Electricity Supply Board.  It strikes me that the scheme might be better if the Electricity Supply Board were doing the whole thing, but as it is, with these two boards in that relation to one another, I do not know whether it is going to be an eminently satisfactory and workable scheme.  However, it is the plan the Minister has started on and I suppose we must see it through. <Col N="2713" /> I urge on him that, whatever he or the Government or their predecessors may think they have done for rural Ireland, the facts are that rural Ireland, on the evidence we have, is becoming less and less attractive day after day.  That is the fact.  I deplore it and I know that many supporters of the Minister deplore it, too.  Something should be done about it, but nothing has been done about it; and every new plan and scheme is being carried out on the credit of the people, and it is a provoking situation when the amenities are being given to the people in the cities and towns and we do not make an effort to give the people in the rural districts some advantage.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to realise that there is something much bigger behind all this than anything he has said, and I trust that he will give careful consideration to the extension to farmers' homes of these amenities of power and light, without which there will not be the attractiveness and convenience to the farmers which there could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise may seem a small one to the Minister and others but I feel sure that it is relevant to this discussion and of interest to a good many people.  It is a very interesting and satisfactory thing that the Shannon Development Scheme and the Electricity Supply Board have succeeded so far that we are in a position to indulge in an extended scheme in which there is an element of danger.  We might consider what made it possible for these schemes to secure a certain amount of profit and success.  In the generating of electricity the main source is situated in the County Clare.  It is not known, possibly, as extensively as it ought to be known, but it is well known to the Minister and to his predecessor in office, that not one bit of the property of the Electricity Supply Board is rated for local administration.  That is a gross injustice.  No matter how small or infinitesimal that may be in the whole scheme, it means a lot to the people paying rates locally in that administrative county.  All the property&mdash;buildings, land and so on&mdash; means not one penny to the local rates. That is a big factor in the county rates. <Col N="2714" /> I have asked the Minister and those who preceded him to take that into consideration and introduce some measure which would redress that grievance, but nothing has been done. Senator Fitzgerald was speaking about the cost of electricity to-day and I interjected to say that, no matter what the cost of generating electricity may be in Ardnacrusha, the man across the road from Ardnacrusha is paying as much as the man farthest removed from Ardnacrusha.</P>
      <P>There are, therefore, two grievances&mdash; that the property is not rated for local administration and that people in the district where the current is generated are charged as much as those who are farthest away.  I put it to the Minister, in no spirit of criticism of the development of electricity&mdash;I do not see that there is danger in developing electricity from peat, and I am not an expert in the matter&mdash;that there is a good deal that the Government should take cognizance of, and that they should take steps to remedy these two grievances.</P>

      <P>Níl fúm oráid a dhéanamh agus an tSeanad do congbháil, ach tá cúpla poinnte agam agus ba mhaith liom iad do chur ós comhair an Aire.  In the first place, I should like to join in the tributes that have been paid to the Minister for his courage in going into this undertaking, and I should like to pay tribute to him for the excellent way in which he has presented his case both in the Dáil and here.  One point to which I wish particularly to refer is that of the electrification of rural Ireland.  I am, of course, completely in favour of this policy but I am not going to appeal to the Minister to do all he can to introduce electricity throughout rural Ireland, nor am I going to make a similar appeal to the Electricity Supply Board, for the simple reason that I do not believe in wasting energy pushing an open door. I believe that, should it be possible, it will be done and that it will be done as soon as these parties can have it done.  This matter was referred to in the Dáil some time ago and has been referred to several times here this evening. I would like to know, since the matter was raised in the Dáil and <Col N="2715" /> further, since it has been raised many times during recent years, whether any estimate has been made of the cost of introducing electricity throughout rural Ireland.  It is quite possible that we in this House and elsewhere, by constantly bringing the question, in the way we do, to the notice of the rural community, may be raising false hopes.</P>
      <P>Those of us interested in economics know how unsettling statements, such as are made on matters of this kind, can be, and how they can, as a matter of fact, interfere with production and development.  I am thinking of the difficulties of our State in this matter, with, roughly, 400,000 holdings, and about as many steadings not planned in any organised fashion or order, but set up under what we may call a staggered system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane very properly raised the question that we should know what the probable cost would be, what rural Ireland would have to bear, and what would be the reactions consequent on the introduction of electricity on our costs of agricultural production.  This is a point of very great importance.  I suggest that it would be very wise on the part of the Minister to take rural Ireland into his confidence as soon as possible and tell them just what the effect of the introduction of electricity to the country will mean.  Many of those in the towns who are supposed to be so well off are very dissatisfied with the charges while thousands of people cannot afford electricity at all, and it may be that, after going to the very great cost of introducing electricity to our 400,000 farms throughout the country, we should find that our farmers would be very dissatisfied, too, and may find that they will not be able to bear the burden.  I would like to know if the Minister has any information about the cost of rural electrification. It is a very big question, and he may not be in a position to give it. I suggest that if it is not available that, great as the task may be, he should face it and have the costing made and then take rural Ireland into his confidence. The people in rural Ireland are reasonable and will appreciate the <Col N="2716" /> difficulties.  He need have no fear of that.  If it is possible, the information should be made available, because I think it is as well that those people should be reassured on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Baxter has left the House, because in the course of his speech he referred to the harm done in Connemara due, as he said, to Government policy in regard to the bogs.  I gather from that that he implies that the Government is responsible for the laying bare of certain parts of the district there.  I am not quite sure whether that is what he implied, but if it is it is not true, because as a matter of fact the unfortunate condition of certain parts of Connemara in this respect is something that has been brought about very many years ago; as a matter of fact the removal of the &ldquo;sgraghs&rdquo; and soil had been completed before ever this Government came into power or before ever it could possibly think of a bog policy.  It may be that he knows of areas in Connemara that have suffered as he says.  I think such places will be as hard to find as those plains in Connemara to which he referred the last day when he was speaking on agriculture and mentioned the inadvisability of taking people away from the plains of Connemara.</P>
    <P>There are two very excellent bog areas in the west, and I should like to know if anything has been done with regard to their development, or if there is any possibility of anything being done in the near future.  One is the very excellent bog at Attymon, which has been surveyed.  We are, as I say, interested in that and in the area in which it is situate.  We believe it has particular advantages, and we hope that something will be done in regard to it very soon.  Then in Connemara, as we know, there are enormous peat resources.  I think, in the Peat Report of 1921, or perhaps it is in the evidence of the Gaeltacht Commission, it has been mentioned that in Connemara there are the equivalent of about 112,000,000 tons of dry turf.  I should like to know if the Minister has anything in mind with regard to the further development of the Connemara <Col N="2717" /> bogs.  In conclusion, I have only to say that I join heartily in the tributes paid here this evening, and recently in the Dáil, to the courage of the Minister in introducing this Bill, as well as in the good wishes that have been extended to him from all sides in connection with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in congratulating the Minister on the able manner in which he has presented this Bill to the House.  Its object, as we know, is to make provision for the expenditure of £4,000,000 on a further extension of our electricity supply.  The debate, to a large extent, hinged round one item in the Bill, namely, the £800,000 on the experiment at Clonsast. I think that proposal may be termed an experiment, and should it prove to be a success it will mean a great step forward in doing what all sides of the House wish to see done&mdash;the bringing of electricity into rural Ireland.  If the scheme is a success, then there will be no area in the country with a generating station in which it will not be possible to have a local supply of electricity.  That, in my opinion, would be one of the greatest advantages of the scheme.  On the other hand, should the supply of turf fail, a thing which is quite possible, provided a generating station has been set up, there will be no great obstacle in the way of using coal or some other substitute for the production of power.  The station, in any event, could be made use of, and will not become a white elephant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with Senator Mrs. Concannon in bringing to the Minister's notice the position as regards the supply of electricity in Galway City.  The valuation charge there has, one may say, been a burning question for some years past.  It seems to me to be very unjust.  The matter is one that we cannot deal with under this Bill, but we ask the Minister to bear it in mind and give it further consideration.  Senator O Buachalla referred to the development of turf in Connemara.  If this experiment in Clonsast is a success, then we would hope to see, in the very near future, a generating station erected at Attymon.  I think this idea of utilising turf for the generating of electricity is a very good one, for this reason that <Col N="2718" /> to-day it does not seem to be possible to get people to burn turf.  In our housing, a change from the old open country hearth has taken place.  Very few people like to spoil their parlours by burning turf in the fireplaces.  In the new houses that are being built, no provision is made for the storing of turf.  Therefore, I think if we can convert the turf into electricity and supply the current at a cheap rate for heating and lighting, we will have taken a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to-day by a number of Senators to the success the Electricity Supply Board have made of their work.  I should be glad if the Minister could tell me into how many places, other than those that had been provided with electricity by private concerns, the board have brought electricity.  My observations lead me to think that all those areas that have a supply of electricity to-day had it before the Shannon scheme was carried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter stated that it would be a good thing if the Government adopted a bog policy.  I agree with that.  While I admit that certain departments are anxious and interested in pushing the use of turf in different ways, there are other departments which do not take the national interest that they should in doing so.  For instance, we have new hospitals, new homes of various descriptions, and new technical schools being erected in different parts of the country.  We find, however, that turf cannot be used as a fuel for heating them, because the proper equipment has not been installed for the use of turf, or because space has not been provided for storing it for use.  In the case of a technical school in Galway, the excuse given for not using turf was that they had not the necessary storage accommodation. This is a matter that, I think, the engineers under the Department of Local Government and of the Board of Works should give attention to before giving approval to plans for the erection of the new buildings.</P>
    <P>Various statements were made to-day as regards the present price of turf as compared with the price of coal. Some time ago, the Ballinasloe Mental Hospital Committee issued an advertisement <Col N="2719" /> for coal and, as I understand, this institution now has a supply of coal sufficient for two years.  The local people, peat societies and so on, who cut turf and supplied so many hundreds of tons of turf annually to this institution offered to supply it with 100 or 200 tons of turf&mdash;I forget the exact amount&mdash;at 17/6 per ton delivered to the institution and they were told that as they already had a supply sufficient for two years, they did not require any turf.  I think a position like that should not be allowed to arise.  These people, on the request of the Government, cut extra supplies of turf and now find it left on their hands.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Madden who made the case for bog roads.  We all like to see bog roads made, but, there again, I think there is a great mistake made.  Some time this year, I was interested in getting a bog.  I visited certain districts and I found that in many cases money was expended in the making of roads as relief works when what should have been done in those particular districts was to expend the money on drainage.  There was one district in which £400 or £500 was spent in making a road and not a sod of turf has been cut there by reason of lack of proper drainage. Then, the Land Commission divide bogs among tenants and no regulations are laid down to compel the turf to be cut in such a way as to ensure that drainage will be properly carried out. One man can turf and drain his bog into the other, and stop the whole thing.  I think that is what Senator Baxter had in mind when criticising the bog policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is not a reason in the world why this Bill should not get unanimous support.  It is an experiment, but an experiment well worth a trial.  The reasons for the failure of the briquette factory were pretty well known locally.  There was an extraordinary laxity in the management, over-lapping of officials and general inefficiency.  That was well known throughout the district, but how that occurred I do not know. There was a staff of officials who were tripping over each other, with one <Col N="2720" /> countermanding the orders given by another.  Orders were sent from various parts of the country&mdash;I believe from as far away as Monaghan&mdash;and arrangements made by 'phone for the sending out of supplies of turf on a certain date. Lorries were sent and there was no material for them when they went there.  I do not know how the undertaking lasted so long.  These are facts which cannot be contradicted.  It was known that, after several disappointments of that nature, lorries travelled distances of 30 miles empty and had to return without a load, and that the factory management took it into their heads to send turf into the town at 10.30 or 11 o'clock on a Friday night and dump it on the street to be disposed of as people liked.  How that was allowed to go so far was a mystery to many people and those responsible for it had a grave responsibility. A sum of £230,000 or some thing like that was invested in the enterprise and I believe that all the elements of success existed, were the management properly taken in hand.  I believe that some of the officials who were guilty of those acts of sabotage against the State have been appointed to very important positions in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the factory is being revived.  I have been through the place and it shows all promise of success.  I believe the fact is that, for the first eight or ten months during which the factory was in operation, it was a paying proposition, while under skilled management.  Unfortunately, that skilled management had to go elsewhere.  That could not be helped, but, for the first nine months or so, my information is that it was working entirely satisfactorily.  It came under new management, or mismanagement, and every hour of every day saw a quicker slide into the mess.  It is again on a very good foundation and I believe it shows every promise of success.  So far as the briquettes themselves are concerned, they are a very excellent fuel.  They were originally sold at the economic rate of 30/- per ton and were exceedingly good value for that price.  I know some people who laid in a supply at the original price who are burning them still and <Col N="2721" /> who say that they are a cheaper fuel than coal, easily stored, easily manipulated and of great calorific power.</P>
    <P>I have great hopes of the Clonsast proposition.  I believe that it, too, has all the material resources for success, but I warn the Government that it will be very necessary to keep a watchful eye on those who, in the future, are charged with the big responsibility of managing businesses in which a quarter of a million pounds have been sunk. The fate of the briquette factory in North Kildare will be a lesson to those responsible, and the position at Clonsast will be closely watched.  The turf is of good quality and is finding a ready sale, although other people who were encouraged to cut turf in other parts of the country now have it left on their hands by reason of the price at which Clonsast turf is being sold.  However, that cannot be helped, and those with turf left on their hands were to some extent at fault themselves, because, at the beginning of the season of sales, they were charging a price almost equal to the price of coal and in that way it was left on their hands, but that position will adjust itself in time.</P>
    <P>As for the future schemes of electrification, I do not think the Shannon scheme, the Liffey scheme and the Clonsast scheme will ever supply the rural areas.  A profit may be made at present prices, but the complaint is generally made that the charges for electricity are rather high; that they are exorbitant.  I do not know how true that is.  I believe if the charges were moderated that the income of the Electricity Supply Board would remain as large as it is, because many people who availed of electricity for cooking and other purposes have abandoned it in favour of other methods.  I believe there would be a great extension of the consumption of electricity if the method of charging according to valuation was so altered as to meet the wishes of many people, who now complain that these charges are exorbitant.  I do not think large schemes of this kind will help the rural population.  I agree with one Senator who stated that he believed smaller schemes of rural electrification, whether hydro-electric or the use of coal, where coal or anthracite exists, <Col N="2722" /> or by availing of the bogs would be ones that would eventually bring light and heat to rural districts.  I do not know if any investigation has been made in that direction.  I have not heard of any.  Possibly that has been done.  It appears to me to be obvious that one or two counties should form an area in which there might be a possibility of producing electricity, and that surveys should be made through county councils or the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In practically every county all essentials for the production of electricity are available.  Around the coast there is sufficient water power, and in the midlands power might be had, without going to very much expense, from coal or anthracite which is within easy reach.  In the midlands there is also an ample supply of turf.  It should be put up to county councils that an effort should be made in future to investigate this problem in consultation with the county surveyors.  I admit that an expert must be brought in to direct that investigation, but I suggest it is very well worth trying.  At the present time there are in operation schemes that are costing large sums of money. Some of these schemes overlap.  I know one county where some 20 years ago an engineer of international repute suggested that he could supply the whole county with electricity with water power from the Liffey.  The estimate he gave is probably pigeonholed somewhere by the Board of Works.  That scheme was intended to supply not only power, electricity and light, but water supplies for a dozen towns.  These places have now separate water supplies, but the cost of the original scheme would have been, at least, one-third less than what the separate schemes amounted to.  I suggest that the possibility of availing of some such schemes still exists and that the matter is worthy of investigation.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to turn down that suggestion.  I make it with a desire to be helpful and not critical. These schemes are worthy of consideration but require careful watching in the execution of the work and also in administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying that, as far as I am concerned, <Col N="2723" /> I have found this a very helpful debate, helpful from the point of view that everything which I have said as to the merits of Portarlington scheme has not been accepted without reasonable reserve, and I must say that those on both sides of the House who have doubts and qualms about the prudence of proceeding with this scheme have voiced their hesitations candidly, moderately and reasonably.  If I had further time it would perhaps have given me an opportunity fully to resolve any doubts with which they may regard this proposition. I would welcome that, because the more we discuss these things and the more we have put forward here not merely the arguments in favour of a proposal of this sort, but also those which appear to stand against it, the more we shall, if the proposal is a good one, carry conviction to the minds of the majority of our people.  To do that, in my view, is not doing any disservice to the Government, to the policy of the Government or to the work of national development.</P>
      <P>Before I come to deal with the two major questions which have been raised in the debate, one, the wisdom of proceeding with the Clonsast development, and the other, the possibility of undertaking a large-scale scheme of rural electrification, I should like to deal with one minor point which has been mentioned here, but that is not, perhaps, strictly relevant to this Bill, and that is the question of pensions for the staff of the Electricity Supply Board. That is a matter which has been under discussion between myself and the Electricity Supply Board and the Minister for Finance.  We have not reached complete agreement as to the basis on which the pensions scheme for the staff of the Electricity Supply Board should be formulated, but we are, I should say, within measurable reach of that agreement, and I hope that we may be able to come to the Oireachtas to ask it to authorise the Electricity Supply Board to prepare a pensions scheme for its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the questions which were raised in relation to Clonsast development, the point was made very frequently during the debate, that there would be less hesitation on the part of <Col N="2724" /> some Senators who were critical of the project, if they had an assurance that the proposal had been submitted to expert investigation.  They asked me whether, in fact, that had been done, and who was responsible for the figures which I quoted in the House. The first question we have to ask ourselves is, what experts would carry conviction. I submit, so far as the problem of using peat to generate electricity is concerned, there are no persons likely to be more expert and better informed on that problem than the engineers of the Electricity Supply Board.  But this is a matter, at any rate, upon which experts do not differ.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked me was there any report by experts upon the possibility of using turf to generate electricity and, if so, why was the report not published.  The answer to that is simple.  The possibility and practicability of using peat for raising steam in large boiler units of the capacity which would be utilised in the Portarlington electricity works is as well established as the use of coal is, and it is not necessary for us to spend money putting that simple question to experts.  It is recognised now as a practice which can be undertaken without running any risk and, in fact, as we know, there are many industrial undertakings in this country which do use peat as a fuel for raising steam. And, of course, the whole process at Portarlington depends upon steam, the generation of steam being the basic operation.</P>
    <P>The next question is how would the use of peat in an electricity generating station at Portarlington compare with the use of coal, say, in the power station at the Pigeon House for the purposes of generating electricity. Again, that matter has been investigated by the engineers of the Electricity Supply Board who, I may say, in that connection, within the past nine or ten years, have completely re-designed the Pigeon House and made it one of the most modern and one of the most economical generating stations in the three kingdoms.  The answer which they have given me is that if they can get an assured supply of peat with a moisture content of not more than 30 per cent. and of normal <Col N="2725" /> calorific value, they expect to be in a position to generate electricity at Portarlington as cheaply as they can generate electricity at the Pigeon House, provided that the cost of the peat to them is not more than 10/6 in normal circumstances or, in other circumstances, if the cost of coal goes up, more than one-third of the cost of coal.  That is to say, that with peat at a minimum cost of 10/6 in normal circumstances or, where the cost of coal is rising, not greater than one-third of the cost of coal to them at the Pigeon House&mdash;there is a decimal place of about one-thousandth of a penny per unit of difference in generating costs between Portarlington and the Pigeon House&mdash;but it would be as cheap from their point of view to use peat at Portarlington as it is to use imported coal at the Pigeon House.  In that connection again I should like to say, in regard to the figures which I have cited here in the House, that they have been supplied to me by the Electricity Supply Board and that the engineers of the Electricity Supply Board have fully investigated the practicability of building the station at Portarlington, and again the only reservation they make&mdash;and it is a reservation of which it is well that the House and the people should be aware&mdash;is that they will be assured of an adequate supply of peat of the requisite quality at Portarlington.</P>
    <P>I would like to put the other side of the picture.  We can assume&mdash;and we are proceeding on the assumption&mdash; that that supply will be forthcoming. If, however, it is not forthcoming and if, in fact, the experiment turns out to be a failure it must not be thought that so far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned it is going to be at the loss of this £800,000.  Some money would be lost but, in my view, nothing like £800,000 because, with the exception of the special furnaces which will be designed for the combustion of the peat, practically all the rest of the plant to be installed at Portarlington could be dismantled and could be re-erected at the Pigeon House.  So that, accordingly, the ultimate risk in this matter is what would be involved in dismantling the plant at Portarlington and transferring the greater part of it to the Pigeon House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2726" /> We should, of course, lose the buildings and lose the foundations, but I would like to say, in my belief, it would not represent, say, more than 20 or 25 per cent.&mdash;I do not want to be pinned to a figure&mdash;of the total capital invested in the station, and if we reduce that to a specific sum, we get something of the order of £160,000 to £200,000.  That is about the maximum risk, I think, we are accepting in connection with this experiment because I do feel that, whether the experiment succeeds in relation to the generating station or not, we shall, at any rate, be able to produce an article at Clonsast for which there will be, in the post-war circumstances as we can now visualise them, a ready sale for so long as the bog has a workable life.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane also wishes to be assured that there has been no pressure on the board.  In that connection, I would like to say that it has been indicated to the board that we feel that it is in the national interest that they should undertake this experiment, but it is open to the board, if they feel that it is not advisable for them to undertake it as a board, to come to me and to make representations accordingly.  If those representations are made, naturally I shall consider them, but that does not mean that I shall be prepared to abandon this experiment because the Electricity Supply Board have a doubt about it.  On the contrary, I think that in such an event I should have to come to the Oireachtas and have to ask it to give me authority to constitute a new statutory undertaking, the purpose of which would be to erect this station and to operate it and to sell electricity to the Electricity Supply Board for distribution over its network to the Electricity Supply Board's consumers.  That would be the alternative.  In fact, before this Bill was drafted, I considered that as an alternative proposition.  I felt, however, on the whole that there was a great deal to be said for having a unified authority in this country in charge of electricity supply and I decided to proceed in the way we are doing and in that connection to clear up any doubt which there might be in <Col N="2727" /> the mind of the Electricity Supply Board as to their powers to erect a station of the kind contemplated at Portarlington.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane also wanted to know about the costings for the Turf Board.  I have already given an undertaking in the Dáil that at an early date, as soon as we can get the accounts in form for publication, the accounts of the Turf Development Board will be published.  It will be seen when they are published that quite a large amount of money has been spent upon what might be described as survey and preliminary development work.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter wanted to know if we had made a survey of the bogs of this country.  We have made a survey of most of the larger bogs of the country, and a very exhaustive survey too.  At least, the Turf Development Board have made that survey and the cost of it has been defrayed out of the Grants-in-Aid which have been voted to the board by the Oireachtas every year.  As I am on that point of the survey of bogs and their future development, I may answer the question which was put to me by Senator Liam O Buachalla who wanted to know what the position was in regard to the Attymon bog.  That is a bog of about 1,400 acres.  It has been surveyed. The report on the survey has been satisfactory.  We hope to put the drainage of the bog in hands in the near future with a view to its ultimate development.  I am not in a position to answer the question relating to the Connemara bogs.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes wished to know what employment would be given on the Clonsast bog.  There were employed there during, I think, practically the whole of the turf-cutting and harvesting season of this year, between 400 and 500 men.  When the bog is in full production it is expected that during that season about 600 men will be employed and, for the remaining months of the year, between 200 and 300.  That is an aspect of this matter that is worthy of attention.  It will be seen that, for the purpose of providing for the employment of people in the rural areas who are not required on the land, and <Col N="2728" /> of keeping them living in country surroundings, in reasonably pleasant surroundings, the Clonsast experiment, if it succeeds, is going to be a very important thing.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot wishes to know when we anticipate the Portarlington station will be erected.  In my view it will be, perhaps, in 18 months.  I should like to qualify that with this reservation: if all goes well.  Because the position is that contracts have not been placed for the plant and, until the working drawings have been prepared, the erection of the buildings cannot be undertaken, or the foundations for the plant put down.  Accordingly, I should say it will be at least 18 months before this station can be in operation and, in view of the present uncertainty, it may be a great deal more.  But I hope we can proceed on the assumption that we will be able to start the erection of the Portarlington station in the course of the coming year.  If we are not able to get the plant for Portarlington, then I am afraid we are going to have equal difficulties in regard to the plant required to complete the Poulaphouca scheme and to undertake the extensions at the Pigeon House, which will also become necessary within a very short period of time, in view of the future development of the undertaking.  In these circumstances we may be compelled to try to put some limitation upon the use of electricity in this country.  What I have said in regard to plant might also apply, in certain circumstances, even to the coal which is required as fuel for the Pigeon House, so that you can see that even if we had not this incentive to try to utilise to the full extent whatever natural resources we have, if we had not this incentive to try to provide employment in our rural areas, there are other circumstances which would undoubtedly urge us to consider very seriously the erection of a station such as that proposed at Portarlington.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan expressed the view that we were, perhaps, rather foolish in undertaking the development at Portarlington, because he felt it would be much wiser for us first to develop all our water-power resources. In that connection he said, I think, that <Col N="2729" /> water costs nothing.  If he were to consult any engineer who has had to consider these matters very carefully from the point of view that once he became an electricity supply undertaker he had obligations to the public which he had to fulfil under very heavy penalty, perhaps he would not continue to hold the view he has expressed here in regard to water-power.  Water-power is, in fact, not cheap.  In normal circumstances, in a country like this, water-power is not a cheap source for electricity. As well as that, it is a motive agent the cost of which, in use, may be very variable.  It is entirely at the mercy of the weather and, as I have said in the other House, the weather, from the point of view of the Electricity Supply Board, is as important a factor as it is to any working farmer in Ireland, the only difference being that the interests of the working farmer and those of the Electricity Supply Board are liable on occasions to come into conflict with each other, as they have done this year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I shall bring that fact more clearly home to the House if I give some figures relating to our actual experience with the Electricity Supply Board undertaking.  Senators will remember that the year 1933-34 was a very dry year.  The total number of units delivered to the Electricity Supply Board network in that year amounted to 182,000,000 in round figures.  The total number of units which the Electricity Supply Board were able to get from the Shannon works at Ardnacrusha amounted in that year to 101,500,000, and the average cost per unit delivered was 6356 pence, which was very much higher than the cost in the previous year or in subsequent years and, in fact, was much higher than anything we have since experienced.  In contrast to that year, when we got only 101,500,000 units from the Shannon, in the year 1938-39, the board was able to get 284,000,000 units, and the average cost per unit delivered in that year fell to .2725 pence.</P>
    <P>I am giving these figures merely to show that if we are going to operate this electricity supply undertaking in the most effective manner, experience has shown us what had already been intimated to the State and to the <Col N="2730" /> board by the experts, that we must maintain a proper balance between that part of our plant which is dependent on the weather and that part of it which is independent of the weather.  The Shannon being a water-power undertaking, its capacity is largely influenced by the weather conditions which prevail almost from day to day, because you can get a year in which you would have an abnormally heavy rainfall, if you take the 12 months as a whole, but you might have a dry period during the critical portion of the year in the summer months and the capacity of the Ardnacrusha plant might be adversely affected.  It all depends on getting water when water is likely to be scarcest.  If that happens the capacity of the plant is considerably increased and, by reason of the fact that you have that great potential capacity available there&mdash;it is important to bear this in mind&mdash;you can secure in those circumstances a very great reduction in the average cost of your total output.</P>
    <P>I have given some figures for 1938-39. In that year the total number of units delivered to the Electricity Supply Board network was 367,000,000 of which, as I have already said, 284,000,000 units came from Ardnacrusha and only 81,000 had to be taken from the Pigeon House&mdash;only 81,000 units were generated, so to speak, from imported coal.  In consequence of that the average cost per unit delivered to the network was .3775 pence.  In the following year, that is for the year 1939-40 whereas the total output delivered to the network increased to 388,498,000 units, the number of units delivered from the Shannon power station fell to 208,023,000.  The total number of units delivered from the Pigeon House in the same year increased to 179,080,000, but because the output from the Shannon was less than the preceding year, the average cost of generation rose to .4170 pence.  I have already indicated to the House what the position was in respect to the driest year when the average cost per unit was .6356 pence.  From that it will be quite clear that it would be economically unwise and imprudent to over-develop our water power resources as against the <Col N="2731" /> development of our steam generating plant.  We have to maintain a balance between them.</P>
    <P>We have also this very great difficulty &mdash;and it is a point that is very often overlooked&mdash;that the installation of hydro-electric plant represents a much greater export of capital than the installation of steam plant.  Accordingly we have to proceed in this matter with great caution because, apart altogether from the fact that we are exporting capital, we are exporting it long before we are able to utilise that capital to its maximum capacity.  On the other hand, I am not to be taken as opposed to development of our water power resources. In fact I feel that this year, and the years which we are about to face, are going to teach us that we were unwise in being so prudent in the past, if I might put it that way.  I think the development of our water power does put us in a position of independence and does give us a national task which has important reactions upon our psychology.  I think it is true to say that the fact that we were able, so soon after the unfortunate civil war, to undertake the development of the Shannon scheme had a good effect upon us all.  We can all look back and take equal pride in the fact that there were some people who had the courage and the vision to tackle the project at that time.  Accordingly, if it were possible to develop either the Erne or the Boyne &mdash;which would rank next to the Erne in regard to its possibilities&mdash;I certainly should not be at all unwilling to ask the House, if it were my responsibility at the time, to give us the necessary power to proceed with the scheme. I think, however, that is perhaps going a bit off the track at present.</P>
    <P>The next matter which was raised in the debate was the method of charging for electricity.  We heard a great deal about the unfairness of the valuation charge, but I can assure the critics of the valuation charge that they will find no support for their attitude from any person who is interested in the economics of electricity supply.  It is my view, for what it may be worth, that we should never have had the extraordinary development in the use of <Col N="2732" /> electricity which has taken place here over the past ten years had the board not adopted that system of charging. It is the fairest system than can be devised. It is one which apportions, as reasonably and as fairly as it can be done, between the various consumers the cost of giving them a supply.  I think that we have sufficient evidence of that fact in the progress of the undertaking. In 1929-30 the total output from all the stations in the Twenty-Six Counties amounted to 61,000,000 units, which were sold to 48,000 consumers.  In 1939-40, ten years later, the output was 409,000,000, sold to 172,000 consumers.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I might say that this increase was not due to novelty in the earlier years, because within the past four years the number of consumers connected to the electricity supply mains has increased by 50 per cent.  We may be perfectly certain that that increase would never have taken place if the system of charging, which the board had adopted, was not fair and satisfactory to those who took the electricity supply.  In fact, I should like in that connection to say that if the board were to depart from that system of charging it would probably be found that people in the smaller towns would have to pay a very much higher amount than they have at present.  So far as there is any unfairness in this matter, the unfairness falls, not on the smaller towns, but on the more densely populated centres like Dublin where the valuations are very much higher and where, accordingly, the fixed charge forms a much higher proportion of the electricity consumer's bill.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of rural electrification.  First of all, I should like to disabuse the minds of some of those who have spoken on that point in this debate of an impression which I think they hold subconsciously.  That is, that every inhabitant of our cities and our urban centres enjoys the benefits of electricity.  There is nothing further from the truth.  The great bulk of residents in Dublin do not have electricity in their homes.  Some of them may have gas, but a very large number of them have to depend upon candles or paraffin for their illumination <Col N="2733" /> and they are people who have to work very hard.  The fundamental principle on which the Electricity Supply Board has to operate is laid down in Section 21 of the Act of 1927 which prescribes this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All charges made by the board after the appointed day for electricity... sold by it in bulk or direct to consumers... shall be fixed at such rates and on such scales that the revenue derived in any year by the board from such sales and services together with its revenue... from other sources will be sufficient and only sufficient... to pay all salaries, working expenses and other outgoings of the board... and such sums as the board may think proper to set aside in that year for reserve fund, extensions, renewals, depreciation, loans and other like purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a way of ensuring that the electricity supply to any consumer will not be subsidised by the general taxpayer. That is the foundation upon which our electricity undertaking rests: that so far as it exists it has to be paid for by the users of electricity. That is the principle which has to govern the board when it is considering the question of incurring additional expenditure upon its networks, transmission lines or plant.</P>
    <P>What we are asked by those who assume that the electricity supply is something which has been provided by the State for the special benefit of individuals is, that we should depart from that principle and that we should make the electricity supply as generally available throughout the country as roads are.  In order to do that it would be necessary in certain circumstances to subsidise and very heavily subsidise the supply when it is given to some consumers, that is, to the consumers who live in certain rural areas which are at a considerable distance from the Electricity Supply Board's distribution mains.  Well, that would be, in my view, though I would be subject to argument and perhaps to a change of view in relation to it, a revolutionary change; because it would be very difficult to justify the subsidisation of an electricity supply to the rural consumers <Col N="2734" /> and at the same time to condemn it or oppose subsidisation in the case of the urban inhabitants who are living in circumstances in which at the present moment they cannot afford to take an electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it will be seen that the fact that the distribution networks have not been erected in a more widespread manner over the country has not been due to any reluctance on the part either of the board or the Minister to undertake it, but because of the fact that very big issues are raised, and these are issues which we, at any rate, would have to find some way of resolving before the project could be undertaken in the widespread way in which it has been advocated here.  It has been advocated here on the basis that the agricultural community have paid for this, as they have been presumed to have paid for everything else in the country, and that they have been getting nothing out of it.  I dealt with that argument in the other House and I pointed out that, in so far as the agricultural community in common with the rest of the community, had accepted the risks which were inherent in undertaking a large project of this kind, they were being fully compensated for those risks in the form of the interest which the Electricity Supply Board pays to the Exchequer on their advances, and that interest has always been fixed so as to cover the risks and the various difficulties which the Exchequer might have to meet in providing the necessary moneys for the operations of the board.  Accordingly, though the amount involved may be relatively very little, nevertheless the agricultural community have secured their share of that along with the rest of us.</P>

      <P>No.  The Electricity Supply Board only began to pay their sinking fund last year when I think they made a contribution of £57,000 towards the reduction of a debt of £13,000,000.  They have every year since, I think, 1931 paid the interest and they have up to last year made full provision for depreciation, renewals and repairs.  They are now getting solidly on their feet.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister agree that there is an intermediate stage between the present position and the position which he says is impossible, of supplying electricity to the individual farmers?  There are communities, apart from the individual farmers, who might get electricity, if certain restrictions were removed, which might prove to be even sound economically.</P>

      <P>I will not burden the House with requoting figures which I mentioned in the other House.  But, in regard to that, and arising out of a question which was put by Senator O Buachalla, I can say that the question of rural electrification has been under consideration for some time by the Government and by the board and the position we have now reached is this: that we propose to erect a number of experimental networks at some cost in various districts in the Twenty-Six Counties and from their erection and operation we hope to derive the data which will enable us to consider this problem in its economic aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, of course, is that we have not such data available in regard to what we commonly call rural electrification, which is something very different from rural electrification as it is understood in parts of the Continent, because, in fact, judged by continental standards, I think that our electricity supply here is as generally available to the rural dweller as it is elsewhere.  There are certain parts of Switzerland where that would not apply.  But then again they have not fuel so easily available, although they have natural facilities which we have not.  One Senator talked about the number of small power schemes in Switzerland.  Of course they have a number of mountains whose peaks are high above the snow line which we have not.  They have the benefit of that. We have the turf and, in normal circumstances, a supply of coal at a reasonable cost, so that it has not been necessary for us to undertake these expensive schemes of hydro-electric development.  We are, however, endeavouring to get the data which will enable us to consider this matter upon some firm basis and then, when we know more about what is the real cost involved in it, we may <Col N="2736" /> be able perhaps to find a half-way house, because I think it would only be delusive to suggest to our people that an electricity supply would ever be generally available to everybody.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to say, in regard to all this question of electricity supply, that while I am to be taken, for a number of reasons, as being a firm believer in electricity, I am not to be taken as one of those people who believe that if you cannot have electricity you cannot have something as good, or nearly as good, depending on your circumstances. I do not think there is anything in the point that has been made here, that the farmer cannot use machinery on his land unless an electricity supply is available, that he cannot have labour-saving machinery if he wishes.  Why, except for ploughing a field&mdash;and there again you can have tractors&mdash;I think that in certain circumstances a small general utility oil engine is as useful as an electric motor.  It may require a little more attention and a little more time, but the additional amount of time and attention which it requires, as compared with an electric motor, to my mind, should not be any barrier to its use by any good farmer if an electricity supply is not available to him.  And as far as lighting is concerned, nowadays, I think, you have improved lamps of one sort or another, with which you can do in a pinch and which will do just as well as most electrical lamps, if the electricity supply is not there.  If it is there, by all means use it.  It has certain conveniences, but I do not think that, in the ordinary run of houses, it is so great a convenience as to coerce us to sit down and say: &ldquo;The electricity supply is not available at my door, and, therefore, I do not propose to put in any labour-saving machinery, and I propose to do my work in semi-darkness.&rdquo;  I do think it would be far better, as Senator O Buachalla has suggested, if instead of coming along here and telling our farmers that nothing is being done for them and that they cannot do anything for themselves unless we do it for them, it were pointed out to them that there are resources and facilities available to them, apart altogether from anything <Col N="2737" /> that may be afforded by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the question of costings.  Now, just with regard to turf, it was mentioned by Senator Hawkins that one of the difficulties that he knew existed in certain parts of the country was that turf which had been cut had been left on the hands of the farmers who had cut it.  That probably was the position up to the present, but I think future developments are going to be such that they will not have difficulty in disposing of the turf before the winter season passes.  The Senator also made a very wise point when he said that he had seen money spent on bog roads which, in his view, would have been better spent on providing drainage in the bog.</P>
    <P>That is very important because I may say that I do not think it would have been possible for us to have proceeded with the development of the Clonsast bog if the Barrow drainage scheme had not been carried out in the first instance.  This question of drainage is all important for the development of the bogs, but as I have pointed out in the course of the discussion here it is essentially a long-term process.  In the case of Clonsast we have been able to start work on the development proper after three years of drainage but it may be that that was, perhaps, due to the special circumstances of this year, and it may be that, in the case of the other bogs, the period of drainage before you get a consolidated surface on the bog, and before you can put the heavy machinery on it, may be longer.  In Germany, it has been five years, and in the case of Clonsast you can use the bog as a bearing surface for heavy machinery within three years.  The fact that we have been able to do that is, perhaps, an indication that on the whole conditions here may be more favourable for the development of bogs by machinery than they have been on the Continent.  On the other hand, you have to keep in mind the fact that this has been a very dry year, and it might be that if climatic conditions were not so favourable we should not be able to operate machines on the bog to the same extent as they have been operated this summer.  These are the factors, however, which each of us <Col N="2738" /> will have to take into consideration for himself and try to form an opinion on. They are not conclusive either on the one side or on the other.  They merely do suggest certain aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about land reclamation.  In that connection, I should like to say that the chairman of the Turf Development Board is a very go-ahead agriculturist, that the matter has been under consideration by the board, and that it is kept in mind by the board when they are dealing with the bogs.  They hope that, ultimately, when the bog is cleared to its floor, they will be able to leave cultivable land behind it.  I do not think there is anything more, Sir, that I can justifiably say.</P>

      <P>With regard to the next item on the Order Paper, Sir, which seems to be a formal motion, would it not be well to make a rule that motions of this kind should take precedence of Second Reading Bills? I think we should have something to that effect in our rules, and I suggest that it should be put before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It seems to me to be ridiculous that one matter should take hours to debate and that a Minister and his officials should have to wait all that time merely to deal with a formal matter which would only take a few moments.  I think it should be on our Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1940, which the Seanad is now asked to confirm, is to implement the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938.  That Act empowered the Minister for Defence to make a scheme which would provide pensions for the widows of five officers and for <Col N="2740" /> one officer who had been transferred to the Gárda Síochána, and the present scheme is only, therefore, an implementation of the Act passed in 1938. The six persons covered by the Act are provided for in Articles 8 (a), 9 (3) and 9 (4) of the scheme.  No pension will be payable to the officer transferred to the Gárda Síochána until he has retired from that service; and no pension will be payable to the five widows until gratuities already paid to them under defence forces regulations have been worked off in terms of pensions provided under this scheme and payable from the day following their husbands' death.  In effect, three pensions will not be payable until 1942, one until 1945, and one until 1946.</P>
      <P>The necessity of thus bringing in an amendment of the principal scheme confirmed in 1937 so as to implement the Act passed in 1938 has been seized as a suitable occasion for carrying out other minor objects.  These are:&mdash; (a) to provide for the widow of a captain who was a serving officer on the appointed day, but who had not the requisite 12 years' service to entitle his widow to a pension.  This is effected by Article 9 (2); (b) to provide gratuities for officers who received short-term commissions in the Air Corps. This is done by Article 6; (c) to provide for officers who may in the future be transferred to the Civil Service or Gárda Síochána.  This is the effect of Article 8 (b); (d) to redraft some Articles, and to make certain verbal amendments in others so as to clarify the meaning of those Articles, where experience has shown their meaning to be obscure or the original intention not fully expressed.  This purpose is given effect to in Articles 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.</P>
