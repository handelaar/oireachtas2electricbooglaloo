      <P>Before taking up the business on the Order Paper, I should say that I have been given to understand that it would suit the Minister's convenience if item No. 4&mdash;the motion in the name of Senator Hayes&mdash;was taken after item No. 1, leaving the resumed debate on motions Nos. 2 and 3&mdash;the motions in regard to parish councils&mdash;as the last item of business to-day.  The motion in the name of Senator Counihan&mdash;item No. 5&mdash;I understand, is not being moved to-day. If the arrangement suggested meets with the convenience of Senators I take it we can proceed accordingly.</P>

      <P>Why is it that when the Principal Act of 1931 is being repealed, the particular section quoted here could not be put into this Bill, so that we would have it all in one, instead of having references?  I know that the draftsman would say that this is the handy way to do it but, from the point of view of people who have to look it up, it seems to be an unhandy way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very poorly equipped technically to discuss this <Col N="2204" /> point.  A man gets a licence: he may spend a certain amount of money in prospecting, so that, when he dies, he may have gone to considerable expense and acquired some information and some rights.  His heirs-at-law have no right at all and get nothing at all from what he spent or from what he may have acquired.  That seems to be a very peculiar situation.  I understand, of course, that the licence is given to a particular individual and that somebody else may not have the same qualifications to work it.  On the other hand, is no value at all to be attached to what the man has done, and do his heirs-at-law get nothing at all out of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.  The licence itself is of no value: the value lies in the knowledge which the person who holds the licence acquires in the operation of it.  Presumably, he would make proper provision so that that knowledge would not die with him.  If it did die with him, his representatives would have no remedy in such circumstances. We may assume that, if he has acquired knowledge, he has arranged that it will be available to his heirs and representatives, so that they can come along and ask for another licence.  There would not be very much difficulty, provided that they can fulfil the requirements as to character, financial standing and technical qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This licence is not in any degree preposed to these people? For instance, a man with technical knowledge gets a licence and spends £10,000.  In doing so he may or may not get extra knowledge and may or may not have transmitted that to his son; but though he has put up £10,000, which he would probably have lost on the totality of the job, now that that money is sunk in the soil, I can come along and get a licence.  There is nothing in the Bill that I know of which gives a greater advantage to his son and heir-at-law than it does to me. Some clerk or civil servant may opt to give the licence because an interloper who comes in may, on paper, be able to show a greater technical knowledge. In that way, one could in effect walk <Col N="2205" /> away with the £10,000 spent by one man, which should have gone to his heir and which, through the operation of such a clause as this in the Bill, will be foreclosed on by an independent applicant for a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister intervenes, may I say that the Minister has said one thing which impressed me in regard to this.  If the heirs of the licensee are prepared to go on with the work and if they can prove their capacity to do so, are we to understand that they would in fact be preferred to others?  If they would, the whole problem is solved, but there is nothing in the Bill to indicate that.  It seems to be in accordance with natural justice that, if a man has spent time and money on this work and then dies, his heirs&mdash;if they are competent and have the technical qualifications and character, as they normally would have&mdash;should get the preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us bear very clearly in mind the point at issue.  We are dealing with the question of a prospecting licence which entitles a person to go in on land, provided that he will fully compensate the owner and is qualified in certain ways, to look for minerals.  Taking the case which Senator Fitzgerald has raised where a person has spent £10,000 in acquiring such knowledge: presumably, if the £10,000 has not been spent foolishly, a proper record of the investigations will have been kept and left in the possession of those entitled to it, that is, the heirs-at-law.  If, with that knowledge, they are able to come along and say they are in a position to continue the work because they are technically qualified or in a position to employ the necessary technical assistance to continue this investigation, then, if they have acquired knowledge which is worth £10,000 I would say that <i>prima facie</i> they would be entitled to preference in a matter of that kind.  However, I doubt whether it would be possible to spend £10,000 in this country advantageously in prospecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2206" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So the question of a person spending £10,000 does not arise. A case might arise of a person who had got a prospecting licence and had carried out investigations which were not excessively costly.  He would have made a record, presumably, of the results of his investigations and it would have been given to his heirs-at-law. The point might arise that they would not be technically qualified and that they would not be in a position to employ a person who would be technically qualified.  There would be no public advantage in giving a licence to such persons to prospect as they are not technically qualified and have not the resources to employ qualified persons, but they would have possession of certain information which, presumably, they could dispose of to some qualified person, who would be of good character and sound financial standing and who could then come along and get a prospecting licence.  The main purpose in issuing a prospecting licence is to secure the public advantage, and in the case of a person who is not capable of employing it usefully to the public advantage, in the first instance, and to his own advantage in the second instance, so far as the Bill is concerned, there is no justification for issuing a prospecting licence at all. Accordingly, I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by making a statutory reservation in favour of the heir-at-law of a person who had originally secured a prospecting licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even a statutory preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it might easily be true, if you were to insert a legal provision in the Bill vesting the heir-at-law with certain rights, that that might be against the public interest.  The Minister, I think, in speaking, not by intention, implies that the public interest at this stage is all dominating, but the question of equity comes in.  The public interest in this country would suggest that we had no moral code: that we were encouraging people to come in and spend their money in <Col N="2207" /> prospecting, and that then the Government can, arbitrarily, take the whole thing over.  That would be public interest&mdash;material interest&mdash;but we recognise that superior to that is the law of equity.  The Minister also pre-supposes that the heir-at-law will be the one person in possession of the information. A man could spend a fair amount of money bringing in diamond drills or perhaps the newer system of magnetic drills for the purpose of prospecting.  He could spend a lot of money in that way.  He would employ, say, a mining engineer.  He could spend a very large sum of money in that way.  It might be only £10 or it might be £10,000, but whatever it is the same principle operates.  The son is 23 years old, say, and the man assisting is a qualified engineer and has actually participated in this prospecting and in these drillings.  The Minister assumes that the knowledge set down in documents is available to the son who is heir.  Admittedly, the engineer who assisted the original prospector might be better equipped technically and might have a more intimate knowledge of the borings than his heir has. Therefore, I think the Minister's statement does not entirely cover the point raised.  At the same time, I can quite see that if you were to insert a legal provision which vested a right in the heirs-at-law, you might create a worse position than the present one.  The truth is that this is a matter of the Government butting in, taking over people's private land and vesting a right in somebody to go in and prospect.  That is a thing that I have no personal sympathy with.  I do agree with the statement that if the Minister were to attempt to meet our point he might easily make things worse than what they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases of intestacy there might be very considerable difficulty experienced because there might be several heirs-at-law.  I think the correct thing to do in such cases would be to proceed by means of a private company.  It would be quite easy to form a private company, with very small capital, for the purpose, <Col N="2208" /> and that apparently would safeguard the rights of the individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether there is anything to prevent a licence being granted to a limited company?  I cannot see anything in the Bill to prevent that.  In measures of this kind you sometimes do find references which would prevent that, but if it is possible under the Bill to have a licence granted to a limited company I think that would be desirable, because it would enable the difficulty spoken of to be got over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), after paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) serve notice of the making of such order on the owners and occupiers of the lands on or under which such minerals are and on the owners of such minerals provided that in the opinion of the Minister such owners can be reasonably ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister indicated that he would consider an amendment on the lines of the one I have on the Order Paper. He also stated that he doubted whether a personal notice was really necessary as mines and minerals generally vested in the Land Commission. I have ascertained, from available figures, that there are over 4,000,000 acres of land in Eire in respect of which the mines and minerals are not so vested.  That is quite a substantial area.  The Minister also said that the owner of the soil might not be the owner of the mines and minerals and that there might be a difficulty in ascertaining the latter. The amendment which I have put <Col N="2209" /> down does not seem to put any great difficulties in the way of acquisition. It gives the Minister a certain discretion. It only requires that notice will be given in cases where the Minister can be reasonably expected to ascertain who the owner is.</P>
    <P>The reason for the amendment is that the Bill empowers the Minister to take mines and minerals without direct notice to the owner.  Section 17 provides that a person claiming to be entitled to compensation must lodge his claim within two months, with a possible extension to 12 months, after the publication of an order in the <i>Gazette.</i> It would seem probable that, in practice, the first direct intimation the owner would be likely to get would be the actual entry for working the mines and minerals, and this entry would likely be within the specified time.  In that case the owner would be precluded from making any claim for compensation. I feel that, in this matter, there is a strong case for direct notice.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the wording of my amendment perhaps he would consider introducing one of his own, to effect the purpose I have in view, before the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a good deal of consideration to the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane, and I have come to the conclusion that it would not be practicable to give the notice which he requires.  There are many cases in which the number of the surface owners of land who would be affected by a proposal to make a Minerals Acquisition Order would be to the order of several hundred, and a large number of these would not be the owners of minerals at all.  If we were to proceed to notify every one of these several hundred and if by any chance we omitted one or two, perhaps our whole proceedings might be squashed on the ground of irregularity.  I think that, in general, the practical situation would be that, where we propose to make a Minerals Acquisition Order, notice of the making of the order would appear in the newspapers.  Those whom the order was likely to affect would hear of it in that way.  The news would quickly spread amongst the owners' neighbours. <Col N="2210" /> For that reason I ask the Senator not to press the amendment. If I were to accept it, it would create difficulties which would make the working of the Act very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be no difficulty in serving notice on the owners of minerals.  Sometimes, as I know, the owners of minerals do not live in the neighbourhood of their land, and because of that might not see the published notice that the Minister refers to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no registry of mineral owners such as that which corresponds to the land registry.  The names and addresses of the owners of minerals might run into hundreds, and for the reasons I have indicated it would be quite impracticable to do what the Senator suggests in his amendment.  When the Senator first mentioned the matter it seemed to me that it would be quite a reasonable thing to do.  I have since given a great deal of consideration to it, and now find that it would be very difficult, in practice, to do what he suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to have the section so amended as to make it legal to have one person, amongst a number, so notified.  If hundreds of people have to be notified I see the difficulty of doing what is suggested in the amendment.  The Minister has referred to the notice to be given in the newspapers.  I want to assure him that very few people read these notices and, therefore, I suggest to him that is not the way information concerning these matters should be conveyed to land owners.  If the Minister would look into the matter, he might be able to devise some plan whereby notice to any one of these people would be construed as notice to all of them.  Some method of direct communication should be found.  The notice published in the newspapers is not adequate.  Such notices as are published by the Electricity Supply Board and other corporations cannot be regarded as sufficient when acquiring the rights of farmers.</P>

      <P>The question is whether or not the Minister will be put on proof that he has ascertained every owner in the area and served notice upon him.  It might be almost impossible to prove that.  It is the owners of the minerals with whom we are dealing and not the owners of the lands on which the minerals lie.  That point is fairly fully and reasonably dealt with in Section 20.  Before lands can be entered upon for the purpose of working the minerals, the Minister has to serve notice on every person who he thinks has an interest in the lands.  I shall, however, look into the point raised in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of the Seanad, the Government should formulate a scheme of war risk insurance for property, and take the necessary steps to put the scheme into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this motion in the knowledge that the question it raises is a very difficult and a very complex one, and that neither this Minister, nor any other Minister, nor any Government of any kind, can, by waving a magic wand, arrive at a satisfactory solution of it, because it does partake to some degree of the nature of a prophecy of what is going to happen in the future.  At the same time, the matter is one upon which we have already, after years of experience of war and a shorter experience of what is known as total warfare, a certain amount of information.  The motion asks the Government to prepare a scheme of war risk insurance for property.  The question was raised here about four months ago and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the matter had been considered and he would promise that it would receive further consideration.  I think we would be all agreed that it is now more urgent, and is made more urgent, not only by general happenings in the world and in a neighbouring island, but by a disaster which occurred within our own territory and in a rural area.  The problem, for many reasons, is not an urban one.  It is not a problem that concerns the cities only&mdash; the destruction of property in war&mdash;it also concerns rural areas.  Neither is it a problem which concerns the comparatively <Col N="2219" /> small number of property owners only.  It might be said&mdash;the Minister nearly went so far as to say it himself when replying here before&mdash;that these people are capable of looking after themselves, but the position of property-owners, and the consequences of the destruction of property, whether of stocks or buildings, are of concern to other persons besides the owners, and it is in its national aspect and from the point of view of its effect upon employment, upon supplies, and upon the normal life of the people, that I should like to ask the House to consider it, and the Government to take action upon it.</P>
    <P>The question also is not, of course, one which is in any sense one of Party politics.  Ministers have frequently told us recently that we are well within the war zone, and an Army officer, broadcasting the night before last from Dublin, said that it was the wish of the Government that every householder should supply himself with an air raid shelter.  We can see, therefore, that the problem is one of general application and, it would appear,. of immediate urgency.  Sometimes, in this kind of case, one asks for a committee to consider the matter, but it seems to me that the matter has already been considered by the Government and that the Minister would welcome an opportunity of stating what conclusions have been arrived at.  On the 27th May the Minister for Industry and Commerce here contrasted the position of a person whose life was in danger, and said that that kind of man might very reasonably say that insurance for him might be considered before any question of insurance of property was taken up.  The truth, of course, is&mdash; and I should like to deal with it at the outset&mdash;that there is no contrast or opposition at all between the two things, insurance for life and insurance for property.  Life can be insured even against war risks, and I think that most life insurance policies which were in force before the war covered, and still cover, risk of death by enemy action.  In any event, circumstances with regard to loss of civilian life in modern warfare have radically altered. <Col N="2220" /> In every conflict Governments have assumed responsibility or a measure of responsibility for the dependants of soldiers who are killed or wounded, but unfortunately for us all, Sir, the distinction between civilians and soldiers in warfare, and their danger in warfare, has now almost entirely disappeared, and, in certain phases and in certain places, has disappeared to the detriment of the ordinary civilian. Civilians and their property are now in the front line of warfare, and what formerly applied in the way of compensation for the dependants of soldiers must, I think, in the nature of things and within the measure of the resources of the State, apply now to the dependants of the ordinary civilian.  We speak in Irish of the bearna baoghail, or the gap of danger, but there is now no gap of danger into which the soldier can leap to the defence of his fellow-citizens, and the A.R.P. warden, the first-aid worker, or the fireman may find himself, in certain circumstances, in more danger than a member of the actual armed forces of the State.  It seems to me, therefore, that in so far as lives are concerned a national effort must be made, and I have no doubt will be made, to come to the rescue of dependents of persons who lose their lives in war, and to allow these dependants to continue their normal life in the State.</P>
    <P>The question of property, as I said before, is on a different footing, and I should like to deal with its importance, apart altogether from its amenities or profits to the immediate owner.  The existence of stocks, machinery and buildings is necessary to provide work and to provide the very means of livelihood for ordinary people.  From that point of view, certain kinds of property are much more important than others. Property is necessary for the raising of revenue either for the State or for local bodies, and it affects them both directly and indirectly.  Its importance, therefore, as far as normal life is concerned, can hardly be over-estimated.  The owner of property has certain obligations, but in the circumstances of war it is actually impossible for an owner to assume all the obligations of insurance. <Col N="2221" /> Just as his resources are limited, so the resources of the State are limited, but a combination of both, while not providing total cover, would, I think, provide partial cover and provide a certain stability and force, which would help employment when one would wonder what it is that can be done to ensure reconstruction after damage.</P>
    <P>There has been, as I said, a certain experience of what has happened in the war, leading to certain conclusions.  I think it was in 1937 that a committee in England considered the question of war risk insurance and came to the conclusion that the amount of damage that would be done in what is called total warfare would be enormous and incalculable, and that, therefore, no scheme of insurance or compensation could be formulated.  In spite of that, in 1939, certain provisions were made in England under the War Insurance Act with regard to damage to stocks, and, strangely enough, since the intensification of aerial warfare in England, it has been stated that the total damage in relation to the whole sum of property in the country is by no means as great as was thought.  The most recent figure that I remember is that in the month of August 800 houses were destroyed out of a total of 13,000,000. There was also a recent statement by Mr. Keynes, the economist, that if £1,000,000 worth were destroyed every night for a whole year, the total sum would not be an appreciable percentage of property in Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It would only be 4 per cent., Senator Douglas tells me, so that an insurance rate of 4 per cent. would cover it completely.  In England, therefore, it has been concluded, under actual war conditions, that the problem is one which is manageable and which can be handled by the Government. Ordinary companies, however, will not, of course, take the risk.  A very high premium in this country applied compulsorily all over the country would put certain persons out of business and have serious results for the moment, but contributions presumably could be kept within certain limits and Government guarantees also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2222" /> There can be no doubt at all, and the Minister will agree, I think, that should a disaster occur, and should we have actual losses by war action, the question of reconstruction upon the cessation of hostilities will have to be regarded as a national task.  I think that can be regarded as being beyond doubt. It must be done on a national basis and it must be done on an organised basis. A declaration beforehand of Government policy would, therefore, be of very great value indeed.  It would be an assistance to employment, to the accumulation of stocks for an emergency and to the preservation of ordinary standards of life.  A premium of 3 or 4 per cent. would be a very great burden.  A premium of 1 per cent. might be possible, or an increase on the ordinary fire insurance premium paid to an extent which might be agreed upon between competent persons and the Government would, at any rate, provide a fund.  There are, of course, persons much more competent than I am to give an opinion on the matter, but one would like to know if the Minister could tell us, for example, the total amount of fire premiums paid on stocks and buildings in the State for one year, and whether, if that amount had been doubled for the year since the beginning of the war, how much would now be available in a fund to meet war damage.</P>
    <P>The question is important and it is important not only in the cities but in the country towns and rural areas which, as we know, derive their stocks from wholesalers in the city.  If city stock is destroyed, that destruction will have its repercussions far beyond the limits of the particular town or city.  So far, the only property destroyed has been a co-operative creamery in a very remote part of the country.  Then, of course, we have the position which is being dealt with in England by the Government undertaking the whole risk, that is, the position of a great number of people who are purchasers, owner-occupiers of their house and whose houses may be destroyed. They are already paying, compulsorily in most cases, I think, a fire insurance premium, but in a national scheme of reconstruction after the war, <Col N="2223" /> their position would surely have to be rather like what it is now in that they will have to be put in a better position than those who have made no such provision.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter not for the purpose of putting forward criticism or advancing the merits of any particular scheme, but in order to give the Minister an opportunity of stating what conclusions the Government arrived at after consideration and after our experience here and elsewhere.  It seems to me that there are two principles from which we cannot escape.  In the first place, the loss in the national interest must be shared and, in the second place, there must be a national plan for the repairing of damage done. It is obvious, even on a cursory examination, that that plan would have to give certain priorities as between dwellings, business houses and workshops.  Business houses, workshops or factories are obviously much more important than dwelling houses. If I can go to my work and get my pay, whether as salary or wages, I can at any rate live and make some provision for an emergency or for temporary housing.  If I am left with my house and deprived of my income, or of any prospect of having an income, my position is, of course, much worse.  It is, in fact, very bad indeed and much more difficult to remedy.  There may be differences between buildings and stocks and machinery.  In the case of a certain type of shopkeeper, his stocks are more important than his buildings, because he might carry on business in a temporary building if he had stocks.  If business can be carried on, employment will be given, money kept in circulation, and normal life, to some degree, maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is here this evening, took what I might perhaps call a rather casual view of the matter of stocks on the last occasion on which he spoke on this matter, when he said that the incentive to make a profit is the cause of the importing and the carrying of the stocks; but I wonder if the Minister for Industry and Commerce listens when the Minister for <Col N="2224" /> Supplies is broadcasting.  I am sure he does&mdash;I do myself, strange to say&mdash;and the Minister for Supplies recently exhorted shopkeepers to carry as big stocks as they possibly could, and he even asked ordinary householders to stock, if they could afford it, an unusually large amount of food supplies. That exhortation was not made on the ground of profit, or personal safety, or gain, but as a matter of national policy. It seemed to me that the Minister for Supplies was entirely correct in his attitude, and, if he was, the Minister for Industry and Commerce must look on those who hold stocks in the country as having some claim to consideration not only as persons looking for profit but also as persons doing a national job of work.</P>
    <P>What I should like to urge is that a declaration of Government policy should be made in the matter.  I am far from thinking that the Minister, as I said at the outset, can wave a magic wand and give us a complete solution. I know he cannot, but he certainly can do something to grapple with the situation and prevent people from being in a state of complete uncertainty and discouragement which is bad for spending and bad for employment.  Either the Government themselves, or after consultation with certain interests, should come to a conclusion with regard to a compulsory contributory scheme.  There must, I think, be a reasonable contribution from the owner and there must be State assistance so that production and employment can continue.  The best and the cheapest proposition for all the citizens is that, after a period of destruction, the State should give all the help it can to restart works, to replace stocks and machinery and to let normal life be resumed, because on the resumption of that normal life will depend the payment of wages, rates and taxes and the maintenance of social services. The problem, unfortunately for us, may be a rural one as well as an urban one, and it goes much beyond the interests of the individual who has suffered loss. I urge that a declaration of Government policy would have a good effect and would be much more valuable if made now than if made after the event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the proposer of this motion, and I think that the present position is about as unsatisfactory as it could be.  It is obvious that we, in common with other countries, run the risk of war damage.  The question, therefore, is: if such damage arose who would pay for it? If the misfortunes of war should come upon us it would be unfair that the burden of making good the damage should be borne by the individual who has suffered that damage.  I think that such damage should be regarded as a national loss, and I would suggest that the Government should announce immediately that any loss due to war damage would be made good out of the National Exchequer.</P>
      <P>If this view were accepted, it has then to be considered whether, if such payments should become necessary, the money should be raised in the ordinary way by means of taxation designed to spread the burden as equitably as possible over the whole community, or whether some insurance scheme should be sponsored by the Government.  In Britain, as the proposer of the motion said, there is a Government scheme for the insurance of commodities, but it is only now that they are considering the insurance of other property.  If any damage should be done in this country, I feel that the poor individual who just has his furniture as his sole possession, or the property owner, is as much entitled to consideration under a scheme of this sort as the owner of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage of an insurance scheme, of course, would be that it would enable a fund to be accumulated out of which losses could be made good in whole or in part.  If such a scheme had been started at the outbreak of the war, a substantial sum would now be available, even if only a moderate premium had been charged.  One of the Irish insurance companies with which I am connected put forward the basis of such a scheme as far back as 1st September, 1939, and I suggest that if action had then been taken the problem <Col N="2226" /> would have been much easier of solution than it is now.  I fear that the time for setting up a satisfactory insurance scheme has gone.  I feel that quite definitely.  Even if you were to start a scheme to-morrow, unless a fund could be speedily accumulated it would not be an insurance at all; and in order to accumulate an adequate sum speedily, I think it would now be necessary to charge a very high rate of premium, probably £3 or £4 per cent.  Unless the scheme were compulsory, I feel that the great bulk of the people would be unable to pay premiums based on a figure as high as that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The fact that it is compulsory does not make it any easier for the people to pay, and of course the difficulty of collection under any compulsory scheme would be enormous. There is also the point that high insurance premiums, under a compulsory scheme, would tend to deter traders from building up reserves of stock as they have been advised to do by the Minister for Supplies.  It would also tend towards the practice of passing the increased cost on to the consumer, as far as that could be done without bringing on the trader the attentions of the Prices Commission, and in any event it would have the inevitable tendency to increase costs and increase the cost of living.</P>

    <P>Taking all those matters into account I feel that, on the whole, a solution of the problem must be something in the nature of a Government declaration that war damage will be treated as a national loss.  Even without such a declaration, I agree with Senator Hayes that, if there were such damage, at the end of hostilities it would have to be faced up to as a national loss. Certainly the individual could not deal with it, and the insurance companies could not deal with it either.  There is one suggestion which I would make to the Minister, and I think he might consider it now, and that is that there might be a scheme for the registration of property at risk, either a compulsory or an optional scheme, but at any <Col N="2227" /> rate let every individual, every firm and local authority, declare the value of the property and pay a registration fee of, let us say, 10/- per cent. That would, in any event, give something in hand, and if at a later date money had to be raised to pay for war damage, the scheme of registration might well be used as a basis for the collection of the amount required to deal with such damage.  It seems to me that that is as much as the community can now afford to pay, and it does seem to me that if such a scheme of registration were undertaken it would give the Government most valuable information in the unhappy event of the country becoming involved in the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say that I have not given this motion by Senator Hayes much consideration, because I received it only quite recently. I just want to say one thing with regard to the comment he made on Professor Keynes' most interesting speech, in case there are any Senators who may not have heard it.  The first thing to remember with regard to his figures is that the population of London is exactly double that of the whole of Ireland, and if the amount of destruction done in London were done in Dublin the cost of it would be perfectly colossal.  I think we must remember that if the destruction in London seems small it is because the British have filled the air with armadas of aeroplanes, and that they have tens of thousands of anti-aircraft guns to keep the raiders away.  It seems to me that what you might make on the roundabouts in the negative way of losses that you did not experience in the knocking down of houses you would certainly have to lose on the swings of the aeroplanes and anti-aircraft guns which you would have to buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that, whatever contribution might be exacted from the profiteers in the shape of insurance, in the end it is the Government that would be forced to pay by raising taxation, and I am sure that any Government would be glad to do so.  But surely it is not simply a <Col N="2228" /> case of money and nothing else.  If the hundreds of millions of pounds which would have to be produced to put things back where they were before they were knocked down could be found in this country, I think it might be possible to put some things back, but I do not think they could ever be put back in the way they were before they were knocked down, if anything like the scale of destruction which has taken place elsewhere even in this short time should happen here.  I imagine if we ever became involved it would be on the same gigantic scale as it will eventually be in England.  Therefore, it seems to me that to face up to the problem now, to make any definite rule about it, would be very difficult. To my mind, it would be a matter of waiting to see what happened.  If it could be done by means of insurance now it would be a very good thing, but I do not think the people would stand for it and I do not think they would raise the money that some of the speakers might anticipate raising in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Senator Brennan that at this stage&mdash;I would actually go so far as to say even at an earlier stage&mdash;insurance to cover what is contemplated is not practicable. I also feel that the extremely interesting speech of Senator Hayes was, to a large extent, a plea rather for Government compensation than for insurance.  If the principle of insurance were adopted, it is difficult to see how you could have the sort of discrimination between different classes of property for which Senator Hayes asks.  He pointed out that it was more important that the factory owner, for example, should be compensated than the owner of the private house that was destroyed.  I think that is true, and if you had a State scheme of compensation the State would naturally give priority where it was considered priority ought to be given; but if you had a scheme of insurance under which we were all paying the same premiums then it would be grossly unfair that we should not get the same benefits in consequence of our premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson thinks that the <Col N="2229" /> Government ought not to make any declaration at all, and I cannot say I agree with him.  Perhaps it does not matter very much so long as no damage is actually occurring but, as Senator Hayes pointed out, there has been some damage already in Wexford&mdash;I do not know whether compensation has been obtained from the German Government for that as we were told it was going to be.  There may be other cases and there may be deliberate damage done here and deliberate damage on a large scale.  If there is, it will be intensely depressing for all concerned to have no assurance from the Government that they are going to do anything about it.  I think, in principle, that it should be understood that the community as a whole must bear the cost of war damage, though in the actual provision of the money and the allocation of labour and materials for repairing damage I agree that priority should be given according to the national importance of the establishment concerned.  I speak myself with a certain personal feeling on the subject because I am unhappy enough to possess a house in London which has been wrecked by a bomb, and certainly it would give me much more peace of mind if I knew the British community was going to do something about it some time or other.</P>

      <P>I think there will be no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the two principles which Senator Hayes suggested should govern the position which would exist if by any chance the risks which he fears were to become realities and we were to find ourselves subjected to destruction by war.  Those two principles were that the loss occasioned by the war, so far as life and property were concerned, must be shared, and that there would be a national plan for reconstruction. The Government, this time last year, very shortly after the outbreak of war, when this question of war risk insurance for property owners was first raised, indicated that that was a problem which would arise for consideration at the end of the war and that it would be dealt with according to the resources which are available to <Col N="2230" /> the community.  I think that that is the only reasonable position which the Government can take up in a matter of this sort.</P>

      <P>That is an aspect of the matter with which I could deal, too.  If we are to assume that we are involved in a war and that by reason of that involvement property is damaged either in the City of Dublin or elsewhere, is there any person going to suggest that in the midst of hostilities we are going to be able to undertake a plan of reconstruction or that we are then and there going to be in a position to compensate fully any person whose property may have been damaged?  I hope we are only talking hypothetically and that we shall continue to talk hypothetically until the war no longer rages, but, are we to proceed on this principle, that in the case of damage to property it is going to be first come first served, and that a person who happens to be lucky enough to have his property destroyed while the resources of the community are still unencroached upon is going to get reasonably full compensation and that the poor person who managed to stick it out to the end, when our resources are perhaps exhausted, is going to get nothing?  It is quite clear that, on the principle which Senator Hayes has outlined, the national loss must be shared, it must be shared equally and equitably and that, accordingly, the compensation which any person may secure must be proportionate to our resources to compensate everyone who has suffered.</P>

      <P>I am not going to commit myself or the Government <Col N="2231" /> more definitely than I have already stated.  Indeed, in regard to the question of compensation for damage to property, perhaps I am not the Minister most competent to speak. It would be a matter for the Minister for Finance rather than for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I may be more interested in the other aspects of the problem, those which relate to the insurance of stocks, but, at any rate, I should like to continue.  The difference between accepting the two principles which Senator Hayes has submitted to us and which the Government accepts, and launching a scheme of insurance is, that in relation to a scheme of insurance a definite specific obligation is undertaken to each particular person who takes out insurance and that it is the basis of insurance that the premium which is to be collected in return for the acceptance of that obligation should be proportionate to the risk.  Who is going to be competent in our present circumstances to assess the risks and to fix the premiums for war damage?  Insurance also, I think, proceeds on this principle, that the cover is only extended when conditions are normal and when the risks that are to be accepted are normal also.  At the present moment, if we were to fix a premium for war risk insurance it would be fixed on the basis that we are at peace and that we wish to remain at peace and that there was not any prospect that our desires in that matter would not be realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going to be the risk of the damage?  The risk of damage, we may assume, would be infinitesimal and the premium would be correspondingly infinitesimal.  But what is feared is that these conditions may change and that, instead of the damage being an abnormality intruded into normal conditions, destructive damage would become the normal <Col N="2232" /> condition and we should have to pay compensation upon a basis in which damage was the normal condition in return for premiums that were fixed on the assumption that peace and the absence of damage were the normal conditions.</P>
      <P>Now, that is the great difficulty in relation to this matter, that there is no actuarial basis for any such insurance scheme as has been suggested and, accordingly, it would be, I think, sailing very close to the wind indeed if the Government were to say: &ldquo;We are prepared to institute a scheme of insurance in order to cover the risk of damage to property&rdquo;.  I do not think, if war came here, that there is any insurance fund that we could build up that would grant full compensation to every person who might have property damaged, and there is certainly no insurance fund that could be built up on a contributory basis, as the result of premiums collected, which would enable us to do that.</P>

      <P>Senator Brennan suggested that the position would have been better to-day if a scheme such as has been advocated here had been instituted 12 months ago.  Let us examine that.  In connection with the problem of providing some sort of cover for stocks&mdash;and it is a much easier problem, difficult and all as it is, than that of providing some sort of cover for damage to property&mdash;we have to start on this assumption, that there are about £15,000,000 worth of stocks of insurable commodities in the country.  What is going to be the premium on those stocks?  What are we going to relate it to?  Are we going to relate it to the premiums normally paid to cover fires or civil commotion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is going to be the basis of our judgment in fixing these premiums? I cannot find any.  But, if we assume that a premium of 10/- per cent. were taken&mdash;and such a premium has <Col N="2233" /> actually been suggested to me&mdash;it would be inadequate.  If we make it 4 per cent. we will be told it is too high, and indeed it would be a very heavy burden upon stocks, a burden which would reflect itself in a considerable increase in the cost of living for every single individual in the country, not merely for the person who has the stocks, who owns the property, but on people who have no stocks at all, who have to live from hand to mouth and who, beyond the fact that when they buy the commodity it helps them to maintain life, are not securing any advantage out of it.  I was assuming that the premium would be 10/- per cent. and, on £15,000,000 worth of stocks, that would bring us in £75,000.  We have to deduct from that the cost of administration, the cost of collection, the cost of assessment and checking and all the other working expenses.  If we assume, and it is a pretty optimistic assumption, that all these costs would not exceed 10 per cent., we would have as an insurance fund to cover the total risk of £15,000,000 a sum of £68,000.  I do not think that the absence of that £68,000 aggravates the problem either for the owner of the stocks or anyone else.</P>

      <P>How do we know? One Senator has already pointed out the extent of the damage in London, notwithstanding the extent of the resources with which they have equipped themselves to prevent damage.  Do not assume that if this State is involved in war and, if damage does arise here, that it is going to be anything less than total damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator can equip us with all the facilities for defence which are available in London, I would be inclined to agree with him that it would not be any worse here than it is in London, but until we are as well equipped, it is only reasonable to assume, if an attack were made upon this city or upon our country, that the damage would be much more widespread than it is in London. Accordingly, the difficulties of dealing with this question as a problem of insurance would be intensified.</P>
      <P>I think, so far as damage to property is concerned, we shall have, in fairness to everybody concerned, to confine ourselves to the principle that it is not capable of being dealt with as an insurance problem, that we shall have to accept the equity of the principles which Senator Hayes has laid down, that the loss will have to be shared by everyone and that at the end of the war there will have to be a general national policy for reconstruction. We must deal with it in that light.  There is no other way I can see that it can be reasonably dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to matters of this sort, we could not give precedence to property over life.  The Senator has indicated that it has been the custom hitherto, when wars have been waged and won, for the victorious State to compensate its soldiers for the losses they have suffered and the risks they have undergone, by granting them pensions.  Of course, pensions are not universally granted.  They are <Col N="2235" /> granted to the dependents of those who have lost their lives but, as a rule, these pensions have been finally determined only after the cessation of hostilities and I think, even in regard to the loss of civilian life in this country, that the kind of permanent provision which we should be able to make for the dependents of those who have lost their lives will depend entirely upon the situation which we may be faced with after the war.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of compensation for stocks, it has been represented to me that the fact that there is an absence of cover against war risk has deterred people from laying up stocks which otherwise they might have done.  We have been investigating that somewhat exhaustively.  Numerous proposals have been submitted to us, and we have tried to draft some of our own, and discussions have taken place between officers of my Department and those who might be thought to be competent to give advice in this matter, with the object of formulating a scheme which would be workable and which would be within our resources, because it would be of no value whatever to any person if a scheme were launched which obviously would be beyond our capacity and which would not, in fact, give that assurance which is needed.</P>
    <P>There are difficult questions to be considered in that connection.  Senator Brennan has mentioned a number of them.  What premium are we going to ask people to pay?  I have pointed out that a premium of 10/- per cent., which was first suggested by those who approached us in relation to the matter, would be wholly inadequate.  A premium of 8 per cent. in present circumstances might be also inadequate. Where, then, in reason, are we going to secure a figure which will be proportionate to the risk which we run? Then we have the other question&mdash; whether we are going to make this compulsory or make it voluntary.  If we make it compulsory, we do spread the risk in the greatest measure but we are up against two difficulties there.  First of all, are we going to bring into the scheme people who feel that they do not want to be insured at all?  It would <Col N="2236" /> be a mistake to assume that the demand for this scheme is universal amongst industrialists, merchants and those who have valuable properties in this State.  Since the matter was first mooted in this House, I have received very weighty representations from some of the most important concerns in the city protesting against the adoption of such a scheme.  They have apparently examined the matter for themselves and have come to the conclusion that it is not possible, in existing circumstances to afford them adequate cover and that the cost to the community of undertaking that obligation would be prohibitive, that is, if you are going to adopt, in terms of assurance, the principle, that you are entering into a specific commitment with every individual from whom you collect a premium to repay him the full cost, perhaps, of any damage he may suffer.</P>
    <P>As I have said, some of the largest concerns in this city are very strongly opposed to any scheme of compulsory insurance.  These are people who would be able to pay but who regard the premium, which they estimate would be the adequate premium, as imposing a burden on their business altogether disproportionate to the amount of benefit and protection which the scheme would give them.  As against that class, you have the other, and perhaps the much more numerous, class of small people who could not pay the premium.  If we are going to make this scheme compulsory, how are we going to deal with them?  Are we going to compel them to fix a value on their stocks?  Are we going to start to check the value, or are we going to give power to officers of the State to enter every man's store and assess the value of the stock which he may have there, irrespective of whether he wants it insured or not?  Having done that, if they still refuse to pay the premium are we going to invoke the law to compel them to pay it?  You say: &ldquo;Very well, leave them and make the scheme a voluntary one&rdquo;.  Suppose we do leave them, and they constitute, as they may well turn out to constitute, the majority of the owners of stocks in this country, what becomes of this <Col N="2237" /> principle of insurance, of spreading the risk?  Does not the spread become narrower and more restricted, and must not the premium become higher? Is the State, in respect to that narrower class which is prepared to pay the premium, to impose an obligation upon the people who do not want insurance to honour commitments which the State makes with those who do want insurance?  As I say, these are points that have to be considered, and it is going to be exceedingly difficult to draft any sort of scheme of insurance that will give the sort of cover which has been suggested as necessary in order to meet the present situation.</P>
    <P>There is, however, in respect to the whole of this problem, one ray of hope, and that is that a number of people in those industries in regard to which the need for a scheme would seem to have most greatly impressed itself, have come together and are forming mutual insurance societies. That would seem to be perhaps the best solution of all of the problem, because if those who are engaged in any particular trade or industry can agree amongst themselves that they are going to make the risk of war damage a common charge, well then, they can make arrangements which will be mutually acceptable to all of them, and they will leave the State free to deal with people who are unable to enter into such common obligations because perhaps they have not the resources or because, at the moment, they do not see the need to provide against such risks.</P>
    <P>I should not like, however, the House to assume from all that I have said that the question of insurance for stocks and commodities has been definitely turned down.  We are pursuing that matter further and perhaps within the next month or six weeks I may be in a position to make a more definite pronouncement in regard to it. From what I have said Senators can see that it is not the plain and simple problem that it might be assumed to be from some of the statements made in the Press or from some of the remarks made here in regard to it.</P>

      <P>So many points have been raised, and so many new points <Col N="2238" /> have been dealt with by the Minister that, unless I were to take up the time of the House at great length, I would find considerable difficulty in expressing my point of view in regard to all of them.  There are very few points, however, raised either by the mover of the motion or by the Minister, to which I have not given some thought or which I have not heard discussed by persons interested in this question.  I want to confine myself to a few points which seem to me of the greatest importance. First of all, in order that there may be no doubt remaining afterwards, I want to ask the Minister a certain question. Am I to take it on behalf of the Government, which means on behalf of the State, that the principle is accepted that should there be damage to individuals or to property during the war, the principle of State liability according to its resources, is accepted by the Government?  The Minister has stated that he said that on a previous occasion. I do not doubt for a moment what he said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  He made use of some such statement, and I should like to know whether it meant that or not.  Am I to take it from his speech to-day that is now the view of the Government?  If it is, it changes the whole aspect of the matter very considerably.  If it is not, then I think it is time that we had a very carefully prepared statement as to what is the view and the attitude of the Government. We are facing a time of very considerable difficulty.  The Minister has very properly pointed out that we have no knowledge which would enable us to know exactly what the danger in future may be.  We do know that we are in what is called the war zone. We know, as was pointed out by Senator Hayes, that the nature of the present warfare&mdash;and we have no reason to think that it will be fundamentally different if it does come here &mdash;means that the civilian, his home, his property and his business, which is by no means always a matter of personal property&mdash;are in the forefront of the <Col N="2239" /> battle.  Whereas in the past the State accepted liability towards soldiers and their dependents, it cannot in future confine liability, in a time of war, with any measure of justice, simply to what are called combatants, because as far as one can see, non-combatants are likely to be in the front line.</P>
      <P>Although that is so, I do not think there is any ground whatever for the pessimism of the Minister when he tells us that if there is damage done we must be prepared for the possibility of 100 per cent. damage.  He said that the stocks represented £15,000,000, and told us that we should be prepared to pay for the destruction of stocks.  If there was 100 per cent. destruction it would not matter whether we could pay or not.  Bad and all as things may be, I do not think there is any evidence that in any country there is any danger of 100 per cent. damage to stocks, even in warfare as we see it to-day.  I think that is an unduly pessimistic view.  I hope it is not the view of the members of the Government, even though it be the view that has been clearly stated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have been in England comparatively recently.  I was in the North of England, where I have business connections, and where important industries here are dependent in the matter of supplies.  One thing that seemed clear to me was that, although there had been air raids every night for three weeks, the proportionate amount of damage done&mdash;I do not want to underrate it&mdash;was relatively small, and that at the rate of destruction it would take, probably, ten or 20 years before 100 per cent. damage had occurred in any industrial district in England.  While I do not want to underrate this problem, which is a real and difficult one, I think the Minister is basing his consideration as to whether or not there is to be a scheme of war risk insurance on the assumption that he must allow for a possible 100 per cent. damage to stock representing £15,000,000.  If so, then I think he is bound to reject it.</P>

      <P>I am extremely sorry if I misunderstood the Minister, but I think he mentioned £15,000,000 and asked what would 10/- per cent. on that amount to.  Some Senator questioned whether we would have to deal with 100 per cent. for the whole £15,000,000, and he gave me the impression that he thought the State would be prepared for that eventuality.</P>

      <P>No.  I said in relation to the City of Dublin that if we were to be attacked, then, with the defensive resources we have at our hands, we could not possibly relate the amount of damage done here to the amount of damage done in London.  I said in relation to this comparatively undefended city we might anticipate practically total destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the £15,000,000 related to the country as a whole and not to Dublin.  There is no need for argument if that is the Minister's view.  I do not think that there should be any real fear of total destruction.  I do not think there is any need to base any scheme on the assumption of total damage.  I view the whole problem in a rather different way to that in which the Minister approached it, and, to some extent, different to the approach of certain other Senators.  It seems to me that preparation to ensure the carrying on of the normal life and trade of the country is just as much part and parcel of preparation for modern warfare as the provision of military defence or as the increasing of supplies for the army or the creation of the local security force or similar measures. They are all part and parcel of the defence preparation of the State, and it is as important for the State to issue a clear statement as to what its attitude will be towards people who are in the front line in their homes as to what it will do for soldiers killed or injured when dealing with certain types of invasion.  There is a real need for a clear statement.  I seem to be more optimistic than the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to take it from his speech that it is considered by him that at the end of the war there would have to be a scheme of compensation for <Col N="2241" /> damage but that it would have to be based on what the State could afford at the time.  I take it that he favours some such scheme.  If that be the case I think he is right.  I do not think it can be avoided, but the sooner the Government makes it clear&mdash;I do not think they have yet made it clear&mdash; the better for everyone.  It would add to the national morale, and would reduce a certain amount of fear about the building up of stocks which I believe exists in some trades.  But that does not meet the whole case. You will at some date after the cessation of hostilities have to consider the question of compensation.  You will have to provide, in addition, some method by which you can deal with more urgent matters before what will be regarded as the final date ending hostilities.  The question of stocks should include furniture and essentials in houses of private individuals, particularly poorer people.</P>
    <P>Even if part of Dublin is destroyed the country must go on and we must all try to live.  The whole nation will have to live even if Dublin ceases as a centre of distribution, and other centres for stocks will have to be found. We cannot sit still and say: &ldquo;We are not going to carry on.&rdquo;  Obviously, if the Houses of Parliament are destroyed we can, if necessary, meet in a barn. We would not start to build an elaborate Parliament House until the end of hostilities.  As far as essential stocks and the livelihood of the nation is concerned these would have to be replaced as quickly as possible and, to my mind, there should be no question of waiting for a Government scheme. A Minister has recently been urging shopkeepers to carry maximum stocks, and if they go to bankers and other people to finance them, they should be in a position to say that they are able to insure these stocks. I want to deal with that particular problem because I regard the maintenance of stocks spread over as widely as possible to be an essential part of our plans for carrying on the life of the country even in war time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that point when I come to a note I have dealing with compulsion.  If you assume, as I do, that a scheme of insurance for stocks is desirable, it does not seem to me that the premium which you are going to charge is necessarily a premium which will provide at an early date a fund to cover the whole amount of what would be regarded as a reasonably possible risk. It is the difference between an immediate payment in full and what would be provided afterwards by the State for which the person or firm is paying the premium.  The rate of 10/- per cent. was suggested; it would provide a fund which might or might not be adequate.  Probably, in the case of serious damage, it would not be adequate but it would, at any rate, provide something towards the total. The premium would be paid, not for getting insurance in the sense that the payers would be the only persons who would be compensated, but&mdash; the State having accepted the principle that compensation should be to some extent based on the national economy at the time and that every person would be compensated&mdash;it would be paid in order that he would be compensated at once and not have to wait until the end of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of compulsion was raised and the Minister showed the various difficulties, most of which&mdash;as he puts them&mdash;I admit.  There is always a difficulty in deciding where the line is to be drawn.  In the first place, I understand that in Great Britain&mdash;whether they did it successfully or not&mdash;they made a distinction between what Senator Sir John Keane describes as luxuries and essentials. At any rate, they took certain types of stocks and did not make it compulsory to insure them.  I think it was permissible. Certain types of stocks were made compulsory, but the very small stock was exempted.  I am not sure of the figure, but I think the stock under £1,000 was exempted.  There was no provision by which it could be insured voluntarily and, personally, it seems to me that that was a mistake.  The way to get over the question of compulsion is to leave out the small man, by making a <Col N="2243" /> margin of £1,000 or £2,000 and making it possible for him, if he is willing to pay the same rate of premium, and by leaving out luxury stocks.  I have an open mind as to whether or not it would be desirable that these luxury stocks should be allowed in on a voluntary basis.  I would be in favour, if the experts dealing with this business think it would strengthen the scheme as a whole.  From the national point of view, obviously, it is not essential that they be insured and the individual point of view must come after the national.</P>

      <P>Would the Senator tell us how he would deal with the case of a chemist who might sell essential medicines, yet the bulk of whose trade may be in cosmetics?  How would he deal with large city stores where the stock may consist of all sorts of articles, some of which could not be described as anything else but necessities and others which could not be described as anything but luxuries? What possible way would he have of assessing the value of the stocks to be insured?  Let him look at the practical difficulties in the shape of these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if very heavy retail stocks are held generally over the country.  The Minister's idea may be that they carry large stocks for profit, but that is not so. You carry a stock as small as you can, while maintaining your turnover, and the smaller the stock in relation to the turnover the greater the profit.  A chemist carries a very small stock and gets his supplies frequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the <Col N="2244" /> wholesaler the stocks will be easily divided.  He makes his returns for insurance purposes.  He will have stocktaking returns once or twice a year, and I do not think he will be in a difficult position in regard to insuring his stock of one class of commodities without necessarily insuring the other.  When you come to the question of settling insurance claims, there are, of course, a great many problems&mdash;Senator Brennan could explain that point better than I could&mdash;but there are recognised ways in which those questions can be met.  Figures for purchases and sales of a particular type of stock are the only method by which you can ascertain the total stock at a certain time, and I do not believe, as far as the wholesaler is concerned, that there would be a fundamental difficulty in differentiating between different classes.  I admit that with regard to the small retailer there would be a difficulty, as he would not be able to show from his records what was a cosmetic sale or what was one of patent medicines.  I am not prepared to follow the Minister in saying whether a great many of the medicines at present on sale should not be regarded as national necessities: I have grave doubt that some of them are no more important than cosmetics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is going to assess the value of the stocks which are insurable?  Who is going to assess the damage?  I gather that in Great Britain the fire insurance companies are not doing it and that there is no method of appraisal, that there is no standard for appraising the damage. It is so easy to talk about this matter in terms of insurance, but the moment you begin to apply the ordinary machinery of insurance to this problem it breaks down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I cannot see that.  If my place is burned down as a result of an incendiary bomb, why cannot the same method of appraisal be applied as if it were burned down through some carelessness on the part of my staff?  The Minister may have some point which I cannot see.  There are recognised methods: it may not be done by insurance companies; as a matter of fact, <Col N="2245" /> it is not done by insurance companies even in the case of their own liability. There are recognised firms who do it and a few valuers act for all the insurance companies here, if my information is correct.  I really do not believe that that point is one of serious difficulty, if the principle were agreed to.  Small people to whom the Minister has referred and who might decide they would not be insured would not, I think, be found to hold the bulk of the stock in the country.  It may be in the Minister's mind that the majority of holders would decline to insure.  I think it is perfectly possible that, if people believed that the State would come along anyway, there are a number of people who would prefer not to pay their 10/- per cent. and who would take the risk in the hope that, if they were unfortunate, they would be dealt with liberally afterwards.  I think that would not be in the national interest, and where the business is sufficiently large and has a stock of over £2,000, it should be made compulsory.  It may not be in the national interest that luxury stocks should be kept large but, frankly, I do not see that there is a serious difficulty regarding luxury stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one other point before concluding.  The Minister refers to certain companies which have been formed to provide what I think he called insurance, but which I would prefer to call a pool, and he sees in that a ray of hope.  I cannot agree with him.  By the very nature of things, these companies have to ask either for a heavy payment or guarantee. Different schemes have been mooted. There is one well-known through published advertisements.  As regards the others, I do not know whether they are going on or not, but there is either to be a payment or a guarantee or a combination of both.  In the case of a guarantee there is to be a pay-out within nine months of a total of 5 per cent. of the whole of the value of the insured assets of the concern.  If that is to be regarded with Ministerial approval, it raises a very serious problem for the directors of large companies who are not dealing <Col N="2246" /> with their own property.  They will be faced with the question of whether they are justified in doing nothing, and, therefore, making no provision at all against damage, or whether they are justified in undertaking a liability to pay one-twentieth of their total assets, thereby, possibly, crippling their concerns.</P>
    <P>Now, the paying out of one-twentieth of the capital assets in cash would be a very serious undertaking indeed for most companies to face.  It is causing many of them very considerable misgivings at the moment.  Speaking for many people, I can say that the very fact that these pool schemes are being proposed makes it all the more urgent that the Government should, as soon as possible, make its attitude perfectly clear so that it may be possible for those who are in the serious position of having to safeguard the interests of a large number of people, and very often of a considerable number of employees, to reach a decision.</P>
    <P>Senators have seen certain statements made with regard to schemes for the formation of a pool in which the risk will be shared by those who share the guarantee, and they have heard the statement of the Minister that we must not take his statement as turning down a scheme of insurance on stocks.  The net result of that is to leave people in almost a worse position than they were before this debate opened.  Most people would prefer a scheme covering their stocks to any scheme of mutual pool that could be devised, but in the meantime we are very much in the air.  I believe it would be far better for business that the Government should make a statement that they had decided not to have any State-assisted insurance scheme.  People would then know where they were, and decisions could be made accordingly.  I very much hope that if the Government does make a decision it will not deal only with stock insurance, and that it will be one that will make clear what the attitude of the State is towards war losses.  The experience on the other side, terrible though it has been, does, I think, suggest that there is no need for any kind of pessimism or that you must prepare <Col N="2247" /> for anything like one hundred per cent. damage.  It is a very remarkable fact that you have an economist of the eminence of Mr. J.M. Keynes stating that if you take England as a whole you could have £1,000,000 worth of damage per night, and that even with that, at the end of a year there will be only 4 per cent. of the total damage.  When you realise that, as far as stocks are concerned, they have collected during the year 3 per cent., it means that on the other side they have made very considerable provision already.</P>
    <P>I think it is a mistake to assume that it is too late now to make a start.  I think one of the reasons why a start was not made last September was the feeling that the damage was either to come very quickly or not at all.  Most people feel now that if the damage does not come very soon it will not come at all.  I think that the future is utterly incalculable.  The damage may not come for years, it may be very sudden, or it may not come at all.  I think some provision should be made apart from any end of the war scheme, by which some kind of prompt compensation will be made by the State such as may be necessary to enable people to carry on.  In my opinion that scheme should be started now.  If it be decided, as I hope it will be, to formulate a scheme for some kind of war risk insurance, then I think that insurance should be on stocks.  I should also like to see it on small dwellings, though not on large buildings.  If that is done, then I urge, do not put on a prohibitive premium.  If it is necessary to have a premium and to get together a large fund, let those who participate in the scheme undertake to make payments over four or five years.  It would be impracticable if people are to be asked, in the case of insurance on stocks, to make huge payments in one year for the purpose of providing an immediate fund.  I think the payment of the premiums should be spread over four or five years, it being always understood that if the danger passed the Government would stop payments when sufficient funds had been collected.  In view of the general attitude taken up by the Minister, I am more than ever <Col N="2248" /> convinced that insurance of stocks is a sound principle, especially as we are all agreed that ultimately the State would have to come along and do something to meet the damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that so far as the majority of the members of the House are concerned this may be regarded as a rather open question.  It is one on which we would require a good deal of information before we could be expected to pass judgment on it.  Having listened to the Minister and to other speakers, I am of the opinion, no matter what scheme may be devised, or whether any scheme is devised, that Ministers and the State cannot absolve themselves from the responsibility of trying to restore, in the event of damage being done, the property of the State to a condition in which the country's affairs can be carried on as usual.  I am not in a position to offer an opinion as to what would be the better method to follow&mdash;the scheme suggested by Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas, or one that the Minister might produce.  What I am concerned about is this: that we should have a clear statement from the Government, if there is the destruction of life or property, that there is going to be some authority to restore property and to compensate for the loss of life in so far as that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found it rather difficult to follow the line of reasoning followed by the Minister.  At one point of his argument he seemed to suggest that we ought not to contemplate a scheme of insurance because, as he said, you would have to provide against a total loss.  Even supposing we did suffer a total loss, then surely somebody will have to make an effort to provide compensation. If I had responsibility, and if I believed, as the Minister seemed to, that there was going to be total loss, I would immediately set about doing what the Minister seems to have a great objection to do.  We have been told that we have stocks in the country to the value of £15,000,000.  If the war goes on for two or three years, and if we suffer a total loss, then if nothing is done in the meantime as regards making provision for compensation, it will be impossible to do anything <Col N="2249" /> sensible at all when the war is over due to the utter confusion that will prevail, the inability to get information, and the other difficulties with which we will be confronted at that time.  If one believed, as the Minister does, that we are going to have total loss, then the right thing to do would be to send inspectors into every store in the country to get records of stocks. That would be the way to ensure that, when total loss did come, equitable compensation, so far as possible, would be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I should not be anxious to have the inspectors but, when property is blown up, you send down inspectors to the ruins.  That was what was done when the British left and after the civil war.  They went to the warehouses and shops and made calculations as to what was stored there. They looked up such invoices as were available, but many of the invoices were burned.  There were no reliable records of trading, and it would be impossible to decide what was equitable compensation.  If you are to have total destruction, that inspection should be done before it comes if equitable compensation is to be allowed.  Of course, this may never happen.</P>

You will not win a war by not knowing whether you are in it or not, and you will not save a city by not knowing whether you are going to defend it or not or whether or not you will get the means to defend it.

      <P>We have creameries turning out from eight tons to 10 tons of butter, value 150/- a cwt., per day. Suppose you have total destruction of one of these creameries, what is going to happen?  Are you going to leave it until the end of the war in that position?  What is to happen to the thousands of farmers in the locality who have products to be manufactured for the use of the people of our own towns?  Are they expected to go into the banks and get the necessary money? It would not be so easy to get them to do that.  I am afraid you would have waste and destruction of valuable products and that knowing that their property might be blown up, they would not put up a thousand pounds to carry on the manufacturing process temporarily in a crude way.  There ought to be some statement by the Ministry regarding cases like that.  The trade of half a county could be dislocated by the destruction of one pivotal point. We do not know how we stand in that connection and our minds are not any clearer as a result of the Minister's statement to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an internal question.  It is not a question on which the Minister should be rushed into a decision but, at the same time, it is of sufficient <Col N="2251" /> urgency to warrant a clear statement from the Government as to what their line of action would be.  There was a certain amount of destruction in Campile. What are the Government doing about that?  We are not at war, and let us hope will not be at war, but even our neutral position did not prevent that destruction.  We do not know that more of that may not come to us. What is to happen the concerns that are blown up, if it does come, between that period and the end of the war, which may be three or four years hence?  These are questions which are agitating the minds of people in the country.  We ought to know where we stand.  My own view is that the State must, in the last analysis, be responsible for seeing that, so far as it is able, equitable compensation will be awarded to citizens who suffer loss during this period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather astounded by the statement of Senator Baxter, that we ought to know where we stand.  That is the difficulty.  None of us knows what a year or two years may bring upon us.  The difficulty in regard to insurance is that, before you had an adequate fund built up, you might meet with a loss which would absorb the whole of the fund.  A large quantity of oil or some valuable commodity might be destroyed in one night and that loss might absorb the whole fund.  I do not see how you are to deal with a matter of that kind unless you take power to pay out only a proportion of the loss.  We are, I think, looking at the question too much from the point of view of carrying on the life of the community on the old peace-time methods and we are giving too much attention to vested interests.  I have often made a plea for vested interests under ordinary conditions but, in case of total war, you have got completely to alter your outlook and realise that, if these calamities happen, it may be necessary for the State to undertake the essential services.  It may be necessary for the State to take control of the existing resources and see that they are pooled for the benefit of the community.  I do not think you can <Col N="2252" /> expect to carry on on the present method of private trading, which is admirable in peace time, in a period of total warfare.</P>
      <P>You have got to deal with these emergency questions as they arise.  In London, they have a large measure of communal feeding, under the direction of the local authority.  That completely cuts away from the old methods and, I have no doubt, trenches, to a great extent, on vested interests.  I am afraid that vested interests, in time of war, have to be sacrificed for the general good, and that there can be no hard and fast rules&mdash;that the State will have to carry on essential services.  In this connection, we must have regard to the redundancy of present methods of distribution.  The country could probably be run with one-third of the existing shops, and it would be utterly impossible for any scheme to replace everything lost at once, when essential services may have to be maintained on a much reduced scale.  That is why I feel that it is very hard for the Government, during the continuation of the war, to formulate any cut-and-dried scheme.  It is impossible for anybody to say at any given moment where we stand.  Senator Baxter referred to the destruction of a creamery.  I think that the existing creameries in that area should be able to absorb a large proportion of the milk which formerly went to the destroyed creamery.  All these matters have to be dealt with as they arise.  The only method is that suggested by the Minister&mdash;that the question of compensation must be left over until after hostilities and that, during hostilities, we must carry on as best we can, largely under the direction of the State.</P>

I listened to him with great care, and it may be my own fault, but I did not gather anything very clearly from him. I was very careful, in moving the motion, to say that my interest was not that property owners should be compensated but that, where property was <Col N="2253" /> destroyed and where its destruction influenced the life of the community, an effort should be made to enable the life of the community to be carried on.  That does not imply, by any means, total compensation; it implies partial replacement, but at any rate replacement for the moment, within the measure of our resources and to such an extent as would allow necessary services to be carried on.  To that extent I agree entirely with what Senator Sir John Keane has said, and I think I stated as a principle&mdash;one of two principles&mdash;with which the Minister agreed, that the State would have to take steps itself and that there would have to be considerable organisation and planning for reconstruction when the war was concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt, however, when the Minister was speaking, that he was like a person who was obliged to defend himself in a debate, whereas no attack of any kind was made upon him.  I said myself, in the beginning, that the matter was an extremely difficult and extremely complex one, and what I feel, from listening to him, is that whatever consideration he has given to the matter, and whatever experience we have had or whatever experience he has gleaned from elsewhere, has not shown him any light at all.  For example, take the statement that you cannot have any scheme now because, if you have, it means first come, first served. That statement puts the matter on an entirely wrong footing.  As I said, I am not proceeding on the basis that a man who has something and loses it ought to get it back from the State.  I am proceeding on the principle, as I mentioned before, and which Senator Sir John Keane mentioned, that when a man loses something and the loss is not only personal to himself but affects the community, then there is a much more important principle involved than first come, first served.  For example, take the case of Campile, which appears to me to be entirely relevant in connection with this matter because it is the one example of war damage that we have occurring in our own area. Supposing that the damage was greater than it was and that all the people employed in that creamery were to be <Col N="2254" /> unemployed as a result of the damage, are we to understand that until the end of the war no effort of any kind was to be made by the Government, by the State, by the citizens generally, to remedy that situation in that particular place?  I have no particular knowledge of the case.  It may very well be, as Senator Sir John Keane has said, that other creameries could do the work, but I suspect, from what I know of the place, because I have been there, that that is not the case in that particular instance.  If that is not the case in that particular instance, are we to understand the Minister's policy to be that the State must take no interest in that matter until the war is over, and then, within the measure of our resources, do something about it?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to intervene for a moment. We have been talking about the situation on the assumption that we should be engaged in hostilities and be attacked, and that this damage would be done in the course of this attack upon us.  That assumption has been underlying the discussion on all this question of war risk insurance.  We have not been dealing with the sort of isolated case such as occurred at Campile at all, and what I said in relation to the situation which would exist here if we were actually engaged in hostilities and in defending ourselves has no relation whatever in regard to Campile, and certainly none to a situation in which we have been making a claim for compensation.</P>

What he said, and what he repeated a few moments ago when he intervened, was that you could not possibly compensate for damage or replace damage done.</P>

      <P>I did not say &ldquo;replace&rdquo;.  I said that the question of compensation would have to be deferred until the end of the war, when it would be dealt with in accordance with our resources.  There are other ways of providing for replacement than on the basis of compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister understands me clearly, but I certainly fail to understand him as clearly.  I made it clear that the existence of certain stocks was necessary to a man making his living, to a number of people making their livings, and to the carrying on of normal life, and that even in a state of war something must be done from the replacement point of view, and I understood the Minister <Col N="2256" /> to say that it would not be considered. Now, he says that it would be considered.  As a matter of fact, war means the destruction of your resources, and the prosecution of the war and the winning of it, if you do win it, very often mean the replacing or rebuilding of your resources so as to fill the best possible national purposes. Therefore, it is clear that the whole question of replacement would not have to wait until the end of the war, and it is interesting to have got that from the Minister.  Senator Robinson told us that immense damage might be done and that you might have no money to replace that damage.  It is, quite possibly, it would appear now, not a question of money at all; it might be a question of material, a question of labour, or a question of organisation; and that might be very much more important than the actual question of money itself.  If the State survives, and with whatever resources the State would survive, it would have to take whatever steps were open to it to take, by special organisation and by special methods, and abandoning old methods, to replace what had been destroyed.</P>
      <P>I do not like to have this matter discussed merely by parsing a particular word and analysing what it means, like the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo;.  I know, of course, that war is abnormal and I know, and everybody knows, that when you apply the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; to a war situation you are using a normal word in an abnormal manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with Senator Brennan, however, that the matter is one in which persons who have stocks should not be called upon <Col N="2257" /> to make a contribution themselves.  I think they should, and the State should undertake to do, within the measure of its resources, whatever may be necessary to do in order to continue normal life and employment.  I can easily see, even in the case of war, places in Dublin and in the country which, if they were destroyed, would certainly need some effort to replace them at once, if the resources were available. If the resources were not available, of course, nothing could be done and we should have no satisfaction out of it. I think the English scheme is to leave out the people with stocks under £1,000, and I think the British have undertaken to reinstate&mdash;if that is a better word than compensate&mdash;houses and furniture for people whose total family income does not exceed £400 a year.  The figure would probably not be as high as that here, but some such figure might be adopted.  The Minister worked out a nice mathematical business about 10/- per cent. on £15,000,000.  He counted the cost of collection and found out that there was a sum of £68,000 to make up for damage of £15,000,000.  He mended his hand on that, too, and he really treated this matter as a debate.  He reminded me of students who debate such motions as &ldquo;You can have no true democracy until you destroy the police,&rdquo; and who make excellent arguments for that kind of proposition. I think this matter is of much greater importance, and should not be dealt with in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is one point clear from what the Minister said.  It is that the matter is complex and difficult, but that with regard to stocks he is consulting certain people to see whether anything can be done.  I merely want to repeat in conclusion that the replacement of stocks in a war situation should be done on a national priority basis, that is to say, it should not be done in the interests of the owners, but in the national interests, and I think it is incumbent on the Minister to make a declaration that that will be done.  I think that, in spite of the fact that he has not made the matter clear, that is what he will eventually do, and if so, we shall <Col N="2258" /> have effected something by having brought this matter before the House and by having had it debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussion we had on this motion on the last occasion, practically every speaker supported the idea of parish councils, but there was a difference of opinion as to whether these councils should be purely voluntary bodies or whether they should have statutory powers.  Personally, I am in favour of parish councils, and I am convinced that if they are to achieve any results or to be of any value to the country, they cannot be voluntary bodies.  I could probably claim that I have as much personal knowledge of voluntary organisations and of bodies with statutory powers as any member of the House, and while I appreciate the work done by voluntary bodies and recognise that some of them have accomplished wonderful things through the years, I still maintain that parish councils would be useless as voluntary bodies.  If we look at most of the voluntary bodies, even those which have achieved things, we find that in many cases they did not cover the whole country, and that in cases where they did cover the whole country, where they had, so to speak, <Col N="2259" /> a nation-wide appeal and branches in every parish, they had not that continuity which is absolutely essential if parish councils are going to be of any use.</P>
      <P>You will find, even in regard to those organisations which have lasted for half a century or more, a branch in one district very virile, very active, and doing very good work, while in the next district a similar branch is in a dormant state.  Then probably a year or two afterwards, quite the reverse is the case, and you will find the branch which was active a couple of years ago dormant and the branch which was inactive most vigorous.  That condition of affairs, to my mind, would be simply fatal to parish councils.  One of the principal reasons for which I support parish councils is that with the introduction of the managerial system &mdash;and I say this as a supporter for years of the managerial system&mdash;there is a grave danger that people will lose contact with local government and cease to take an interest in it.  I consider that that would be very serious for the country as a whole.  That is why I think, if we are to make the managerial system the success we should like to make it, there will be a necessity for something like parish councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will probably be charged with trying to revive the old district councils and, to an extent, I say &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;, although as a member of the Dáil in 1925 I supported the Bill&mdash;which you probably remember, Sir&mdash;which abolished district councils.  I supported their abolition although I was chairman at the time of the largest district council in my county, and got rather into hot water for doing so.  I took the view then that the membership of these councils was too large. I was a member of one council consisting of 17 members and, one day, we would have probably 10 members attending, and 17 members only on rare occasions when something particular had to be dealt with.  At that period we had boards of guardians, and meetings of the district councils were held subsequent to the meetings of the guardians, with the result that things <Col N="2260" /> were done in a hurry.  At that time the boards of health took over all the poor law work, and I was quite satisfied to give a trial to the system under which the board of health took over the work of the district councils.</P>
    <P>I pay a tribute to the boards of health for the excellent work they have done in practically every county, but there is one difficulty which I have found in relation to them during the past 15 years.  Their success was largely due to the fact that they were small bodies, consisting of only 10 members, and 10 men spending a whole day at it would achieve a lot.  The trouble was that they all represented large areas and I felt that we would do much better work if there were in existence some types of advisory bodies like parish councils.  No matter how anxious the members were to deal with all the detailed work such as home help, the building of cottages and the 51 other things which would be of advantage to the people who needed them, and especially the poorer types and with the requests from towns and villages for sanitation and water works, the members were not in immediate touch and there was a real need for some advisory body.</P>
    <P>I recognise fully that one of the big difficulties in regard to parish councils is to set out what kind of work and what kind of statutory powers you are going to give them.  Let me be quite clear.  I do not agree with many supporters of the motion who suggest that they should get anything in the nature of large powers.  I would give them very restricted powers.  Some people say: &ldquo;Let them work as a voluntary body and, as the years go by, we will discuss the possibility of giving them statutory powers&rdquo;.  I say: &ldquo;Give them some statutory powers, no matter how small, from the beginning, and, as the years go by, we can discuss whether or not we will increase them&rdquo;.  There are many small powers at the moment which could be given to them.  In passing, I might say&mdash;I am sorry Senator Johnston is not here&mdash; that from the experience I have, I certainly would not at all agree that they should get anything in the nature of power to strike a rate up to 1/- in <Col N="2261" /> the £.  In fact, if they had any right to strike a rate at all I would not provide for a fourth of that figure and would stipulate that they could strike that rate only for some very necessitous work in the parish, and only after some means had been adopted to discover whether or not the whole parish wanted that work.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, some of the various committees that we have up and down the country at the moment. They seem to have been overlooked in the discussion we had here on the last occasion.  Somebody suggested that they should have the right of giving old age pensions.  I think Senator Counihan objected very strongly to that, and so would I.  We have local committees, dispensary committees, working up and down the country, and they investigate and pass a pension, subject to the sanction of the Minister. If the local officer does not agree with that, he can appeal to the Minister, and likewise those local committees can appeal against the local officer's decision.  Those committees are continuous, for the reason that if the secretary of the county council finds those people are not attending the committees he simply draws the council's attention to the matter, and some one else is co-opted.  That work could be very easily done by the parish councils, and done much better.  Those of us who are members of the county councils, and probably the clergymen of the various denominations, do not always know the people we are talking about, or the people who are before us. As I said, the work could be better done by parish councils, but I would not give them any more power than the dispensary committees have at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is also, I think, provided in the Managerial Bill that some kind of committees could be set up under that Bill to deal with such things as home assistance.  I think the parish councils could deal with that, in the sense that they could recommend to the home assistance officers the people who would be qualified, the people who would be deserving of home help.  They might even be able to give other information which would be very helpful to the <Col N="2262" /> various home assistance officers.  I also think they might be very helpful to the officers of the Labour Exchange on questions regarding payment of unemployment assistance, and on questions of finding work.  There is also the matter of the care of cemeteries, which I certainly think could be handed over to them altogether.  I think that in rural Ireland, anyway, there should be somebody looking after the cemeteries, and there might be some statutory powers that the boards of health already have which could be transferred to the parish councils.</P>
    <P>There are many other things which they could do.  For instance, at the present time if we are selecting a site for a labourer's cottage&mdash;that is a very important matter for the land owner and for the man who is going to live in that cottage&mdash;the procedure is that the engineer comes along, and he has to get two members of the board of health to accompany him.  Incidentally, I might mention that the engineer gets 10/- for looking at the site, while the people who go with him do not even get their expenses, and they are not very keen on travelling around all day. Naturally, the engineer looks at the site purely from the engineering point of view, and it does not matter much whether it is suitable to the local committee, or whether it suits the person who owns the ground and is giving it, or very often whether it suits the man who is going to spend his life in that cottage.  Surely the parish councils would be better able to deal with that matter than anybody else, because they would know the type of man who is getting the house, they would know the man who owns the land, and would have all the inside information that those two outside men would not have. They would not take purely the engineering point of view.  They would simply ask themselves: Is it fair to the man who owns the land to build the house there, and is it equally fair to the man who is going to live in it?</P>
    <P>I could enumerate many other things which are being done at the moment, and which could be passed over to those parish councils without giving them any great powers to which objection might be raised.  As the <Col N="2263" /> years go by we would probably find many other matters which could be handed over to them.  At the moment, there are certainly half-a-dozen things which they could do very effectively. We have county committees of agriculture working at the moment.  They spend a good deal of money and are doing a great deal of good work, but very often the county instructor, not only in agriculture but in horticulture and various other things, lacks local support.  The county committees do their part well, but I think the parish councils could do enormous work in popularising those schemes, and in popularising the lectures which the various instructors are giving up and down the country.  The same thing applies to vocational education.  From my experience of vocational education in rural Ireland, I think it is not anything like the success it should be, and a lot of the money involved has not been well spent.  I very often feel that that is largely due to the fact that there is not sufficient local support and enthusiasm because the local people have no say in it.  While I do not propose giving those councils any extra powers, I am quite convinced that if such councils were working the local people could be induced to take a bigger interest in those schemes, both under the county committees of agriculture and under vocational committees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not reached that stage yet.  As the matter has been mentioned, I might say that I think there have been suggestions that the establishment of parish councils would interfere with the work of Muintir na Tire.  I do not think so at all.  I altogether agree that parish councils would be a great asset and a great help to voluntary organisations.  I think they would do a great deal to spread the splendid idealism of Muintir na Tire.  Another matter which would have to be dealt with is the method by which they would be elected, but the one thing I want to stress is that if <Col N="2264" /> those councils are to be effective they must have some sort of statutory powers, and we must see that they continue; we must ensure that, having worked satisfactorily for five or ten years, they do not fade out, have to be revived, and then move along for another five years; otherwise they would be useless.  I do believe they would help organisations like Muintir na Tire; I believe they would help the ideals for which such organisations stand, and probably spread them much better than they could be spread by voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>I believe they would help the Gaelic Athletic Association, and help athletics generally in the country.  I believe they would be a great help to the I.A O.S. in getting co-operative ideas spread up and down the country, and I believe they could do a lot for the work of the Gaelic League.  If we had the right type of people, and I am sure we could get them, I believe they would make some effort to get the children in the schools and the children who have left the schools during recent years to speak the language, and bring the language into the life of the parish and into the life of the nation generally.  The same thing would apply to our music and dances, and to Irish culture generally.  I believe they could achieve a great deal of work in that way, provided they were put on a proper basis, that they would continue to work in season and out of season, and would be always there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty is the question of how they should be elected.  Personally, I would be inclined to favour the view of the mover of the motion that there should be some kind of family vote.  I do not think they should be elected on a vocational basis.  I do not think there is much use in discussing an election of any kind of body in this country on a vocational basis until we get a report from the Commission on Vocational Organisation which is at present sitting, and until we know exactly what kind of vocational organisation we are going to have.  I would like to say, if I might, as a warning, that I believe that any attempt to elect parish councils on a vocational basis <Col N="2265" /> might have the very opposite effect to what the people who are advocating that believe.  I do not think it would be suitable to elect them on anything in the nature of a vocational basis because we have no such thing as vocationalism in our parishes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my opinion. Vocationalism, as I said before, does not exist in this country, and I am afraid that instead of getting the parish councils organised on vocational lines we might simply get them organised on class lines which, I think, would be detrimental.  If we had vocational organisation in the country, of course, it would be quite a different thing, but at the moment it is a very difficult problem, and I think it would be better, if parish councils are to exist, that they should be elected on some general lines.</P>
      <P>During the various discussions here we have been told a great deal of what they did in England and Portugal.  I do not think that we should go abroad to find what system of parish councils we want or what system of democracy we want.  I do not believe that we should reject anything from any country, especially if it is good, but I think that we should try to model it on our own needs.  While I am a democrat and stand for the democratic idea in matters of suffrage, I still hold that on the question of parish councils, even from a democratic point of view, we could adopt some better system.  I still think we should give a trial to a system such as is in the mind of the proposer of this motion, Senator O'Dwyer, on the lines of a family vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that I do agree with the Minister to this extent, that I do not think the time is opportune now to introduce legislation for the purpose of establishing parish councils but, personally, as one who is very much in touch with all kinds of councils, not only in my own county but here in Dublin, before the managerial system is in operation&mdash;and I am one of the people who are looking forward to seeing the managerial system in operation&mdash;I believe <Col N="2266" /> that we should discuss or consider very carefully whether we should not have something in the nature of parish councils.  I think I can claim some experience and I feel that parish councils would fill a very useful part in our life but, if they are going to achieve anything, they must be some kind of elected body with even small statutory powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in putting down this motion was to try to get, at least in my own mind, some clarity out of the confusion that exists in regard to these parish councils.  I think if one who did not know the country should suddenly come into the country, and read the effusions on the subject, he would be inclined to think we had discovered some magic method of regenerating society and bringing a sort of Utopia into the land.  I think those who live in the country and who work on local bodies have doubts upon that subject.  I have had a good deal of experience on local bodies and I have also had my salad days of enthusiasm when I hoped to get things done well and quickly.  I remember, when I was quite a youth in my own village, I suggested we should have modern sewers.  Immediately there was an indignation meeting, headed by the parish priest and the Protestant clergyman, protesting against the very idea that we should have modern sewers because of the cost they would entail.  I think I would be in the ranks of the protestors now.  We have got beyond that now and, I think, in the last few years we have got the modern sewers. I cannot say that we suffered during some 40 years by the old system of drainage.  I think that perhaps the more primitive thought had a good deal to be said in its favour, and I think all of us who are ratepayers very much doubt that all this modern development and so-called efficiency and centralisation of local services have produced benefits corresponding to the very heavy burdens we have had to bear.  I do not see how we can put back the clock.  The tendency is towards centralisation and with the complications of modern life, and with the ease of communications I am rather afraid that is inevitable.  I should like <Col N="2267" /> to see a much more primitive form of life.  Perhaps the war and the impoverishment we are all threatened with will lead to a more simple and primitive life, and to that extent I would welcome the principle of the parish council and the setting up of a medium in which the parish council can function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think the immediate question before us is not so much the statutory powers we should give them but as to how these emergency committees are going to work.  The Minister has told us that it is contemplated, in the event of the country being split up owing to war and communication becoming impossible, that a large portion of the local services and interests should be in the hands of these emergency parish committees, under the direction, presumably, of regional commissioners or county commissioners. That is, I think, on the right lines but what puzzled me was how these emergency committees were going to work in practice.  I gather that they are going to be voluntary and, as such, I think there is much to be said in their favour, but how are they going to assert themselves and get the information they want on a purely voluntary basis?  I still doubt that we have got that 100 per cent. element of goodwill and desire to assist authority that would enable a voluntary body to function adequately.  I can see these emergency committees, without any statutory power, trying to compel people to lay in stocks, to compel people to give up what they have got for the benefit of others, and being met by a refusal. What is the next step?  Are they going to call upon the regional commissioner or try to assert authority they have not got?  If so, what would be their legal position and what view would the courts take of it?  It is to have this point cleared that I put down the motion and I do not think I got full enlightenment from the Minister.  If he said: &ldquo;We rely on goodwill.  We have not given these people compulsory powers and do not expect them to exercise any compulsory powers&rdquo;, well and good.  I see difficulties in the case of a number of people not being satisfied <Col N="2268" /> with the methods they employed, combining to oppose them.</P>
    <P>I am also a little puzzled as to the method of bringing these bodies into being.  I wonder if it is quite satisfactory. I met a certain individual not long ago who said: &ldquo;I am told I am on the parish council.  It is the first I heard of it.  Nobody ever asked me.&rdquo;  I wonder to what extent you will get the necessary element of goodwill in bodies that have come into being in such a very haphazard way. I do not suggest that we should have all the complicated machinery of local government and election and all that, but I do think there should be some better organisation than is at present the case, when a sort of meeting is called and those who like to come may come.  Many people do not know about it and out of such a meeting emerges a body of so-called representative people.  I am not quite convinced that that is a method by which in times of emergency you are going to get goodwill to function freely.  I am prepared to say that 90 per cent. of the whole business is goodwill, and if you have not goodwill you will not get very far even, probably, with a statutory body.</P>
    <P>Apart from any emergency in the future, on the general question as to whether these councils should have statutory power or voluntary status, I think there can be little doubt that these voluntary bodies are the only things that will do good in the long run.  Once you have statutory institutions, you have the dead hand of bureaucracy.  I think it is that dead hand of bureaucracy that is responsible for the great diminution of interest in local government. Everything now seems to be taken out of the hands of the local people.  In the old days, I do not know if there was such a great amount of bribery and corruption, but I do know that there was a great deal of local interest taken in various appointments, and I do not know you got a worse lot of men.  It still has to be proved.</P>

      <P>I can call to mind the names of certain people appointed <Col N="2269" /> under the old system, people who were thoroughly good in their positions.  I can call to mind certain county surveyors and dispensary doctors who were appointed under the old system, and I can say there are no better to-day.  I do not know in the long run whether this system of Appointments Commissioners, nice as it looks on paper and orderly as it may be, necessarily produces any better results.  I do hope, if we are going to pursue this parish council idea, that it will be on a voluntary basis, something on the lines of the Muintir na Tire organisation. That is the only real way in which you will get any spiritual force behind the movement.</P>
      <P>Once you get statutory powers it becomes dead and automatic and people will undoubtedly lose interest, because you will never get the central authority to leave these bodies to function freely.  The minute there is any appointment or any departure from what the central authority considers the conventional method, they will at once come in and say: &ldquo;We cannot have it that way.&rdquo;  There may be mistakes sometimes in the process of educating the people in local administration, but the central authority will not be satisfied with that.  That is one reason why I have little hope of what will come from statutory bodies. I would welcome the voluntary organisation, slow as it may be, as the only way to bring any real interest and spiritual force into the smaller groups in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome parish councils in one way, but I do not agree with the manner in which they are elected.  Senator Sir John Keane is quite right when he says that there were numbers of people appointed on parish councils and they did not know they were appointed.  That would show that the system of election is bad.  To my mind the only hope for the parish councils, if they are to function successfully, is to have them on a voluntary basis.  I would not be in favour of giving them statutory powers.  They can do excellent work by coming together voluntarily and taking an interest in their respective <Col N="2270" /> parishes.  Each parish council is supposed to concentrate its thoughts on its own parish, carrying out improvements and so on.  They can inquire into several matters that might be of interest to the parish and, perhaps, to the country as a whole.  For instance, they could investigate such subjects as the making of by-roads, local drainage schemes, derelict bogs, which are of considerable importance at the moment, and other matters such as the provision of new halls.  Parish councils might also be very useful in an advisory capacity.</P>
      <P>It occurs to me also that parish councils might be of great help to the Government and the various political Parties&mdash;the three Parties in this House and in the other House, for example.  It would be of great use to them to have parish councils in this way.  The followers of a particular Party might be anxious to have some work done in a locality.  They make an application to have the work carried out, believing it to be useful work, but unfortunately that is turned down.  If you had parish councils, all the Parties would be represented on those councils and they would investigate the application and see if the work would be useful&mdash;that it was not for the benefit of one particular Party, but for the good of all.  This sort of thing would bring people together, and I am sure, after a year or so, they would find out the most intelligent people and they could form a committee for the parish which would have control over the carrying out of various works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same sort of thing applied in the co-operative movement some 30 or 40 years ago.  Bodies of farmers gathered together and they elected a certain number to carry out work in connection with a local creamery.  At the end of each year this committee retired, and there was a new body elected.  If the farmers thought that the old committee was doing the work reasonably well, they did not make any change. The same could apply to the parish councils, and in that way they would have the confidence of the people.  If the people thought that members of the councils were not doing their work <Col N="2271" /> well, they could elect a new body.  I would like to see these councils functioning in the country, but I would not like them to have statutory powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I see too clearly what this motion may lead to.  At the same time I am convinced that there is room for these parish councils throughout the country.  I rather imagine when, in parts of Ireland, we suggest ideas that are very fine and beautiful, the different political Parties and the Press take hold of these things.  They send their representatives out and the majority of the people, with their eyes shut and their mouths open, gather round the political platforms at election times, vote for these things and forthwith they become law.  The power of the Press and of the political Parties seems to grow with the years.  I should like these parish councils directly and immediately to connect the homes of the people, and particularly the heads of families, with the Government.  The Government, through these organisations, could feel the pulse of the country and would know how fast or how slow, as the case might be, they should proceed.</P>
      <P>These parish councils would curb any tendency to revolt and revolution and would make for stability.  Obviously if proposed reforms were more thoroughly digested before they reached the Legislature, it would lead to better administration and would obviate those unsatisfactory results which arise when new measures are enacted without that thorough consideration that they should receive.  Sometimes local bodies receive orders from Departments which cannot be justified.  In my own county the wages of county labourers were raised by 2/- last September, to meet the increased cost of living, but the State now objects to the payment of this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen too many revolutions to be enamoured of them.  I do not know that they lead to the victories that are sometimes claimed for them.  Nevertheless, I have reason to know that very many enthusiastic members of the Local Security Force disappeared out of that force when this order became <Col N="2272" /> operative.  When their wages were reduced by 2/- these men said: &ldquo;Well, we will not bother.  Our 2/- increase has been stopped but Senator McGee gets his salary and Deputies and Ministers have increased their salaries&rdquo;.  I think such imprudent acts&mdash;I do not wish to exaggerate them but they are imprudent&mdash;would be curbed and perhaps squelched absolutely if you had a prudent and well-chosen parish council.  It is quite easy to choose such a council by a procedure such as was adopted in my own town, where the farmers went into one room, the labourers into another and the businessmen into a third to choose their representatives.  The six or seven rooms that formed the local school were all occupied and, as a result, a splendid parish council was elected. These parish councils furnish the means of connecting the homes of the people with the Government.  They bring home to the hearth of each family an idea of the part they should play in the life of the nation.  They are a connecting link between the humblest cabin and the most stately mansion in the land.  The parish priest or rector is generally chairman, though I do not think it is absolutely essential that a clergyman should always be chairman.</P>
    <P>I think it desirable that these bodies should have statutory power.  I was rather struck by the statement of the Minister here that it would not be judicious to give them power to strike a rate as it would not lead to their popularity.  I am delighted that we have a Minister to advance that theory because, after all, our Ministers have struck rates in their day, retained their popularity and are flourishing just as well as ever.  I think that no public money should be extracted from any townland unless with the support and approval of some such institution as the parish council.  I think it absurd that a demand should issue from say, the City of Dublin, that a certain rate should be struck on a certain townland, regardless of the life that may be lived in that townland. It is, in my opinion, impossible to judge the circumstances in the distance. &ldquo;Out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;. How can any official or any citizen up in Dublin, no matter how well-meaning, <Col N="2273" /> form a judgment of the life that is lived in the different homes throughout the country?</P>
    <P>It is impossible to do that.  It is equally impossible to decide what rate should be struck on an individual working his plot of land, large or small, without having that local knowledge which is derived from immediate contact with people of any particular district.  Families with six, seven or eight children are living on farms of 20 or 30 acres of land but they are debarred from all the social benefits of the Medical Charities Act.  The failure of one small crop may place that entire family in jeopardy.  I think it would be well to suggest to the Legislature that there the parish council should come in and that it should not permit any authority to take out of a townland something which it cannot afford. Charity begins at home, and it is the duty of every family to protect itself first.  It has no opportunity of doing so now, with the result that you have so many instances of derelict farms, flight from the land, and a want of sympathy with the people who reside on the land.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of Muintir na Tíre in Cavan I observed that there was some severe criticism of the government of our State for the last 20 years, and I was glad to note that one gentlemen advocated the necessity for credit for our farmers.  I am rather sorry that Senator Quirke has left the Chamber because my mind goes back to one evening when I suggested here that something further should be done in that matter.  I mentioned a case of which I was aware, in which an application had been turned down for some reason and the Senator, who is a member of the board, stated that the Agricultural Credit Corporation never gave the reasons as to why an application for a loan was turned down.  To my mind, a parish council should be informed of the reasons why a frozen loan exists in its area.  Some means should be found by the State that would enable the people of that locality to have that frozen loan melted and thawed.  I might suggest to the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they, like every other institution in the State, are part of Ireland, and no <Col N="2274" /> greater than the poorest part of it will permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  I suggest that these parish councils should be given sufficient authority, and should have sufficient means at their disposal to discover what are the real needs of the people, and that they should be provided with means to supply these needs if they cannot be supplied otherwise. I do not think I could make the position clearer.  I ask the sympathy of the House, and also its pardon if I have transgressed in any respect.  It is not fashionable and not right to claim that we are poor.  I do not want to urge the &ldquo;poor mouth&rdquo; eternally, but if parish councils were given statutory powers over every aspect of Irish life, and particularly over the expenditure of money extracted from the different townlands, something could be done to instil some vigour and some life into whole districts, and parents could see what they might do for their children in the future.  I do not want to criticise the very excellent institutions that have been established, beyond saying that they should have been given more power.  Centralisation has been a direct cause of the loss of interest by the people in public affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2275" /> The Press writes up certain schemes and the Party leaders do the same regardless whether the people require these schemes or not.  I am not so interested in the appointments that have been made by these bodies.  I am sure a scheme could be hammered out so that appointments would be all right.  In my part of the country excellent appointments were made by the old bodies.  We have had surveyors, secretaries of councils, doctors and others who stood the test of time.  We have had the same experience with the new bodies.</P>
    <P>What I would like to lay emphasis on is the importance of connecting these questions with the homes of the people, the abolition of class interest in every area, as well as the welding together of the entire community.  That must come if parish councils are chosen and elected in a just and commonsense manner, so that every class will be given its rights.  I want a sort of blending together of the community for the good of all.  I am not so foolish as not to know that we are up against vested interests.  Appointments have been made and a lot of power has been given to certain parties and organisations and they are not going to let that power go without an effort.  We are not going to have the whole system of giving pensions and jobs done away with.  These things would not have passed if the people had been consulted. I am not uneasy about that, but I consider it would be for the good of the country if the whole basic power of the State had its source in the homes and then conveyed through parish councils.  The power of the Press has a wonderful effect on the people.  But very often what one reads in the morning newspaper has a different meaning in the evening.  I am not so anxious about appointments because I believe that question could be fixed by some method.  We could have a more stable nation if the whole people, and especially the heads of families, had a greater voice in the affairs of the country than they have now.</P>

      <P>Having listened to part of the debate a few weeks ago, <Col N="2276" /> and read it with a good deal of interest I cannot but think that we are hampered in coming to a decision by taking together two motions which are really not very closely connected.  It seems to me that by taking them together the logical order was reversed. The main one was discussed in very interesting and able speeches while the other motion was only formally introduced. It was not until I heard Senator Sir John Keane to-day that I realised what the query in his motion meant.  He announced to-day that he was thinking of the emergency councils which have been established in the past few weeks, and he made very proper inquiry as to what their powers, functions, and method of election would be.  When I read his motion before, I thought he intended to inquire what the Government had in mind with regard to local councils, a question which is at present awaiting consideration by the Oireachtas.  Taking the motions as they stand, it seems to me that it would be logical first to ask for information, and then, having got it, consider it.  Having the information and taken the trouble to consider it, the House might then proceed to make a positive demand, such as it made in the other motion.  Senator Sir John Keane simply asked for information on some points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be more logical to get information first, and then consider what positive proposals we would make to the Government. There are several points in the motion of Senator O'Dwyer, some of them are associated, while others might stand by themselves.  The demand is to have these councils on a permanent basis, so that they might form an integral part of the local government system.  There is also a demand for a special and rather peculiar form of election.  I think the House was entitled to a little more specific information than it got in the debate a few weeks ago.  The debate has done good in some respect.  It has clarified the minds of the people against a confusion which was very general, a confusion about the different forms of parish bodies that have been talked and written of in recent months. <Col N="2277" /> Parish guilds, as proposed by Muintir na Tíre, we have learned a good deal about in recent weeks from the very interesting meetings that have been held. There are then the local councils which are adumbrated in a Bill before the Oireachtas, and the emergency councils which the Government has already established.</P>
    <P>The distinction between them has now been made clear.  Certainly, the distinction between the first two which I have mentioned should be clearer now than it was before.  We have had a very definite statement from Fr. Hayes, that he wishes to have nothing to do with the sort of council which Senator O'Dwyer and his colleagues demand. The one thing he wants to be saved from is any statutory basis.  We have had from Senator O'Dwyer and his colleagues a declaration that voluntary bodies are, if not no good, at least next to no good.  I will come back to that in a few minutes.  The distinction between these two, therefore, should be clear in the minds of those who have listened to the recent debate or who have read Fr. Hayes' statement in the press.</P>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister on the last evening as to the functions and powers of the emergency councils has cleared up the matter as to their possible status.  We have to keep our minds fixed on those distinctions. I am not criticising the bodies which the Minister has thought fit to establish, or the purpose for which they have been established; but few things could be worse for such bodies than that they should have any claim to continue as statutory bodies when the emergency has passed.  It is quite clear that the machinery which has been designed&mdash;and, perhaps, very ably designed&mdash;to deal with certain matters during the emergency has not necessarily, and is unlikely to have, any particular suitability for carrying on work in more normal times.  Therefore, while I am not criticising them in any way, I hope that when these emergency councils have done their work they will pass into a grateful oblivion.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the case that was put so persuasively before us a few weeks ago by Senator O'Dwyer, <Col N="2278" /> I think we are entitled to ask some questions which have not yet been answered and draw attention to some doubts which have been raised in our minds by some of the speeches made in support of his resolution. He made a very persuasive speech and evidently took great care in its preparation; and I am entitled to accept it as the best case that could have been put before the Seanad at present in favour of his resolution and the sort of councils it seeks to establish.  He has stated to some extent the objects he has in mind for such councils, but he has stated very vaguely the powers which he thinks the councils should have.  We must make a distinction between objects and powers, as an object may be very desirable, but the body designated may not be the best to entrust wise powers to work towards it.  With a great deal that Senator O'Dwyer said I am in full sympathy, and I draw particular attention to his statement of the general purpose he has in mind in proposing these councils.  In these matters it is important to quote the actual words he used.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main object of the formation of these parish councils would be to engender a spirit of independence and a sense of cohesion and of co-operation amongst the people of the rural communities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all agree with that, and whether we think his councils are the best means of promoting that or not, I think we are in full sympathy with it; and with some of what the last speaker has said on the same lines.  Senator O'Dwyer goes further, a little lower down in his speech, and points out that the mere establishment of such an organisation is more important than the functions that the organisation would carry out.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The organisation of the rural community on the lines I have indicated would itself be more important than any function that the organisation could carry out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not easy to understand that the establishment of an organisation could be more important than the function it is designed to carry out.  If an organisation is designed to carry out <Col N="2279" /> certain functions and the functions are not important, it would be a waste of time.  However, that may be rather hasty criticism.  I believe that Senator O'Dwyer has in mind there that the establishment of some organisation engaged in useful work would show in itself a spirit of co-operation. Whether such organisations could not be established by other means he does not discuss.  He comes to the question of powers, and the suggestions he makes are comprehensive but vague. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the powers, naturally the parish council would carry out the ordinary local government functions which are performed by all local bodies, such as relieving the poor and dealing with other matters of that kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is given in column 2134 of the Official Debates.  That statement may be as comprehensive as you like, but it certainly is vague.  In his reply here the Minister dealt with that in a very definite way.  He pointed out that certain functions at present carried out by county councils for the whole county covered such matters as roads, public health, and some other main services, and he asked&mdash;and the question is worth repeating&mdash;whether it was suggested by the supporters of this resolution that these powers should be removed from the county councils to these small local bodies.  The Minister said that at present £7,000,000 is being spent by county councils on the four essential services&mdash;roads, county services, health and public assistance. These cover the whole county.  Is it suggested that they should come back to the parish councils?  If not, what are the powers to which Senator O'Dwyer refers?  The last speaker did not suggest that the control of such services should be referred back to the parish councils and that the county council should get rid of them but, so far as I could understand him, he did think that any taxation or expenditure on such purposes should receive the veto, not of each parish but of each townland.  One of the supporters of this motion feared he might be regarded as reactionary and even mediæval, but it <Col N="2280" /> seems to me that the Senator was going back, as far as national economy is concerned, to a state of primeval chaos.  Except in some small points, those who followed Senator O'Dwyer were no more precise.</P>
    <P>The next point I ask about is this: Why is there such determined and unanimous condemnation amongst several speakers of voluntary bodies&mdash; not of the spirit behind them, but of the possibility of their success and of their utility?  Senator O'Dwyer was very definite on that point.  In column 2130 he remarks:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to show that it would be impossible to found a system of parish councils that would be of any permanent value on a voluntary basis.  It would be contrary to universal experience to expect such a system to work efficiently.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few minutes further on, when he threw his mind back to his own experience, he spoke differently.  In column 2134 he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may not be realised how powerful an instrument such an organisation could be, but if one looks at many parts of Ireland, particularly in the South, where co-operative societies have been functioning, it can be seen what a material revolution these societies have made in their districts and what great industries, some of them running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, are being and have been built up by the very people who would be called upon to form these parish councils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently, they have succeeded already, though a few minutes before the Senator had declared it impossible that they should do such permanent work.  But although universal experience would seem to indicate, in one part of the Senator's speech, that voluntary bodies were capable of doing very good work, in another part of his speech he seemed to hold the contrary view.  At any rate, the Senator did draw the attention of the Seanad to the amount of valuable work that could be done by voluntary societies.  There was a good deal of insistence on the question of permanency. The last speaker insisted that these bodies must be permanent and <Col N="2281" /> said that voluntary bodies could not be.  Senator Johnston was very insistent that unless they were permanent they were likely to be very useless.  Speaking at column 2149 on the 28th August, 1940, the Senator said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do think that while enthusiastic propaganda and voluntary associations are admirable things in their way, organisations of that kind are liable to become somewhat flabby and invertebrate if the intial enthusiasm should disappear, or if the leadership which they have enjoyed in the first instance should, in the course of nature, not be replaced by equally effective leadership.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It occurs to me to ask him, could not the same thing happen the statutory bodies which he is anxious to have? Even if they have a legal ground to stand on, could not the same thing happen there?  If these bodies have lost their vitality, what is the use in trying to keep them alive?  If that has happened to the voluntary bodies might it not also happen to the statutory bodies?  The unfortunate corpse remains. Instead of burying it, what is the use of trying to put life into a dead body?  That is beyond anybody's skill. If interest in these bodies is gone, and if they are not likely to serve any useful purpose again, then the sooner they are out of the way the better.</P>
    <P>I am rather puzzled by the peculiar franchise which is being demanded for these parish councils.  We have had a lot of&mdash;I hope I may refer to it without offence&mdash;loose talk about the link of the family.  It has been suggested to take the head of the family, where there is a family, and to make him an elector of the parish council. It seems to me that it is almost impossible to decide who is the head of the family.  Certainly, I know some families in which a discussion on that point might lead to very unfortunate family friction.  Even the neighbours may not be able to decide in some cases whether the grey mare is not a better horse.  This talk of family franchise seems to me to be very vague.  There is no indication given as to what is meant by it.  I notice that some supporters of the resolution were not as <Col N="2282" /> fond of it as others.  Senator Counihan, in fact, frankly ran away from it, and suggested that he did not care what sort of franchise there was provided it was a restricted franchise. He said that he was convinced &ldquo;that the parish council should have statutory powers, that it should be elected on a vocational basis by the heads of families, by householders, or by ratepayers&rdquo;. Of course, that is running away from the resolution.  He went on to say that it should, at all events, be a restricted franchise.  It, therefore, appears from what Senator Counihan said that he has not any strong convictions in favour of a family franchise.  If he has, he did not give the Seanad the benefit of any clear ideas on that, or as to what it means. But, so long as it is not a general franchise, he, at any rate, will be satisfied with it.  I do not want to tie the Senator to the actual words he used. He made it clear, however, that he wanted a restricted franchise.</P>
    <P>The first comment I would make on this question of representation for the heads of families is this: that apart from the almost certain family friction that it would give rise to it has this distinctly unhealthy aspect about it. The activities of Muintir na Tíre, and of many other good, thoughtful people in the country, have been in the direction of trying to make life interesting for the young men: to interest them in what is going on in their parish, in their neighbourhood and in their county.  Here it is suggested, so far as this new organisation is concerned, that the young men, unless they happen to be the heads of families in rural Ireland&mdash;and, mind you, a young man is not very young when he becomes the head of a household in rural Ireland&mdash; should be debarred from taking part in these elections.</P>
    <P>They may, no doubt, give advice to their fathers or mothers who are the heads of families, but advice is not always taken in the best spirit by elderly parents from their youthful and less experienced sons.  I think the suggestion is distinctly retrograde inasmuch as we should all like to see the young men of the country take a responsible and intelligent interest in <Col N="2283" /> the country's affairs.  It surely would be a retrograde step to debar them from doing that in their own neighbourhood and to persist in this demand for a family franchise.</P>
    <P>In the speeches delivered by some Senators on this resolution I detected what seemed to me to be a certain hostility to democratic methods.  We are all disappointed with democracy.  It has not brought the millennium or even what our more modest hopes might have expected.  But has anything better been introduced into government in the history of mankind?  When I say &ldquo;better&rdquo; I am thinking particularly of the effect on individuals, and I am not regarding man in the mass or man in the group or man in the State.  I do not join in State worship.  But I think the most that one can hope for in any system of government is that it will give an opportunity to the individual for the expression of his free will and of responsibility in the society of which he is a part.  I suggest that our democratic methods, faulty and all as they are, and open to criticism as they are, and they are certainly open to criticism, to judge by the results that have been got from them, have proved more effective than any other methods that have been tried.  I think there is a real danger that in our disappointment with the results, a disappointment very often due to our own faults and to our exaggerated hopes, we may be led to say that we had better get rid of the whole thing and try something else. Words, almost synonymous with these, were in fact used in the debate.  We had a certain disrespect shown for manhood suffrage and for woman suffrage.  I do not mind people having views on these matters.  All that I do say is that until we see clearly what is going to be substituted for them, we should be slow to make any demand on the Government to introduce a different system of suffrage.</P>
    <P>One of the signatories to the motion, Senator Tierney, has a particularly interesting theory as to what should constitute the institutions of the State &mdash;an intriguing theory.  He said that the present institutions do not represent the natural organic grouping <Col N="2284" /> which the people might adopt for themselves if they were allowed, and he added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I say that, of course, I know I am in danger of being accused of wanting to go back to the Middle Ages, and of being reactionary.  A great many people have the idea that the best thing we can do is to take what we have got and to make the most of it.  I do not at all share that view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As an alternative, he suggests that we should get as close as possible to the system that would have grown up naturally if we had not now to be reconstructing, as a result of historic circumstances.  I do not know to what era Senator Tierney wants to go back in order to lay the foundations of his building.  Is it 300, 400 or 800 years? We should want to know fairly accurately what the conditions of civilisation in this country were before these institutions were interfered with to any considerable extent by what I may call hostile external influences, as I do not think that anybody wishes to exclude the natural influences due to civilisations other than the native civilisation.  To go back to the period before any hostile influence was brought to bear on our institutions of government, we would want to know what the conditions then were.  Having done that, I cannot imagine how any mind could be wise enough or comprehensive enough to tell us how the institutions would have developed during the past three, four, seven, eight or ten centuries.  Perhaps I may give a parallel example.  Look at the fine house in which we are sitting or at any similar house.  We may say that these are due to some external influence and that we ourselves would have developed differently.  Are we to say: &ldquo;Let us pull down this house and see what sort of house we would have if native influence had been allowed to develop?&rdquo;  I do not say that that is an exact parallel, but I do express the opinion that what has been suggested to us is not more practical than the idiotic suggestion I have just made. We are to discover the living foundations from which the State has developed, whether under external <Col N="2285" /> influence or not, go back to that as the starting point and try to see how these living institutions would have developed. If I may say so, that seems to me too great a reaction, due to disappointment with democracy.</P>
    <P>I have complained that those who brought forward this motion were not precise enough regarding the functions and powers of the sort of council they recommended.  We had some hints of further activities which I confess did not attract me.  Rather they made me feel a bit uneasy.  It was suggested that the administration of old age pensions should be handed over to these bodies.  I should like to be living in a country parish in a few years if the parish councils are to have charge of old age pensions, because I am quite sure that I should have no difficulty in persuading my neighbours to vote me a pension, knowing that the moneys were not going to be levied on the parish.  We had another suggestion which made me feel even more uneasy &mdash;that the parish council should control the amusements of the neighbourhood. I was rather startled at this suggestion, because a great deal of Senator Tierney's speech had been devoted to demanding greater freedom for the people of the countryside.  Anything more irritating to the people of the countryside than having any parish body controlling their amusements, I cannot imagine.  I should be very uneasy about the measures those councils would take.  Another suggestion interested me even more&mdash;and not unnaturally. There was a certain feeling in the minds of Senator Johnston and Senator Tierney that these bodies might curb the undue activity of the medical profession in public health matters.  Senator Johnston told us of the terrible disaster brought to certain parishes in his neighbourhood by the desire, presumably of the health authority, to prevent the sale of, possibly or probably, contaminated shellfish, It turned out, the Minister told us, that this did not happen at all. It was due to the carefulness of some English medical officer of health that the export of possibly contaminated shellfish from Louth was stopped.  I am sorry to hear that, because I should <Col N="2286" /> like to give the local authority credit for having stopped that pernicious trade.  Senator Tierney includes public health in a regular litany of evils that need cure.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do suggest, although it may sound extravagant, that you can have too much public health, too many tourist resorts, too much cleaning up of beaches, and too much interfering with the people because they have buckets lying about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney and Senator Johnston were in agreement in a great part of the argument, but they have fallen out about the buckets.  Senator Johnston was very annoyed because, at a certain seaside resort which he visited, he found the same bucket on the beach that he had seen there four or five years before.  He thought that the parish council, if it had been in existence, would have removed that bucket.</P>
    <P>This is what the Senator said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am aware of one of these resorts in which a tin bucket was rotting and decaying on the sand, with many broken bottles, years ago.  I recently visited the same seaside resort and the same tin bucket was to be seen in a more advanced state of decay than before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Senator Tierney and Senator Johnston were colleagues on a parish council, we may be sure that the parish would be divided for years over the fate of that tin bucket.</P>
    <P>I have made a quite honest and serious attempt to understand the case put up for the motion.  I have every sympathy with voluntary activity and with the voluntary associations which Senator O'Dwyer told us about in his opening speech.  I should like to see them active in every rural area and I should like to see all the people of the locality working together for the common good, but I think you will destroy that chance when you give them legal status.</P>
    <P>I think they will be useful and that they would continue to work as long as they would be useful, but if they are given a legal status they may be encouraged to meddlesomeness, and <Col N="2287" /> certainly would continue in action whether they were fulfilling useful functions or not. I do not think that a case in favour of parish councils, whether with such powers as have been suggested or not, has been made, and I do not think the Seanad should be pressing such a demand on the Government as is proposed in the motion, and I cannot imagine anything more undesirable than that the Government, at the present moment, should commit itself to a revolution of this sort, or to any revolution.  During a time of national and international emergency we must carry on with such machinery as we have, except where it is necessary that certain machinery must be designed to meet the emergency. To decide, however, on what the proposers of the motion have rightly described as a revolution, in the middle of the present emergency, when our minds are fully occupied with other matters, would be, I think, a rash act and I do not think the Seanad should invite the Government to take such action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at any great length.  Senator Dr. Rowlette has summed up, in the last sentences, what I might take, perhaps, 20 minutes to elaborate here.  I do sincerely hope that the Government will not be influenced by the discussion that has taken place here based upon the introduction of the motion on the utility of parish councils.  I do hope that they will move cautiously and slowly.  We ought to learn by mistakes, and I am sure that the Government will have learned primarily by the mistakes made by the previous Government in their treatment of and completely breaking up the parish councils in a larger administration, called district councils, shortly after the advent of our national Parliament.  The district council were a representative body, carefully selected by the people. They were an intellectual body of administrators and they served the people well, and particularly the poor.  The area which they administered was <Col N="2288" /> limited, and they were of great advantage, particularly to the sick poor, because of the proximity of the local hospitals to their homes where they could be accommodated.  The Government, however, came along and, I would say, without giving due and proper consideration to the matter, and practically with the touch of a magic wand, terminated the good, efficient, democratic system of local administration which obtained in this country at the time.  Not alone had you the local rural district councils operating in a manner something analogous to that in which we are told the parish councils will operate, if and when they get statutory powers, but the chairman of each of these rural district councils had a seat on and representation in the county councils; so that the matters that were locally discussed in a circumscribed district were analogous to the duties of the proposed parish councils. They instructed their chairman, who had a seat on and representation in the centre of gravity, the county council, and he conveyed to the centre of gravity, the county council, their views and wishes in connection with schemes for development and progress, schemes for remedial legislation for the poor, and so on.  In that way, they were very helpful, and in that way I say, as one who sat on one of these councils for nine years, you had a miniature parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why were these councils abolished? Why was that done?  We were told then that it was done in the interests of efficiency and economy.  Did it accomplish either?  I stand here, after an experience of 25 years in both, and say that it accomplished neither, but it inflicted continuing and daily hardships even to the present moment on that section of the people, the extreme poor, who can least afford to bear them.  No one can deny that.  That was the result of hasty and ill-considered legislation without due and proper regard to the circumstances and to the purposes these bodies served. Ought not that be a lesson for this body to-day&mdash;to seriously consider any motion that may influence the present Government to embark upon such a condition of things, when we have <Col N="2289" /> before us the disastrous results that have accrued from a similar attempt about 18 years ago?</P>
    <P>There is terrible confusion at the moment.  I was really amazed and I cannot understand why, at this most inopportune time, when the whole world is in the vortex, you might say, of a ghastly European embroilment, we should embark upon such a scheme and introduce a motion here to influence the Government to retrace their steps and change the whole system that is operating, at the present time at least, beneficially for the people generally. We had a Bill here a few months ago by which the whole system, fundamentally, of local government in this country will be changed.  It is law now, but has not yet been put into operation.  We were told by the Minister that it will be put into operation in September, 1941.  Under that Act membership of the county council is reduced and the board of health is completely done away with, and I welcome that because it throws the greater, or at least the great, responsibility of public administration under local government on the reduced county council, which would be less than the board.  Now, how will the parish councils conform to that new Act, if and when it comes into operation?</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting of an emergency committee the other night, as I happen to be one of the selected members, and I asked the commissioner there what were the powers and duties of the committee? He said that he was acting under the Minister for Supplies and that it was the duty of that emergency committee to get vouchers and to supply the poor with these vouchers for food.  I asked him who were to guarantee the vouchers?  I said: &ldquo;Our names will be to the vouchers, and when they are presented at a business place, the figure may be £50 or £100 or more, and the merchant may tell us that he wants money to carry on; who, then, is to honour the bill?&rdquo;  He told me that the central Government here would honour it.</P>
    <P>We had another meeting a few nights afterwards for the formation of a parish council, and the gentleman who organised that meeting said that he <Col N="2290" /> was organising and operating by the authority of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and the duties he defined were something analogous to those indicated by the speaker a few nights before on the question of emergency.  I said: &ldquo;Good heavens, where are we?  If the two bodies perform the same functions and have the same duties, where is the need for two of them?&rdquo;  I asked this gentleman the same question about the vouchers: &ldquo;Who is going to honour these vouchers for the purchase of food, should the central Government cease to function or be unable to function because of war conditions that may eventuate?&rdquo;  His answer to me was a complete contradiction of the answer given by the other man.  He said that the parish councils must collect the nucleus of a fund for the purchase of these commodities, and that the central Government would not be responsible. I asked whether the board of health would not be the proper authority, knowing all the circumstances of the county, having statutory powers and, in my county at present, budgeting for £20,000 for the poor? These are some of the confusions which exist at present, and is this the proper time to invite the Government to introduce legislation designed to discard the present system of administration and to create parish councils?</P>
    <P>I should be very sorry to think that voluntary bodies have not got the power, the inspiration, the industry and the initiative in themselves to do good, useful and essential work in a parish, but I have this misgiving, that the day you give statutory powers to a local, circumscribed committee in a parish, that is the day you ruin the whole spirit of the parish.  Once you give statutory powers, once you give the power to make a rate and collect money, once you give the power to a small committee to elect an executive officer with salary and pension rights, that is the day you drop an administrative incendiary bomb which will destroy the whole spirit of voluntary effort and make the whole thing a matter of &ldquo;Paddy is going for a job to-night, and you are on the committee, so you had better go up there; but isn't Tom <Col N="2291" /> Brown going, too?  and I do not know what the devil to do between the two of you.&rdquo;  Is that not what is going to happen, and is that not our experience in the past?  Will that not tend, if anything tends, to destroy the splendid unity shown by all Parties in the country to-day?</P>
    <P>There are some points in favour of parish councils.  There is the question of decentralisation.  I think the whole spirit of both the previous and the present Government was centralised bureaucracy, and through the whole country the people were suffering from this constant irritation on the part of the central authority, which showed no confidence in the people and certainly gave them no responsibility.  That is an aspect which I appreciate and realise, but I hope that in this matter there has not been any inspiration to throw responsibility back on the people and to say: &ldquo;In the establishment of parish councils, we have done a great thing for you.  We are creating an administrative interest in your own bailiewick and you can no longer say that Merrion Street is a centralised bureaucracy which despises the very name of bureaucracy because it has no confidence in the people.&rdquo;  Let us be careful that that inspiration is not there.</P>

      <P>I did not refer to the Government.  I was very careful to say that I hoped there was no such inspiration because I am speaking not of the present Government but of the Governments in office since a native Government first came into office.  I do think, from experience, that the moment is most inopportune, and I have not been convinced by any of the speeches I have heard.  I was sorry I was not here for Senator Sir John Keane's speech, because I was impressed by his suggestions. I think they were appurtenant and preliminary to the discussion initiated by Senator O'Dwyer, and I would have learned much had I been in the House while he was speaking. Not having heard his remarks, I give my own view.  It is: move slowly and <Col N="2292" /> let us learn from the experience of the past, which shows us a colossal blunder which reacted on the rural ratepayers, on administration generally, and particularly on the poor, who are crying from that day to this about the hardships, the disadvantages and the strain which it has meant for them and for their limited purses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I think this motion is ill-considered.  What does it say?  The substance of the motion is that the Government should bring in a Bill which will say: &ldquo;<i>Fiant</i> parish councils and let the members of the councils be elected on a family vote.&rdquo; That, to my mind, is a perfectly ridiculous motion to bring in because, if the Government is going to create such bodies, it must be for a reason, that these bodies shall embark on a certain work and that the Government will vest them with certain powers in the interests of those functions.  <i>En passant</i>, I want to refer to the question of family vote.  Senator Rowlette seemed to assume that the family would have to have a sort of vote in itself as to who would be its representative in the voting for the parish council.  I may say here right away that I have understood the idea of family vote as perfectly natural.  The natural head of the family is the father, and the State and national society is really a combination of families and not of individuals.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I quite agree, not that I think it will bring about any miraculous change in our life in this country, that, in the natural order of things, it is right that, as society consists of that unity of families, the head of each family should be the operative member in its relationship with society, whether that society be nation or local.  Therefore, the head of the family, the father, should be the voter, if there be parish councils, for parish councils, and also the voter for the national authority of the whole national society.  That seems to me to be perfectly natural, and I do not think there need be any friction in families, because the natural order of things is that the father is the authority in the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a departure from the natural order of things, and legislation should recognise that the head of the family, independent of any legislation this Government brings in, is the father, and that society is the unity of families and, therefore, the father should be the operative member.</P>
      <P>A sort of mental laziness, a sort of desire for an easily-obtained Utopia is prevalent all over the world to-day and in every aspect of life.  Everybody likes to think that, without any mental operation, without any discipline of oneself, without overcoming one's natural desires, a perfect order of things can be obtained by a simple mechanical process.  We hear people talking about democracy and dictatorship as though one or the other, by its own nature, would necessarily bring about perfection.  You are not going to have perfection.  The trouble in our society in Ireland, as in every other country, arises from the natural tendency to evil in the members of that society, and whether they be grouped according to parishes or counties is not going to overcome that tendency.  It will operate or not operate according to the persons or individuals forming society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree that it may be that, on examination, it will be found&mdash;and I think there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to show it&mdash;that the first territorial organisation of society should be according to the parish.  Mind you, the old rural district councils largely coincided with the parish arrangement, and it just happens that, as we live in the country here, the one place where people meet, the centre of the area, is the church.  Therefore, there is a certain interflow, a certain relationship between the members of one parish which unites them as distinct from their relationship with other parishes. Therefore, I would quite agree that if one were overhauling our whole system of control the parish might naturally suggest itself to one as the natural unit there.  But here we are going to create a new governing body. In the case of voluntary bodies, I am <Col N="2294" /> entirely in agreement, but we are asking the Government to create new bodies with statutory power to control people in defined areas.  Now, anybody who ever bothered listening to me here knows that I am dead against further interference by the Government, and the greatest condemnation I can see of this proposal is that, when people begin talking about parish councils, instead of setting about trying to get them to come into operation by the natural will of the people nobody thinks of anything else but invoking the Government to come along with more legislation to tie us up in more rules.</P>
    <P>I would be dead against any proposal that the Government here and now create a new and additional body for controlling people's operations. As I think I have said here on previous occasions, I am quite satisfied that the whole local government arrangement in this country requires to be totally overhauled.  I have not made up my mind&mdash;I should like that matter to be examined&mdash;as to whether that reorganisation should aim at giving the local bodies more power or less power, that is to say, whether the local territorially organised bodies should have more power or less power.  One of the troubles in this country at the moment, as I have pointed out, is that if you elect people locally, and give them power, they are not only the people who impose taxation in the way of rates but they also have power to pawn the production of future generations, they have power to commit and bind and impoverish future generations by their power to borrow. In regard to any local body I would deny them the right to borrow, and I would also like to deny it to the central Government.  We have not the right to legislate to rob or to tax generations that remain to be born. That is what our local bodies are doing here, and that is what our central Government is doing.</P>
    <P>Here we are asking the Government to do something.  We know perfectly well that the Government cannot just bring in a Bill which will say: &ldquo;<i>Fiant</i> parish councils.&rdquo;  They can bring in a Bill saying that there <Col N="2295" /> shall be parish councils elected in this way, and they shall function in such a way and be vested with such powers, that is to say, they will create additional bodies with additional powers to control the unfortunate people of this country who are already over-controlled.  This afternoon we had this Mines Bill.  What is the explanation of that?</P>
    <P>The explanation of that is that the people forming our society individually are so utterly inferior that the wealth lying under the ground of this country remains undeveloped if it is left to the people who own the land; that if there is any hope of development of the mineral resources which may or may not exist in this country we must have the Government butting in.  Here again we come along asking the Government to legislate.  I think three sorts of parish councils have been talked about.  There are parish councils being started, I think, in various places in relation specifically to what is called the present emergency. Yesterday or the day before somebody&mdash;I cannot remember who it was&mdash;came to me and said there had been a sort of hand-picked parish council elected in his district, and it was having a very bad effect on the shopkeepers, because those people were already telling the shopkeepers that, in the event of anything emerging out of the emergency, they would promptly come along and seize the shopkeepers' goods.  I do think that, in view of the possibility of a shortage of necessary food stores in this country, it is quite legitimate that there should be local committees with certain powers, and I quite agree that the handiest way&mdash;possibly the most efficient way&mdash;of getting together a suitable body of people is by hand-picking.</P>
    <P>That is one type, only in relation to the emergency, and an emergency can cover quite a multitude of sins. Another type is the voluntary body. I am quite in agreement with the voluntary body which will have no powers over the people except such as the people themselves may voluntarily give to them.  That is another type. The first we will put up; the other <Col N="2296" /> would be desirable if the people have sufficient initiative to get going, and also sufficient intelligence and other qualities to make those bodies effective for good.  Now we have other people coming along demanding that there be parish councils.  We have the Government, and we have county councils, and we have all sorts of bodies, and the only solution we see for our ills is to create additional ones.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the family vote, I think, would be an improvement upon this division of society which we have now, in which there is only the Government and the totality of society without the natural division in between.  From the things I have read and heard about parish councils there seems to be a suggestion that they would lead to the establishment of corporations and the delegation of the powers and the authority already arrogated unjustifiably by the State to itself in economic affairs; that those bodies might come about who would have the control within their own vocational spheres.  People quote Papal Encyclicals on this.  I admit here and now that I have not read <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> for a good long time, and I may not be quite exact in my references to it, but as far as my memory serves me there is in <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> a description of the arrangements made with regard to corporations in Italy.  There is set down there among other things the view that although you do not necessarily have to be a member of those corporations you have to pay your subscriptions anyway.  The late Pope follows on that&mdash;I repeat, it is quite a number of years since I read that document&mdash;and says that many people feel that this is an unwarrantable arrogation of powers by the State to itself, and also it is hard to see how membership can be said to be free for the individuals when it is also stated that they have to pay their subscriptions.</P>
    <P>In relation to those parish councils, what money are they going to spend? Are they going to spend money?  If so, where are they going to get it? I do not think that by some arbitrary mechanical device you are going to get <Col N="2297" /> exact justice from some new subdivision of society.  Somebody mentioned, or I heard somewhere, about the possibilities if factories were wanted in a district.  What has happened for many years past?  Everybody came rushing along trying to grab a factory for their own district. What do they want?  If you are going to start a factory for making anything you like, say door knobs, the T.D. is dashing around saying: &ldquo;Why not have it here?  Such a place has a factory for boots, and such another place has a factory for cloth.&rdquo;  What do they want?  They want an arrangement made whereby everybody in this country who buys a door knob will be robbed, if you like, by the Government; will have to pay more for that necessary commodity, and that money must go into that particular district.  If the people in a district want factories, or if they want new mines, let them get after them themselves. Do not let us have another body with statutory powers able to butt in.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be an admission of impotence amongst the people.  If the people want parish councils, let the people create them.  When they function, I should then like to see the Government reverse what has been done in the past.  I will not say that the Government of which I was a member was perfect; it is only a matter of degrees of guilt; we were a little less guilty than the present Government. It would be quite right, when we see them working voluntarily, for the Government to take from itself certain of its present powers and hand them over to those councils.  If I can see into the minds of the people whom I hear talking about statutory parish councils, they will want money.  It does not follow that, because they are elected in the parish and by the fathers of families, a just system will prevail. Anybody can be unjust, whether he be a member of my parish or whether he be the father of a family.  One of the things that has played the mischief with the people of this country&mdash;it was a necessary thing in the first place&mdash;is this land division.  Take a parish where the average farm is 25 acres, and <Col N="2298" /> where there are three men with big farms.  Mind you, those big farms might, in their present big state, be quite a good thing in the economy of that district and in our national economy.</P>
    <P>A parish council might have power to decide with regard to division of land.  You have 72 heads of families with 25 acres each and you have three heads of families with 500 acres each. It is a question of land division. Somehow or another, in this magic word &ldquo;parish&rdquo;, or in this magic word &ldquo;council&rdquo;, is something going to operate that they are going to be moved with no other object but exact justice or are they going to be moved, as our society is so enormously moved, by envy and cupidity, and say to themselves: &ldquo;We have the majority here, we will take those men's lands from them and divide it amongest ourselves?&rdquo; What virtue is there in this which is going to prevent that? Therefore, in handing over powers, I want to see that they will be circumscribed so as to operate within natural justice.  I have no belief in any of our local bodies, in central government, and, you can sub-divide or multiply as much as you like, I do not believe you are going necessarily to get justice. The only way you protect yourself against government is by limiting its powers.</P>
    <P>I consider this particular resolution particularly inept.  It is merely asking that some sort of statutory bodies be created, not saying anything with regard to the work they will do, the functions they will fulfil, but only talking about the way they will be elected. It is just like this talk about democracy. People think that democracy is necessarily free and anything else is not free.  I am free to vote for A or B.  Am I any better off for it?  The purpose of voting is to get an authority, to create an order in which I will be able to attain to my natural perfection in the most straightforward way.  Whether that authority comes about by all of us sitting down and voting, it does not follow it is going to do that.  What we want is to consider what the Government exists for, <Col N="2299" /> what it is going to do, and how it is going to do it.  The way you find out whether your society is healthy or not, whether your State is a good State or not, is to see whether the thing for which government exists is appropriately and aptly attained, but it is not necessarily brought about by the fact that everybody votes.  We can look around certain statutory bodies and see some of the people who are in them and see if they are so perfect that just order necessarily flows from them.  All we are interested in in this resolution is how they are elected.</P>
    <P>I like the proposal with regard to the election, because it is in accord with the natural order in which the father is the head of the family.  The relationship between society and men is not directly between the individual and society; it is the family and society.  Therefore, the father should be the representative of the family, the organ of the family, in its relation to society in general.  There I am quite in agreement.  I think the parish would probably be the best subdivision, but I do not believe that we should here and now, without any consideration as to what the functions of these bodies are going to be, create new bodies to have new power over things.  What I would like is a reconsideration of our whole local government position.  I think that any body in this country which is going to spend money must itself be totally responsible. I do not know what the Government gives at present, but I remember when we went out of office the central taxation handed over to local bodies, for them to spend, roughly £2,000,000.  On the strength of that the Government claims control over the activities of those bodies. Under those circumstances it is quite right.  You are not going to have free local government until you have liberty and responsibility.  If you have the Government collecting the money and the local body spending that money, the local body has no right to demand to be totally free of Government control.  I think the parish councils can do quite good work; they can add to the unity of society, in the <Col N="2300" /> flow of good between individual and individual in the parish.  The parish is, therefore, a natural division inasmuch as it is already established and has a centralised life, centring around the church and school.  There I am quite in agreement.</P>
    <P>In regard to money, I think if such bodies were created I would vote against their ever receiving any penny from the Government.  I mean that they should not cost the Government one penny.  If inspectors are necessary I think each parish council should bear its proportionate costs of each inspector who is involved in their operation.  I would insist upon that. Secondly, before these bodies are created I want as far as possible&mdash;I admit I am not urging this&mdash;that they should be able to collect no money in the way of rates or subscription from anybody except on a voluntary basis. If they are going to have statutory power to raise any local levy then the control over them and the consideration of their creation must be very closely gone into before any such power is given.  If we think that such bodies are going to be socially good in this country, I believe the proposal that they should be created by Government action is thoroughly wrong.  I refer again to the question of corporations. As far as Papal pronouncements are concerned, time and again it is stated that the only form of society is corporational, and yet in <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> I can read nothing but a condemnation of what was done in Italy where the Government, using this power that it had arrogated to itself, comes along to impose a control upon the people through corporations. I do not purport to be an authority, but it does seem to me that if we want a perfect society here we can only do it by getting people to act upon their own initiative.  To think that by the Dáil passing a Bill, by that Bill coming before the Seanad, being duly sent by the Government to the President for signature, we are going to create a society in which the flow of charity from one section of society to another and one individual to another is going to be such that the angels looking down will be rejoiced to <Col N="2301" /> see it is perfectly futile.  The goodness in society is the goodness of the charity which unites the members of that society and that charity is not a thing that can be created by Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Muintir na Tíre, which I do not pretend to know a great deal about, may or may not be doing good work and be quite successful in promoting the formation of parish councils.  I do agree that as far as I can judge&mdash;but a closer examination might change my point of view&mdash;the parish is a natural unit for the minimistic territorial section of society.  There I am quite in agreement, but as far as this resolution is concerned, we know perfectly well that if we want statutorily created bodies it means that they should have statutory powers and we do not say one word as to what the statutory powers are going to be although the statutory powers that are given to such bodies may make all the difference between their being beneficial institutions through the country or being malevolent tyrannies through the country.  I think we rather stultify ourselves by coming in and passing vague, general resolutions.  If you are going to pass a resolution which proposes something in the nature of legislation to the Government then that resolution should come as near as may be to the actual drafting of a Bill.  If the Bill were there we could examine its various clauses and bring our judgment to bear upon it.  It is futile to think that because we say: &ldquo;Let there be parish councils&rdquo; and the Government with its almighty power, its creative word, comes along and establishes parish councils, we can go home and rest because everybody in the country is going to be perfect from now on, that there is going to be marvellous unity amongst ourselves. There is no unity except through the operation of love.</P>
    <P>I think that in the parishes all through the country there is an enormous amount of cupidity and envy.  If you could get rid of those two things you would do a great deal to solve social evils.  I hear so many people talking as though by merely passing a Bill you are going to have <Col N="2302" /> a new order in the world.  I have a horror of new orders.  With the order we have they can find faults, but something we have not got is going to be perfect.  In regard to the present war, when I hear people talking about the new order that will be created out of it I get quite depressed.  You have the Communist going around telling us of the marvellous conditions that could prevail.  I know perfectly well that they can point out to us all the troubles that exist at the present time. We cannot do that with them in relation to whatever conditions might exist under their ideal form of government, because that is something that is going to come.  We can see what is wrong at the moment, but we cannot make any comparisons with them.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that this motion has been subjected to a rather severe bombardment.  There was one comfort, at any rate, when the attacking planes, as it were, seemed to come into collision, especially on the question of the family vote.  I may be to blame, inasmuch as I did not perhaps explain the motion in a clearer manner.  There still seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding regarding parish councils and what they mean.  For example, Senator Fitzgerald referred to the question of land division and he seemed to think that a parish council would have power to confiscate the land of persons in the parish.</P>

      <P>Nobody suggested that those councils should have power to acquire any property compulsorily; there was no such proposal.  Senator Fitzgerald also said that the people of a parish could establish a council if they wanted one.  Of course, it is only the Legislature that can give the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">

      <P>There would have to <Col N="2303" /> be some authority.  It would be futile for the people of a parish to have a council if they had no powers.  Without powers they could do nothing at all.  The impression seems to have gone around that parish councils would mean Government interference and certain restrictions.  That would not necessarily follow.  Our contention is that the establishment of those councils would bring about a sense of cohesion in every parish and would prove a charter of liberty for the small rural community.</P>
      <P>Senator Rowlette, although he seems to have arrived at some wrong conclusions, has done much to clarify the position.  He and Senator Fitzgerald complained that I did not go into details regarding the powers of the proposed parish councils.  The fact is I did not like to prolong the debate by going into details.  I do not know that it is very necessary at this stage to go into details as to what the actual powers would be.  I think that would be more a matter for a debate when whatever measures may be necessary are going through the Legislature.  I think it would be sufficient for the present if the principle of the parish council for a rural community was accepted.  Its exact powers could be debated afterwards.</P>
      <P>Senator Rowlette questioned the wisdom of saying that the establishment of a parish council was of more importance than any functions it could perform.  At present you have numbers of families in a parish without any sense of cohesion, without any power of acting together or pooling their intelligence and resources.  We propose that these families should be organised in parish councils.  The potentialities of such a body as a parish council would, indeed, be very great.  The formation of such a body would be in that sense more important than any work it might do, because the potentialities, especially in the way of parish improvement and development, would be immense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the taking of certain powers from the county councils and handing them over to the parish councils.  That was not suggested <Col N="2304" /> when the acceptance of this motion was advocated.  What was suggested was that the parish council would be useful to the board of health and to the county council.  As regards the distribution of outdoor relief, the parish council could give great assistance to the board of health by reason of local knowledge.  The parish council could also give considerable assistance in the matter of housing and local improvements generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Rowlette thinks that he discovered some inconsistency in my remarks when I said that it would be impossible to base the system of the parish council on voluntary organisation and, at the same time, pointed to the success of co-operative societies.  I pointed out the work that voluntary organisations have done in the case of co-operative societies and I do not think there was any inconsistency in my remarks.  So far as the voluntary organisations are concerned, we do not say that they have not done good.  I know they have done and are doing great work, but the great objection to them is that they are not permanent. Nobody can deny that, in the course of time, whether it be a year or 20 years, these societies tend to disintegrate.</P>
    <P>Co-operative societies, as I pointed out the last day, have done a lot to develop the country.  We may regard them as somewhat similar to parish councils because they are formed of one section of the people who would be called upon to form a parish council, but we must remember that a co-operative society as such is a different body from a voluntary society organised to carry on public services. A co-operative society has an incentive in so far as it manufactures goods.  It has the incentive of the profit that is made arising out of its work and the material advantages it confers on its members.  That is one reason why co-operative societies will continue to exist so long as they are financially sound.  The incentive of material advantage is there.  That incentive would not exist in the case of voluntary organisations endeavouring to carry on public services.  It may be recollected that the previous Government had to <Col N="2305" /> bring in an Act to provide for the compulsory purchase of proprietary creameries that were in competition with co-operative societies.  The co-operative societies could not retain the enthusiasm and cohesion which marked their earlier existence in face of the competition of the proprietary creameries, with the result that the Government had to step in to purchase the proprietary creameries and practically, in a measure, give statutory powers to those societies.  They fixed a certain area within which no other creamery would be allowed to compete. Even in their case, therefore, the purely voluntary system was not a success. That is why I say that the experience of the co-operative societies confirms my contention that a local body entrusted with functions of a local character cannot be permanently carried on, on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Some objection to the principle of the family vote was raised by Senator Foran and Senator Rowlette.  I am afraid that in that instance also there has been some misunderstanding, because people seem to have in their minds conditions such as exist in a city when a corporation has to be elected. The situation is quite different in a small rural community where there are only a few hundred families concerned. The parish council, as I say, is a sort of super-family and there can be no objection to its being elected by the heads of families.  It will be quite understood that the situation will be completely different from that which exists where a Dáil vote or a corporation vote is concerned.  There is no question as to retaining adult suffrage for Parliamentary or corporation elections. As a matter of fact, Senator Rowlette seemed to have forgotten that, up to about five years ago, the local government bodies were elected by the heads of families.  Husbands and wives as the heads of families were the sole persons authorised to vote in local government elections.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, the family vote would be really the natural system to adopt in the election of these councils.  The objection has also been put forward that young people would be excluded from these councils.  That <Col N="2306" /> need not be so, because young people would be eligible for election on parish councils and the parish council would utilise the energy and enthusiasm of the young people in the promotion of many of their schemes.  The young people, on the other hand, would be more concerned with the lighter side of life and in providing amusements. The heads of families have a greater sense of responsibility and they would be more suitable for the administration of local affairs than very young people.  I quite agree with the Senator who spoke about the advantages of democracy and I think it can be said that in setting up this system, so far from injuring democracy, you would be setting up a firm basis for the democratic institutions of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it might be well if I were to explain what our proposal really means because there seems to be great misunderstanding on the question.  The essential points of difference between the parish councils that we propose and the other bodies&mdash;the voluntary bodies and the emergency committees of the present time&mdash;are that the parish councils would be elected by the family vote and that they would be established by statute.  We propose that each parish or community group should be as self-governing as possible, that the local council should be elected on the family vote, the council to consist of ten persons in addition to the clergy of all denominations of the parish.  There would then be an annual assembly consisting of all the heads of the families in the parish so that, so far from taking over control of the administration from the people, you practically make every family in the parish a part of the parish council. I am sure that Senator Rowlette realises the effect that the establishment of that system all over the country, and its continuance for a number of years, will have upon the whole future of the country.</P>
    <P>The powers and the authority of the council would fall into three catagories. In the first place, it would have such powers of local government as are visualised by the Local Government Bill, which contemplates the setting up of small committees similar in a way to <Col N="2307" /> those parish councils.  These powers would include the distribution of outdoor relief, the repair of by-roads and all these small functions that would be performed by such committees.  Outside of these local government functions, in regard to which it would act under the supervision and authority of the county council, the parish council that we visualise would be an independent body and would be free to embark upon any schemes of development such as a co-operative society might embark upon.  It would be perfectly free to embark upon such schemes of development.</P>
    <P>We must remember that councils consisting of heads of families would have great moral authority in the parish.  They could supervise cinemas, literature and any other happenings in the parish.  A parish council would be an ideal body to deal with unemployment. There could be a local exchange at which the unemployed in each parish could register.  In dealing with the unemployment problem there would be no such thing as malingering if a parish council was in existence. Such a council could also provide openings for the provision of work.  It could purchase land, secure allotments, arrange loans for drainage and for agricultural purposes, provide transport facilities, marketing, and arrange the establishment of suitable local industries.  Our proposal would, in effect, set up a co-operative society in every parish.  In some countries, such as Czechoslovakia, parish councils have local police and local courts somewhat similar to the old Sinn Féin courts.  I do not suggest that they should supersede the State courts or the State police force, but it might be possible to have here also a voluntary parish police like the Security Force and parish courts for settlement of local disputes.  I mention these things to indicate the powers that might be given to such bodies and to show the great possibilities of parish <Col N="2308" /> councils.  The Minister stated that in the new Local Government Bill provision has been made for the establishment of parish councils, but I understood that they are to be voluntary and do not provide for election. I consider that the parish councils should be set up statutorily.  It has been said that the present moment is inopportune.</P>
    <P>France, which has passed through a terrible crisis, is at present considering the re-establishment of parish councils. This includes the reorganisation of rural districts.  There is no reason why we should not take advantage of the present opportunity to carry out a great reformation, for great revolution can only be effected in times of stress and emergency.  The emergency bodies that have been established have not been very successful because their functions were not clearly defined and they have no powers. We all know that at this moment there is a great danger of this country being involved in the war. Even if we escape there is the possibility that we might be involved in a financial crash after the war.  It is to meet such a situation that it is necessary to have local committees because they would have the confidence of the people.  I suggest to the Government that the emergency councils should be elected by the family vote in the different localities, and in that way provide the Government with responsible bodies in each parish.  Having raised this question of the establishment of parish councils, I think I can safely withdraw the motion now, and leave the whole matter in the hands of the Government.</P>
