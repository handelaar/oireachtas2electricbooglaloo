      <P>I have received notice from Senator Douglas that, on the motion for the adjournment, he proposes to call attention to the need for a greater realisation of the importance of A.R.P. on the part of the public generally and for greater clarity on the part of the Government as to its attitude to the problem.  I am accepting that notice.  The matter will be taken on the motion for the adjournment at the conclusion of the other business on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second and subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Dáil the main object of this Bill is to get authority for further issues of loans out of the Local Loans Fund to enable the social activities financed from it to be continued.  The fund was set up on a statutory basis on the 1st May, 1935, under the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, Section 4 (3) of which put a limit of £5,000,000 on issues.  This was extended to £11,000,000 by Section 2 of the Local <Col N="2078" /> Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1937, and authority is sought in the present Bill for a further extension of £6,000,000 which will bring the limit to £17,000,000.</P>
      <P>From its establishment in 1935 up to the 30th June, 1940, the loans issued from the fund aggregated £10,319,309. Of this £7,989,132 was for housing loans the apportionment being &mdash; urban, £2,877,009; rural, £4,387,548; small dwellings acquisition, £658,718, and Gaeltacht, £65,857.  The balance of £2,330,177 went in loans for public health, £941,865; hospitals and county homes, £736,382; vocational education, £452,711; drainage, £149,593, and other services, £49,626.</P>
      <P>Over the same period the total commitments of the fund, including the carry-over of loans sanctioned, but not all given out before the 1st May, 1935, were £13,246,487.  The aggregate of loans sanctioned up to any date will always be substantially more than the total issues up to that date as the full amount of a loan is sanctioned before any issue is made and loans are ordinarily given out in instalments. The existing statutory limitation of £11,000,000 applies only to issues of loans; the same will, of course, be true of the new limitation of £17,000,000.</P>
      <P>It will be seen from what I have said that by the end of June last the margin available for issues within the £11,000,000 limit was less than £700,000. This should be exhausted by about the end of September.  The extra £6,000,000 provided for in Section 2 of the Bill should do for about three years, or up to about the summer of 1943; fresh legislation will then be required if the granting of loans from the fund is to continue, as no doubt it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for some subsidiary matters.  Section 3 extends to all borrowers from the fund the provision in the existing law respecting local authorities which enables arrears due by them to be recovered out of any Government money payable to the borrowers; Section 4 applies to borrowers like harbour boards and public utility societies, provisions like those in Section 2 of the Local Authorities <Col N="2079" /> (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, which protect the Local Loans Fund against evasion of repayment of a loan on the plea that the borrowing body is not properly constituted or has exceeded its powers.  Section 5 confirms the arrangement as to the making of loans by the Minister for Finance through an intermediate body&mdash;the Commissioners of Public Works. Section 6 is designed to remove doubts that have arisen as to the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works concerning the making of harbour and other loans.  Sections 7 and 8 are intended to clarify the position as to the disposal of money received in repayment of loans before the present statutory Local Loans Fund was established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the policy with regard to the retiring of these loans.  I take it that the borrowers pay interest into a sinking fund and ultimately, I presume, the capital is repaid.  Is it intended to leave this total of £17,000,000 in a sort of revolving fund, or is it the intention that, when the capital is being repaid, the Exchequer will be refunded?  The Minister may say that that is all laid down in the Principal Act but I should rather like to know what the position is as I do not know whether or not it is in the Principal Act.  I should also like to know from the Minister the reason for these provisions in Section 5.  It seems rather strange, on the face of it, that when ordinary lenders have to have scrupulous regard to the regularity of the borrower, the Government should not have to have the same regard. Take the case of a bank, for instance. When a bank lends to a person who has not got the power to borrow, it is not a legal loan.  Apparently, however, the Government is absolved from any vigilance in these matters and does not appear to be concerned with the regularity of the position of the borrower. I suggest that these provisions are new, and perhaps the Minister would tell us why they are being adopted now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one little point that I wish to raise.  It is the <Col N="2080" /> experience of local bodies, in borrowing money, that they can get it at a much cheaper rate of interest from outside bodies than from the Local Loans Fund.  I think that the rate, as it stands at present, will be prohibitive from the point of view of encouraging building.  Will the Minister give some reason why local bodies, as I understand, are not encouraged to borrow from outside sources where they can get money much cheaper&mdash;at least, up to recent times&mdash;than from the Local Loans Fund.  I think that the interest in the case of the Local Loans Fund should be reduced if it is the intention, as I understood it was, to encourage the building of houses in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Senator, it is hardly correct to say that local authorities are discouraged from looking elsewhere than to the Local Loans Fund for moneys for loans.  Nothing has been done that I am aware of to put any obstacle in the way of local authorities getting money anywhere else that they can get it, especially if they can get it cheaper than from the Local Loans Fund.  There have been one or two cases, when I was Minister for Local Government, that came under my notice, where sanction was not given, but there were special reasons because, in the two cases that I have in mind, there were conditions attached to the loans that the then Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance then and now could not accept as conditions that a local authority ought to accept.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question asked by Senator Sir John Keane, the money is put into the Local Loans Fund as it is received from the local authority in respect of sinking fund and interest and reloaned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the vigilance of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the Commissioners for Public Works, I think vigilance is exercised by all these authorities and very strict examination is made not alone into the <i>bona fides</i> but the legal status, the position generally, of the local authorities and individuals seeking loans from the Local Loans Fund. <Col N="2081" /> There was one case came to my notice when I was Minister for Local Government where a local authority claimed that its predecessors in office, firstly, had not a legal status and, secondly, exceeded their powers.  That is the only case I recollect in which a question was raised in court as to the status of the borrowers, and the verdict was given against the then local authority which sought to prove that its predecessors had exceeded their powers.  No case that I know of has been established wherein a verdict has been given against the Commissioners of Public Works or the Minister for Finance on the ground that those to whom they loaned the money, the local authority, had not proper legal status or exceeded their powers.  I think very great care is taken to establish that the loans are properly given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 2, I want to ask the Minister if there is any principle followed in fixing the total amounts which can be borrowed from the Local Loans Fund.  I see that the fund has grown very considerably in the last six years.  I think the Minister said that it was £6,000,000 and is now £17,000,000.  Presumably, there is some basis on which this total amount is fixed.  It is all bound up, of course, with the borrowing powers of local authorities, but I take it that a point is reached when it is dangerous and unsound finance to lend, in the aggregate, more than a certain amount to local authorities.  In fact, there must be some attempt at a more or less definite ratio between the revenues of local authorities and the amount which they should legitimately, in the interests of sound finance, be allowed to borrow.  I do not know if the Minister has had the matter examined from that standpoint, but, if he has, could <Col N="2082" /> any indication be given as to what the total amount of sound borrowing at present is likely to be because there is no evidence that the wealth of the country is increasing at such a rate as to justify the unregulated growth of this fund?  I should like to know if that aspect of the problem has been examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane, as well as members of the Seanad in general and particularly those who have or have had, any intimate association with local governing bodies, is aware that the law relating to local government regulates and limits the amount that may be borrowed on valuation.  There are certain exemptions.  Certain items that may be borrowed for do not count against the limitation of borrowing.  I am sorry that I could not, without notice, give the Senator any idea of what the total borrowing powers of all the local authorities in Éire would be at any given time, but I am sure that, in the Department of Local Government and in my own Department, that figure would be available or, at any rate, could be made up.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, a statutory legal limit, so far as local authorities are concerned, in the case of each local authority and, presumably, we have a total legal limit for the aggregate of all the local authorities in the country, but in every individual case, first, the local authority itself, generally speaking, examines its borrowing powers when it has any scheme of work for which borrowing is necessary under consideration.  The scheme then goes before the Minister for Local Government and he, through his officials, generally makes a very keen examination of the financial position of the local authority, with particular reference to the law limiting its borrowing powers for certain purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as the Senator said, that the Local Loans Fund has increased its total considerably in the last few years. That is due to the rapid rate at which housing schemes, public health schemes of various kinds and other social services have developed in recent years. <Col N="2083" /> I do not think that so far as the legal limit is concerned, we are anywhere within measurable distance of it, taking the country as a whole.  It is, of course, another question whether it is wise for us to go near that limit at all, or whether the rate of borrowing is too rapid.  I think that, generally speaking, members of the Seanad, as well as the Dáil and public bodies, wish to see these social services go ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put this point to the Minister because I think it has a bearing on the question raised by Senator Sir John Keane.  There is no doubt about it: there is a great deal of work to be done in this country. Hundreds of millions could be spent in making conditions better than they are.  The trouble is that you do not know whether you have got the income to repay the expenditure or not.  The amount of income which you require is determined to a considerable extent by the demands <Col N="2084" /> which are being made upon it for carrying out drainage schemes, housing schemes or the like.  I am thinking mainly as a countryman with regard to the problem of drainage, and, like the problem of housing, none of us can ever see the end of this problem or its final solution, so long as the cost of the money which has to be used in the carrying out of the work is as high as it is to-day.  I would like to know what the Minister has to say on that point.</P>
      <P>Apparently, we can only get money from the people who have earned it in the past and who have it stored up and are prepared to give it to us if we give them absolute guarantees that it is going to be repaid in full and that, in the meantime, they are going to get a very high service for the use of the money.  I have a little experience of this and I know that local authorities down the country want to go on with the good work of providing more and better houses, but their difficulty is that when they look at the expenditure and at the rates year after year, they see that they are mounting up, while there is work still there to be done. Many of our towns are paying 20/- in the £ rates to-day, yet hundreds of new homes remain to be built, or ought to be built, in order to give the people the chance to live there in them.</P>
      <P>When you discuss this matter with members of local authorities, they tell you that money is too dear and that, if it could be brought down 1 per cent. or even ½ per cent., it would make all the difference in the world in the rates.  It is the same thing in the case of drainage schemes.  You are going to spend, perhaps, £100,000&mdash;more than £100,000 was spent on one particular scheme in my own county&mdash;but when the local authority has to bear portion of the charge and farmers have to bear another portion&mdash;the farmer, particularly, tries to get it out of his land, and the income from the farm is hardly adequate to meet the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to any of our schemes in the future, I think we are never going to find a solution for our problems, social and economic, so long as local authorities have to borrow money <Col N="2085" /> at 5½ or 5¾ per cent., or even at 5 per cent.  Looking at it from the human standpoint, I must say that I cannot see how it is justifiable to expect human beings, first of all, to give the kind of service that they have to give to live and that so much is to be exacted from them for the use of money.  Money costs more than humanity itself can afford to give. That problem is there&mdash;and it has been debated, one might say, in a somewhat oblique way in this House&mdash;but it still remains unsolved.  The world is employing curious methods to-day to provide solutions, but those methods will only create greater problems.  I feel that this is an aspect of our whole national question which we are not facing up to as we should.  I do not know what enlightenment the Minister can give us, but I would like to know that he was just as disturbed about it in his mind as I am and that he and his colleagues are concentrating on finding a way out.  If he cannot find a way out, I would go no further than to say that there are strange ways of doing things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I should like to put to the Minister. From my experience of over 15 years, I have never heard of any instructions issued by the Department to the public bodies pointing out to them that the maximum borrowing power is set at such-and-such a figure.  We seem to go on borrowing indefinitely.  I have raised this question many times at council meetings, that the amount we have already borrowed in the last six or seven years comes to a colossal figure.  Speaking from memory, I think that, at the moment, we have already borrowed something in the neighbourhood of £1,250,000.  I have tried to point out that we are most desirous of co-operating with the Government in the very proper drive that was made some years ago&mdash;and by the previous Government in a lesser way, if you like &mdash;to meet the demands of social services and to give what was urgently and pressingly important &mdash; decent hygienic homes to the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger point, however, if we are taking risks and borrowings are <Col N="2086" /> never questioned.  I have raised this matter in the council and asked the limit of our borrowing powers and the chief executive officer told me he did not know.  I ask him if we could continue indefinitely until the condition of things would arise&mdash;and it seems that we are coming to it&mdash;when the taxpayer and ratepayer will be just as badly off as the people for whom we are getting these services, whom we now regard in the category of the poor. I heard the Minister saying to-day that there is a definite limit to the borrowing capacity of our local authorities, but for the last 15 years I have never heard of a letter having being issued by the Department drawing the attention of the public bodies to the sum which may be spent on this wild escapade for all kinds of social services. There is a limit to the capacity of our ratepayers to pay.  I was glad to hear the Minister speak on this matter, but I never heard of any documentary proof that they cannot go on indefinitely in such an escapade until the condition of things will be, as I have said, that those who pay the money for these social servces may find themselves very much poorer than those for whom they provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could announce a solution to the problem set me by Senator Baxter, but I am afraid I cannot.  Money is dear at present and it is just as hard for the Minister for Finance to get it as it is for the local authorities.  We have to go to the country, to the banks and to the people to borrow the money and, as Senator Baxter has said, we have to guarantee, on the credit of the State, that that money will be returned and, in the meantime, we have to pay a heavy rate of interest for the use of the money.  I do not know any other way of getting money and I do not know any way at present of getting cheap money.  Of course, if it were thought proper, even though the Government had to pay four or even more than 4 per cent. interest on the money it raises for local loans and other purposes, the Government presumably could decide to saddle the taxpayer in general with part of the <Col N="2087" /> interest and let the local authorities off that, but it would simply be &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; and, in the end, the local authorities would not be any better off as, if they escaped the taxation in one way, they would get it in another.  Probably the straightest way to bring it home most clearly and definitely to the country as a whole and to the local authorities that they have to pay for this money and pay pretty dearly for the improvement in the social services they are demanding, would be to let them know directly in a straight and clear way what it costs to provide these services, by charging them the full interest.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Madden, certain services are excluded from the limit of borrowing powers.  At different times&mdash;in the British days and in our own days&mdash;the law has eliminated certain items&mdash; social and other services&mdash;from the limits of borrowing; but the chief executive officer of any local authority should be in a position at any time to tell a member of the local authority, or the ratepayers in his county, how much they have borrowed, how much they are paying for their borrowing, what are the limits fixed by law under the various headings and what margin still remains.  That should be available and, if that is not done in the case of every local authority, it would be wise for the members of the local authority to get that set out in the annual statement of finances of the local authority itself.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill now before the House repeals completely the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931, but &mdash;it is important to note this&mdash;reenacts the essential provisions of that measure.  Many of the changes which <Col N="2088" /> are being introduced in the existing code by the new Bill affect matters of detail only, but as these changes are numerous it has been thought desirable to prepare this Bill in the form of a consolidating measure so that those who may contemplate availing of the provisions of it may be absolved from the need to refer back to the earlier measure in order to ascertain what their rights are or what facilities may be available to them.</P>
      <P>Possibly, the clearest way of explaining what it is sought to do in the Bill is to summarise part by part the main provisions of the 1931 Act and then to indicate how the provisions of this Bill differ from the provisions of that Act. The Act of 1931 was framed on the assumption that the development of the mineral resources of this country was mainly, if not indeed wholly, a matter for private enterprise only. Under that Act, therefore, it was not necessary to do more than to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give leases of the minerals which were in State ownership and to provide facilities for the acquisition of the right to work minerals which were in private ownership.  Experience has shown, unfortunately, that the fundamental conception underlying the existing Act was not justified and that more comprehensive powers are required to enable such mineral resources as we possess to be developed efficiently and effectively.  The present Bill proposes to confer the necessary powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part I of the 1931 Act dealt with the meanings of the terms employed therein and provided also a means for settling the very difficult question of the substances which passed into the ownership of the tenant farmers on the sale of estates through the Land Commission and what substances were reserved to the Land Commission as minerals. The House is, no doubt, aware that on the sale of estates under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1923 minerals were, as a general rule, reserved to the Land Commission, the tenant purchaser being granted the ownership of the stone, gravel, sand and clay on his holding. Difficulties sometimes arose as to whether particular substances were <Col N="2089" /> minerals reserved to the Land Commission or were the natural stone, gravel, sand and clay of the locality where they occurred.  Furthermore, under the Land Acts to which I have referred, the mineral rights acquired by the Land Commission extended only to deposits which were not being worked on the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; and the question of fact as to whether or not particular deposits were being worked on the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; was one which was very difficult of ascertainment.</P>
    <P>As a solution for these difficulties, the Act of 1931 empowered the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer questions of title to the Land Commission. An appeal lay under the existing Act from the Land Commission to the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission and from him to the Supreme Court.  For a person proposing to work the deposits this reference to the Land Commission, with subsequent rights of appeal, meant delay and, in one case, at least, expensive litigation in which the tenant purchaser was involved.  In the proposed Bill the remedy which it is sought to apply is that the Legislature shall declare that all the mineral substances set out by name in the Schedule to the Bill were and always were substances over which an exclusive mining right vested in the Land Commission under the Land Purchase Acts.  This would seem&mdash;and I think on consideration it will be generally admitted&mdash;to be the most practical and businesslike way of overcoming the difficulties to which I have referred.  Depending on the completeness of the list contained in the Schedule, this method should dispose completely of many of the troublesome doubts that now infect questions of title to mineral deposits.  With the exception to which I have just referred, Part I of the Bill roughly corresponds to Part I of the 1931 Act.</P>
    <P>In Part II of the 1931 Act there are contained provisions for the establishment and constitution of the Mining Board.  This Board advises the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the reasonableness of the claims made for mining rights, rights, that is to say, <Col N="2090" /> to acquire and develop minerals which are in private ownership.  The Board also assesses the compensation to be paid for any such rights under the Act. The Board is constituted of three persons one of whom, the chairman, must be a barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing, a second person who must be skilled in land values and a third who must be an officer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill re-enacts the substance of Part II of the existing Act in regard to the Mining Board.  The constitution of that Board will not be altered by the Bill.  The general nature of its functions will not be altered either, but cases coming before the Board for determination may be more numerous, depending altogether on the extent to which the powers vested in the Minister under Part III of the Bill will be exercised.</P>
    <P>Part III of the 1931 Act contains provisions regarding the terms on which minerals in State ownership might be examined by or leased to persons who wished to develop them.  Part IV of this Bill re-enacts Part III of the Act but it introduces in addition the following new principles: First of all the Minister will have authority to give facilities to take from State-owned mineral deposits small quantities of the deposits without putting the applicants to the expense of obtaining a formal lease of them and, secondly, the Minister will be authorised to work mineral deposits as a State enterprise.</P>
    <P>The arrangements most suitable for working the minerals by the State, either directly or through a semi-State organisation, will be for consideration in each particular case.  So far as it may prove necessary, the Dáil will be asked to provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances, but I should like to emphasise that the intention is that any mineral development project which will be undertaken by the State will be of such a character as to be capable of maintaining itself within a reasonably short period.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Act were the provisions under which the Minister or <Col N="2091" /> private persons might get authority to work minerals which were in private ownership.  These facilities were called &ldquo;mining rights&rdquo;.  Part V deals with the general way in which the minerals shall be developed, or rather with the way in which they shall not be developed.  There are provisions in this part of the Bill making it an offence to work minerals in such a way as to deprive of the necessary support any building or other structure on the surface of the ground.  The provisions of Parts IV and V of the 1931 Act are embodied in Part II of the present Bill.  This is the part which contains the provisions for securing facilities for the working of minerals which are in private ownership.  In the Bill they are called unworked mineral licences. In the Act of 1931 these provisions were called mining rights.  In this part of the Bill also are the provisions which make it an offence for the person working mineral deposits to work them in such a way as to deprive of necessary support those buildings and other structures which may happen to be on the surface of the land.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the existing Act is concerned with the fees to be paid on applications made to the Mining Board, and with the general question of the costs and expenses of that board. Generally corresponding provisions will be found distributed throughout the several parts of this Bill in which they are most appropriate to the general context.  Part VII of the Bill lays down for the guidance of the Mining Board the general principles on which compensation for mining rights shall be assessed, and the persons to whom compensation shall be paid.  Part VII of the present Bill, likewise, deals with this question of compensation.  Compensation will be possible in respect of the following: (1) Land damaged by prospecting; (2) Mining rights acquired by compulsory acquisition orders; (3) Ancillary rights acquired by compulsory acquisition orders; (4) The exercise of the right of entry and user of land which is sought to be conferred under Section 31 of the Bill; (5) Unworked mineral licences or <Col N="2092" /> ancillary rights licences granted under Part VI in accordance with Section 53. In default of agreement the compensation due to the rightful owner of the deposits will in all cases be determined by the Mining Board.  In fixing compensation the Mining Board must have regard to Section 66 and 67 of the Bill, which provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that the board shall assess compensation on the basis of what would be fair and reasonable as a consideration for a bargain between a willing grantor and a willing grantee; and furthermore, that, in the case of compensation for State acquired minerals or compensation in respect of unworked minerals licence compensation shall, as a general rule, take the form of a royalty rent. It is my opinion that in general the owners of deposits will be sufficiently compensated by a royalty on any minerals which an efficient mining undertaking may succeed in winning from the deposits.  This is a form of compensation which is fair to the former owner of the deposit and from the point of view of the new owner the least onerous method of paying compensation.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the existing statute contains general miscellaneous provisions. We propose to repeat these in Part VIII of the Bill, amending one of them which prescribes that information has to be furnished to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the strata passed through by certain shafts or bore holes.  We propose, also, to add a new provision, which is set out in Section 73, making it an offence to work mineral deposits without lawful authority.  We have found that a provision of that sort is necessary, because unskilled and inexperienced persons trying to work what they assumed to be mineral deposits have sometimes created conditions which are dangerous to other people and we have, in fact, on record one case where, because of a non-skilled attempt at mining, a life was lost.  The provisions I have detailed constitute the principal parallelisms between the several parts of the existing Act and those in the proposed new measure.  The latter, in addition, however, contains two important new features to which I <Col N="2093" /> now propose briefly to refer.  The Act of 1931 made no practical distinction between prospecting for minerals and the working of minerals.  The result was that any person who wished to examine mineral deposits for the purpose of ascertaining the extent or the richness of the deposits was faced with almost the same degree of formality and expense as if he had already made up his mind to develop the deposits. Part II of the Bill, the provisions of which, in the main, are new, makes that distinction and it is hoped will facilitate the investigation and evaluation of our mineral resources.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill introduces another new principle.  It authorises the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance to issue orders vesting in the State any minerals which are not being worked efficiently in all cases where it is in the public interest that such orders should be issued.  It is necessary to ask for the powers sought in this part of the Bill because experience has shown that if their development be left to private enterprise alone, there is a possibility that such of the mineral deposits in this country as may be worth exploiting may never be exploited at all.  In the interest of the State, and of the community as a whole, it is important that such mineral resources as we have should be exploited, where possible.  Apart from the fact that work of this kind would give much needed employment, the minerals raised would help to feed essential industries with raw materials at times such as the present when, for any cause, the flow of such raw materials into this country is likely to be interrupted.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has, to some extent, impeded the development of the mineral deposits in this country is the exaggerated value placed on the deposits by the owners of some of them.  It is important to ensure that the efforts of the State to develop mineral deposits should not provide the owners of the deposits with an opportunity for demanding for their interests prices which would make the exploitation <Col N="2094" /> and development of these deposits utterly uneconomic.  I need scarcely say, however, that there is no desire on the part of the Government to confiscate private property and the Bill, as I have already indicated, provides in Part VII that compensation shall in all cases be paid to the dispossessed owners for any deposits acquired under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to the Seanad if I try to summarise briefly the various orders and licences for the issue of which provision is made by the Bill. These various orders and licences may be classified into four main groups. First of all, are the orders by which the Minister will be empowered to acquire mineral deposits and to acquire the facilities needed for their development. The orders in this group are (1) Minerals Acquisition Orders, such as would be issued under Section 14 of the Bill, which would vest in the State mineral deposits which are not being efficiently developed.  In the same group are what are known as Mining Facilities Acquisition Orders, to be issued under Section 19, which would enable any land or other ancillary right needed for the convenient exploitation of minerals acquired by the State to be likewise acquired.</P>
    <P>The second group of orders would authorise prospectors and other private persons to acquire rights against third parties.  In this group would come the Prospecting Licence issuable under Section 7 to authorise any person to prospect for minerals whether owned by the State or by private persons.  In this group would come also the Unworked Minerals Licence issuable under Section 38.  This would authorise any person to work minerals which are in private ownership.  It is equivalent to the right called a &ldquo;Mining Right&rdquo; in the Act of 1931.  In this group there is also the Ancillary Rights Licence, to be issued under Section 40, which would authorise a person who has authority to work mineral deposits to acquire the ancillary rights necessary to enable him to work these deposits effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> In the third group are the orders which authorise the Minister to dispose of mineral deposits or of mining rights which are or, under the Act, may become vested in him.  The principal orders in this group are three in number&mdash;(1) the State Acquired Minerals Licence, issuable under Section 22, which authorises any person to work minerals acquired by the Minister under a Minerals Acquisition Order; (2) the State Mining Lease, provided for by Section 26, which would demise by way of lease any minerals vested in the State; (3) the State Mining Permission, which would enable the person who gets such a permission to remove from State-owned mineral deposits trifling quantities of such deposits for inspection or examination or in certain circumstances, for use.</P>
    <P>In the fourth group are the orders which would empower the Minister to secure that mining operations should not be carried out in such a way as to endanger other property.  The only order in this group is the Preservation of Support Order, issuable under Section 42.  That order prohibits mining operations which might in any way interfere with, or endanger, the stability of buildings or other structures on the surface of the ground.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the general purposes behind this Bill come under the following heads&mdash;(1) it seeks to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to acquire compulsorily minerals in private ownership which are not being worked effectively or efficiently; (2) it seeks to authorise the Minister to work mineral deposits as a State enterprise; (3) it introduces certain amendments to the existing mines and minerals code, which amendments I have summarised for the information of the House.  These, as I have said, are the essential purposes and main provisions of the Bill which has been accepted by the Dáil.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, I propose to introduce, following the discussion which took place in the other House, four amendments.  These amendments will affect Sections 17, 59, 64 and 67 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to hinder the passing of the Second Reading of this Bill, although it is the type of Bill that I thoroughly dislike.  I think it was the 1931 Act to which the Minister referred.  It was made necessary by an Article in the Constitution in its original form, Article 11, which had the effect of seriously handicapping any development of mineral working in this country.  I did not like the Act.  At a later stage I was a member of a committee looking into a particular mining matter and I was quite shocked at the way that Act worked out.  It seemed that people could walk on other people's property and hunt around to see if there were any minerals there and, if they could make a case, they could negotiate in London, let us say, in order to sell something, in which they had no rights whatever, at a high price.  I objected to that.</P>
      <P>When the Minister talks about the State having power, whenever it thinks that a private owner does not work minerals efficiently, to intervene, the assumption is, and it is very much in our legislation now, that nobody in this country is capable of being even nearly as efficient as the State.  I object very much to State interference of this type.  I would rather people owned things or did not own them.  The assumption is that nobody knows anything except the State.  A farmer thinks he owns his own farm, but some person comes along and goes prospecting there in order to see if it is possible to get minerals and the State can dictate to the farmer as to what is going to be done with his land.  The Minister has referred to a man losing his life.  That is the sort of thing that can be dealt with by powers dealing with dangerous structures.  Nobody has the right to carry out mining development under conditions dangerous to people and nobody should have the right to interfere with his neighbour's property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the general principle of the Bill.  There seems to be more and more of State interference in this country.  We have here an example of a general movement towards socialism; there is this general assertion that the State rights are so absolute and <Col N="2097" /> human rights have no real definition at all.  I understand we are dealing only with the Second Reading and that there will be certain amendments introduced by the Government before the Committee Stage is reached.  It may be that we may want to propose certain amendments too.  I could not miss this opportunity of getting up to point out that nearly every enactment brought in by the Government tends to suggest that the people of this country are not able to live their own lives and manage their own affairs, and we have got to have the Government intervening in the management of our affairs down to almost every minor detail.</P>
    <P>I have always understood, in the case of land annuitants, that a reservation was made in relation to mineral rights. When the land annuities sinking fund has been completed I should like to feel that every farmer would know he really owned his land and that you would not have the Government saying it thought there might be minerals there and he was not capable of working them efficiently.  The main point is that the Government, if it does not think a private owner is working the minerals efficiently, is to have the power to say that it will take over his property, thereby assuming that everything the Government does is done efficiently and everything the private owner does is inefficient.  That is one of the outstanding points in a huge Bill containing about 80 clauses.</P>
    <P>People love to believe that there are all sorts of concealed wealth under the surface of the soil in this country.  It is always politically useful to come along suddenly and say that the Government is bringing in a Bill to develop&mdash;I suggest imaginary&mdash;mineral deposits in our soil.  I remember a few years ago at Slieveanierin, in County Leitrim, an examination was carried out in connection with a proposed iron works.  Some thousands of pounds were spent, but I do not think anything of a remunerative nature came out of it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a Bill like this will tend to have the effect of inducing <Col N="2098" /> some people to put pressure on the Government and, if there is any mining work to be carried on in the country, the Government will either directly or indirectly be the employers of the miners.  There will be a tendency to have that type of pressure put upon the Government.  It may be that a local patriotism will urge some people to think that there is gold or iron in their districts and they will be encouraged to put pressure on the Government to get minerals taken out of the soil for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>We are moving in the direction of an extension of Government powers and the assumption that nobody is capable of doing anything except the Government and Government Departments. The whole movement of Socialism is a movement tending towards the assumption that the people are inferior.  This, I suggest, is a movement to make the people inferior.  It would not matter a great deal, as far as one can judge the mineral resources of our country, if the exploitation of our mineral resources was delayed a few years.  I would much rather see ordinary private ownership operating rather than have the State controlling everything, claiming rights over property that men believed belonged to them, claiming the right to arbitrate and to decide what compensation should be paid to those men and directly or indirectly making itself the exploiter and the employer in connection with any mineral works that may be operated in this country.</P>
    <P>I would be much more concerned if I felt that the Government was prepared to take really serious action and that there were a great number of mineral resources to be operated, but I have heard so many promising stories of what this country contained, and then found that nothing came of them, that I do not think this legislation will make a great deal of difference.  As regards the 1931 Act, Article 11 of the original Constitution practically asserted State ownership in such a way as to prevent any possibility of exploitation.  So far as I remember the 1931 Act, it was to release that strangling State control and, in the light of the Article of the Constitution, it could only have done <Col N="2099" /> that to a certain extent.  I would rather see the removal of State influence from this sphere and leave to the ordinary citizens the right to look after themselves rather than to be wet-nursed by the State.  It would seem that the curve is going in the opposite direction and this is tending to assert socialist doctrines, that things can be done only by one agency, and that is the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that there is no question that the Second Reading should be passed.  I understand that some time will elapse between this and the Committee Stage.  Most of the matters that I should like to raise are matters which can be much better raised when we come to discuss the details of the Bill. There is one matter upon which I can congratulate the Minister and that is the form in which this Bill has been introduced. I hope it is a precedent that will be followed by other Ministers. When a large number of amendments are required to an existing Act and when a completely new Bill has to be brought in, it means that you can discuss it on the basis that it is to be the law and you can accept it as such without having to look back on other matters.  It means that when this measure is passed you will have everything in the one Act, and that is a highly desirable principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the Minister's speech in the Dáil, and not too closely comparing the two measures, the main difference seems to be an extension of the powers of the State in order to enable it to develop minerals; the other matters are relatively unimportant. One thing which I should like to have explained further is why it is necessary to deal with that by means of a general power.  I can understand that the Minister might want the acceptance of the principle that that might be done under certain circumstances, but if the State is to develop a mineral it should be dealt with in the same way as electricity or industrial alcohol or various other matters by bringing forward proposals, <Col N="2100" /> carrying them through the Oireachtas on their merits and dealing with the whole thing as a matter of State development.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view of Senator Fitzgerald, though I am not prepared to go quite as far as he did.  I think there may be circumstances in which there is no likelihood whatever of the development of a mineral that might be desirable, but what I cannot see is why that should be given as a sort of general power rather than as something that should be brought forward and debated on its merits, having regard to the possibility of any private enterprise taking it up, and having regard to all the circumstances.  It is on that that I have most doubt with regard to the general change in the Bill.  There seem to be almost only two types of people in this country: those who believe that we have enormous wealth in soil&mdash;we heard a good deal from a great many of them in the form of letters at the time that the first Constitution Committee was sitting, so much so, indeed, that I think we made the blunder of inserting Article 11 and on that I am quite prepared to agree with Senator Fitzgerald&mdash;and the others, who are so sceptical, that they do not believe there is anything in all this talk about mineral wealth.  I think that both are probably wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree more with the point of view of Senator Douglas than with that of Senator Fitzgerald. If left to private enterprise alone, and if left especially to the enterprise or initiative of the holder of a farm, I am afraid we shall have to wait a very long time for anything in the nature of mineral development in the country.  I am one of those people who have very little faith in the mineral wealth of this country.  I think that, from the mineral point of view, we are really a very poor country, and that because of that we need not bother ourselves a lot about the grievances that may arise as a result of any attempt to work the mineral wealth we have. Outside the County Wicklow, and perhaps one or two small coal bearing <Col N="2101" /> areas, the mineral wealth in this country is really very, very small.  If, however, any development is to take place, I am afraid that the power to do that will have to be left with the State. Take the case of the individual farmer. If he were to discover some mineral on his land, and were to pursue the working of it, he would not, I am afraid, have gone very far until he had approached the bounds of his neighbour. He would then find himself involved in difficulties with the neighbouring farmers.  If, on the other hand, the State entrusted to some body the power to work that mineral it is fairly safe to assume that it would give that body powers to enable it to override such difficulties as might arise.  In my opinion, if the working of the mineral were to be left to the initiative of the individual farmer the position would be that he would find it utterly impossible to do that.  Therefore, I do not think we need worry ourselves unduly over that aspect of the matter. Whether rightly or wrongly, I believe that the mineral wealth of this country is infinitesimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points that I desire to bring to the Minister's notice before the Committee Stage of the Bill is taken.  In Section 15 it is provided that the Minister may make a compulsory acquisition order, without notice to anybody, and that the only notice given of such order having been made is publication of the fact in the <i>Gazette</i> and newspapers. No provision whatever is made for the giving of notice of the order direct to owners or occupiers who are left to the chance of seeing the notice in these publications.  The receipt of specific notice appears to be a matter of vital importance to the parties interested, having regard to the provisions of Section 17 which provides for a period of two months only, and the possible extension of 12 months after the date of the order for application by parties interested.  It would appear to be more than possible, indeed probable, that owners, occupiers, or other parties interested may have no knowledge whatever of the order, and that the first they would <Col N="2102" /> know about it would be the actual entry for working.  I should like to know if the Minister would consider the insertion of provisions for giving due notice of the order to owners and occupiers.  I think that is reasonable. I am not aware of any case&mdash;no doubt there are some&mdash;where the owner has to be satisfied merely with the notice published in the <i>Gazette</i> or newspapers. I think that in all cases where the Land Commission act compulsorily they give direct notice to the person whom they believe to be the occupier.</P>
      <P>With regard to the new provisions in this Bill introducing compulsory acquisition, I feel that there should be some protection afforded against the acquisition of mineral rights to the destruction of amenity, recreational or scenic values.  Mineral rights may mean a great deal.  They may mean that there are very valuable minerals in the land, but they may also mean minerals of very doubtful value indeed.  We have got in this country a certain amount of low grade coal which we periodically hear of speculators taking an interest in, but which never comes to fruition, largely, I imagine, because the development of the coal would not be an economic proposition.  I think it would be very undesirable for the State to acquire compulsorily, without affording any protection whatever to the owner, mineral rights of doubtful value, especially in places which might be of historic interest or which might have amenity value.  Would it not be possible to allow an appeal from the Minister's order to some tribunal which would try to reconcile those conflicting interests?  I would ask the Minister whether he would not consider giving protection of that kind, not so much perhaps in the interests of the individual but of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that the Government are taking power to acquire and to work minerals themselves.  I hope that is a power the Government will be slow to exercise, because I cannot imagine any body more unsuited to make a success of a speculative enterprise, such as mineral development, than a Government Department.  Development of <Col N="2103" /> that kind requires a large amount of capital, a good deal of patience, big resources, and a flexibility of operation which you generally do not find in Government Departments.  I trust that the Government will go very cautiously before proceeding to take steps to work directly any minerals in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he anticipates that, as a result of the passing of this Bill, there is going to be greatly accelerated development activity in the case of the minerals that we have in this country? Has he evidence that we have areas in the country where minerals lie that have not been exploited, areas in which no attempt has so far been made to work minerals because, unless there is evidence that we are going to do a great deal more in the matter of mineral development than we have done up to the present, I doubt very much whether the Minister is justified in asking for some of the powers set out in this Bill?  I am sure every sensible individual will agree that we ought to make every effort to exploit effectively and reasonably efficiently whatever mineral wealth we have got, either on the top of the soil or some distance under it.  I think that, no matter what may be said to the contrary, the first six or nine inches of the soil represent and will always remain the greatest wealth that our people possess, but if further down in the bowels of the earth there are other things the development of which might go to make life more complete, and if these are workable, then I think that we ought to try to get all we can of them to the surface.  We have this situation to consider: if it be known that minerals lie in certain areas and that private enterprise will take no part in exploiting them, then I suppose the community must somehow, through some organisation, try to have something done with regard to their development.  I agree with some of the previous speakers in that I do not think a State Department is the best medium to entrust that development to.  I would much prefer to see some <Col N="2104" /> other form of organisation set up to exploit such resources as we have got.</P>
      <P>There are obvious reasons why people in this country, and I think people outside the country too, are not enthusiastic about State Departments running businesses like these and, so to speak, bossing all round them.  We could point already to the ineffectiveness of Government enterprise in one or two lines of activity here.  We have lost a considerable amount of money on our bogs.  I do not say that other people did not lose money there before, but the State has engaged in a number of other activities too that are not proving sources of any great wealth.  I refer particularly to its endeavours in regard to industrial alcohol and the capital sunk in them&mdash;not a very large sum, indeed, but we have not a great deal of money to throw away in this country and we have many ways of using money in this country, if we can get it, more advantageously than on enterprises such as these.  For that reason, people are sceptical as to the capacity of the State to do these things as efficiently as private individuals or other bodies could do them and people are not anxious to give the State these extraordinary powers. What Senator Keane has referred to is an example of extraordinary powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst feature of the matter is this.  It may be all right if a group of individuals are given a lease to exploit my farm.  They will not attempt it, of course, because there is nothing in it except what is contained on the first six inches of the surface and people who seek leases of this kind will not exploit that part of the farm.  If, however, these people were given a lease they would behave reasonably and sensibly. I am much more fearful of the servants of the State, backed with the authority of the State, who will come down to my farm or to the farms of other people.  In that case there will be a complete disregard, I am afraid, of the rights of the owner.  They will break down your fences and open your gates leading into your fields of corn. They will come along, as some employees of the Electricity Supply <Col N="2105" /> Board did in the case of my farm, and tell me that they are going to cut certain trees and toss them into my meadow.  Fortunately, in my case I was able to prevent their doing so until after the following harvest but I do sympathise with the ordinary John Farmer who might be intimidated into permitting them to fell trees into his meadow and, as a result, have his machines smashed later in the year. That sort of thing is inherent in a measure of this kind.  Because of that we are doubtful whether these powers are going to be exercised as fruitfully, from the point of view of the citizens of the State, as they would be if the Government could manage to have them operated in another manner.</P>
    <P>While saying that and while seeing these difficulties, on the other hand I confess that we should do our best to exploit whatever resources we have in this country worth exploitation.  We can do that, however, in a sensible way.  We should not sink a great deal of money, money which we find it very difficult to get and which might be more fruitfully employed, in a kind of spectacular endeavour that only damnifies real enterprise and takes a great deal of heart out of the people. When we set out to exploit anything, with the authority of the State behind us, we ought to make the servants of the State appreciate the fact that the men on whose lands they enter are the owners, or at least, believe that they are the owners, of these lands and that in their dealings with them, in the matter of acquiring their farms, entering upon them for the purpose of making preliminary examinations or in the matter of dealing with them finally in making awards of compensation, they ought to treat them in the kind of way that a superior authority should treat a lower or weaker authority.  If the State were to act like that, even if the State failed in its endeavour, I think the State would come out of its efforts with credit and with that enhanced reputation which we have not been able to acquire for the State up to the present in this kind of activity.  I am not approaching this question in a critical manner but in the manner that any man down the <Col N="2106" /> country has to approach a problem like this.  If the State is going to do this work in the right way, it is no harm for the people at the head of affairs to know how the people at the foot approach a problem of this kind.</P>

      <P>Possibly I have no right to speak on this subject because I am not an expert on mining matters, but I have some interest in Irish mineral deposits and I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that they are worth working.  I should like to underline some of the remarks made by previous Senators, particularly the appeal made by Senator Sir John Keane, that, in working these deposits, we should have some regard for existing values and amenities.  Senator Sir John Keane, however, did not mention one value on which I think special emphasis should be laid, that is, the sporting values of a region where there are large deposits.  Some of us can remember how serious damage was done to a splendid fishing river in County Wicklow in recent years by the careless working of the copper deposits.  The third part of the Bill disquiets me considerably, that is, the part dealing with the compulsory acquisition of mineral rights by the Government and the working of them by the State itself or by private individuals under licence from the State.  I am sure the Minister knows much better than I do the initial cost involved in acquiring the plant requisite to work properly and economically certain of these deposits. That is a very serious matter and may involve the State in considerable initial expense which the taxpayer must meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point which I mentioned causes me perhaps more disquiet, namely, the granting of licences to individuals. I hope the Department will be very careful in giving such licences and will ensure that the people who obtain them are competent and have sufficient capital to work the deposits properly.  Otherwise, they may seriously damage some of our mineral resources.  I have particularly in mind the case of a large mineral deposit in the West of Ireland which is in the possession <Col N="2107" /> of a corporation who were very anxious to work it.  Were it not for the present condition of Europe, they would have got the capital necessary to start work.  The war, however, has put a stop to that as to many other economic adventures.  A small body, which I do not believe has the necessary capital, wanted to take over the rights from this corporation at an absurdly low price.  I hope the Minister will look very carefully into these matters and that if a transfer does take place it will be a case of a willing vendor and a willing purchaser.  As regards other features of the Bill, I think that payment by royalty has got some drawbacks.  How can you keep a check on royalties?  The vendor will have to feel confident that he is not being &ldquo;done.&rdquo;  Will Government inspectors be appointed to see how much is being taken from the mines?  I do not want to find fault with the Bill, which I think is inherently good, but I should like some assurance that the third part of the Bill will be worked with due regard to the rights of owners.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his explanatory circular, and also in the statement which he made to-day, points out the difficulties arising under the 1931 Act owing to the interpretation placed on the clauses of the Act which purport to define what was held by the land owner and what was retained by the Land Commission.  The Act says that stone, gravel, sand or clay were items which belonged to the tenant purchaser and that the Land Commission would then define, on appeal, what other deposits or minerals were reserved to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in passing this Act, the Legislature is asked to define more or less finally what is reserved and what is not reserved, and it seems to me that the Schedule to the Bill is one of the most important parts of the Bill so far as these definitions are concerned.  As an ordinary individual I must admit that I know nothing as to what is the meaning of half the items mentioned in the Schedule, and I hold that we, as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, <Col N="2108" /> should be in a position to know what we are doing.  The first item mentioned in the Schedule is alum, or alum shales.  I believe there are several kinds of alums, but I do not know what is meant by alum shales.  The next word is &ldquo;anhydrite&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  Then we have the word &ldquo;apatite&rdquo;.  I know what appetite means but I do not know what the other word means.  Going along through the list we find mention of several types of clay.  You have ball clay, China clay, fireclay and refractory clays.  These are now to be State controlled or, by this enactment, they will become the property of the tenant and not the protery of the tenant purchaser.  Nevertheless, they are clays.  Marble also is one of the minerals listed there, and later on you have mention of serpentinous marble, whatever that means.  Then you have limestone or dolomite and dolomitic limestone.  I do not know whether that is just ordinary limestone or a definite type of limestone, but at any rate it is a stone.  Besides clay and stone we have even sand listed here.  There is mention of silica sand, which, I presume is also to become State controlled. Probably, some of the other materials mentioned in the Schedule would be of the nature of a gravel, and accordingly you have stone, gravel, sand and clay, apparently, being taken over.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that is the really serious part of the Bill and I think the House should understand really what it is doing in passing this Bill.  There are several stones besides marble and limestone mentioned.  Chalk is mentioned and I suppose calcite is a type of limestone.  So that practically all these stones under the soil are taken over.  Curiously, I do not see any mention of granite, Wicklow granite, but mica is mentioned and so I take it that we would have to take that out of the granite.  This is a matter of which I think we should have full knowledge as to the extent to which this thing goes exactly and what is meant by the so-called minerals.  I do not know whether all clays are minerals, but I should like to know to what extent <Col N="2109" /> the enactment of this Bill is going to take from the land owner his right to his possessions</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill, Sir, notwithstanding what has been said against it by various speakers, and I must say that I find it very hard to understand the type of opposition the Bill has met with here to-day.  If this discussion had taken place a year ago or even six months ago I could understand it, but with a war raging around our coasts and with the obvious possibility of a complete blockade of this country I cannot see how anybody could conscientiously stand up and try to prevent, as apparently they have been trying to prevent, the development of our various mineral deposits in this country.  If there were no other reason except one, I would willingly support this Bill, and that reason is that I believe that as a result of this measure the coal deposits of Slieveardagh in the County Tipperary will be released. I think the Bill would supply a long-felt want if it were to do nothing else but that.  I am sure that we have similar deposits of coal and other minerals all over the country&mdash;I know that we have&mdash;and it is about time that we got over any little technicalities which may have been holding up the development of such deposits.  I have been hammering at this Slieveardagh proposition for a number of years, and I have gone to various Ministers and, one after another, they always told me that, for one reason or another, the thing could not be done, with the result that the coal has lain there and the people of the district have been idle and have had to rely on unemployment assistance and the dole for a number of years.  I believe that as a result of this measure there will be an outlet for that particular proposition and, as I said at the beginning, if it were for no other reason than that I would gladly support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, if this discussion took place a year ago it would be easy to understand certain people opposing the measure, but at the present time the question of coal is daily becoming of more importance, not only <Col N="2110" /> for its use in heating houses, cooking and so on, but from the point of view of our whole organisation which depends on our coal and peat deposits. We have had a speech from Senator Baxter in which he says that the first six or nine inches of the soil are the most important and that, when all is said and done, they are our greatest source of wealth.  That may be so; there may be a good deal in that, but I am sure the Senator will agree with me that our six or nine inches of soil would be very little good to us if we were absolutely confined to them and had no coal or other deposits which are necessary to maintain the industries and the very existence of this country.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions were also made to the effect that this Bill was being introduced to enable the State to monopolise the whole development of minerals in this country.  My reading of the Bill and of the explanatory note attached to it would not convey any such idea to me.  In fact, I am quite satisfied that the whole idea behind the Bill is to enable the Government, in cases where certain mineral deposits are not being developed by private enterprise or not being properly worked by private enterprise, to interfere themselves by way of State or semi-State Departments.  In fact, I refuse to believe that the policy of either this Government or the previous Government was to monopolise the industries of the country.  I believe that it was not their policy even to set up the industries that have been mentioned here as State concerns if it were possible to get them developed by private enterprise.  I think it is ridiculous, at this stage in any case, for us to start to criticise what has been done.  Certain experiments have been tried; many of these experiments have been successful and some of them have not been successful, but if an attempt had not been made to develop certain industries and try out these experiments we would be in a very different position from that in which we are to-day.  I believe that it was only as a result of the risks, if you like to call them risks, which were taken that we are in a position to-day <Col N="2111" /> probably unique, and, in fact, definitely unique in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has taken advantage of the debate to have a crack at the peat development industry, and while I do not propose to deal with the matter for obvious reasons&mdash;I am sure the Minister will deal with it in his reply&mdash; I should like to tell the Senator that before entering on such a discussion, he should first make himself conversant with the facts.  If he were conversant with the facts, he would know that the briquette factory at Lullymore which failed was not, in reality, a State enterprise, but one of the things which he apparently lauds here to-day, a matter of private enterprise.  Unfortunately, it did not succeed, but I have not lost hope that it may yet succeed under different management.  I should like to tell Senator Baxter and anybody else who may think as he thinks, or who may believe what he says, that the money put into peat development was not lost, and I believe will not be lost, but that, instead, the country will be very much the better and very much the richer for the development which has been carried out up to the present.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is probably the second greatest industry we have in the country&mdash;second, and only second, to agriculture&mdash;and I believe it would be criminal for this or any other Government in existing circumstances not alone not to carry on the industry, but not to increase the production of turf in every possible way.  I believe the same applies to coal, copper, aluminium and the various other deposits we have in the country, and more than ever because of the war situation.  Even before the war, I should say that it would be the duty of the Government, and a very desirable thing on the part of this or any other Government, to make provision for the development of the various minerals available, if the development were not being carried out by private enterprise. I am sure that the Minister will explain that the Government are in no way jealous of private enterprise and that, in fact, they would very much prefer private enterprise to do the job; <Col N="2112" /> but if private enterprise does not step in to do the job, the Government has a responsibility to the people which it cannot and must not shirk and more particularly at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the statements made in connection with the provision of compensation, compensation is very definitely provided for in the Bill and the explanatory note to the Bill says that compensation shall be paid to the dispossessed owners and the compensation will, in default of agreement, be fixed by the mining board.  It also sets out that the compensation which the board is empowered to award is limited to compensation by way of royalty on the quantity of minerals raised from deposits which are acquired.  Similarly, provision is made in connection with prospecting, so that any damage done on the surface will be paid for and paid for reasonably. I am quite sure, that if it were suggested that somebody be paid an enormous sum for a little damage done, such as that caused by running a two-ton or three-ton truck across a field, Senator Baxter would be the first to criticise the Government for making such a payment.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter also painted pictures of Government officials going around the country knocking trees down on top of farm machinery and running rough-shod through crops of wheat and oats, and through meadows.  I know quite well that Senator Baxter has too much common sense to believe anything like that himself and I also know that the people who read his speech, or who heard it, have enough common sense not to believe that Government officials are different from anybody else.  It is only just an accident that Senator Baxter was not a Government official himself, and even if he were, I should say that he would not do a thing like that.  It is a very popular thing to attack Government officials and civil servants, but I think it ridiculous to take advantage of a debate of this kind for that purpose.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald suggested that this Bill, perhaps, had its origin in the fact that a number of people believe that under our soil are all sorts of mineral riches.  In view of the manner in which that widely-held belief has been exploited by a number of unscrupulous persons in the past, I should like to say that no investigation that I have had occasion to study supports the view <Col N="2114" /> upon which that belief is based, and that it is perhaps because of that fact that I consider this Bill to be even more essential than it might be if the popular belief were, indeed, a correct belief.  It is because our mineral resources are scanty that we have to take special steps to ensure that they will be carefully conserved and skilfully worked, and, also, in view of the fact that there is need for us to provide the utmost employment for our people, to ensure that, if they are worth working, they will be worked.  It is upon that basis that this Bill proposes to proceed and not with the idea of socialising this State, socialising our industry or our people.  If private enterprise will go in and do what the Government thinks ought to be done in regard to our mineral resources, there will be nobody more pleased than the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and certainly I am sure that, in that regard, I am speaking for all of my colleagues.  It is only when private enterprise has failed and, in my view, has conclusively failed, that we should seek to utilise the powers which it is proposed to confer upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked why it is necessary to take the general powers sought for.  There are a number of reasons, the first of them being that, when you propose to acquire a mineral deposit, the general characteristics of the problem may be taken to be the same.  It usually resolves itself into a question of the value of the deposit and the compensation to be paid for it and for those ancillary rights which are essential to the development of the deposit.  If we were, in regard to every particular mineral deposit in this country which might be workable, to bring in a special Act of the Oireachtas and get the Oireachtas first of all to agree as to the manner in which the value should be assessed, the form in which the compensation should be paid and the ancillary rights which were essential for the proper working of the deposit, I think the Oireachtas would have very little time to devote to the <Col N="2115" /> remaining concerns of this nation. Accordingly, in the Bill we are laying down the general framework within which this question of compensation and ancillary rights shall be settled. When we consider it necessary, on the basis of rights thus acquired, to proceed to exploit any particular proposition, a specific proposal will be submitted to the House and the House will then have an opportunity to express its opinion as to whether the proposition submitted to it is a worth while one or not, and we hope that it will be able to do that expeditiously without, as I have said, having to go over and repeat, in regard to the general basis of all propositions, the procedure to which this Bill is being subjected to-day.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane, referring to Section 15 of the Bill, mentioned the fact that no notice appeared to be given to the owner of the minerals.  I am not certain that the Senator's point is not fully covered by Sections 16, 17 and 20 and, accordingly, I shall look into it; but there is this difficulty with regard to the point he has raised. The owner of the minerals is seldom the owner of the surface.  In this country, I suppose in the generality of cases the owner of the minerals would be the Land Commission, and I think it could be assumed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not going to do violence to any rights which his colleague the Minister for Lands may have in regard to mineral resources.  Apart from that fact, there is also the fact that where the ownership of the minerals is in other hands than those of the Land Commission, it may be very difficult to ascertain the true owner.  We can only proceed then to deal in the first instance with the land and in the meantime the owner of the minerals will have due notice, as I said under Section 16, when it is proposed to acquire his rights in regard to the minerals, and I think he will have ample time to make his case to the Government in regard to that matter. However, as I have said, I shall look into the matter again, as we have no desire to do any injustice to any private <Col N="2116" /> rights that there may be in this country in relation to the mineral deposits thereof.  I shall also look into the other point which Senator Sir John Keane raised and if he would suggest an amendment for my consideration I will very carefully consider it and see whether I cannot do something to meet it.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked me whether, as a result of this Bill, there will be a greatly accelerated development of our mineral resources.  Frankly, that is something that I do not know.  It will depend upon whether the circumstances for such development continue to be favourable.  At the moment, in relation to a number of our deposits, they do happen to be favourable.  If those deposits can be developed economically, taking a reasonably long view, they should be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not even some of those the development and exploitation of which would be most essential to the farmers at the present time.  That is because the development has been left in the hands of private enterprise which, in my view, has lamentably fallen down on the job.  It was rather unfortunate that the Senator should have suggested that the development of the mineral resources of this country under the auspices of the Government would be likely to be unsuccessful and, in that connection, to have cited the amount of money which was being spent in endeavouring to exploit the peat resources of the State because, as Senator Quirke has indicated, while it is true that a very considerable sum of money was lost in connection with one peat project, that peat project was entirely in the hands of private enterprise, the management and control of it and every item of its administration.  Because we felt that it was important from the point of view of the general economy to see what possible use could be made of our extensive peat deposits we rather liberally financed that undertaking. As regards the activities which are being carried out more directly under <Col N="2117" /> Government auspices, I should like to say that they have proven their worth in this particular year, that though considerable sums of money have been invested in them and though the development of the peat resources presents very many difficult engineering and other problems, I do think that they are now beginning to show results which will justify the moneys which have been invested in them.  I say beginning to show results, and I do not want to put it any more optimistically than that.  It may happen that we may get a setback because we, in common, I think, with most other countries in Europe, have a very great deal to learn about the technique of peat development.  We have learned a great deal during the years which members of the Turf Development Board have devoted to this problem and, as I have said, in this year, I think all their past activities are being justified. If the existing situation in regard to fuel continues and if we have average climatic conditions in this country and can maintain present working conditions, I think the progress which the Turf Development Board will make will considerably surprise those who have been critics of its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Alton suggested that he was disquieted at the prospect of compulsory acquisition of mineral rights by the State.  Naturally, I suppose, when a power so absolute as the State is given further powers over the properties of individuals most ordinary private persons in the community might feel some disquietude, but at the same time that disquietude should be tempered by the fact that we have in this country a responsible Government, a Government which is responsible to the two Houses of the Oireachtas and that if at any time the powers conferred by this Bill were to be exercised in an arbitrary or unjust manner the Minister responsible for the exercise of these powers in that way can be called publicly to account. The Senator also professed to be disquieted at the fact that prospecting licences would be given to private individuals who might be incapable of properly utilising them, and I think that that also was in the mind of Senator <Col N="2118" /> Fitzgerald when he referred to the manner in which such licences had sometimes been granted.  In that connection I should like to refer the House to Section 23, sub-section (1), paragraph (e) of the Bill, where it is provided that in connection with applications for licences in respect of State acquired minerals, the Minister may make&mdash;and in this context &ldquo;may make,&rdquo; I think, is mandatory&mdash;regulations &ldquo;requiring every applicant for a State acquired minerals licence to furnish evidence as to his character, financial standing, and technical qualifications and to give security for the due fulfilment of his obligations under such licence, and prescribing the nature of such evidence and of such security respectively.&rdquo;  I think that the making of proper regulations controlling the issue of licences in respect of State acquired minerals in accordance with the terms of this paragraph will ensure that the licences will only be given to people who can properly use them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made also by Senator Alton that it was difficult to keep a check on royalty payments, I think perhaps the Senator would be reassured there if I point out that in most cases, I think, it will be the Government which will be responsible for the royalty, and I think he can at any rate rid himself of any uneasiness he may have as to the honesty of the Government in matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan described the Schedule which is attached to the Bill as one of the most important portions of the Bill, and he then went on to criticise us somewhat severely because we had not circulated with the Schedule a glossary of the terms which appear therein.  I do not know exactly to what extent such a glossary would have been helpful to Senator O'Donovan or to any other Senator who wished to discuss this Bill learnedly upon this stage, but I think that before proceeding to criticise the Minister for his failure in this matter, the Senator might have ascertained whether the information was or was not available for him in the Library or whether it could be obtained either upon inquiry from my Department or elsewhere.  I think that in relation to <Col N="2119" /> this Bill I have given the House somewhat greater help than is usual and, after all, it is no part of the Government's responsibility to equip any particular Senator with the knowledge and information which he deems to be necessary in order to enable him to discharge properly and fully the obligations which his membership of this House imposes upon him.  While in view of what has been said by the Senator I will circulate fuller definitions of the terms, I think that we will have to feel that the Government has one responsibility and the members of the House have another, and that at least when we do try to be helpful to the House we should not be subjected to carping criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will confer on sanitary authorities a simpler and more expeditious procedure for the acquisition of derelict sites.  The Bill applies to land which is unoccupied or unused, and on which there are buildings which are ruinous, or in disrepair, or on which for two years there have been no buildings, and which is by reason of its condition injurious to health or amenities.</P>
      <P>This definition of land for the purpose of the Bill takes in all the more objectionable ruins, dumping grounds, and waste plots which are to be found in many towns and villages.  It is proposed that the sanitary authority should acquire such sites as nothing short of acquisition will enable a derelict site to be dealt with effectively and prevent its reversion to its former state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill enables a preliminary order to be served on the owner or occupier of a derelict site stating that the sanitary authority will not proceed with the acquisition of the site if its ruinous and objectionable character is removed within 28 days.  Acquisition will not, therefore, take effect unless the owner or occupier fails to deal with the matter.  This procedure will enable any owner who wishes to clear up the site to the satisfaction of the local authority to retain it in his own possession. Failing action by the owner or occupier of the site, or an appeal by him being rejected by the District <Col N="2121" /> Justice, the local authority may proceed to vest the land in themselves.</P>
    <P>Acquisition will enable the sanitary authority to enter on the land, clear and level the site and apply it to any purpose for which they have statutory powers.  It may in suitable cases be used as a building site or if it is a dump or waste plot it may be found desirable to convert it into a playground or have it suitably planted.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides that compensation will be payable to any person having an estate or interest in the land so vested, but a claim to compensation must be made within three months from the making of the vesting order.  The Bill will give very necessary powers to local authorities to clear derelict sites and ruined buildings in towns and villages throughout the country.  The present statutory powers are somewhat restricted as there would have to be an element of danger arising to the public in the case of a derelict building before a local authority could act.</P>

    <P>I am glad that this Bill has come before the Seanad, and any remarks I make on it will largely apply to the City of Dublin.  As most Senators are aware there are a number of derelict sites in the city which lend to it an appearance of decay.  I need only point to that ugly gaping wound at the head of O'Connell Street opposite the monument to a great national leader, Parnell.  At the right hand corner of Parnell Street there is a ruin which lends an appearance of decay to one of our principal streets. In Fleet Street, at the rere of the Bank of Ireland, there are also some houses which have been closed for a number of years.  That means a loss to the revenue of the city, because when they are idle such buildings do not contribute anything to the rates.  The Dublin Corporation referred to this question on various occasions and at a meeting held on 4th December, 1939, the city manager was requested in a resolution to prepare a return of <Col N="2122" /> derelict sites within the city boundary, with a view to their acquisition under the Derelict Sites Order, and in that way to remove the unsightly appearance of decay that their existence gave to the city.  It is perfectly obvious that there is a necessity to expedite the acquisition of such sites.  There is certain legislation in existence under which municipal councils could proceed, but I understand that such sites have to be three years derelict before action could be taken.</P>
    <P>Apart from the loss of revenue involved when sites are lying derelict there is an inducement to certain people to cause destruction.  Immediately that happens the owners of derelict property become very active and go before the courts to demand compensation.  Everybody who reads the daily Press knows that Dublin Corporation has had to pay compensation for the destruction of such property. In the case of some buildings that I know, the owner of which resides in London, I wrote to him, in the interests of the ratepayers to look after his property. When it was damaged the owner had no reluctance about proceeding to the courts to seek compensation. While my remarks are applicable largely to the City of Dublin everyone who goes through the country and sees the appearance of some of our towns and villages realises the necessity for clearing away derelict sites.  I hope this Bill will not meet with any opposition. I do not think that anybody can have any grievance in view of the fact that an owner who feels aggrieved can go to the courts with his case.  I am glad that this Bill has been introduced and I hope it will receive general support and thus end many of the eyesores that are to be seen throughout the city and the country.  Visitors coming to the capital would not be impressed with the appearance of that ugly derelict building at the head of O'Connell Street.</P>

      <P>I am interested in this Bill which proposes to deal with derelict sites.  I know a town in which there are many derelict buildings, but it would cost a considerable amount of money to clear them.  They may not <Col N="2123" /> have any site value.  It would be unjust that local authorities should be saddled with the expense of clearing derelict buildings where there is no site value. The buildings I have in mind are very ugly and, as Senator Healy has said, are damaging to the general appearance of the town.  But I do know from experience that the cost of removing these buildings is very considerable when the site is of no value to those who remove them.  I should like to know if there is any provision in the Bill to meet such a case.</P>

      <P>In many towns where there are large slum areas we find those &ldquo;gaping wounds&rdquo; to which Senator Healy referred.  They are extremely objectionable and are a source of trouble to the neighbours.  They are oftentimes used in the darkness as dumping grounds for waste material and they cause a great deal of trouble to the local authorities.  In towns under the control of town commissioners, the rate-striking power is very limited and the amount raised is, accordingly, very small.  The commissioners are not, therefore, in a position to cope with the clearing of those areas.  It is extremely expensive work to clear these sites and in many cases, when cleared, they are not likely to be used for building again.  In some cases, they are below the level of the surrounding ground and are fit only for an inferior type of playground&mdash;and that only after they have been properly prepared.  The local authorities have no funds to deal with these matters and the work could only be done if a special grant were given or if the work were regarded as being for the relief of unemployment.  If the necessary money could be found, that work would absorb many of the unemployed who are bound to come on our hands during the coming winter.  This problem is not confined to one town; it is general throughout the country.  These places are great eyesores and steps should be taken to remove them.  So far as I can see, that will only be done in the way I have indicated.</P>

      <P>To my knowledge, a great improvement has taken place <Col N="2124" /> in Ireland during the past 30 years so far as these eyesores are concerned.  I should like to know from the Minister why he is making an exception in favour of local authorities and bodies corporate under subhead (d) of Section 1. Some of the eyesores which exist at present are on sites in the possession, not of local authorities, but of certain companies.  These places are a blot on the landscape and why should an exception be made in favour of corporations? The Bill will, I am sure, have the blessing of every member of the House.</P>

      <P>Some of the greatest eyesores are under the control of the local authorities themselves.  As an example, we have the disused workhouse buildings scattered throughout the country.  I had occasion to go through one of these buildings in connection with local security work and I found the place in a terrible state of ruin.  Part of it was in a very good condition, but the roof had given way on another portion and the rain had been getting in for years, with the result that the place was terribly unsafe. Before the Department insist on other people doing this work, they should insist on their own authorities clearing away these unsightly buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Goulding, it is, perhaps, true that some local authorities are in the possession of workhouses and other buildings which are not in a proper condition.  We have tried to the best of our ability to get these local authorities to sell or otherwise dispose of these buildings if they are not suitable for reconditioning as houses for the poorer classes.  When dealing with local authorities in connection with that matter, certain methods are open to us, but these methods are not open to us as the law stands in dealing with the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Senator Alton, the bodies he mentions were excluded by an amendment which was inserted in the Dáil.  It was pointed out there that a tramway company <Col N="2125" /> might have a tram yard which would look unsightly but which would, nevertheless, be necessary.  It was urged that a local authority should not be allowed to come along and urge its removal simply because it was unsightly. The case of a railway siding was also mentioned.  If these places were not given exemption, it was thought that they might be regarded as injuring the amenities of the locality and that a demand might be made for their removal.  These, however, are minor matters, and what the Bill proposes to do is to deal with the main problem.</P>
    <P>As Senator Healy has pointed out, we could not, as the law stands, deal with a place that was injurious to the amenities or unhealthy unless it was also proved to be dangerous to the public.  Under this Bill, we shall have power to deal with it where it is injurious to the amenities or unhealthy. A point was made by Senator Cummins about the cost of removing these derelict structures.  I think that this is one of the activities to which we may be able to direct unemployment relief money or, at least, give a certain proportion of it to the local authorities if they put up schemes for the demolition of derelict sites and their replacement by houses or playgrounds or plantations.  I think we may take it that work of this kind will be regarded as work for the relief of unemployment.  If we want to deal with the matter expeditiously, I think the only way of doing so is to make the unemployment relief moneys applicable to it.  Otherwise, a number of public bodies would not take it up at all.</P>
    <P>The point was made that it would not pay to take down these buildings. Where the owner refuses, after notice has been served upon him, to take steps to put a place in proper condition, then the local authority can go in and demolish the site.  When compensation comes to be assessed, they can deduct the cost from the compensation payable to the person who neglected or refused to carry out his duty.  I am glad that the Bill has met with so favourable a reception.  It is long overdue and I believe it will do a great deal to clean <Col N="2126" /> up these eye-sores and restore local amenities.</P>

      <P>May I answer Senator Honan?  The Senator spoke as regards individual derelict sites not being worth the cost of their clearance.  As the Minister stated, the local authority has the right to deduct in respect of the demolition from any compensation that would be due to the owner of the derelict site.  There is another point. Does Senator Honan agree that these derelict sites should be allowed to stand in a city, ruining its appearance? Furthermore, if those sites are taken over, that will naturally give an opportunity to builders to engage in building operations.  They would construct houses on those sites and I am sure numbers of them would be glad to get an opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to have forbearance with me while I put forward some arguments in support of the motion that stands in my name and that of the other Senators associated with me.  We hope to be able to convince the House to support the motion <Col N="2128" /> standing in our names.  A great deal of confusion prevails in general surrounding this question of parish councils. In the first place, I would like to say that the councils we have in mind are not the emergency councils which are being formed at the moment to deal with the present situation.  These councils have their own functions and will probably end when the emergency passes.  Neither are the councils that we have in mind voluntary associations, nor in great measure the parish committees visualised by the Department of Local Government.  The idea behind this motion goes much farther.  We visualise a system of parish councils modelled upon those in existence in other countries, councils which would have a far-reaching effect on our rural communities.  This new method for the organisation of small rural communities would, we believe, have a far-reaching effect upon the future development of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to point out what has been done in other countries regarding the establishment of parish councils.  We find that parish councils, in some form or other, have always been a prominent feature of most European countries.  Even in England parish councils were in existence from the 17th and 18th centuries, although they fell into disuse during the 19th century following upon the introduction of the poor law system, and the establishment of boards of guardians with which we in this country were at one time familiar. In the year 1894 they were re-established, so that we find that over 4,000 parish councils are functioning in the rural districts of England, although many in this country seem to share the view that England is almost completely urbanised.  That, however, would appear not to be so.  These parish councils are elected by the people of each parish.  They have extensive powers of local government, subject to the control of the county councils.  In France, there has been a system of parish councils in existence for over 150 years, and these have formed a prominent feature of the life of the country during that period. There are over 40,000 parish councils functioning in the rural districts of <Col N="2129" /> France to-day.  They also have parish councils in Belgium, Norway and Sweden, and recently they have been set up in the new Portugal.  There they have proved to be a great instrument in the regeneration of that country under the direction of Dr. Salazar.  These councils are elected by the family vote.  In those countries the councils are founded with the parish as their basis.  In other countries, where the people live in village communities, there is the village commune.  You have these in Spain, Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and Italy.  In fact, in most of the countries of Europe, and especially in those countries that share the same spiritual outlook that we in Ireland do, you have this system of parish councils in one form or another. Through the centuries we find this system in operation in a number of European States; we find it in such ultra-democratíc States as England, Belgium and Denmark.  We find it in States that were practically under a dictatorship and also in countries organised on a corporative basis.  They have found it necessary to organise small rural communities.</P>
    <P>In all these countries in which they have adopted the system of parish councils, there are certain things which these councils have in common which I should like to point out.  First of all they have been established by statute; secondly, they have a territorial or parish basis, and thirdly, they are elected by the family vote.  They are elected or formed on a vocational basis and they have never been founded on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I come now to the position in Ireland.  We know that in the two Constitutions of this country, this whole question of the organisation of the rural communities on the lines of Continental countries, seems to have been overlooked, and instead we have visualised development on the lines of modern States, such as the United States or other modern countries. Although for some time past an effort has been made to bring this question of Continental parish councils before the public, up to recently the Irish people have taken only an academic <Col N="2130" /> interest in the question.  Now, however, the European War has shown clearly to all people the danger of centralisation in government, the danger of bureaucracy.  To-day the situation as far as parish council organisation is concerned, has completely changed.  To-day there is general agreement that the future of this country lies in the organisation of the small rural community to preserve their own rural culture and to develop their own resources.  There is general agreement that in such a development lies the hope of rural Ireland and of the nation as a whole.  While there is unanimity on that point, there is hardly the same unanimity as to the method of organising the rural community.</P>
    <P>Two distinct schools of thought exist on this subject.  Firstly there are those who believe that that organisation of the rural community must be carried out and maintained on purely voluntary lines, that it must be left to the people themselves to build up rural organisation and to maintain it.  There is a second school of thought which believes that that organisation must be set up by the State and carried on by the people, as in England and Continental countries.  Since it would appear that many people favour the idea of voluntary organisation, I should like to show that it would be impossible to found a system of parish councils that would be of any permanent value on a voluntary basis.  It would be contrary to universal experience to expect such a system to work efficiently.  It is for the first time being proposed that a system of local government should be carried on, on voluntary lines.  When we speak of a voluntary organisation to carry on parish councils, what exactly do we mean?  Do we mean that the people of the parish of their own volition come together and formally elect a committee, and that that committee is delegated powers by the county council or by the Government? It may be conceivable that in the present emergency such a thing could happen or that, even in normal times, an informal committee might receive some powers such as the distribution of poor relief, the care of wells or cemeteries or such small local work, <Col N="2131" /> but it is impossible to believe that any Government would entrust to such an informal committee extensive powers of local government which would include perhaps the levying of rates and the raising of loans.  It does seem impossible and contrary to all precedents of government.</P>
    <P>If we take it that the voluntary system would mean a voluntary organisation, with an executive and branches in every parish, and that that organisation would have bestowed upon it by the Government the functions of local government in rural districts, we see at once the objections that would arise to such a course.  In the first place, a voluntary organisation taking over powers of administration from the Local Government Department would have to give up its voluntary character. It would have to conform to certain rules and to submit to inspection and to audit in the same way as any other statutory body.  It would have to relinquish all its independence.  Again, no matter how admirable such an organisation would be, no matter how representative it might be, to hand it over powers of administration over other people would be contrary to the first principles of democracy.  In any case, however, these arguments are superfluous.  We all know that any voluntary organisation of any voluntary effort cannot last except for a short time.  It is the universal practice for an organisation once it reaches its zenith to tend to disintegrate and to decay.  We know that any local government system could not be built on a voluntary organisation.  A local government body that is to be permanent, must be established by statute.  Its powers and functions must be clearly defined and its continuity must be secured by law, otherwise it cannot last and no powers of government can be delegated to it.</P>
    <P>Having made so much clear, I should like to deal with the parish council which the signatories to the motion have in view, a system of parish councils which might be established on the lines of other countries.  What we propose is that the parish, or preferably <Col N="2132" /> the half parish, be taken as the unit, that it be left to local option to determine the size of the unit, that the people of a half parish or any portion of a parish be entitled to have their district declared a parish council area. We must remember that the peculiar value of the rural parish council which we envisage, as distinct from the county council, the district council, the urban council, or any other public body, lies in the actual personal contact between the council and the different families that compose the parish.  We propose that the parish or the half parish be taken as the unit and that every family within that parish be entitled to a vote in the election of the parish council, that every head of the family should have a vote or, as the local government procedure up to recently was, that the husband and the wife should each have a vote.  In any case each family would have an equal vote&mdash;they would have an equal vote within the parish area. We propose that a council of, say, ten members, together with a chairman, to be elected every three years, would be elected by that family vote.  In addition to these ten or 11 members, the clergy of the parish, of all denominations, would be <i>ex-officio</i> members.  That completes the council.</P>
    <P>Now, over that council there would be the parish assembly.  It would consist of the representatives of all the families in the parish, who would meet once a year, or as often as might be necessary, and that body would exercise a controlling voice over the council or executive body.  As a matter of fact, the families of the parish, through their representatives or heads of the families, would themselves constitute the parish council, and what we call the council would only be the executive committee.  I should like to point out how this system would work.  Take the case of a small parish of, say, 200 families; each of these families would have an equal vote, and they meet once a year to decide such matters as what local rate should be struck, what money should be borrowed and all these things with which their executive council would deal.  You see at once that we have created an organisation <Col N="2133" /> that might be called an extension of the family itself; we have created a kind of super-family in the parish, and such an organisation is the next step in the hierarchy of government from the family itself.  There may be an objection made to this family vote that it is too restricted.  We must remember, however, that in the Constitution itself the family is given pride of place as a basic unit, but although it is given pride of place in our Constitution, I think it will be agreed that in actual practice the family has no place, as such, in the public life of the country. At any rate, I think it is generally recognised that, in a restricted area such as the parish, you can well afford to go back to the family vote as it existed up to some years ago.</P>
    <P>The next question is, what powers we would give these parish councils. First of all, I should like to point out that the main idea behind the formation of the parish councils is not so much exactly the particular work that they might be able to do but the organisation of the rural community into bodies that would provide them with a means of expression and the power to act.  The main object of the formation of these parish councils would be to engender a spirit of independence and a sense of cohesion and of co-operation amongst the people of the rural communities.  The framework of the constitution of these councils, as I have indicated, would serve this purpose. Apart from the duties and functions which such a council would perform and the powers it might have, that council would do much to help to engender a spirit of independence and to foster a sense of cohesion and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Now, it is difficult to define all at once what the powers of a parish council would be, and there is no necessity to define them immediately. Many people who look upon efficiency as the end-all and justification of everything, ask what powers and functions of such a body as the councils can do; but the organisation of the rural community on the lines I have indicated would itself be more important than any function that the organisation could carry out.  At the <Col N="2134" /> same time, we must remember that such a parish organisation would be a powerful instrument in the development of the country generally.  As regards the powers, naturally, the parish council would carry out the ordinary local government functions which are performed by all local bodies, such as relieving the poor and dealing with other matters of that kind.  That might be developed into larger works, such as the carrying out of building schemes or schemes of public works or any work that might be entrusted to them by the county council or Government Departments. All these things would fall within the province of the parish council.  Of course, these powers need not necessarily be given at once.  Once the organisation was formed and had proved its fitness, these powers could be expanded step by step, or it could be left to the people of the parish themselves to take over these powers, as has been done in England, under what is called the Adoptive Act.  Outside of the local government work or the functions which the parish councils would carry out, however, we must remember that the parish council, formed as it would be by the people of the parish themselves, would be a most powerful instrument for the development, not only of the parish, but of the country generally.  It may not be realised how powerful an instrument such an organisation could be, but if one looks at many parts of Ireland, particularly in the south, where co-operative societies have been functioning, it can be seen what a material revolution these societies have made in their districts and what great industries, some of them running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, are being and have been built up by the very people who would be called upon to form these parish councils.  That proves definitely that the most potent instrument for the material development of rural Ireland and of our agricultural and rural industries is the co-operative spirit of the rural people themselves once it is harnessed in an organisation.  If you could get your 200 families together, once they are organised, and get them to pool their resources, there is nothing that they could not do in the <Col N="2135" /> way of development.  For instance, they could purchase land for allotments; they could reclaim or drain derelict land and, as I say, they could do many things which we cannot even imagine being done at present.  The very fact of having these councils organised and in existence would mean that the people themselves would undertake these schemes of development.</P>
    <P>You may also perceive that, although we propose that such a body should start first by statute and have certain statutory powers and duties, there is room within the constitution of that body for the voluntary organisation of every unit and every effort in the parish.  There is room within that statutory body for the genius, charity and Christianity of everyone in the parish.  It does not impose any additional Governmental restriction to have a parish council set up in any particular parish.  It simply enables the people of that parish to stand up in an organised body against any undue Governmental restriction.  Again, it will give the people, for the first time, a voice in the affairs of their own districts, and will give them a means of expression.  It should do much to restore the old respect for the family and the authority of the head of the family in rural Ireland.  It should do much to restore the old culture and the old traditions of the people, because, if we visualise the formation of such a council in a rural district, and its continuance for a number of years, we can easily see the effect that such a body would have on the imagination of the people in the locality.</P>
    <P>It would also give a training to the young citizen in the art and principles of Christian government.  At present, the country is simply a mass of individuals. The ordinary individual has no training in public life, and, as a result, he has no sense of responsibility.  This loss of responsibility is the cause of the great difficulty we find in carrying on the local government bodies and all the various organs of government, because the necessary public spirit is not in the people, and they have not been trained to a sense of responsibility.  These councils, in their own districts, would <Col N="2136" /> be a training ground for the young people which would enable them to take their place in public life either in the administration of the affairs of their own part of the country, or in the councils of the nation if they were called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made clear now to the House what is intended by the resolution. We ask that these councils be set up in permanent form by the Government and that it be optional with the people of the localities then to accept that statutory power or not.  I ask the House to give this matter their very careful consideration.  We seldom look outside our own country for inspiration, but I think we should look around us and see what has been done in other countries, and especially those countries that have the same spiritual outlook as ours.  They have in those countries built up a great system of local government; they have got rid of bureaucracy; they have trained their citizens and have maintained their native culture and civilisation in these rural districts, while ours have never been restored.  It is only by organising our rural population as those people have organised theirs, and as Portugal has organised its rural population, by giving them a corporate being and a means of expression as they would have in such councils, that we can change the entire orientation of our development, and lay the foundations of that State which we have all been looking forward to, a free and Gaelic State.  It is only by organising the rural community on permanent abiding lines that we can achieve this, and I ask the House seriously to consider it.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility upon us in this emergency because this is a young State and we are called upon to-day to lay the foundations of the future. It is a great privilege and we should not fail.  What we do will affect the whole course of the future development of Ireland, and we must remember that the soul of Ireland lies, as it has always lain, in the rural districts. If we allow the culture and life of the rural district to die out, there will be no Ireland, or not the real Gaelic <Col N="2137" /> Ireland that our leaders dreamed of. There is still enough of the Irish-Ireland spirit in the rural districts. There is genius, energy and everything else there, if we could but organise that life again and give it a living force and expression.  There is but one system by which we can do that, and it is to follow the lines of the old European countries and establish in Ireland a system of parish councils.</P>

      <P>If it does nothing else but to remove the misconceptions with regard to the functions and powers of parish councils and give us the official or Government point of view, this motion will have served a very useful purpose.  There has been a good deal of controversy with regard to the respective merits of Muintir na Tire and statutory parish councils, and I should like to understand at the start that the Senators who put their names to this motion are not in any way opposed to the policy of Muintir na Tire.  Some of us are members of that organisation, and we hope that when parish councils are set up they will carry out the policy and adopt the Christian principles advocated by Muintir na Tire.  The statements made by the Taoiseach on Part VIII of the Local Government Bill, 1940, show clearly that the Government intend to set up parish councils with statutory powers, and the object of this motion is to give an indication to the Government of the type of parish council which the Seanad considers most suitable for meeting the needs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the parish council should have statutory powers, that it should be elected on a vocational basis by the heads of families, by householders, or by ratepayers&mdash;it should, at all events, be a restricted vote&mdash;that it should consist of five members elected from a panel of farmers, five members elected from a panel of agricultural workers and three members elected from a panel of shopkeepers, artisans and other vocations, with clergymen and medical doctors resident in the council district <i>ex-officio</i> members.  I believe that chapel districts with a population of <Col N="2138" /> over 200 would be entitled to establish a local council on application to the county council.  As most people are more interested in their local village or district than in a village or district six or seven miles away from them, they would lose their interest completely if their parish council meetings were held six or seven miles away at the other end of the parish, and I do not think that it would have the same effect at all as the smaller unit.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new, as Senator O'Dwyer pointed out, in statutory parish councils.  He pointed out that they have been established and have been working in England for hundreds of years.  They are working in Norway, Portugal and several other countries and doing excellent work for the districts in which they are functioning. Father Hayes, a very eminent priest, who has the good of the country at heart, has organised what he believes to be the best form of parish council, that is, the organisation of Muintir na Tíre.  His idea is that it should be a voluntary body, that there should be no election and that it should have no statutory powers.  The objects, as set out by the founder himself, are: &ldquo;To contribute to the reconstruction and perfection of social order by promoting a wider and better knowledge of Christian social principles, and by securing their effective application in public and private life, and to organise the rural people of Ireland in a series of parochial guilds grouped in diocesan or provincial federations, and to organise associate guilds.&rdquo;  Most people have no objection to that.  The only point on which we differ is that we contend that these guilds or parish councils should have limited statutory power, and that unless they have statutory powers, they will fade out in a very short time, where they have not got such an energetic organiser as the founder of Muintir na Tíre.</P>
    <P>We have another very eminent priest who has studied the question of parochial councils in all the different councils, Rev. Father Devane, and here is what he says about parish councils:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let me at once warn readers that there is a vast radical and essential <Col N="2139" /> difference between the mere voluntary parochial organisation described as a parish council, and parish councils proper which act under an Act of Parliament and derive their existence and power from the law. It is only this latter that is in question, and I suggest the new basis of organisation of Irish rural life should be the parish council system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Father Devane has studied the question in the different countries, and he has come to the definite conclusion that if parish councils are going to be effective and if they are going to continue in existence and going to do the work which the founders of Muintir na Tíre hope that parish councils will do, they must have statutory powers.</P>
    <P>The only place where the people who advocate the statutory parish council and the advocates of Muintir na Tíre differ is that we believe that it will take very many years before Muintir na Tíre would be established all over the country.  It has been in existence now for ten years and I understand that very little more than 40 branches have been organised.  You could not get a more energetic organiser than Father Hayes and if that is the only work he is able to do in ten years it will be a very long time before the whole of Éire will be organised into parish councils on the principles and mode adopted by Muintir na Tíre. Most people are agreed that there should be some form of organisation in rural districts and the only difference is whether the organisation should be voluntary or have statutory powers and be elected.  I believe that the councils should be elected on the vocational basis which I have suggested, and I believe they should have statutory powers, even of a very limited nature.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a personal explanation in this matter: I do not speak for my Party and anything I say is my own personal responsibility. There may be something in the terms of the resolution that is against the principles of the Labour Party, that is, <Col N="2140" /> the method of election.  Possibly the method of election would be suitable to rural needs in parishes of from 200 to 500 in population.  The question does not affect the urban areas: these councils are intended for rural areas with a population of 200 to 500.  I am not concerned as to the method of election; the family vote may be a good one, though I would much prefer to see the democratic vote&mdash;the local government vote.  However, in order to agree with people who are more conversant with the question and in order to help in getting an explanation from the Minister, I consented to my name being put to this resolution.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that the method of election would exclude ladies from it. In my mind, it would not: there is no necessity whatever for that; anybody can be elected to a parish council.  It does not exclude women: to exclude women would be contrary to the principles of democratic government, and I certainly would not be a party to it.  The question of parish councils is not a new one in this country.  We have a standing example of it in the old Congested Districts Board.  Many Senators who were living and taking an interest in economic affairs in the West of Ireland round the coast of Kerry 40 years ago, will recall the nature of those councils.  They were parish councils consisting of <i>ex-officio</i> and elected members.  The <i>ex-officio</i> members would be something of the type of men who are being elected to what are known as parish councils today&mdash;the parish priest, the doctor and, at that time, the landlord or the landlord's agent.  Any two members of a parish could come together and pass on to the congested districts boards their findings in the matter of establishing a parish council.</P>

      <P>They were advisory councils working under a statutory body.  We have these to-day in the country and they are made statutory. I happen to be a member of one of those bodies called a sub-committee of the public health board.  I think it is rather unique, and that there is only one other in Ireland.  It is a statutory body, partly elected and partly nominated, and it is of such a nature as the parish council.  It has more power, as it is definitely statutory, and its work is that of an advisory body to the board of health.  The congested districts boards did a tremendous amount of work throughout the country.  These parish councils had power to advise on drainage, land reclamation, housing and loans for building.  The small farmers were enabled in this way to get money grants for the purpose of improving their homes, their surroundings and their lands, and for making permanent improvements in these places. They worked very satisfactorily, and I believe that if these parish committees are to be made statutory, they could not take a better model for their method of election and organisation than that laid down by the congested districts board many years ago.</P>
      <P>It would be tedious for me to go into this matter, but I do believe that there are great possibilities in it.  At any rate, at the present moment it is necessary to do something about this question as the utmost confusion exists. We have what are called parish councils, emergency councils, Muintir na Tíre and a host of other bodies springing up <i>ad hoc.</i>  To-day any few people in a parish can walk into a council chamber led by an important member of the community and produce &mdash;as has been produced&mdash;from a vest pocket a list of the council that is to be set up as a parish council.  Unfortunately, this has led to great confusion at the birth of what might, perhaps, be a very useful body.  In some cases it has led to scenes.  A body born under such disturbing and violent conditions is not likely to function smoothly or be of much benefit to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy, I believe, will live; and, if it is to live, we must avoid centralisation <Col N="2142" /> in government.  It is a growing evil in every country, and has led, eventually, to what we find in several countries of Europe to-day&mdash;a dictatorship. If the people are trusted to do their work, the work will be done effectively, but organisation is very essential to secure this.  For the last 50 to 100 years, bodies have sprung up in this country such as the parish councils that are springing up to-day.  They have faded away; they had their day and they have passed out of men's minds. Some of them had certain useful effects nationally and economically, but they had no stability about them.  Methods of government are becoming more and more centralised.  We here opposed the managerial system of government which leads to centralisation, which is cutting off the people more and more from actual contact with the instruments of government.</P>
    <P>The rural population take very little interest in the economic questions that concern the nation and very little interest in the political questions that concern the nation until an election comes around.  I believe that the establishment of social nests&mdash;if you like to call them so&mdash;in the shape of parish councils would give to every adult member of the community an interest in the economic concerns of his neighbour.  I believe there would be no division in families as a result of this.  Political questions, I should say, would be abandoned for the time, eliminated from the programme upon which their minds would work, and the family attention would be concentrated on matters bearing upon the future economy of the district.  This is not a time for work that will entail any expense or even very little expense on the Government.  The work should be entirely of a voluntary character, and the clerical work in connection with the business of the council should be entirely voluntary.  Perhaps there might be one paid official, but the payment might be no more than what was required for stationery and postage.</P>
    <P>The great benefit, I should say, of this movement would be to create more interest in rural life.  Rural life is drab.  The flight from the land continues. <Col N="2143" /> We cannot shut our eyes to that fact.  We may try to deceive ourselves that Ireland will be prosperous if our cities and towns and factories are prosperous, but nobody is so foolish as to think that.  The great source of life-blood in our country is the rural district.  I should say that it would give much attraction to rural life if parish councils were established.  They would train the people of our country in citizenship, in a sense of civic justice. To-day we find elements in the family breaking away from control. Family control is becoming more difficult. I should say that the parish councils would help considerably by their example, by the integrity with which they performed their duties.  I should say that they should be a model in each townland that would help even family life and family discipline.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal and I trust that the Minister will clear up the present situation and let us know whence we are going or where it is going to end, because in some places there are in existence two parish councils running side by side, like two clocks in the same locality, one striking old time and the other striking the new.  Some day there will be a clash. What are their powers?  How are they going to be elected?  What are their duties?  What are their responsibilities? What is the period of their existence? Are they emergency councils or parochial councils or Muintir na Tire councils or what are they?  I should say that nothing but some statutory rule will regularise the situation so far as these councils are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather anxious to hear Senator Tierney speaking on this motion, but we will have that pleasure later, and perhaps it would be easier to come before him than after him.  I would like to feel that the House was unanimous in the view that it is a wise and a good thing and, indeed, an essential thing to set up parish councils. If we all held that point of view strongly then we could sit down to think out the kind of organisation that we wanted to establish.  I may say that, at this stage anyhow, I cannot <Col N="2144" /> feel myself supporting the motion as it stands but, like a great many others, I am struggling to fight my way out to the light and it may be that more light will be thrown upon the ideal and the idea behind this motion before the debate concludes.  I think it was Senator Cummins who spoke about the benefit of this movement. Interpreting the motion as it stands, I do not know that there is actually a movement at all.  It is true that there is a movement in favour of parish councils, but I do not know that there is a movement, or at least the kind of movement that we would like to have, in favour of this sort of parish council.  My difficulty about it is this: I believe that any form of parish organisation that does not spring from the root of things, which has not its life in the soil itself will not be worth anything in this country.  I fear that if we took the decision to-day to pass this motion, and if the Minister were prepared to implement it, and if he set about establishing these parish councils as statutory bodies you would destroy that initiative which I would like to see our people displaying in creating and developing an entirely new spirit and outlook in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Cummins also who referred to certain committees that existed under the old Congested Districts Board.  I do not want any committee like that.  I do not want to think of the conditions as they existed under the old Congested Districts Board in the country.  I do not want the outlook that our people had at that time applied to the conditions in this country today.  In my judgment, that is not the way to make this a better country.  We are now a free, independent, liberty-loving people, with the right to enjoy our liberty and to use it as we so decide for the betterment of all our people.  We are not out, I hope, looking for doles or for the power to administer doles or grants from anybody, but we are out to do the creative work that has to be done everywhere in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cummins referred to the spirit that is being displayed in some parts, in the effort to establish some of <Col N="2145" /> these parish councils.  I must say that I have no experience of that, but I believe it is so.  My feeling is that if those people were made to understand that in coming into parish councils there were sacrifices to be made and that if there was any honour in the position it would only result from the members' hard work and from an honest endeavour to put into application Christian principles in a practical form, there would not be any of that attitude of men revealing lists of people who were to be parish governors.  If there was any such spirit, parish councils from the beginning would be a failure.  I feel that if under an Act of the Oireachtas we are going to establish parish councils in that form, I am afraid men would come in with lists in their pockets, so that certain people would be put in control of the affairs of the parish.  That would be wrong.  It would for a long time destroy any hope we have of building up the right spirit and the right outlook with regard to the future work of parish councils, if they are to develop with the right mentality and in the right atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Senator Counihan to Muintir na Tire.  I do not know, if asked, if the founder and those responsible for working Muintir na Tire for a considerable period would be able exactly to define what Muintir na Tire is.  Clearly it is a spontaneous movement that has had a considerable measure of support from all classes of people who are very disinterested and very worthy citizens of this State.  I cannot claim to be a member of it.  That is how the matter strikes me.  It is an intangible kind of movement.  The ideals which it has advanced are ideals which can only shape themselves definitely in the future, when the position is clearer.  It seems to me that out of a voluntary organisation like it something will result, if it is left to the people to think out, without trying to establish their thoughts for them.  There is any amount of intelligence in the country and many people are thinking not on the old lines at all, not on the lines of the past 15 or 20 years, but rather on the basis of fresh soil.  I prefer to cultivate that soil and that atmosphere <Col N="2146" /> and to give it a chance to be tended by people who, now, perhaps in a different mood can come along and study the problem rather than seek to impose anything upon it.</P>
    <P>I urge that this is the very worst time in the world's history for people to try to fix things by statute.  Goodness knows we have statutes galore. Our task now seems to me to be to try to hold what we have the right to hold under the statutes that exist.  We do not know whether we will be able to achieve that object.  Who can peer into the future and say exactly what form society will take when reconstructed, or who will be left to reconstruct it?  In France, Belgium and Norway they had parish councils, but that did not save them from what came upon them.  There are things that parish councils cannot do.  It seems to me that to take a decision to-day to set up statutory bodies as parish councils would be trying to put a slate on top of a house when you know that the fuse of a bomb inside it was going to blow it up.  In my judgment we are too soon with the proposal.  If the voluntary movement gets a chance to develop, and if the people who are doing their utmost for it get the support that their ideals and their honesty justify them receiving, I do not say that ultimately it will not take the shape urged by the supporters of this motion.  That may very likely be the case, but it will take time.  To sit down on the voluntary movement which has caught on to a considerable extent, and the prospects of which many people are turning over in their thoughts, would be unwise on the part of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator O'Dwyer and those associated with him have been very keen on parish councils for some time past.  I am also keen about them, and I urged strongly, when certain measures were going through the Seanad after the outbreak of war, that one way of getting the best out of the present situation was to set up parish councils.  I think Senator McEllin expressed similar views.  At that time I was referring in particular to our tillage scheme.  It seemed to me that if we were to get the best out of the <Col N="2147" /> land there must be voluntary co-operation on the part of the people residing in a parish.  None of us but can look at places in a parish that are not being worked to quarter their capacity.  Even to-day that is true. We know that many things are required to get full production in these places.  I believe it could be got by the people of a parish if they got together and if there was amongst them the spirit to make sacrifices, to leave their own work in order to help a poorer neighbour by the loan of a horse or a plough, or perhaps by doing something collectively to procure seeds and fertilisers for the soil.  That was my idea months ago.  I think that sort of thing would be practical application of Christian principles in rural Ireland. We did not attempt to do that when, in my opinion, a fertile field offered to make the land more useful.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dwyer referred to the co-operative movement in which he and I are associated.  He knows that it is a voluntary organisation in which farmers came together, and that many of them have made great sacrifices and have lost money in doing so.  Some of them had practically to break up their homes in order that the principle of co-operation might be established and carried on in their districts.  As a result of the sacrifices of numbers of such people, magnificent co-operative organisations and business institutions are flourishing.  One of them is the society in County Wexford that suffered the other day.  It is one of the finest in the country, and was built up by the voluntary spirit of sacrifice and co-operation amongst the people.  That spirit existed for a number of years. It is not as militant to-day, or doing the same creative work for the country that it did 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have now entered upon a new phase, and I prefer to give voluntary effort a chance.  It may very well be that voluntary effort will throw up leaders to represent the people and that the powers proposed now may be granted to them some time, but, in my judgment, not yet.  Above all I urge that to fix anything to-day would <Col N="2148" /> be very unwise because we do not know what to-morrow will bring.  I prefer to keep the machinery that we have got tuned to the highest state of perfection, and to do our best to protect the things we have, by creating as much food and other essentials as are necessary out of existing organisations, and not to take a decision which might do much to prejudice the possibilities of parish councils.</P>

      <P>I think I ought to take an early part in this debate, partly because it is only an accident that my name is not associated with the motion standing in the name of Senator O'Dwyer and his associates, and partly because I find myself in this matter in sympathy with a number of people with whom I frequently am not in sympathy and opposed to a number of people with whom I frequently act in concert.  It is, I think, desirable that we should do all in our power in this debate to clarify a matter about <Col N="2149" /> which a considerable amount of misunderstanding appears to exist and do our best to crystallise the issues at stake for the benefit of the public as well as for our own benefit.  It seems to me that the principal point at issue is whether parish councils should be purely voluntary organisations or whether they should enjoy and possess a certain statutory authority and a certain independent jurisdiction.  There is a third kind of council now in existence, known as a local emergency council, and, in my view, the need for these local emergency councils would not exist if we had, as part of the normal framework of local government in the country, everywhere functioning, statutory parish councils.  I may say at once that I strongly hold the view that parish councils should be allowed to come into existence and should be given by the State statutory authority for the exercise of such functions as come within the scope of such bodies and that, as between the principle of voluntary parochial guilds and statutory parish councils, I am altogether in favour of statutory parish councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I should like to say that I admire very much the enthusiastic work done by the leaders of Muintir na Tíre, and that I welcome that organisation and the propaganda and accomplishment associated with it.  I should hate it to be felt by anybody associated with that organisation that people who think with me are in any way opposed to the valuable work they have been doing. But I do think that, while enthusiastic propaganda and voluntary associations are admirable things in their way, organisations of that kind are liable to become somewhat flabby and invertebrate if the initial enthusiasm should disappear, or if the leadership which they enjoy in the first instance should, in the course of nature, not be replaced by equally effective leadership.  I also feel that if you give parochial councils a suitable legal framework and recognition as part and parcel of the fundamental local government of the country, there is no earthly reason why these voluntary organisations should not empty their enthusiasm in bucketfuls into the machinery provided by law for <Col N="2150" /> these statutory parish councils which I advocate.</P>
    <P>I think they should have a legal and statutory position, and should have a right of taxation in respect of the people of the parish up to a limit which might, perhaps, be fixed at a shilling in the pound on the valuation of the parish.  They should have a right to tax themselves for purposes approved by themselves, and there should be no rigid limitation of the purposes upon which they should be allowed to spend their own money beyond the limitation regarding a certain percentage of the local valuation.  I also think it desirable that they should not be supervised, except in the remotest possible degree, by the Ministry of Local Government, but that supervision of their financial proceedings, the auditing of their accounts and that sort of thing, should be done entirely by the county managers who will provide them with all the necessary expert advice.  It would be fatal and disastrous if the Ministry of Local Government had directly to attempt to supervise some thousands of parochial councils, functioning throughout the country, but it would be the easiest thing in the world for the county manager to get in touch with these parochial councils, give them any necessary advice or supervision, and make use of the machinery provided by them to facilitate and make more efficient, and, indeed, more humane and more discriminating, the work of local administration now performed throughout the parishes by the county council authorities and even by Departments of State.</P>
    <P>Many simple things could easily be done, things which would cost nothing, provided this statutory parochial organisation were in existence to provide the machinery for doing them. For example, there are numerous seaside resorts which are not under the jurisdiction of any urban council, and which are, therefore, rural areas, forming part of the administration of the county council.  They have no parochial government.  I am aware of one of these resorts in which a tin bucket was rotting and decaying on the sand, with many broken bottles, years ago.  I recently visited the same seaside resort <Col N="2151" /> and the same tin bucket was to be seen in a more advanced state of decay than before.  It would be the elementary duty of a parochial council to see that that sort of thing did not take place; that broken bottles, tin cans and the debris of exuberant picnicking parties were cleaned up at our seaside resorts after each occasion on which they became polluted.</P>
    <P>If some such bodies existed, with local articulation and local public spirit, visitors and others who might have occasion to make complaints would, at least, know to whom they should complain.  They would know that the chairman of the local parish council was the man they should get hold of if a complaint was to be made about the amenities of the resort.  As things are, nobody seems to be responsible for these elementary amenities. Nobody knows where to find the secretary of the county board of health. What concerns everybody concerns nobody, and these simple parochial amenities are frequently left neglected.</P>
    <P>An argument appealing only to general principles and broad considerations is, perhaps, unconvincing as well as somewhat dull; so, to make the matter more concrete, I want to give an example that recently came to my knowledge of how a certain problem could easily, and would easily, have been solved if the statutory parochial council had existed in a certain parish, which problem has, as a matter of fact, defied solution for the last eight or ten years.  I hope I shall not be accused of drawing a red herring across the debate if I refer at some little length to the history of the mussel industry as it concerns the country in general, and as it concerns the parish of Mornington and the neighbouring parishes of Bettystown and Baltray in particular. This is one of those national questions which is so national that it is completely ignored, except at election times, when it only leads to election promises which generally lead to nothing, whereas, if it were treated parochially in the sense in which it is parochial, the solution would be probably arrived at as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>So far as I understand the matter, <Col N="2152" /> the mussel industry ten or 12 years ago was doing fairly well, and some £7,000 or £8,000 worth of mussels were being exported every year.  But some physician, with that misguided enthusiasm which doctors sometimes display, if I may speak somewhat flippantly, began a racket or a propaganda which tended to show that the mussels drawn from our rivers were polluted by sewage.  Whether they were or not is not the point, but the effect of the propaganda was that it was necessary to pass a Shellfish Order forbidding the export of mussels drawn from certain river beds, including the river Boyne, among others, unless those mussels had been put through a purification tank.  The Boyne mussel industry continued to function, not quite so well but in some degree, because the Nanny river, some few miles away, was adequately pure and, by transferring the mussels to the Nanny, it was possible to comply with the requirements of the Shellfish Order.</P>
    <P>In 1926 Bettystown parish acquired a system of local sanitation, with the result that the Nanny became polluted within the meaning of the Act and it was necessary to forbid the sending out of mussels where they were drawn originally from the Nanny or the Boyne and given a bath for a day or two in the Nanny.  The effect of that order was that an industry, which used to distribute £4,000 or £5,000 a year between some 30 or 40 families in the parishes of Mornington, Baltray and Bettystown, has been completely wiped out and now does not exist, and I find that whereas our mussel export before 1932 averaged £7,000 or £8,000 a year, after 1932 our export was down to less than £2,000 a year.</P>
    <P>That is a trumpery matter, if you like, unworthy of the attention of the National Assembly, but it is a matter of the most vital importance to the people of Mornington, Bettystown and Baltray.  I would like this National Assembly to develop the parochial outlook with regard to matters of this kind and to do everything possible to facilitate the establishment of local machinery which would enable this kind of problem to be dealt with by arrangement between the State and <Col N="2153" /> the parish council.  The solution of the problem of the polluted mussels is, of course, a purification tank filled with fresh sea water, through which the mussels should be passed and, after being treated there for a sufficient length of time, they would be regarded as pure and might safely be exported.  But a purification tank costs £3,000 or £4,000.</P>
    <P>At every election meeting in Mornington within the last ten years candidates have promised a purification tank to the local electors, and if election promises were horses Mornington parish would have ridden off with half-a-dozen purification tanks instead of several hundred empty promises. The people there have not got their tank, but if they had a parochial council it would be quite easy to arrange that they would have their tank.  The State was approached and the attitude of the Board of Works or the Department of Fisheries was that the tank would cost £3,000 or £4,000. The local fishermen would contribute so much a hundredweight of the mussels used towards the payment of the interest and sinking fund on the cost of the tank, but there was no guarantee that the mussel industry might not fail for some other reason and the State might be left to hold the baby.  If the State did pass £3,000 or £4,000 down the drain in that way, the Government and other Governments have spent money in worse ways.</P>
    <P>But, if there were a parochial council in Mornington and a similar one in Baltray and Bettystown the State could say to them: &ldquo;The local fishermen want a tank which is going to cost £3,000 or £4,000.  Will you underwrite the interest and sinking fund on that £3,000 or £4,000 and pledge the credit of the parish to that extent in the event of the cost of the tank not being met by the mussels passing through?&rdquo; Personally, I think the loss would be infinitesimal and the local councils could confidently undertake that.  If the State arranged that, the parish council would have no excuse for not having a tank.  The possibility is that they would have a tank and we would have an industry worth several thousands a year more and the local <Col N="2154" /> fishermen would have profitable fishing all the year round.</P>
    <P>That is a concrete way in which a parochial council, if it had statutory authority, could promote the interests of the parish.  That is one of the ways in which such a body might use such powers.  I see no objection to the pledging of the credit of the parish in favour of other desirable objects which would be promoted by local enterprise, encouraging agricultural and other kinds of production.  If you have that kind of parochial machinery, the State can co-operate and it will be entirely the fault of the parish if the kind of local problem which I have outlined is not automatically solved.</P>
    <P>The powers I would like to see devolved on these parish councils should not be rigidly limited.  They should be authorised to do everything which is not illegal and which they are prepared to take full responsibility for, financial and otherwise, within the limits of their taxing powers or within the limits of their ability to get contributions to supplement their resources from taxation.  I would like to hear this matter debated fully, and I would like to see some general agreement on this question as to whether parish councils should be statutory or only voluntary.</P>

      <P>As there seems to be some danger, in connection with parish councils, of the existence of women being overlooked, it might be useful to have the voice of one woman heard in this debate.  Doubtless, like many other Senators, I find myself in some difficulty in the consideration of the problems presented to us by the motions before the House.  In principle I accept the administrative ideal inspiring the proposal to establish parish councils as integral parts of the machinery of local government.  It follows from that, as an imperative consequence, that I would like to see them established as statutory bodies with powers, functions, endowment and, above all, the permanence which alone the legislature can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it is because I believe that parish councils, statutory parish councils, would be useful and would fit in with <Col N="2155" /> our conception of life in Ireland that I have asked myself if this is the moment when it would be right to establish them.  It seems to me that there are certain difficulties involved.  It is a very real change-over, much more real than is apparent, perhaps, from a superficial observation.  It is a real and, in fact, a revolutionary change-over. Is this the moment when a world war, the most appalling in human history, is waging around us and above us and threatening to engulf us at any moment&mdash;is this the moment when we will have the leisure and calm and clearness of mind necessary to give full consideration to the many legal and technical difficulties which I believe would be inherent in the setting up of parish councils?  It seems to me that it would result in hasty and ill-considered legislation, and that these bodies would be hampered at their initiation.  They would have within them the germ of disintegration, and we would be very sorry that we ever set them up.  In my opinion the prudent thing for us to do is to watch the development and working of the voluntary parish councils and the cognate bodies that are being set up.  We can see how they work, and can then make up our minds as to what powers, if the country should decide to adopt them as part of the local government system, they should have, how they should be elected and selected, and how&mdash;and this is a very important part&mdash;they could be made to fit in with other instruments of local government.  Now, it is always much better, it seems to me, to work with the wisdom one gets from experience.  It is much more helpful than any <i>a priori</i> plan.</P>
    <P>Another objection to the Government accepting the motions before the House would seem to me to be that the establishment of parish councils now would meet with a good deal of vocal opposition.  I am not concerned to discuss that.  It is not my province to discuss whether the opposition that Muintir na Tíre has made itself the mouthpiece of is justified.  But I say that, at this moment, we should not do anything that would split our people. <Col N="2156" /> To sum up, I imagine that the best thing for us to do would be to watch the development and working of the voluntary parish councils: to wait and see.</P>
    <P>I think the Leas-Chathaoirleach may be interested in this.  St. Francis de Sales, discussing marriage, said: &ldquo;If marriage was an Order to which one had to serve a novitiate, there would be very few of its novices professed.&rdquo; I do not say that I hold that view myself, but I say that before we wed ourselves to the idea of parish councils we should serve our novitiate to them, and see how they work before we pass any legislation about them.  That, I think, would work out much better in the long run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put my name to this motion may I say that I was not at all so optimistic as to imagine that we were going to rush the Minister for Local Government, or the Government, into hasty legislation. My object, if I may speak for myself, was principally that I would like to have a full discussion of this subject of parish councils in a place where a full, free and well informed discussion is possible. I entirely agree with what Senator Mrs. Concannon has said, that this movement does imply, to a large extent, a revolution in our local government system.  I would like it to imply a revolution, and, that being so, I am far from being so impetuous as to wish that it should be entered into without examination, and without an understanding on all sides of what is being attempted, and of the direction in which the movement is tending.  The reason why those of us who put down this motion did so, apart from a desire for a discussion, was that we felt that there was a certain danger, as things stand, that matters were perhaps being rushed: that certain vested interests, almost, were being created, and that steps were being taken in particular directions without there being informed discussion of what was happening and of what was meant.  Before the country rushed off in perhaps three or four different directions at once in this matter of parish councils, we felt it would be a good thing to have a debate <Col N="2157" /> in the Seanad, and in that way try to get Senators, from all sides of the House, to discuss the question and put forward their views.</P>
      <P>Like most other questions that are up for public debate in Ireland, this question of parish councils is always in danger of being transmuted into two or three totally different questions. There is a very strong danger, as far as public discussion has gone up to the present, that we may wake up some morning and find that it has been transmogrified into a discussion on women's suffrage.  All the women of the country seem to be writing letters to the newspapers denouncing this and that form of parish council because it does not live up to the very ancient and respectable ideal of &ldquo;votes for women.&rdquo; Then there are other people, I notice, writing letters to the papers calling for something like social credit in this connection, and there is a danger that practically every nostrum in the country will be trotted out and recommended to the people under the guise of a discussion on parish councils.  It was partly with the hope of bringing things to focus, and getting down to the realities of the subject, that we put down this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea, I think, that Senator O'Dwyer and the rest of us had about this whole question was that there is a definite need for the completion of our local government system.  That has been shown by experience of its deficiencies in most important respects. We believe that some form of statutory parish council is one of the things that we need in order to put it right. I said in the House before&mdash;it has been my opinion for a long time&mdash;that the first Local Government Act passed after the inauguration of the Free State, 16 years ago, was passed rather too speedily and without sufficient study being given to the whole question of local government organisation. We abolished the rural district councils before the Free State came into being, and then proceeded to erect a whole local government system on the basis of county government.  There are a great many defects, as I think we can all see now, attaching to that system.  In the first place, the counties, <Col N="2158" /> although they have been given a certain spurious claim on the popular affection by bodies like the G.A.A., do not represent anything organic or historical over a very great part of Ireland. They do not represent any sort of common feeling among their inhabitants. At any rate, if I may speak for the county I know best, I am quite certain that is so.  A county like Galway contains within itself at least two totally different communities.  It contains a city as well, but apart from the city it contains two communities who are totally different in their needs, and even in their language.  These two are brought together under one council, and the most intimate work affecting the lives of these two communities is supposed to be done as if they were one community.</P>
    <P>I think that that applies to a great many other councils also.  They have no native historical claim on the affections of the people and they do not represent the natural organic grouping which the people might adopt for themselves if they were allowed.  When I say that, of course, I know I am in danger of being accused of wanting to go back to the Middle Ages and of being reactionary.  A great many people have the idea that the best thing we can do is to take what we have got and to make the most of it. I do not at all share that view.  We in this country have had a unique history in many ways.  There is hardly any other country in the world that has been so ground down in social matters as we have been.  We have been so completely bereft of native organic institutions, so completely bared of everything of that kind that we can call our own, that we have to build from the ground up if we are going to create a living Irish community in the future.</P>
    <P>That is not merely my personal notion.  It has become a widespread belief nowadays in many other countries that before you can build any organic society you must have a natural unit as the base.  You must have some unit into which that society will naturally fall, some unit of a social kind in which the members feel themselves bound to one another by some tie.  Although our <Col N="2159" /> history has been so unfortunate, and although we have been so widely deprived of our native organisation, there is one thing which we have been left. That is a most important thing; we hardly realise how important it is.  We have been left the parochial and diocesan organisation which in its essence goes back to the 12th century, which does represent something vital, something that tends to bind the people together in a particularly powerful way, and in which I think the State and the community, in the secular sense, would be wise to build upon for the future. It is for that reason we are so much interested in this idea of parish councils, because we think the parish should be the natural unit of local government.</P>
    <P>The people in a parish&mdash;I mean, of course, the people in the rural parishes &mdash;do feel that they belong to one another. They are linked together in the most important of their human functions. They meet together regularly for public worship, and there are other ways in which the people of a country parish always feel more united amongst themselves than they do with the people of other parishes.  We think that you can make great use of that sort of spirit amongst the people in the sphere of local government; whereas the counties so far, despite the efforts of bodies such as the G.A.A. and the Gaelic League, have left the people very largely cold.  That was also true of the rural district areas.  I should not be at all surprised if one were to discover, on going into the history of the establishment of the rural district councils, that the reason these areas were chosen was that it was felt by the local government authorities at that time that by setting up these peculiarly chosen areas, they would get rid of the great bogey of the priest in politics. It was all very well for an English Government to set up areas which would eliminate as far as possible the Church from all contact with local affairs, but it should not be the idea or the design of a native Irish Government. Indeed, it should be our idea as far as possible to reverse that process, and to get back to the unit in which <Col N="2160" /> the priest, like everybody else, will be able to play the part in the life of the community that his position entitles him to play.</P>
    <P>We are encouraged in the view that the parish is the natural unit by what we see happening in other countries. As Senator O'Dwyer pointed out, nearly every Continental country has some form or organisation based on the parish.  Portugal is the great example of that, and it has surprised many people to discover that England itself is an example of it.  All down through the 18th century, England, to all intents and purposes, was governed by means of parish committees.  The rural government of the country was in the hands of these parish committees much more than in the hands of anybody else. They were of a peculiar type at that time.  They were aristocratic and oligarchic, but at the same time it was the parish that formed the unit of the effective government of England down well into the 19th century.  In our times the English people have revived that form of government.  They have reestablished the parish councils and parish committees, and they have given these councils back a good many of their ancient powers.  So that we, in proposing to set up statutory councils&mdash; although in many ways it may prove to be revolutionary&mdash;we can say that there are aspects of it about which nobody need be so terrified as some people seem to be.  The same form of organisation exists in other countries, and all experience shows that parish councils are a suitable and efficient form of local government organisation.</P>
    <P>Of course, when we are looking for the basis of a new society, as we are here, the great difficulty that always confronts us is that we have to proceed artifically to some extent from the start.  We have not got the natural organisation we should have had if our history had been different, but that should not prevent us from trying to get the natural organisation even if we have to look outside for an example, or even if we have to do things that were not done in England.  When we find that what we are proposing is in fact the normal form of local government in other countries, that, I think, should <Col N="2161" /> give us considerable courage in considering this proposal and in supporting it.  In putting down this resolution we deliberately inserted a reference to the family basis of the parish council.  We did that, as Senator O'Dwyer said, not merely by reason of an interest in electoral machinery, but because we thought it was an important principle that the family should be represented as such in these units of our local government.  We have references to the family in our Constitution, but we have not gone very far as yet to implement the promises that were made about it.</P>
    <P>I would suggest&mdash;and I think the proposers of this motion would agree with me&mdash;that here we have an opportunity to do something with regard to giving the family a place in Irish life. With all respect to the advocates of women's suffrage, and to the advocates of individual democracy, I think there is more to be said for giving the family a place somewhere in our governmental system than there is for the old and respectable causes of women's suffrage or manhood suffrage.  We have tried these things and we have a good idea of how they work.  It might be no harm if we tried the other plan for once. Not merely might it be no harm, but, of course, it is a thoroughly desirable thing because&mdash;again I am following in the footsteps of Senator O'Dwyer&mdash;if we are to have the Christian idea of the State at all, we have to begin with the Christian family, and there is no way you can more fittingly or more effectively give the family representation than in the small local unit of government. There have been criticisms of the idea of family representation.</P>
    <P>It has been said that it means the principle of &ldquo;Papa knows best&rdquo;, that it means cutting women out, that it means keeping young vigorous elements of the community from having any share in the government of the community, but it is perfectly easy to devise a system of family representation that need not do any of these things.  It is perfectly easy to devise a system, for instance, in which women will have quite as an important place as men.  At the same time, it is easy to devise a system in which it will be <Col N="2162" /> possible for the younger members of the family to have at least as good a say in the choice of representatives on the parish committee as the older members will have.</P>
    <P>There is no intention at all, on our part at any rate, to rule out women or to rule out the young.  The idea was that we should find, somewhere in our local government system, a place where the family could operate as a unit, and there is no more appropriate place and no place where it can operate more effectively than the parish. There might be many different ways suggested, as I have said, of carrying it out, but we put it down as a general guide to indicate what our idea, at any rate, was about the form which these local councils should take.</P>
    <P>There has been a sort of opposition created between that idea of family representation and the idea on which I believe Muintir na Tíre operates&mdash; the idea of vocational organisation. There, again, there is no necessity to be exclusive on these things.  As Senator Counihan pointed out you could easily have a parish committee in which you could arrange for both family representation and representation of different vocations.  It is rather difficult for me to grasp the need for vocational representation in a parish, because I happen to belong to a part of the country where all the members of the parish are of the same vocation and where all are very much on the same level.  They are all small farmers, and that is the sort of parish that I visualise when considering these councils.  There are other parts of the country, however, where you have other conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there are telephones and things like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what telephones have to do with vocationalism. What I mean is there are parts of the country where there are different types of vocation: where you have big farmers and small farmers and where there is a whole class of farm labourers&mdash;a class that, I am afraid, I for one have practically no experience of at all&mdash;and other vocations <Col N="2163" /> to be found.  There is no reason why, in framing a system of parish councils, account could not be taken of all these differences.  What we should aim at is to get back as far as possible to the system that would have grown up naturally if we had not now to be reconstructing it as a result of historical circumstances.  We may be quite certain that, if we had that system based on some traditional unit like the parish, there would still be great differences in different parts of the country owing to some historical event, perhaps, or some big differences in class division or something of that kind.  In every country where you have had a really live and highly-developed traditional system of government, such as Switzerland, for instance, or France before the revolution, you had any amount of local differentiation, and the last thing we should aim at in any scheme of local government is too much uniformity.  As a matter of fact, one of the things we suffer from all over the country is that uniformity which is rapidly, before our eyes, tending to turn every parish in Ireland into a suburb of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The ideal of almost everybody in the country districts nowadays, the ideal inculcated by generations of education and of local and national government, is to become as nearly suburban and as &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; as they possibly can become.  There are some of us that may wallow in suburbanism&mdash;perhaps because we do not know any better&mdash; but I do suggest that if that process of centralisation and uniformity, and what I call suburbanisation, goes on, there will be no Irish people, worthy of the name, left in another 50 years.  It is in order to put the clock back&mdash;I say that quite frankly&mdash;it is in order to stop that process of too rapid centralisation, too great uniformity, and too extreme a tendency to imitate the city and follow the city in everything, that we ought to frame our system of local Government in the rural areas, and it is because the parish and family vote will, I believe, be the most efficient instruments in doing that, that I am in favour of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> Another question about which there has been a great deal of rather complicated and, to my mind, unnecessary debate is the question of statutory <i>versus</i> voluntary bodies.  I must confess &mdash;perhaps it is that I am slow in the uptake or that I have something peculiar the matter with my mind&mdash; that I cannot see where the necessity for any excitement about that difference comes in at all.  Surely, it is perfectly possible to have statutory parish councils and to have any number of voluntary bodies side by side with them in a parish.  If there is a voluntary organisation of the type of the Gaelic League, the G.A.A., the co-operative movement or the Muintir na Tíre movement, why cannot any or all of these subsist in a parish, and the parish at the same time have a permanent form of self-government in which all its families will be represented and which will be able to do certain things for the good of the people?  I can well see that, if you had these statutory parish councils, and if you had, side by side with the parish council in a particular parish, a branch of Muintir na Tíre, that branch would be able to do magnificent work.</P>
    <P>I am very far from wanting to criticise or to crab the Muintir na Tíre movement in any way, and so I think are all of us who have put our names to this resolution.  We do not consider that there is any difference or any quarrel between our point of view and that of the Muintir na Tíre movement, but what we do want to emphasise is that, in our opinion, unless parish councils have&mdash;I will not say statutory powers, because that implies certain things that I do not like&mdash;unless parish councils have a statutory form and statutory permanence, the whole movement for parish councils will tend ultimately to become weak and, perhaps, in many cases, to wither away entirely.</P>
    <P>All voluntary organisations have that defect, that they go through a regular cycle.  They begin with great enthusiasm and work up to a peak of energy, and then a time comes when their original leaders grow old or disappear from the organisation, and what happens <Col N="2165" /> is that the organisation either changes its whole nature, as has very often been the case, or it disappears altogether.  Now, either of these eventualities would be a danger, to my mind.  We should not, so to speak, put all our eggs into the one basket of voluntary organisation, especially when there is no real argument at all against having statutory organisation so long as we have regard to certain elementary precautions.  Certain things must be guarded against in connection with these voluntary bodies if we set them up, but if we take some elementary precautions there is no reason why these bodies should not flourish and do extremely good work.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the advocates of purely voluntary parish councils propose to set about doing the sort of work that parish councils would have to do.  The limits of voluntary work in any parish may be wide.  There may be a great many things that could be done by purely voluntary activity, but there are certain definite limits. There are certain obstacles that any voluntary body that has no legal existence at all is bound to come up against. It may come up against certain rights, vested interests, and even, perhaps, against the police or against the powers of the county council or the Local Government Department.  Some of these points may be points on which the most valuable activity of the parish council could be concentrated.  Take, for instance, one matter which I believe could be very healthily left to the management of a parish council&mdash;the question of the control of dance halls. If a voluntary body started to interfere with the control of dance halls at present it would be up against the law immediately, up against the police, the Department of Justice, and the district justices, and its activities would very soon be cut short.  At the same time, there is a type of function which I think a regular permanent parish body could very well undertake in the control of public amusements.</P>
    <P>Then again, unless ultimately such matters as the support of the poor, or old age pensions, can be passed on to natural organic bodies like parish councils, these bodies will not be doing <Col N="2166" /> their best work.  I should like to see a system under which old age pensions are granted on the recommendations of the neighbours of the candidate for the pension.  I get cases every week, and I am sure every Senator gets them, of people who apply for old age pensions. These people first have to go before the local pensions committee. Then there is the pensions officer, and it all has to come up to the Local Government Department, and ultimately the Minister purports to decide, in the vacuum of his office in the Custom House, whether Pat Murphy down at the other end of Ireland is of the right age and in the right economic position to get an old age pension.</P>
    <P>The thing has only to be stated for anyone to see how absurd it is that there should be that degree of centralisation and that degree of control, which is, in effect, not control at all.  The same applies to a very large extent to any of these grants of public assistance.  The public are the people who should give these grants, and the public, I suggest, in most of these cases, are the man's, the woman's or the child's own neighbours, the people who know all about them, who go to Mass with them on Sundays and who are actuated towards them by sentiments of neighbourly charity&mdash;and our people everywhere, whether in the town or in the country, are by no means deficient in charity towards one another, in spite of the things often said about them.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to conceive of many forms of work which these voluntary committees can do, except to have congresses and to make speeches about agriculture.  They can do that until the cows come home, but any voluntary body which tries to carry any of these ideas into practice and to get money spent on them will soon come up against a stone wall.  I cannot see what the argument is against creating regular permanent bodies that can undertake at least some of these activities.</P>
    <P>There are two dangers into which these parish councils may, perhaps, fall.  One is very frequently mentioned. It is the danger of control by political <Col N="2167" /> Parties.  The other is the danger of too much control by the Local Government Department.  The first is a point which I should like to hear debated.  I think we could have a great deal of discussion as to whether it would be possible for political Parties ultimately to make these parish councils into instruments of their own.  I doubt very much that it would.  If you have a system of parish meetings where all the families in the parish are represented as families, and if you have these electing a small executive council to do certain specified work and controlling that council democratically, I find it very difficult to conceive that any one political Party can get hold of it.  You cannot stop it in any case, and if that is going to happen, you might as well say that you are not going to have any sort of local government.  The only alternative is complete centralisation and that means, in the end, theoretically at any rate, still more complete control by a political Party.  The thing is a circle.  If you are prevented from setting up statutory parish councils by fear of political Parties, the same thing ought to keep you from setting up county councils, or a Government, or any other form of social organisation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think the danger of too much control by the Local Government Department is a real danger.  It is a danger which Senator O'Dwyer, and the people who put their names to the motion are not at all unaware of.  We all know that, as things stand at present, the secretary, or whatever he might be called, of a parish council would be very soon in danger of being turned into an instrument of the Local Government Department in Dublin, but the way in which that can be obviated surely is for the Local Government Department, which is part of the Government, to make up its mind that that will not be done.  There, again, you are up against a kind of dilemma.  You are running in a circle.  If you have too much control by the Local Government Department, why have anything but the Local Government Department?  Why have county councils or county managers or any form of decentralisation?  The <Col N="2168" /> answer surely is that the remedy is at the centre.  Until the Minister for Local Government and the Government decide that they will definitely adopt a system which would make for decentralisation, and let that system alone, and deliberately let it alone, we will continue to have that excessive control.</P>
    <P>I do agree entirely with the view that there is too much control and, on that point, if I am not boring the House too much, I should like to make one final observation.  One of the causes of centralisation is a failing to which we are all subject, and of which we are largely unaware.  It is the desire we all have to improve everybody else, the inability we have to let other people manage their own business; and I do not think there is any Department in the country which suffers so much from that inability as the Local Government Department. Here, again, we are dealing with a kind of passion we have inherited from a century or more of British bureaucratic government.  England, during the 19th century, was distinguished by the number of largely anonymous improving administrators she possessed, and she needed them badly because she began the 19th century with an appallingly feeble form of government which gave the utmost possible rein to individual exploitation, the exploitation of the poor by the rich. She corrected that very largely during the 19th century through the agency of a number of extraordinarily able civil servants, and it was these civil servants who created the type of bureaucracy we have here now, and which we have inherited from England.</P>
    <P>With it we have inherited that passion, that instinct that drove people like Lord Shaftesbury and Kay-Shuttleworth, and all these great reformers of a century ago, to change the whole basis of English life.  I suggest that that again is something that we should reconsider and try to get rid of. Senator Johnston has just asked me whether I am denouncing centralisation or decentralisation.  I am denouncing centralisation, and pointing out that one of the causes of that excessive centralisation is this passion for improving everybody else.  If we do set up these parish councils and give them <Col N="2169" /> powers, and act on the basis that they are going to manage their own business, we shall have to reconcile ourselves to letting them manage their own business.</P>
    <P>I suggest that as a criticism of some of the speeches I have heard this evening. If we are going to continue in this country on the basis that we are to teach our country people especially how to clean their houses and to wear nice town clothes and good town boots, and be nice, respectable, decent suburban people, we are going to ruin the country and we are going to destroy the people.  If we do set up these bodies we shall have to set them up on the basis that we will let them alone, and that we will rely on them to manage their own business.  If they mismanage it, that is their responsibility and not the responsibility of improving bureaucrats or interfering educated people in Dublin.  That is what democracy and an organic system of government ought to mean&mdash;that we should do away with that excessive control at the centre.  I do suggest, although it may sound extravagant, that you can have too much public health, too many tourist resorts, too much cleaning up of beaches, and too much interfering with the people because they leave buckets lying about.</P>
    <P>It is time that we changed our whole attitude towards these things, and that we left them to the local people themselves. I believe that, if we did, the local people would manage their business ultimately far better than the Dublin people can manage their business for them.  Ultimately, you are taking a chance that is not a chance at all. What is wrong with a great many of our local resorts, and about a great many of the amenities that people miss so sadly in the country, is that the people have not the organisation or the machinery themselves for looking after those amenities.  We ought to give them that organisation, as Senator Johnston has suggested better than I could, and having given them that organisation, we should rely on them to see that things are well done, and, if they are not well done, we should wait until the people&mdash;who are ultimately responsible to themselves for their own affairs&mdash;<Col N="2170" /> decide to do them better.  It is because I believe in the principle of local government, and because I believe that parish councils would give a chance to the people in an organic, vital and living way to do these things for themselves, that I am in favour of this resolution.</P>

      <P>I waited deliberately to hear Senator Tierney justify putting his signature to this motion.  I thought he might clarify the position somewhat, for I must admit that I do not know whether he was supporting the motion or against it, or whether he was giving legislative authority to the parish councils or encouraging voluntary ones. We heard a good many stories, but if he justifies legislative authority through the local authority in the case of the applicant he talked about for an old age pension, I do not think the State's resources could meet all the claims for old age pensions.  He deplored the fact that we had a Minister for Local Government here to check up as to whether the applicant was entitled to the old age pension, whether he was the age, and so on; but imagine the local committee considering that case. Human nature is human nature, and the same thing applies to these parish councils, whether they be set up with legislative authority or be voluntary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not studied this matter very fully, but I am certainly in favour of the voluntary councils mentioned by Senator Mrs. Concannon.  When these voluntary councils have justified their existence, we should take the matter up and legislate to see that they will be carried on.  Senator Tierney talked about a revolution.  I suggest that this motion is nothing but a form of revolution.  He suggested that election to these bodies should be in the hands of the heads of families.  The legal definition of a head of a family is a male, and again it would be a very limited franchise and a very limited number of people would have the power to appoint these people. Senator O'Dwyer advocated handing over the local government of the parish to those people elected on this very limited franchise.  As I say, I was waiting for someone to justify that.  It <Col N="2171" /> would be a very retrograde step for a House of the importance of the Seanad here to pass a motion such as it has before it.  We have gone away from that idea of the limited franchise, and I am surprised that Senator Tierney has referred to it.  On this motion Senator Tierney has talked about a good deal of confusion and muddled thinking.  Is there anything more confusing or muddling than the motion before this House?  I suggest that there has not been anything so badly thought out as the motion we are dealing with.  I am in favour of the voluntary committees, and I believe they could do good work.  If they do their work properly and are enthusiastic about it, in the near future the Government will be compelled to legislate for them and give them their place in the national economy of the country</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that in this debate, which is extremely interesting, there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding due to the mixing up of words.  It is a mistake to set against each other the words &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;statutory&rdquo; because statutory does not necessarily mean that it is not voluntary as far as the work of members of councils is concerned.  As far as I can judge, there is practical unanimity of opinion that the movement in favour of the establishment of parish councils is one that should be supported by all sections of the community.  The main difference of opinion is as to what work can be given to these councils.  We have had in this debate suggestions which, to my mind, are extravagant as to the amount of work which could be put on small voluntary bodies, whether they be created by statute or not.  The <Col N="2173" /> opinion that I have formed definitely is that it would be a mistake for the central authority to introduce legislation immediately.  I am sure that the time will come, if parish councils are ultimately to be a success, when a certain amount of legislation or statutory recognition will be necessary.  My hope is that parish councils will be formed at a much greater speed than they are at present&mdash;although one welcomes the increase comparatively recently&mdash;and that from those councils will come a demand, more or less united, for the necessary statutory recognition and that, as a result, steps would be taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by some of the arguments and very much, as I always am, by the enthusiasm of my friend Senator Tierney, with whom I generally agree, but I think that he has undue optimism if he believes that this Government or any other likely alternative Government at the present time could produce a Bill, emanating from the Department of Local Government, which would avoid all the pit-falls which he sees.  The introduction of legislation now, to my mind, would be going in the wrong direction. It would be starting from the top and trying to create something which would be coloured by and influenced by the mind of people in Dublin&mdash;exactly what Senator Tierney does not want.  It would be wiser to wait, even at the risk of losing a little, until the movement becomes stronger and makes its own demand for such statutory recognition as may be found desirable. On the whole, I think the decision of the Government not to rush into legislation is a wise one and, for that reason, though I am in sympathy in many ways with much that has been said here, I could not support the resolution as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want, as far as I possibly can to deal with the matter that has been mentioned not only here but in newspapers and various parts of the country about the confusion that is created.  So far as the Department of Local Government is concerned, its responsibility for indicating <Col N="2174" /> the desirability of parish councils was shown in Section 69 of the Local Government Bill which was introduced in the Dáil some time ago.  What was in our mind was that there was some movement at the time and some indications from the people at the time that there was a desire in certain parts of the country to set up parochial councils, and that section provided that where these councils did exist then the county council could delegate to them certain duties, with the approval of the Department.  They could also assist them in the way of providing halls and so on.  That was not because there was what one might call a clamant demand or insistent demand.  There were only indications at that time that parochial councils were considered in some quarters desirable.  The Taoiseach, I think, earlier had given indications of his views on that matter.  Where confusion could arise on that particular section, I do not know.  With this Bill at the time it was circulated in the Dáil for Second Reading there was circulated a memorandum, and I will deal with the portion that relates to this particular section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Part (Part VIII) enables councils of counties to assist local councils.  If the inhabitants of a locality in a county are desirous of having the special interests of the locality considered and safeguarded locally they can if they wish establish a body for that purpose and ask the county council for help.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The constitution and procedure of such a local council will be a matter for the inhabitants by whom it is set up.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think Sir John Keane's motion indicates that he wanted to know what was the procedure and what would be its constitution.  As I indicated, its constitution and procedure will be a matter for the inhabitants of the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The form of organisation will be determined largely by the conditions and needs of each area.  Its activities should be concerned as much with the advancement of the economic welfare of the inhabitants as with <Col N="2175" /> matters directly appertaining to local government in the area.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When such a local council is approved the county council may provide them with premises to be a social centre for the locality, and with furniture, etc.  Except for these purposes and for purposes arising from a delegation of the county council's function, the county council may not finance the local council.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Functions of the county council may, in appropriate cases, be delegated to an approved local council. Such a delegation may require the acts of the local council to be confirmed, or it may with the sanction of the Minister allow the local council to act independently.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We considered that that was giving an opportunity to county councils to delegate functions that they thought would be more suitably performed by local bodies such as parish councils.</P>
    <P>So far as I have been able to ascertain, different views have been expressed, and, of course, will be expressed when a matter of this sort is under discussion. The probability is that the subject itself will provide for criticism and discussion of different points of view, but generally I think that section was welcomed by persons who took a keen interest in local councils.  In other words, it was apparently what was desired: that if the county councils wished to help, they could.  If they gave help it would be subject to what some Senator described as bureaucracy and official interference.  That was the position that we found ourselves in when we appointed county and regional commissioners. While one might say: &ldquo;Wait and let the parish councils develop in the ordinary way&rdquo;, it was felt in the emergency that steps should be taken to provide emergency councils, corresponding to parish councils, in every area throughout the country, to deal with the emergency situation, and secretaries of county councils were summoned to Dublin for instructions.  The only method of procedure that I indicated to them was that they were to go <Col N="2176" /> into a parish, or if they were not able to go themselves, to send a responsible official into every parish to secure on the parish councils, for the purposes of the emergency, the most representative people without regard to class, creed or distinction.</P>
    <P>There may be complaints here and there that there is confusion about these councils.  That was the procedure adopted, and no complaint of any difficulty being encountered has been made by any of the secretaries.  I have not seen in the newspapers or otherwise where any discordant note was struck, or where there has been any real confusion amongst members of parish councils.  I know that in certain parts, where county secretaries went in and found parish councils, and made suggestions of adding to them or giving them a wider character, there was no difficulty about it; and in other places the people as a whole were quite prepared to accept the council in existence for the period of the emergency. The next step was to send out instructions as to what these parish councils were to do.  I am referring now to parish councils set up for the emergency, because I feel that, while that Bill has not been approved of by the Dáil or Seanad, no further steps should be taken by statute to set up parish councils of a permanent or quasi-permanent nature.</P>
    <P>The instructions sent out to the secretaries of county councils were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Obtain information from time to time regarding the food and fuel supplies in the parish, encourage traders and heads of families to store additional supplies and take such other measures as they consider advisable to meet an emergency.</P>
    <P>2.  In case of emergency co-operate in securing the equitable distribution of such food and fuel as may be available, prevent waste and conserve supplies and, if the parish is threatened with food shortage owing to being cut off from its usual sources of supply, assist in rationing the food available and procuring food from other parishes.</P>
    <P>3.  Co-operate with the County Commissioner in making arrangements <Col N="2177" /> to meet an emergency and dealing with the problems that will arise in an emergency.</P>
    <P>4.  Encourage the people of the parish to study the official instructions regarding &ldquo;Civilian War Duties&rdquo; and make preparations now for their protection.</P>
    <P>5.  Take steps to preserve essential public services, such, for example, as the water supply.</P>
    <P>6.  Ascertain as soon as possible what accommodation would be available in the parish for the reception of persons evacuated from other districts.</P>
    <P>7.  Co-operate with the Gárdaí in staying panic among the population and preventing evacuation from the parish except on the instruction of the proper authority.  If evacuation of the people in the parish is ordered, assist in it.</P>
    <P>8.  Maintain so far as possible communication with other areas in case of disruption of existing means of communication.</P>
    <P>9.  If a unit of the Red Cross does not exist in the parish, organise a unit and assist in the training of its members in first aid.</P>
    <P>10.  Help the Red Cross in carring for any sick or wounded that may be sent to the parish from other districts.</P>
    <P>11.  In a parish where the Local Security Force is not up to strength, encourage suitable people to become members.</P>
    <P>12.  Organise assistance for farmers in the neighbourhood in saving crops if such assistance is required.</P>
    <P>13.  In the event of isolation assist in the maintenance of public order and at all times co-operate with the Gárdaí and Group B of the Local Security Force in non-military and humanitarian activities.</P>
    <P>I read these instructions for the purpose of showing Senators that whatever has been done by the Department of Local Government has been done up to the moment purely for the purpose of dealing with the emergency.  There <Col N="2178" /> cannot and there should not be any confusion.  If there is going to be loyal co-operation in a parish, I am sure individuals can sink any difference they have in a time of emergency, and co-operate.  If that is not possible now, then I think there is a poor lookout for parish councils in the future.  I cannot say personally that the criticism that has been made about confusion has been justified.  To take the main problem that we are discussing, the advisability or otherwise of parish councils, I confess that I find no fault with them.  When I read the motion I was not clear as to what powers, functions and duties it was intended to give parish councils.  It was not clear to me whether it was proposed to give them some new functions, or whether it was proposed to take away functions from existing local bodies and assign them to them, or whether they intended to assume such functions as striking a rate, borrowing money or appointing officials.  It has not been made clear yet.  In a matter like this I am not complaining that it has not been made clear, because I think people are only trying to find out each other's views and the reactions as to how these councils would work.</P>
    <P>It has not been made clear what exact powers it is proposed to hand over to parish councils.  It is all very well to talk about the situation that existed many years ago, and about the position in England.  Parish councils did exist in England as poor law authorities until the boards of guardians took over their functions.  They were in decay until revived in 1894.  Let us take their powers for what they are worth.  They can do little except call attention to grievances.  They could strike a rate up to 4d., but very often that right was not exercised.  It is not correct to say that parish councils, as they existed in England, were important as administrative units.  I do not want to go over a list of other countries, but take the case of Portugal. Under a decree of 1933, parish councils in Portugal deal with old age and invalidity pensions and similar matters.  I am not criticising another country when I say we are years ahead of that.  Senators talk about parish <Col N="2179" /> councils being democratic and, in the same breath, they mention France, where, side by side with the communes&mdash;the parish councils&mdash;ran the prefects&mdash;whose exercise of power is far from democratic.  I mention these matters merely to show that arguments of that kind can be knocked down.  Let us not think too much of France or Portugal, but let us look at our own country and see what is most suitable for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney gave the impression that, when the Local Government Bill of 1923 passed through the Dáil, the people were not alive to this matter. If there ever was a time in the history of this country when the people clearly expressed their will it was at that particular time because, during two years before that, they had actively and actually abolished the boards of guardians and placed their duties on a county authority.  When the Poor Law Act of 1838 was passed, the unit taken was the townland.  This unit was used to make up the electoral areas which were used for poor relief and other purposes.  Then, a number of electoral areas were taken and were put into what was called a union, the meeting being usually held in the market town in the centre of a number of electoral areas.  That was in the days when travel was difficult and when people used the horse and car.  As time went on and as the motor car came into use, the union gave way to the county council.  The powers of the unions were limited. When the county councils were some time established they gradually got&mdash;I am speaking of their later years&mdash; more power and more centralised authority.  I suggest that it is not sufficient simply to point to bureaucracy and centralisation and recognise the evils in them.  The county councils were composed of representatives of various parts of the county who were intimately acquainted with the needs and difficulties of the people they represented in those areas.</P>
    <P>We come now to the stage at which we find, after the passing of the County Management Bill, that instead <Col N="2180" /> of a multiplicity of authorities in a county you have practically a supreme administrative body.  At present, £7,000,000 is being spent by county councils on the four essential services&mdash; roads, county services, health, and public assistance.  If Senators look through these services, they will find that the medical service covers the whole county.  They will find that the same thing applies in the case of roads.  The demand I have heard most frequently in the Dáil in recent years is that the roads should be a national charge&mdash;that the county is not big enough as a unit.  When people talk about sending back various matters to the parish council, they should think about the financing of these services.  I assume that Senators mean that each parish is to pay for its own needs in respect of home help. If that is so, then the poorest parish will be hardest hit and have most to pay.  There was an area convenient to where Senator Counihan resides&mdash;Dunshaughlin&mdash;which, at one time, had the smallest rate in the country because, with its high valuation, its poor relief charges fell lightly on the ratepayers. The extension to the union and then to the county was an effort at fair distribution of the charge&mdash;at spreading the responsibility so as to cause the least hardship.  The only way that can be done is by adopting a county-at-large basis.  I do not know if the suggestion to go back to the rural areas means that we should give up steam-rolling our roads and go back to the boreens.  If people want steam-rolled roads, they must have steam-rolling machinery, and I do not think that that would be a practical proposition for any parish.</P>
    <P>What, then, would the function of a parish council be?  I say that a parish council has very valuable and very useful functions to perform.  As an advisory body, as a body calling the attention of the premier bodies to local conditions or local needs, it could be of great help.  It could be of considerable assistance to county committees of agriculture by affording necessary co-operation.  It has been a success in many parts of the country in procuring <Col N="2181" /> by co-operation seeds, manures and agricultural machinery, and it could do a lot more in that way.  It could provide halls for informal methods of education.  It could provide playing fields for young people and endeavour to build up our population on self-reliant and self-respecting lines.  I am very anxious to see parish councils established, and I believe they could play a very important part in the life of the country, but we must be very careful not to proceed blindly to the passing of measures giving them certain functions in local government without knowing how the experiment will work out.  The present emergency gives us an opportunity to see how these parish councils will work.  I believe they will work successfully.  So far as I know, there has been complete co-operation amongst the members everywhere the councils have been established during the emergency.  I believe that, if we give them the opportunity, they will show in what way they will best fit into any scheme we may have in mind when implementing the provisions of the Local Government Bill of 1940.  As some Senator pointed out, if statutory bodies were set up, it would take a long time to decide what functions should be assigned to them but, if you allow them to grow up voluntarily and spontaneously, you will have the benefit of the experience gained in the emergency and you will have, from discussions such as have taken place to-day, an atmosphere created in which both sides of the problem can be seen and profit derived from criticism of one or the other.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Senators here have indicated that they are against parish councils.  It is a question purely and simply of method.  Do not accept for one moment Senator Johnston's example.  I knew something at one time about that particular matter of the mussel tank at Mornington.  At that time the British Government, as far as I can remember, were only experimenting with a tank at a place called Conway, in Wales, and there was a good deal of money spent on it by the British Government.  These mussels were not stopped by the Irish Government, but on the complaint of <Col N="2182" /> somebody outside the country.  I do not think a parish council would be able to deal with a problem of that sort.</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney referred to old age pensions.  On all the old age pension sub-committees there is a representative of the various parishes; so far as I know, there is a parish priest or someone like that on them.  After all, five out of every seven persons who are over 70 years of age are getting the pension.  I do not know why the Department of Local Government is being criticised so much.  There were suggestions of bureaucracy and that it is this makes them send out an inspector to inquire into means.  That is the only way they have of inquiring into means.  Surely, Senator Tierney does not suggest that pensions should be given without any investigation? Again, appeals are not altogether as plentiful as Senator Tierney thinks.  They are comparatively rare, I understand, and when pensions are appealed against we must assume the local officer has some information that the claim is not the valid one that it is represented to the committee to be.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into this matter any further at the present time.  I had not intended to use the Bill in any way except that the emergency had arisen.  The Bill has not been passed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas, and it was not intended that that section would be implemented or that any people should be encouraged to implement it in any way until it became an Act.  The emergency forced that position aside, and we set up these emergency councils in the country, and it gave us a hope that out of the emergency councils many useful parish councils would eventuate.</P>
    <P>So far as the conditions at the present time are concerned, I am not prepared to recommend this motion to the Government.  I think it is a matter that would require considerable examination, and I would much prefer, and I think people with any experience would much prefer, to see councils springing up spontaneously.  It may be said, as was said by Senator O'Dwyer, that you will not get councils who have <Col N="2183" /> not got money&mdash;that you will not get them to operate.  I have heard Senator Johnston a few times in this House criticising high expenditure, and I was amused to hear him very cavalierly telling us how £400,000 was to be exacted by putting 1/- in the £ on the parishes. I may tell the Senator that if that was attempted, there would not be much welcome for the parish councils throughout the country, because from many parts of the country there are complaints about rates being too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I suggested 1/- in the £ as a maximum in connection with their powers of taxation.</P>

We find that there is great difficulty, in the case of several councils, in getting them to strike the proper rate, and our difficulties would be much greater if the Senator's idea were to be put into effect.  I suggest that these motions could be very well left over, put aside for the moment, and let us see when this emergency has passed whether we may have some other opportunities to consider this matter in another way, in the light of the experience that would be gained in the meantime.</P>

      <P>In moving the adjournment of the House, I wish to take advantage of a provision in the Standing Orders by which matters of importance may be raised, and as I have already given notice to you, Sir, and, as you have announced, I propose to draw attention to certain aspects of the A.R.P. services at the present time, and to suggest that the importance of these services does not appear to be fully realised by many individuals or properly emphasised by the Government itself.</P>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to express the sympathy which, I am sure, is felt by everybody in this House with the relatives of the first air-raid victims in this country.  I do not want to refer to what occurred in County Wexford beyond expressing that sympathy, and pointing out that what, for want of any other information, we must assume to have been an accident, was an accident that might quite easily have occurred, say, over Dublin or Cork; if the area in which the bombs had dropped had been one which was very thickly populated the results might have been much more serious.  I think that the apathy of the public is due to a certain amount of misunderstanding. I think it is also due to the feeling in the country, which I find amongst all classes, that either nothing is happening and that what the Government has told us with regard to danger is false, or that things are happening and that the truth is not being told.  We have rumours of all kinds as to the landings of foreigners. We have news only of three.  We have rumours that in hundreds of cases there have been mines laid, and that mines have been found in various places along the coast.  Nothing has appeared in the Press about the finding of mines, and the general impression is that either there is no real danger or that every serious event is being censored.  I think it would be a healthy thing, if there be any truth at all in these rumours that more information should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> I know that amongst a very large number of the men who have joined the A.R.P. there is the feeling that they are a sort of Cinderella, in which the Government is scarcely interested: that appeals have been made for recruits for the Army, for the Local Security Force, for the Red Cross and, last of all, a sort of half-hearted reference to the A.R.P. services.  I am told that when these services were started some nine or ten months ago arrangements were made for the issue of badges: that the badges were designed and prepared, but that then instead of being issued to the A.R.P. services, they were handed over to the Local Security Force, although the latter body had not been formed until months after the badges were designed. Badges may seem to be of very little importance, but it has given the impression to the men in the A.R.P. that they are scarcely wanted and that their work is not to be taken seriously. Now, I believe that impression requires to be rectified, and in order to have it rectified we need not only a clear statement but a series of clear statements on the part of the Government and of the Ministers concerned. I raised this matter in a somewhat different form last May.  The Minister for Finance was present, and he admitted quite frankly that he himself had discouraged any expenditure on A.R.P.; that he was one of those who was responsible for the fact that whereas there had been at first a general appeal to people to join A.R.P. service, that it had later been more or less stopped.  He admitted that he had now changed his mind.  He said he recognised that he was wrong, and admitted that the Government attitude had changed.  Since last October quite a large number of men have been giving their service in the A.R.P. They fitted themselves for A.R.P. duties only to discover that the Minister for Finance thought expenditure on A.R.P. to be wrong.  Those men have been giving their service during all that time, but still they feel that they are regarded as a sort of Cinderella: that to a certain extent they are ignored and treated in what I call a mean way.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary <Col N="2186" /> Secretary to understand that I am making this statement because I think it is in the public interest to do so.  I cannot prove all this positively, but I am satisfied that my statements are made on reasonably good authority.  I am told that the equipment provided is scanty&mdash;that in certain posts full equipment has not been supplied.  Take one thing which may not seem very important.  Where you have an A.R.P. post it requires at least three wardens. For a 24-hour service you must have at least two shifts.  I think most people would say that there should be three shifts, but the official attitude is that you need issue only three helmets.  The position, therefore, is that the A.R.P. authorities, in order to provide that service, must find a number of men with the same size of head or else some of the men serving must feel uncomfortable, apart altogether from the unhygienic aspect of the matter.  Most wardens would gladly pay for individual helmets if they could find out exactly where they are to be had.  That, of course, is a trifling matter and I do not want to overrate its importance. I do, however, want to point out that while many of us have been wobbling and doubtful, these men, at the request of the State, gave their services voluntarily, and fitted themselves for the duties to be performed.  They seem to have done their work remarkably well. There is nothing very spectacular about it, and they feel that to a considerable extent they are being forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is a serious mistake to regard their work as being in any way less important than the work performed by other voluntary defence services.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is true that the Government do regard recruitment for the A.R.P. as being less important than for, say, the Local Security Force.  Is that impression a wrong one?  If the Parliamentary Secretary says that the Government do regard the A.R.P. as being less important I would ask him whether he can conceive any emergency in this country requiring the assistance of the Army and the Local Security Force in which we would have no danger from air raids. I certainly cannot.  If the answer is <Col N="2187" /> that they do regard it as equally important, I want to know why in the speeches of Ministers and in broadcasts there has been so little reference to the A.R.P., and why this impression I have referred to has been allowed to get abroad.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the Government consider it the duty of individuals and of families who can afford it to provide air-raid shelters for themselves. Is it the opinion of the Government that I, as an individual, if I can afford the £12 or the £20 necessary, ought to have an air-raid shelter in my garden? As far as I am concerned I am in a public position and I thought it was my duty to do so.  I, therefore, obtained one.  I am not dealing with this as a personal matter, I am referring to it because a great many people have spoken to me about it. They take the view that there has been no statement from the Government and that, in fact, to put it in plain English the Government themselves are not agreed on the matter.  I believe we should have a clear statement from the Government.  A matter of much more importance on which there is considerable doubt is that concerning the duty of employers to provide air-raid shelters.  Is it the opinion of the Government that it is the duty of an employer, if he can afford it, and of limited companies, to provide shelters and, if so, are they to do so only for their employees or are they expected to make provision for customers and others who may live in their districts? My own personal view is that if the present danger is a serious one, and as a loyal citizen I accept the view of the Government that it is, then I think that a business which can possibly afford it ought to make provision for both employees and customers.  But I want that statement from the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to know why it is that the A.R.P. Act was followed by an order which provided that if the expenditure on a shelter in the case of a limited company was of a capital nature, the Government would allow a refund of 5/6 in the £, which was then the <Col N="2188" /> income-tax rate, but only to the extent of the provision made for employees. If the company made further provision for the public or for persons other than employees the refund referred to could not be made except only to the extent that employees were provided for.  If it be the policy of the Government that additional shelters should be provided for the public is it not absurd to discourage limited companies from making provision for other persons in addition to their employees?  If we could have a clear statement from the Government as to what is to be regarded as expenditure of a capital nature in regard to this, difficulties would not be likely to arise later with the income-tax authorities.  The position at the moment is unsatisfactory.  If a clear statement were made by the Government that ample provision in this direction ought to be made, then I imagine that claims made later could not be disputed by the Revenue Commissioners. Suppose, for instance, the basement of a large building is strengthened, the building will be permanently improved and, clearly, might be treated as capital expenditure. If, on the other hand, trenches are dug in a yard at the rear of business premises and shelters are put in them the latter will be of no capital value to the company that erects them. As soon as the emergency has passed they will be removed and additional expenditure will have to be incurred in filling up the open trenches and in making the yard again fit for ordinary purposes.  Businessmen have asked me what the position is, but I have been unable to give them any kind of clear information on the matter.  I referred on a previous occasion to the order made with regard to capital expenditure on air-raid shelters and to the allowance of 5/6 in the pound for expenditure of the kind set out in the order.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would clarify this position.  I have been told that people applying for this refund in connection with air-raid shelters must do so before next September.  That means that the question as to whether the expenditure is or is not of a capital nature must be decided before then.  If the <Col N="2189" /> expenditure is made <i>bona fide</i> I think the period for making a claim for a refund should be extended over a year or 18 months, which would give the income-tax authorities time to decide whether or not the expenditure is to be regarded as being of a capital nature.  If expenditure on air-raid shelters is not of a capital nature it can be deducted as an expense before profits are assessed.  The dear knows what the income-tax rate will be next year, but it is certain to be higher than 5/6.</P>
    <P>My main object is to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to the need for a clearer statement on the A.R.P. service generally, and whether or not that service is to be regarded as of first importance.  We should also be told whether there has been a sufficient number of volunteers for A.R.P.  If not, why is not the same appeal being made for volunteers for A.R.P. as is being made for the Local Security Force?  What is the real attitude of the State to this problem?  I still hope that we may be saved the sufferings and the horrors of war in this country, but should that not be the case, I am absolutely convinced that the provision of trained men and women&mdash;it is mainly men's work in A.R.P.&mdash;to deal with the situation that may arise in the event of an air raid is absolutely essential.  The work connected with A.R.P. is not spectacular; you do not carry a gun; you do not march round with bands.  Instead of that you have to go in for serious study, you have to be adequately trained.  The work of training may be of a rather tedious character.  Air wardens have to find out the position in each particular area.  They have to call on the inhabitants to find out how many people there are in each house in the area so that, in the event of an air raid, they will know how many people should be there.  They will also have to decide which houses should be demolished immediately after a raid has taken place, a matter in which they probably must have the assistance of architects or other experts.  Generally speaking, the work is not spectacular, and it has not the same kind of appeal as other services connected with the <Col N="2190" /> present emergency, but it is quite as or possibly more important for the safety of the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is just as dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways, it is more dangerous.  It is just as dangerous of course in the case of an actual attack on the country.  Consider for a moment the onerous character of A.R.P. work in England at present. Night after night, the A.R.P. workers there, take their turns at going round, ready at any moment to deal with an air raid if it comes.  Their responsibility is just as great and, in fact, in many ways is greater than that of those who belong to local security forces in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one last matter I want to raise.  I have been told by an air-raid warden that there are many people in this city who are so apathetic or so hostile that they even refuse to give the names of people residing in their houses.  They refuse even to give that simple information.  The A.R.P. workers, of course, have no authority to compel them to supply it.  It is a purely voluntary organisation, and some of them, naturally, get rather sick of the work when faced with an attitude of this kind.  For my part, I should like to see them given authority to require the police to get the required information.  Alternatively, if such information is refused, notice might be served on the house-owner that should the house be damaged in an air raid, there will be grave danger that nobody will be there to take the necessary steps to have the inhabitants removed to a place of safety, because the A.R.P. workers are not in possession of the necessary information to enable them to carry out that work. I am quite satisfied that it is absolutely essential that the air-raid wardens in each particular area should have definite knowledge of the number of people in each house in the area so that if a number of houses should by any misfortune be seriously damaged, the wardens will be able to ascertain whether the people are out of these houses before deciding which houses in the area require first attention <Col N="2191" /> from the demolition squad.  By that means they will be enabled to save a great many more lives.  The work, as I have said, is not spectacular.  It is a purely life-saving service, and it is work which a great many people could undertake.  The plea which I make is that it should receive just as much recognition from the authorities, and that as much emphasis should be laid on its importance as on that of other services which, no doubt, are extremely valuable and which I do not want to belittle in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Douglas raised this question because, though perhaps he is not aware of it, he has complimented me in some of the remarks which he has made.  I am one of those people who have devoted time, study and attention to this matter, and as one of the wardens in the city, I can tell him, before the Parliamentary Secretary speaks, that he has somewhat exaggerated the position.  I do not want to answer on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary, but as air raid wardens have been in practically constant touch with the A.R.P.  Services of the Corporation and the A.R.P. Department of the State, we have had frequent contact with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I only hope that in his reply he will tell the House what he told me personally in a letter in connection with the A.R.P. services.  If he does so, I think he will convince Senator Douglas that there is no lack of enthusiasm as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, in regard to these services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement about badges was not actually correct.  That has been the cause of considerable clamour throughout the warden services from the time of their inception. I might say that this was the first services of a defensive nature for which volunteers were asked on the emergency arising.  I volunteered my services at that time and since then I have been engaged practically week in, week out on it.  I must say that much of the opposition we received was from very responsible people who should know better.  We had even some hostile references in this House.  I refer to a statement by Senator MacDermot on the occasion when the Minister mentioned the purchase of gas masks. The Senator then said that that was money thrown away.  I wonder would he state to-day that the money was thrown away?  We had statements also from other public representatives which threw cold water on the service and made it very hard for us to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator permit me to point out that, by intervening in the debate, he is curtailing the limited amount of time within which the Parliamentary Secretary must reply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say that we had a parade of 150 A.R.P. workers of my area last Sunday. That parade consisted of more than nine men from each post in many cases.  We try to have at least six men for each post, but in many cases we have three eight-hour shifts, with three men on each shift, if we can regulate the work so as to fit in with the men's ordinary working hours.  We have been regarded as the Cinderella of the defence organisations, and there is the fact that certain people who got trained in this service went afterwards and joined the Local Security Force because it was more glamorous.  The fact that the local security men were allowed to carry rifles and that they were enabled to parade with them, made that work far more glamorous <Col N="2193" /> than the routine work of the A.R.P. If I am not taking up too much of the Parliamentary Secretary's time, I should like to add that we undoubtedly have had grievances.  Senator Douglas has exaggerated some of these grievances but he certainly has not exaggerated others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been defending this idea of organising an air raid precautions service in the country for the past nine or ten months, and on my first visit to the Seanad I expected that I would have to defend it rather valiantly and at great odds.  I am very much pleased to note, therefore, the line that Senator Douglas has taken.  I think he has really made the kind of speech that I should like to be able to make myself. He has put his finger on the trouble in relation to air raid precautions when he has called that service the Cinderella of the defence services.  In trying to organise the A.R.P. services for the past nine or ten months we have been working against the apathy of the general public, and, I would say, the apathy of the Opposition in the Dáil, or rather their active opposition&mdash;I cannot say anything about the Seanad, as I do not know what their idea is about it now&mdash;and I might as well say that, in my opinion, there has been apathy on the part of the Government also.  Therefore, it has been very difficult to organise an efficient and widespread A.R.P. organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator Douglas says in relation to the building up of a warden service is also correct.  The people of this country, to my mind, are very fond of glamour, and the newspapers are fond of headlines, and between the fondness of the people for glamour and the newspaper headlines that are devoted to another very important and more glamorous service, that is, the Local Security Force and the Army, we have had an idea inculcated into the minds of the general public and of the people who have joined the Warden Service that the latter service is not as self-sacrificing a service or as important or valuable a service as that given by men who are prepared <Col N="2194" /> to engage in forming fours and handling rifles.  Now, I take issue with that altogether.  In my opinion, a good warden must be a really good and a very intelligent citizen.  He has to do a rather hard course of training. He has to do a good deal of unobtrusive and unknown work and he has, as Senator Douglas again pointed out, to try to induce people to help him&mdash;people who are not only apathetic in giving him any help, but who also definitely deny information which it is their duty as citizens to give him and who refuse to give him any co-operation, with the result that the whole thing has been rather difficult up to now.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas made a couple of points which I should like to answer. When anybody asks me anything about money I am afraid I get rather muddled.  However, with regard to this question of a grant to employers building shelters for their employees, it is not a rebate of income-tax of any kind; it is a grant of 5/6 in the £ of their expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act says that it is only if it is capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is why I say I am muddled.  I do not quite know what the Senator means by capital expenditure, but if you spend £100 on building air-raid shelters for your employees you get a rebate of 5/6 in the £.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to satisfy the authorities that it is capital expenditure, and what is meant by capital expenditure is well known to the Revenue Commissioners.  I should be glad, however, if the Parliamentary Secretary would look into this matter and send me a statement on it which I could have published if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly do so, but I think the Senator is wrong.  I think the Revenue Commissioners do not come into this at all.  While the <Col N="2195" /> Senator has been very polite to me, I should like to say that I did not get sufficient notice to enable me to have all the necessary information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, Sir, that I wish to be proved wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hope to do so, Sepator.  With regard to the question of claims for work done before a specified date, there was a date fixed, the 31st December, 1939, but that went by the board, and there is no difficulty in meeting what you want at the present moment because a change has been made whereby I am enabled to extend the date to any particular time that is really required in fairness to the man who built the shelter.  That can be done.</P>
      <P>The question of badges is another case in point, as Senator Douglas points out.  Badges were made for the A.R.P. service and handed over to the Local Security Force.  A badge, I suppose, is not of any great value, except&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in so far as that in this case it showed that the Local Security Force should have priority over the air-raid wardens.  I think that is wrong.  I am very insistent on the fact that the wardens are quite as important, and, in many cases, much more important than any other force in the country.  With regard to the matter of equipment and its scarcity, I do not think there is any great scarcity of equipment now.  I should like to tell the Seanad what exactly has been done in the way of the provision of equipment generally.  In regard to public shelters, we have trench shelters for 7,000 people, basement shelters for 17,000 people, and overhead shelters for 7,000 people.  We have not yet completed our scheme but when the whole scheme is completed it will provide accommodation for something like 35,000 people in the various shelters. Now, these cost a lot of money and I do not think the general public ought <Col N="2196" /> to expect the Government to provide shelters for everybody in every place. We cannot go completely under the ground.  The Senator, however, has mentioned the question of private shelters.  I do think that it is definitely the duty of the people who can afford to build private shelters to do so.  If there were any warning to us in that regard that could be more drastic than that which was given to us in Wexford in the past few days, I do not know what it is.  I would advise people who can afford to build shelters to build them; and, after all, they do not cost such a lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am learning a lot here in the Seanad.  At any rate, it is really their duty and I should like to have in the Bill a compulsory clause to make employers provide shelters. You must remember, however, that up to now what we have got in regard to the provision of A.R.P. services has been got by simply begging from this person and that person.  We have not got anything voluntarily.  The people have been apathetic and even antagonistic. The Opposition in the Dáil has been very antagonistic, and I must say that, in my opinion, the Government have not been sufficiently sympathetic with our point of view.  What we have got has been simply by the grace of the people themselves.  We now have 73 fire-fighting machines for Dublin, Dun Laoghaire and scheduled areas, 44 for the scheduled areas, and 40 for the towns in this country of over 5,000 people.  With regard to respirators we have got 500,000 ordinary respirators, 19,000 babies' respirators <Col N="2197" /> and 25,000 children's respirators.  A further order for the same number and classes of respirators has been placed and we are waiting delivery. We have also 6,000 civilian duty respirators and 3,000 more have been ordered.  We have 8,000 service respirators and 3,000 more have been ordered.</P>

      <P>I still think that there is too much emphasis on gas masks and respirators.  I do not believe we are going to see any gas.</P>

      <P>I have never been keen on them myself, but while Senator MacDermot is a very responsible person, he has not got the responsibility of looking after the general public, and I cannot afford at the end of this war, during which undoubtedly all sorts of terror will be let loose on the people, to be held responsible for not providing them with gas masks, if gas has been used.</P>

      <P>We will come to the money.  Up to date, the total State expenditure on A.R.P. is £149,641 18s. 5d., and the Dublin Corporation has spent £36,000.  I do not think there has been a tremendous lot of money spent on A.R.P.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;for the provision of shelter and the other services.  I think we have got very good value for the money.  Senator Douglas also referred to what Ministers say.  I cannot help what Ministers say any more than I can help what Senators say, but I do believe that Ministers&mdash;I hope I will not be hauled over the coals for saying this&mdash;have not sufficiently stressed the necessity for A.R.P. and have not seemed to grasp that it is such an essential service.  I will not keep the Seanad any longer because it is late, but I should like to make a more detailed statement on the whole question of A.R.P.  I am glad that Senator <Col N="2198" /> Douglas has given me the opportunity of saying these few words.  He raised the matter in the right place and in the right manner.</P>
      <P>We are not only up against apathy and antagonism in our attempt to organise the services, but up against people who seem to be in too much of a hurry and who do not take the right steps to secure what they want.  Quite recently, a circular letter was sent to Ministers, to the T.D.s of the County and City of Dublin and to the leaders of the various denominations in regard to the sins of the A.R.P. service.</P>
      <P>People who do that sort of thing are not helpful.  If anybody is in any doubt, or in any way in want of help which we can give, if he comes to us first, we will try to give him the information and try to help him, but it is grossly unfair for people, in the guise of friends, to go out and stab us in the back.  If only for the manner in which he has raised this question, I am very thankful to Senator Douglas.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say a word about hospitalisation.  I have heard it said by a very high medical authority in the city that no arrangements were being made for hospitalisation in the event of an emergency.</P>

      <P>I do not quite understand what Senator O'Callaghan is worried about, but in regard to the provision of hospitalisation, first-aid and so on, I think a good deal has been done here in Dublin City.  The St. John Ambulance Brigade have complete control in the carrying out of first aid, and <Col N="2199" /> I should like to say a word of appreciation of the work the St. John Ambulance people have done.  They have done what I might call trojan work, and they have been most helpful to me in everything appertaining to their work.  The Irish Red Cross Society, which has been organised since the A.R.P. service became a subject for abuse, is also working very hard to perfect first-aid and medical services.  The Irish Medical Union is in constant consultation with the doctors of Local Government, the Army and the A.R.P. service in the matter of providing hospitalisation.  Also drugs and dressings for all the first-aid stations in the Twenty-Six Counties have been provided. The stuff has been purchased <Col N="2200" /> and, apart from the amounts of drugs, dressings, surgical appliances, etc., which have been accumulated as reserves in all the voluntary and Local Government hospitals in the country, we are purchasing this week sufficient drugs, dressings, and surgical necessaries for 50,000 casualties.  Arrangements have been made with various hospitals to take patients and casualty clearing hospitals have been arranged for here in Dublin.  While a good deal has been done throughout the country, we are taking up the whole question of dealing with air-raid casualties in the provincial areas during the next week.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 25th September, 1940.</P>
