    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1940 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the three emergency orders which are set out in the Schedule.  The orders relate to amendment of existing duties.  The first of these orders, No. 319 of 1939, is merely a clarification of an existing definition. There was formerly a duty of 9d. per square yard, and 6d. per square yard preferential rate, on compositions made of plaster of paris in sheets or slabs.  It is proposed to amend that definition so that it will read: &ldquo;Compositions which are made wholly or mainly of or from gypsum or calcium sulphate and which are imported in sheets or slabs.&rdquo;  The need for the amendment of the order arises from the fact that, in its present form, the <Col N="1998" /> duty has been found by the Revenue Commissioners to be somewhat difficult of administration.</P>
      <P>The second order in the Schedule is No. 73 of 1940.  There was formerly a duty of 45 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, and 30 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, preferential, on woven tissues, with a general exemption in respect of tissues which were under 1/6 per square yard in value.  The order which it is now sought to confirm has raised the exemption limit from 1/6 to 2/6 per square yard.</P>
      <P>The third order is No. 154 of 1940. There was formerly a duty of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, and 25 per cent. preferential, on certain agricultural machines.  The duty also applied to parts of these machines, with an exemption in respect of parts of machines other than plough parts of a value not exceeding 5/-.  The order which it is now sought to confirm has raised the exemption limit for these parts from 5/- in value to £2 in value.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed that the remaining stages of the Bill be taken now.</P>

    <P>(1)  Whenever a vacancy occurs in the membership of Seanad Eireann, the Clerk of Seanad Eireann shall, on the direction of Seanad Eireann, send to the Minister notice (in this Act referred to as notice of a vacancy) in writing of such vacancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 9, to delete the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were going to accept amendment No. 4, I should not move this at all.  This amendment is proposed for the purpose of simplifying the very elaborate machinery in the Bill.  This first amendment proposes to have notice given to the Taoiseach instead of to the Minister.  The second amendment in my name proposes to give power to the Taoiseach to appoint the person direct and substitutes simple appointment by the Taoiseach&mdash; subject to the qualification in amendment No. 3 that he should have regard to the knowledge, practical experience and other qualifications of the deceased, resigned or disqualified member&mdash;for what I regard as the almost fantastic machinery which the Bill contains.  I am not proposing the amendment with the view that vacancies in the Seanad should be filled by the Prime Minister for the time being: I propose it simply because I think it is a better scheme than that in the Bill.  This House purports to be a vocational House, but it is in no degree and to no extent whatever a vocational House.  The <Col N="2000" /> members were elected by a very complicated and very creaking machinery and it is proposed in the following Section 6 of the Bill that vacancies shall be filled by a machinery rather similar.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme which the Bill itself contains, three names will eventually make their way to the Taoiseach and he will then appoint the one whom he thinks fit.  In other words, in spite of all the elaborate machinery in the Bill, the process is not a process of election at all, but a process of appointment by the Taoiseach.  I think it would be better to give him that power direct.  I have not gone to the trouble of finding out the chances of an individual who was put upon one of these vocational panels, but the chance would be very small.  The chances in this case will be great, because one person out of three must be selected.  Therefore, there will be considerable activity in putting all this machinery into operation and getting the three names, but it seems to me that, seeing that the Taoiseach is going to appoint, in any event, it would be much simpler and fairer if the amendment I have on the Order Paper were accepted.</P>
    <P>I should like to set Senator Quirke's mind at rest, and say that I am not speaking with reference to the present Taoiseach or the present Government, but that I am talking about any Taoiseach to whom the three names may be presented.  It is only human that he should select from the three names the person who appears most suitable to himself.  Thus, you may easily have a position in which a Senator who had a particular association in the Seanad and in the country will have substituted for him another Senator who may belong to the same profession, or a like profession, but entirely of a different point of view with regard to public policy.  If the amendment were accepted, the Taoiseach, publicly and on his own responsibility, would have to appoint a person to fill the vacancy, and in doing so would be obliged to take into consideration the knowledge, practical experience, and other qualifications of the deceased member.  This would simplify the procedure in the Bill and <Col N="2001" /> would make it more straightforward, more honest and more realistic, and I believe it would produce better results in the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill provides that three names must be put forward, there is no reason to suppose that that necessarily will happen.  It is quite conceivable that two persons might be selected fairly easily, but there may be a tie for the third and there seems to be no machinery by which a decision can be forced regarding the third&mdash;unless two names are put into a hat and one is drawn out, which probably would not be a very good plan.  This might cause adjournment after adjournment and there may be no progress until someone would be unable to cast a vote through being sick or for some other reason.  There is nothing in the Bill to show how a decision can be forced in a position like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that what Senator Robinson says is substantially correct.  In spite of the provision in Section 18, that if you have not got three you start all over again, there is no limit provided as to the number of times which you can start all over again, and yet the Taoiseach will never get the chance of choosing between two.  There will never be a vacancy filled unless by some means or other he receives three names from which to select.  At least, that is my reading of it.  Personally, I would prefer a system of co-option, but I cannot help feeling that a person like the Taoiseach would find himself in a rather unsatisfactory position when faced with the responsibility of choosing one person from three names put forward, all of sufficient importance to represent panels chosen by representative bodies.  It would be far better to go the whole way and let this body nominate one person.  There may be some justification for having the same principle as that on which the House was elected, though I am not saying it would be identical.  It would not, nor is the <Col N="2002" /> appointment by the Taoiseach from three names identical, either.</P>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that if you must have the principle that a person has to be chosen by the Prime Minister, it would be far better to give him complete authority.  As far as the fundamental difference is concerned, it is not very great.  Experience has shown that the number of vacancies for what we might call the normal period between elections is not very great and it is not going to make any vital difference. Where possible, it is desirable to improve the Seanad or, at any rate, not in any way to lessen its capacity, by co-option.  The filling of a vacancy of this kind quite frequently provides an opportunity to introduce somebody well known to the public who would not be likely to go forward under the system provided here.  I would much prefer the amendment to the scheme in the Bill, but if it is not possible to amend it, and if you must have the system of the Bill, then the Committee, that must meet, should take responsibility for its action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to put another point which I omitted when speaking previously?  In order to frame this amendment I looked up Article 18 of the Constitution dealing with Seanad Eireann.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Eireann shall be composed of 60 members, of whom 11 shall be nominated members and 49 shall be elected members.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, this provision by which the Taoiseach appoints one out of three is in no circumstances an election.  I wonder if any consideration has been given to that legal or Constitutional point of view?  The Bill proposes the appointment by the Taoiseach of one person out of three.  I know that subsequently in the same Article of the Constitution there is a proviso dealing with the filling of casual vacancies. Section 10, paragraph 3 of the Article says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Casual vacancies in the number of the elected members of Seanad Eireann shall be filled in the manner provided by law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> I wonder can the law provide that elected members shall not be elected?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better deal with that point first.  The constitutional aspects of this matter have been considered and it is felt that the method proposed here can be considered an election.  Certainly, if the Senator thinks that the method I am proposing in this Bill is unconstitutional, then his own amendment is doubly unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is an election.  These nominating bodies select three persons.  The picking out of one of these selected or elected members is certainly a method of election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly to give the Taoiseach power to select straight away one person in addition to the power he already has of selecting 11 others would be outside the Constitution altogether.  Perhaps I might deal at this stage with the point raised by Senator Robinson.  It arises, I think, out of Section 14 of the Bill and although we have not reached that section yet, I might as well deal with the matter now.  Section 14, paragraph (h), says:</P>
      <P>Every question which shall arise at or in relation to the taking of the poll shall be decided by the Seanad returning officer and his decision on any such question shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that he selects one of two people if the deadlock which I mentioned should arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2004" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>He can do that if there is no other method of dealing with it.  He has to submit three names to the Taoiseach.  To come to the amendment itself, the whole case made against the section is that the machinery is very cumbersome.  As against that, it may be pointed out that these vacancies arise very seldom and the machinery is in existence already. It has been set up under the Principal Act and it is there available.  Since it has been set up under the Principal Act, as a natural consequence it should be utilised for the filling of casual vacancies.  When a person who is a member of the Seanad dies, resigns or is disqualified, these nominating bodies should certainly have a say in the selection of a person to take his place. I think it may safely be assumed that the nominating bodies will be able to select three persons representing the particular point of view which had been represented by the person deceased or the person who resigned or was disqualified. They stand for a point of view also and they will select persons whom they regard as qualified to represent that particular vocational point of view.  They send forward three names and out of the three names so submitted the Taoiseach will make his selection.  In that way they will be able to say that the person appointed is qualified to take the place of the person who previously represented them in the Seanad and that he represents their point of view.  I do not think it right that power should be handed over to any Taoiseach to pick out whom he likes.  The fact that the three names must come from the nominating bodies ensures that whoever is appointed ultimately will represent their point of view as did the previous Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Government point of view is that this is constitutional because it is an election?  I look upon it as constitutional but I came to the conclusion that it was constitutional because the Constitution specifically says that the law should provide for the filling of casual vacancies.  If you are, however, depending on the court to decide that this is an election, you are on <Col N="2005" /> extremely thin ice.  I was perhaps guilty of saying that the method proposed in the Bill is cumbersome.  I still think it is cumbersome but I do not think it is excessive, if you must have that system.  On the whole it has been prepared with great care. Nothing that one can think of has been left out.  If you must have an elaborate system of this kind, I find no fault with the machinery but I do not agree with the Minister when he says that all the machinery is there at present.  The committee has to be set up.  That committee is not there at present.  It is quite one thing to have a nominating body to send forward the names of two persons who, they think, will be suitable Senators but I think it is giving away no secrets to say that quite a number of these bodies do not choose persons who are the most representative of their trade or profession. They choose two persons hoping that one may get votes from one political side and the other get votes from the other political side.</P>
      <P>We certainly would be suffering under an illusion altogether if we were to think that the nominating bodies in all cases, or even, I think, in most cases, sat down simply to put forward the persons who were the best representatives of their particular professions. I am told, however, that there were one or two of these bodies who did so, that the results were nil, and that there has been a considerable grievance.  I honestly believe that the setting up of a committee, with three representatives from each of these bodies which, collectively, on the rare occasions on which a vacancy may occur in the Seanad, will send forward three names, of whom the Taoiseach will choose one, will create more dissatisfaction amongst the nominating bodies, many of whom are not at all satisfied at the present time.  From their point of view, it only means that they will have gone through a good deal of trouble and that the result, for the vast majority of them, will be just nothing at all.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the procedure set out in the Bill is quite all right, and the more one <Col N="2006" /> thinks of it the better it appears to be, or at least, the more I think of it, the better it appears to me.  At first sight, I thought that it would be better for the nominating bodies to select their own men definitely and to eliminate any question of selection by the Taoiseach, but on thinking the matter over, it appeared to me that it might lead to overlapping if it were entirely left to the nominating bodies.  Take such a section as the agricultural section, for instance.  It might happen that there would be a vacancy in the agricultural section in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we know that Senator Counihan represents the live-stock interests in the House here. I think the live-stock people have only one representative in this House, but it might happen that they would have two representatives, and then there is the possibility that a vacancy might occur in some other branch of the agricultural section, such as the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society or perhaps the Beet Growers' Association. They might lose a member in this House and then it could easily happen that the live-stock people would be able to get the third candidate as one of the three selected by the nominating body.  It would then be very useful indeed that the Taoiseach should have the right to select a candidate from amongst the three, so as to prevent over-representation or overlapping in the way I have suggested, because it would be very unfair if the live-stock interests were to have three representatives in this House.  For that reason I would be in favour of giving the Taoiseach the right to select one out of the three candidates.  As I say, without that, there would be the danger of overlapping and one section might get too much representation in this House.  If the Taoiseach did not have the right to make the final selection, it would be possible for one section, such as the beet growers, the Irish <Col N="2007" /> Agricultural Organisation Society, or the live-stock people, to get excessive representation in the House, and that would be very undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to take part in this debate, but it struck me, from what the Minister said, that in connection with this system he, perhaps, had in mind Article 18 of the Constitution.  I should think&mdash;although I do not pretend to speak with any authority on the matter&mdash;that, inasmuch as that Article proposes, and does not put any limitation to, legislation for filling casual vacancies in the Seanad, Article 18 is a thing that we need not worry about.  On the other hand, the system proposed by the Government seems to me merely to be trying, by a sort of side wind, to get around that Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that in the discussion of this Bill everybody who spoke has put what seems to me to be a particular stress on the vocational side of this thing. Now, I object to that, because I believe that, although something could be done with regard to a vocational council, so far as this body is concerned, however, we are only misrepresenting vocationalism here.  To begin with, and without meaning any offence to my Labour colleagues, the idea of having Labour as a vocation is perfectly absurd and is a complete negation of the whole idea of vocationalism. Then, when we consider the functions of the Seanad here, it must be remembered that we deal with every form of legislation here, and there is nothing in a man being a university professor, a farmer, or a carpenter, that particularly qualifies him for dealing with legislation that is directed towards the common good in general.  It seems to me that the purpose of a vocational council would be to look after certain affairs if the Government took away from itself and gave to the council its arrogated functions with regard to the economic activities of the people in the country and allowed that council absolute power, subject, of course, to the State as a juridical entity in relation to economic functions.  The fact, however, that a man is some kind of a <Col N="2008" /> specialist in economic production does not necessarily give him qualifications as a legislator.  This body here has very limited powers, but these powers relate to all the legislation for the common good of the people.  Consequently, I feel that this parade of the word &ldquo;vocationalism&rdquo; with regard to this body here is calculated to have a very bad effect on the whole idea of vocational organisation in this country. I only got up to speak because it is so irritating to hear this stress being put upon vocationalism in connection with a body such as this where vocationalism has no power whatever.  To suggest that we here are a vocational body is to give a quite wrong idea of what vocationalism really is.  The end aimed at by vocationalism is not attained by this body here, and this body is not a vocational body.  Both from the point of view of the ordinary functions of the Seanad and that of vocationalism, the word is being used wrongly, and it seems to me that the simplest and most satisfactory method that we should consider for the filling of casual vacancies here would be that which would give us the best form of Seanad; that is, if there is no constitutional objection.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he did not think the power of nominating should be given to any Taoiseach.  I say that it should be given to any Taoiseach because, if you cannot trust a Taoiseach for that purpose, you certainly cannot trust him to fulfil the functions of his office.  I cannot argue very well about this because the Minister said, or suggested&mdash;or at least it could be read into what he said&mdash;that this method of the so-called vocational bodies nominating, and the Taoiseach selecting, gets around an awkwardness in the Constitution.  I myself should think that there is no need to worry about that.  Although I am not a lawyer, I should think that the next Article, which says that what this Bill aims at should be according to law, gives the Legislature an unrestricted scope for deciding what that law should be.  I know that there is not much good in arguing about this if the Government has decided upon this form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we are fortified in two ways here: first, by what I have already said about an election, and then by Article 18, Section 10 (3), which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Casual vacancies in the number of the elected members of Seanad Eireann shall be filled in the manner provided by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides how Seanad vacancies are to be filled.  I do not want it to be inferred that, when I say that I would not leave the power to any Taoiseach, it could not be left, perhaps, in a Taoiseach's hands, but there are vocational bodies already there&mdash;the machinery is there&mdash;and I think it is only right that they should have some say in the selection of the persons to go forward.  That leaves the Taoiseach above a certain amount of criticism and it gives these people a way in which they can find a suitable person to be selected from the group. I do not want to say anything more about it, Sir.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the vocational bodies have absolutely no say as to who will be elected to this House at a general election.  Everybody knows that, and the Minister realises it just as much as I realise it. They have nothing to do with the election, and nobody has been elected to this House because of his vocational position in the country, and everybody knows it.  Of course, I am sure Senator O'Donovan is mad to be allowed to say that he was elected just because he was a veterinary surgeon.</P>

      <P>Along with being a veterinary surgeon, Senator O'Donovan <Col N="2010" /> wants to be a chairman also, and they are very different things.  What I was saying is that vocational bodies had nothing to do with election to this House.  They put up a panel and the persons on that panel were put on it, not as a result of the vocational idea, but as a result of something which was purely political, which was meant to be political, and which has produced a political result.  Senator O'Callaghan made a point which I think he will find completely solved if he votes for my amendment.  He takes as an example the dreadful case in which the only representative of the Live Stock Association in this House might leave the House.  I am entirely at one with Senator O'Callaghan in feeling that that would be a dreadful disaster.  He wants to be sure that one representative of the live-stock industry would be nominated in his place.</P>

      <P>I want to explain that, if I may.  Let us take, for example, that a vacancy occurred, that the person who previously held the seat was a representative of the live-stock industry.  Senator O'Callaghan says he would hate to see a beet grower appointed to that vacancy. Surely, under this particular scheme in the Bill, that might happen, but under my amendment it could not, because the Taoiseach would make the appointment direct and in making the appointment would be bound by this particular proviso in the law that, in making an appointment under the preceding sub-section, the Taoiseach shall have regard to the knowledge, practical experience and other qualifications of the deceased, resigned or disqualified member.  So that, confronted with a vacancy which arose from the resignation, let us say, of a member of the Seanad who represented the beet growers, the Taoiseach, whoever he might be at the <Col N="2011" /> moment, would be practically bound to appoint a person with similar knowledge, practical experience and other qualifications.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question with regard to sub-section (h).  I understood from the speech of the Minister that under this sub-section the Seanad returning officer could do anything and that he could choose between two or three if there happened to be equal votes and that also, presumably, would be described by the Minister as an election. But when I look at paragraph (h) it appears that if there were not any votes at all he could put up three names according to the interpretation of the Minister, because there is nothing whatever to show that he can choose between two if they happen to be equal, but it does say that every question which shall arise shall be decided by the Seanad returning officer.  If three or four names were proposed and the meeting refused to vote he could choose the three.  I am extremely doubtful if the court would hold that &ldquo;every question that arose at a poll&rdquo; included the right to pick between two of the candidates and, with very great respect to the Minister, I doubt very much if &ldquo;every question arising at a poll&rdquo; could actually include that casting vote.  I do not regard it as very serious.</P>

I understand that the reason why some provision such as the Senator suggests was not inserted was that we did not want to elaborate certain rules.  It would tend to more confusion perhaps. A question like that is a matter for him to decide.  He is presiding and it is for him to decide what method he is going to adopt.  If there is a difficulty and if there is no likelihood of getting away from that position by further elections, I presume the returning officer has to make some regulation that will enable him to get out of that impasse.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 27 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Sections 5 to 27, inclusive, of this Act shall not come into effect until an order is made by the Minister and such order shall not be made before January 1st, 1943.</P>
      <P>(2)  Until an order is made by the Minister under the preceding sub-section vacancies in the membership of Seanad Eireann shall be filled by a vote of Seanad Eireann and whenever a vacancy occurs in the membership of Seanad Eireann the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Eireann shall at the next meeting of the Seanad give notice of the same. The Seanad shall thereupon fix a date at an interval of not less than three weeks for the holding of an election to fill the vacancy.  The method of nomination and election shall be decided by Seanad Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Stage of this Bill I gave it as my view that there was a great deal to be said for the filling of casual vacancies by co-option.  That was based on my experience in the Seanad over a considerable period, and I am still very definitely of the opinion that, in spite of all that may be said against this or any other Seanad, you will get commonsense agreement in 99 out of 100 cases that arise for co-option and you will get, as a rule, a good Senator.  The Minister more or less stated&mdash;and there is no doubt about his attitude&mdash;that he did not favour that and that he would not accept an amendment to that effect, but it seems to me that, whatever may be said about that ultimately, there is a very strong case to be made for having a system of co-option at any rate during the present emergency, for a couple of years' time.  It will avoid the setting up of this machinery during a time when everything more or less is upset.  It will give a chance of trying how it works.  The Bill would be passed into law under my amendment and after a period&mdash;and I do not mind <Col N="2014" /> shortening that period if it is thought better&mdash;the Government can bring in the whole scheme because they have decided either that the emergency is passed and that it is better to have the whole scheme or that the idea of co-option for vacancies has not worked satisfactorily in practice.  The effect of my amendment really is that after a period of a little over two years the Government shall decide then whether they want this whole scheme brought in or whether they would allow co-option to continue, but during that period there would be co-option for vacancies.</P>
    <P>There was sent to members of the Seanad Standing Orders of the previous Seanad which show that the practice and system adopted then seems to have met with pretty fair agreement.  It is just possible that the first sub-section of my amendment would meet with more approval if it was worded to read &ldquo;during the period of emergency, as stated in the Emergency Powers Act.&rdquo;  That could be ended by an order of the Government or by an extension of this Bill. My idea is that it is obvious it will not want to bother setting up a new committee at present, as the Government is concerned with acute and urgent matters, and vacancies which might exist during this period could be promptly dealt with without setting up this machinery, while enabling the Government to have the principle which they, apparently, hold so dear, if they are still of that opinion.  I am not at all sure that they would be if they saw co-option working in practice. I have not put down an amendment which would in effect reject the Bill and replace it by co-option, but I am proposing a system of co-option for a short period.  I think there is very definite merit in a political Party having a system of co-option.  I had first intended to put this down as an alternative to the Bill, but I came to the conclusion that that more or less was useless, as the Government would not agree, and if that is their mind still, I would rather have no Bill than an elaborate scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <P>When I saw the amendment I did not know what the <Col N="2015" /> Senator had in mind.  He proposes to put the operation of these sections back until January, 1943, or until an order is made by the Minister.  I was wondering what circumstances and conditions would apply when that order was going to be put into operation. The Senator explained to-day that what he has in mind is the present emergency.  I do not know that matters of this sort could be postponed in this way.  If so, I suppose it would be as well to close down altogether.  There are certain things that cannot be done in the present emergency, but people are not prevented carrying out an election of candidates for casual vacancies which very seldom arise in this House. There is only one vacancy at present. Unless we were unable to meet or that nominating bodies could not meet, or some circumstances like that arose, there would be no purpose whatever in postponing the operation of the Bill until the emergency was over.  As conditions obtain these bodies are registered nominating bodies, and they have only to select representatives and vote.  While they are in a position to do that, there is no case to be made for waiting until the emergency is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a case for the amendment on the merits, apart from the emergency, the same case as was made for the other amendment. Bye-elections take place in the Dáil for various reasons, one reason being, as indicated recently in the Dáil, to indicate the political position in the country.  The Dáil is elected on a regional and political basis.  This House is not elected on a regional basis, and there is no objection at all to giving this House power to fill vacancies.  The amendment simply asks, since we are beginning with a new constitution, that we should have an experimental period for filling vacancies, by substituting for the machinery in the Bill which has already been declared to be elaborate, a simple proposal.  I think what is now proposed would be a much better scheme.  The least this House might <Col N="2016" /> be given is the power to fill casual vacancies amongst elected members, not those in the first instance nominated by the Taoiseach.  The amendment would provide a simple method, and if it were accepted and inserted in the Bill, after a couple of vacancies had been filled if everything was done in a manner to which few people could take exception, then the other machinery would not come into operation at all.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal to be said for following the procedure that was followed by the previous Seanad.  It might be followed here, because people who sit together, even though they differ, get to know one another and to appreciate certain principles.  This would produce a more satisfactory scheme for filling casual vacancies if this House were allowed to co-opt, as it would be bound to take into consideration the type of person who had left, or had died, and would fill vacancies with reference to his experience, practical knowledge, general qualifications and standing.  The proposal here is not new.  It worked admirably before.  There was only one instance, I understand, where there was a difference about the filling of a casual vacancy.  This proposal should be tried.  We should be paying a compliment to ourselves by deciding to adopt this amendment instead of the machinery in the Bill.  The amendment leaves the Minister his Bill, but simply asks him to make an experiment in the filling of a few vacancies to see what happens.  If the experiment was made I believe it would be successful and would be a compliment to ourselves, and for that reason I think the amendment should be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that in my desire not to be an alarmist I failed to interpret the Minister's mind with regard to the emergency.  If an emergency arose, what is proposed could be carried out, but we are making preparations, to put it mildly, for something which may not happen.  I can easily see that in the provision for the Dáil sub-panel, and for sending out notices, time is required, and that that <Col N="2017" /> may prove extremely awkward if not impracticable in making a selection. When I spoke of a period of emergency and put down 1943, I had in mind that there was a very strong case for a simple method of filling vacancies. Without being an alarmist I can easily see a situation arising where it would be desirable to have as many members as possible of both Houses available, when it might not be possible to have full Houses.  The nominating bodies in Dublin might be able to come together and carry out the machinery, but I can see difficulties in carrying out <Col N="2018" /> an election for the Dáil sub-panel.  I have given up the idea of persuading the Minister against the Bill, but for a short period I think he might try the system of co-option which, it appears to me, would be extremely convenient.  I had hoped that he would meet us in that respect.  If 1943 seems too long I am willing to change the figures to 1942.</P>

      <P>I should like to indicate my objection to this Bill.  I said on the Second Reading that the notion that this was a vocational House, or that it was elected on a vocational basis, was false; that it was a fraud upon the people and that the Bill was elaborating machinery to maintain the fraud.  The division that we have seen taken just now is a complete proof of that.  I think the Bill should not pass, but I suppose we are powerless to keep it from passing.

It is ridiculous that such statements should be made.  The fact that a certain group on the other side stick together on all possible occasions is no indication that the House is not a vocational body.  Even to-day, Senators voted with the official Opposition, Senators who disagree with them on every other possible thing that could be imagined. I think it is only right that somebody should voice resentment at the statements made by Senators Hayes and Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator Quirke is correct and I am rather sorry for Senator O'Donovan. Senator Hayes has said that this is not a vocational body.  It is not, and it should not be for the functions of this body.  Senator Quirke tries to prove that Senator Hayes is wrong by assuming that what he has said is a reference to certain people in this House voting together.  I do not see much harm in that.  A law becomes a law here by virtue of a majority vote. There has been a lot of condemnation of Party Government, but, if you are going to have a Government responsible for the well-being of the country, it must have some assurance that it has a fairly loyal majority behind it. I see no objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the pretence that this is a vocational body, although it hurts Senator O'Donovan's feelings to hear me reiterate, I intend to reiterate.  I remember once a woman who had the name of being very beautiful.  A man who did not like her was a draughtsman, and he drew a caricature of her, and it was hard to see her afterwards without seeing her in terms of the caricature.  People are judging vocationalism by this Seanad, and that is a harmful thing because this Seanad is not vocational.  Nevertheless, people look at the Seanad and say it is <Col N="2020" /> vocational, whether it is good or bad. Mind you, I am not saying anything against the Seanad.  Does this body fulfil, or is it designed to fulfil, the functions that would be appropriate to a council or corporation?  It does not. Is this body a vocational body representing various vocational functions in the country?  It is not.</P>
    <P>I gave one instance by reason of the fact that labour is represented here. Take it that you are engaged in a vocation that is, shall I say, objectivised, in the sense of a thing made or done.  For instance, there are biscuits made in this country.  All those who participate in the making of those useful things, biscuits, might be regarded as being in a corporation. The girl who wraps the biscuits up in paper, or puts them in tins, is only one part of it.  The director of the company is another.  Therefore, the moment that you segregate labour you indicate clearly that this is quite the opposite of a vocational body.  I am not going to go into why the method of election for this body was decided upon.  It may have been decided upon with the idea that it was a step towards vocationalism.  To my mind it was a step away from vocationalism. I think that, after the experience the Government have had, the clear lesson they should have drawn was that you harm vocationalism by putting the mask of vocationalism on something which is not vocational.  Senator Quirke says this is a vocational body, and thinks that the argument against its being a vocational body is that the people on this side of the House, or some portion of them, do not vote together with the people on that side of the House, but that has nothing whatever to do with it.  It would, perhaps, be unfair to say that one votes otherwise than the way one believes to be for the public good, but I can conceive people on the other side saying that they might do more harm, and cause a disintegration in the general line of Government policy, if they were to vote against the Government, even though they might think that in relation to some particular point the Government's policy was wrong.  I am not going to sit here and listen to <Col N="2021" /> people describing this as a vocational body.  We are elected by a body of people who think in terms political, and it is quite right that it should be so until the society of people in this country are organised vocationally. When they are organised vocationally to the total of the vocational avocations of the people of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Vocationalism is represented by the people, in their various avocations, earning their living, and in doing so producing a totality of good to be at the service of the people. On the point of vocationalism, as I see it, this Government up to the time of the war had, more than any other Government in Europe that was not already labelled totalitarian, extended the powers of Government over the lives of the people to a most unwarrantable degree, a degree definitely harmful to the purposes of vocationalism.  In my opinion the Government should limit itself to its true functions.  One of its true functions is that of a juridical entity: but, so far as the vocational functions of the people in the country are concerned, that they themselves would organise corporations which would be autonomous societies, and that in relation to what they were dealing with they would be able to arrange each corporation for itself.  Those corporations would then regulate the relationships between one another, and where disagreements existed they would appeal for the arbitration of the State&mdash;the juridical entity.  That is not the case with regard to this House.  You may say that the girl who wraps up the biscuits should be represented here. Very well.  An official has decided as to what bodies are eligible for representation here.  I do not know what <Col N="2022" /> was the final decision, but I remember that in the case of the first Seanad election there was a question as to what made a man eligible to represent what was called vocational labour.  Apart from the fact that the Labour Council itself is anti-vocational, the decision of the official exaggerated that and has multiplied it.  I got up to speak on this because Senator Quirke, quite clearly, misunderstands our point of view.</P>

      <P>A lot of people have got up to denounce Party-Government, but once a lot depends on a majority in the Legislature, then the Government, which has responsibility not merely for one aspect of policy but for the total policy, should have a fairly secure and steady majority until another Government takes its place.  The Minister for Finance, speaking here last week, said that practically every one of us, while urging economy, was ready to propose additional expenditure.  I do not want to pat myself on the back, but I do not remember any occasion on which I proposed additional expenditure. I may have proposed that money should be spent on one thing rather than on another, but I do not think I ever proposed additional expenditure simply.  You may have the position in which more services are required.  You get up and vote for them, but when more taxation is proposed to finance them you get up and vote against it.  A situation of that kind would make government practically impossible and, as we know, government is absolutely necessary.  If I may digress slightly, we have this wretched proportional representation system in this country, a system which is based on an absolute fallacy.</P>

      <P>I am certain the Senator's remark was intended to be humorous and not meant seriously. The reason I am speaking now is because I want to give my reasons for voting against the Final Stage of this Bill.  Whether this House be semi-vocational, vocational or not vocational, I still do not believe that the system outlined in this Bill is the best way to get vacancies filled.  I am further of the opinion that during the next six, seven or eight months it is quite undesirable to have elections under this system.  If this Bill is rejected by the Seanad, it means that <Col N="2024" /> it can be passed over our heads, and that we will have no vacancies filled for the next few months.  I suggest that would not be as great a calamity as that this House should decide it was entirely in favour of this system.  The measure designed for filling vacancies in this House ought not to be simply a Party one.  I do not understand Senator Quirke's resentment at all.  He has often assured me that the members of this House were entirely free to vote as they thought fit and if we or the Minister succeeded in persuading 25 members that the system of co-option was bad, instead of showing resentment, he should be satisfied.  If a majority of them were to accept responsibility for the details of the Bill they can accept that on the Final Stage.  If I vote against it, there is no question of affecting the life or otherwise of the Government; it is only a question as to whether there are vacancies to be filled in the next five months.  At any rate we can deal with this entirely on its merits without any regard to the life or otherwise of the Government.  I do not agree with Senator Fitzgerald when he suggests that it is essential that in the Second Chamber the Government should always have a working majority.  I cannot agree with that.  I think his remarks would apply quite soundly to the Dáil, but they do not apply here at all.  However, I do not think that is relevant.  I just mentioned it because I do not want to be taken as holding that view.</P>

I want to say this, that certainly no fault can be found with the framers of the legislation of the Principal Act.  They went out to provide a framework as far as possible and to secure here a framework of the machinery for a vocational Seanad.  To some extent that has succeeded. Some Senators say that is not so.  However, the very vacancy which <Col N="2025" /> exists arose from the framework of that Bill; in ordinary circumstances, the Senator whose death caused the vacancy would not have been here at all.  Senator O'Callaghan could say too that but for that framework he and others could not have found their way here at all.  They represent certain vocations in the country.  As time goes on I think the framework of the Bill would succeed much better than it has <Col N="2026" /> in the past.  In any case that Act is there.  The machinery is there and all we are doing under this Bill is to provide for the casual vacancies that arise, but making a change in that from what obtains under the Principal Act with regard to the Seanad as a whole would be absolutely inconsistent.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulation, the Minister for Finance stabilised the cost-of-living bonus applicable to Government servants at the figure 85 which obtained during the six months to 30th of last month. This Bill will restrict the upward variation of the bonus in the case of local officers and servants to the figure in operation last month.  The same restriction will apply to bonus on pension.</P>
      <P>The number of local officers and servants who have a variable bonus is limited.  Local authorities generally did not adopt the Civil Service scheme, but some authorities did.  The Dublin Corporation and the vocational education committees and committees of agriculture adopted the Civil Service scheme to a large extent.  It is only persons with variable bonus that will be affected by this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important in the present emergency that any tendency to increased expenditure on the remuneration of particular classes at the expense of other sections of the community should be avoided.  Additional burden will be thrown on everybody and local authorities like other bodies have a duty to guard against the danger to our economic position which would follow from rising salaries and wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> As I stated, the Minister for Finance has stabilised the bonus with regard to civil servants.  It is thought right that those other people employed by local authorities, some of them perhaps in a better position than civil servants, should have their bonus stabilised also.  It applies only to a very limited number of officials&mdash;the officials of vocational committees and of committees of agriculture and the officials of the Dublin Corporation and one or two other bodies.</P>

We have borough councils, county councils and urban councils, but I did not think we had boards of guardians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill, which I think is practically a wage-cutting device.  There is no great sum of money involved and certain classes seem to be picked out for a reduction of wages.  We know that the record of the previous Government was a very bad one in regard to wage-cutting. There was a series of cuts made in wages which was responsible for creating much discontent with the previous Government and putting them out of power.  I do not think that this Government want to follow the same road.  Wage-earners will react in the end to these cuts in wages.  Pin pricks inflicted on various classes of people are inclined to become poisonous to the body politic and result in serious opposition to Government work. Instead of giving a good example to private employers, the Government are giving a very bad example.  The cost of living has soared up in the last 20 years by nearly 100 per cent., and the Government's way of dealing with that situation is to cut down wages.  In the other House, the Bill was rushed through all its stages and scarcely any time for criticism was given.  Surely it would be simple justice for employers to have had consultation with the representatives of their employees before this Draconian method of inflicting a cut in wages by Act of Parliament was adopted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further point that this is a direct violation of a statutory guarantee given in the Act of 1930.  A statutory guarantee was given to certain classes of employees, including some of the employees affected by this Bill.  Under Section 99 of the Act, employees transferred from the old technical committees to the new vocational committees were given a guarantee that their conditions would not be worsened.  Their basic salary was fixed at a low figure, on the understanding that the cost-of-living bonus would increase or decrease according as the figure increased or decreased. That was a fairly just arrangement, but the Government now stabilises the figure at 85, which is much below the present cost-of-living figure.  It is a serious thing, I suggest, to break statutory guarantees.  It destroys <Col N="2029" /> people's faith in Government.  You pass an Act to-day giving a statutory guarantee, which gives a certain feeling of settlement and ease to those affected, but they find next day that the statutory guarantee is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, will plead the exigencies of the case, but pleading the exigencies of the case in a matter like this is not, I think, sufficient reason.  The Government are bound in honour by an Act of their predecessors and to violate that Act is a very bad procedure.  It destroys the confidence of the people and creates a good deal of uneasiness amongst a very important class of public servants who are doing work of a very specialised nature.  To have such people distressed by the perpetual fear of having their rights&mdash;because rights they undoubtedly are&mdash;filched from them is very bad for administration as it prevents these people from giving the best possible in them.  There was no consultation with the representatives of these people who have organisations and officers to represent them, and the Government, so far as I know, had no contact with them before inflicting this cut.  I happened to be connected for a number of years with vocational employees and I know the work which they are doing, and I know the perpetual dread which has haunted them for some time past that their conditions would be gradually worsened. As an example, the salary of an officer of the highest grade 20 years ago was £430.  At present, it is £300 odd, the difference being £113 per annum. That is an extraordinary reduction in salary, considering that the cost-of-living index figure, when the higher salary was paid, was much lower than it is at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill also affects the pensions of officers and that is a very important point.  Their pension is a basic figure and the cost of living is added to it. If men have served 40 years in a particular job and then find that their pension is being filched from them, it is pension-cutting on a large scale.  It was bad enough to take 1/- a week off old age pensions, but this is a much heavier cut, and very old people who <Col N="2030" /> had undertaken certain commitments in life will now find that they cannot carry on on their attenuated pensions. I suggest that the Bill should not apply to officers who were given a statutory guarantee by the Act of 1930, that that guarantee should not be violated.  I also suggest that the cost-of-living figure on the date on which the Bill comes into operation should be adopted.  If any figure is to be maintained, it should be that figure and not the figure of 85, which is much lower than the present figure.  It would prevent the bonus from rising in future and give some measure of stability and satisfaction to those affected.  I think the Bill, which will not enrich the Central Fund by any considerable amount, is an unfortunate Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some misgivings about the propriety of this Bill, and I find myself in agreement with a good deal of what has been said by Senator Cummins.  I think it is always a mischievous principle, on the face of it, to interfere with a contract by legislation, and I do not think the House should pass such a Bill as this on a few moments' consideration and without giving thought to the fact that they are interfering with a contract between certain employees and their employers. As the Senator has pointed out, some of these employments have a statutory sanction already given to them, but, whether they have statutory sanction or not, it seems to me improper that the House, without grave consideration, without very serious reason, should exercise itself at all to interfere with existing contracts.  More particularly, I think, is that the case where the contract is between a class of public servants and the authorities which employ them and for whose safeguard the Government, and, behind the Government, the Oireachtas, has a certain responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people took their appointments on a certain contract.  They believed that they had the guarantee of the State behind them for the fulfilment of that contract, but when it becomes a little inconvenient, the Government invites the Houses of the Oireachtas to vary that contract as against an <Col N="2031" /> employee and in favour of a public employer.  That certainly gives me some misgivings and I do not like to agree without uttering a protest.  I have studied very carefully what the Minister said when he was conducting the Bill through the other House, and have found it hard to find any justification for the measure.  There were two points which he stressed, neither of which I thought convincing.  He stated that the object of the Bill was to put these employees on the same lines as civil servants.  That opened at once a prior question as to how civil servants were dealt with.  It appears that civil servants were dealt with by an order of the Government&mdash;a vicious system of employers regulating the position of their employees without considering the matter with the employees.</P>
    <P>That is what I read into the debate which took place in the other House. It raises the question as to whether that was a just decision and, if it was not a just decision, whether it should be made a precedent for another decision of the same sort.  I would not admit, in any case, that the Government should have power to regulate the terms of employment of the Civil Service in this way or that they should ask the Oireachtas to take such power with regard to the employment of other persons in public service, even local service.  This is one point on which the Minister relied.  The other is a curious one, which always arouses a certain amount of suspicion, that if it were an injustice it was a very small one.  That is a very bad excuse for doing wrong, that it is a very small wrong, and it has been made in strange circumstances before.  If the Minister wants to get this Bill through, he should give us some more convincing reasons than those he offered in the other House.  The Seanad should be slow to legalise the interfering with contracts.  People who have a contract rely on it, in the belief that they have the guarantee of the State behind it.</P>

      <P>I thought there would be very considerable <Col N="2032" /> discussion on the principle of this Bill, but nobody seems particularly interested and I should like to make only a few personal remarks.  I agree to a great extent with the arguments, as regards the continuation of contract, which have been put forward by Senator Cummins and Senator Rowlette, but it is really about time we realised that in the world of to-day&mdash; in Europe, and particularly in Great Britain, from whence a great deal of the income is derived to employ people in this State&mdash;the present circumstances are very remarkable and extraordinary and may become more so in the future.  The farmers are suffering in 100 different ways through loss of income, loss of prices and loss of freedom to sell.  Many investors' incomes have dropped by half, yet they have to carry on and pay their way, both to the State and through the ordinary cost of living.  Taking it all round, everybody should suffer to some extent in order to help the country.  In particular, Government servants&mdash;although they are going to have less money to spend, owing to the rising cost of living&mdash;enjoy a definite competence as regards salaries and cost-of-living bonus.  One might as well argue that, amongst the others, are old age pensioners who have no bonus of any sort or kind.  It appears to me that this is a reasonable economy to put before the public and before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the point of view of Senator Cummins in advocating opposition to the principle of the Bill.  After all, as Senator The McGillycuddy has just pointed out, we cannot exactly afford to ignore the serious position which exists.  Possibly it is only a temporary period of stress&mdash; let us hope that is so&mdash;but assuming that it is likely to continue, there is no guarantee at all of any security in positions, not to mind salaries.  We must assess the value of the position at the moment, when there is a great deal of security.  A certain amount of sacrifice must be made by everyone in a spirit of co-operation.  The cost of living as we know it to-day is about 19 points higher than stated in the Bill. The value of the return per week <Col N="2033" /> would be only a matter of a couple of shillings to local government officials on the average, but the cost to the general taxpayer would be considerable when the total sum is taken into account.  This extra cost in taxation, being spread over the population as a whole, would probably mean inflicting greater hardship in times of stress on poor people who cannot afford to pay for this extra increase in the cost of living.  In the last resort, it probably means developing a position where certain classes of employees remain in sheltered positions and work on an even keel, while other sections of the community are suffering serious losses as a result of the state of emergency.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the Government are very wise in stabilising this bonus at 85, or in stabilising it at all, for that matter. One has to look a little further than the present emergency and visualise the position afterwards.  Even if we have continued peace, it is quite possible that, as a result of the chaos in Europe, there may be a complete dislocation of our economics as we know them to-day.  As a consequence, the standard of living and even the cost of living may be reduced considerably and be far lower than is presently stated in the Bill at 85, and then the Government will be in a more difficult position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of pensions as mentioned by Senator Cummins.  The pensioner suffers losses as a result of stabilisation, but he would also be liable to suffer losses in normal peace times, before the stabilisation at 85, as the cost of living may have gone below that figure at any time during the past five years.  In taking advantage of the cost-of-living figure in these times, he was all the time risking what his pension would ultimately be, if what Senator Cummins pointed out is correct.  He was taking the risk that it would go below the figure that he would normally consider fair at the period he was going on pension but he was prepared to make that gamble.  I doubt if from the taxpayers' point of view it is wise to stabilise the cost-of-living figure at 85. There is something final about that arrangement.  While there is a stable <Col N="2034" /> Government here, the State employee is guaranteed a salary of a certain figure no matter how the taxpayers may be affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a matter of principle.  A number of people entered the municipal or public service and had a contract with these public authorities stipulating that their wages would be at a certain rate with a bonus fixed on a certain standard.  In view of what is going on in the world to-day, the bonus must substantially increase in order to maintain the agreed wage.  That being so, the Government step in and say: &ldquo;Thus far and no further; instead of maintaining the original wage we are going to reduce it.&rdquo;  I submit that that principle is entirely wrong.  I think that Senator Dr. Rowlette put it very moderately and very clearly when he stated that the repudiation of that arrangement was tantamount to the breaking of a solemn contract entered into by public bodies with their employees, a contract recognised by legislation. We are dealing in the main with ratepayers' money in these cases, not, as Senator McEllin says, with taxpayers' money.  The ratepayers are mainly concerned, and, as far as I know, there has been no outcry from public bodies or from the ratepayers in the various areas demanding that <Col N="2035" /> this change should be made.  I am, consequently, rather suspicious that, if the Government got away with this proposal, they would try to impose the principle generally.  That is not outside the bounds of possibility.  Before they think of imposing this arrangement upon other sections of the community, I would suggest that they take a line from a neighbouring country in connection with what they are doing.  If we are going to suffer as Senator McEllin mentioned, let us all suffer alike.  Do not single out a comparatively small section of the community to try this out on them with a view to imposing it on a greater number in future.  Let us bring all sections of the community into the suffering, and regulate profits, on essential commodities at any rate.  If we are going to be thrust into this awful crisis and turmoil that we see all around us, what provision are we going to make to ensure that the burden will be shared equally by everybody?  We, as Labour representatives, have no particular interest in this Bill, but we see in it a very dangerous principle.  We are very bitterly opposed to the principle contained in the Bill, and we are going to vote against it now and on every stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the position is not by any means so simple as one might think from some of the speeches.  I should very much like the Minister to deal more fully with the suggestion made here that there is a breach of contract involved in this Bill. I am not at all clear that that is so. If it is so, it might affect my attitude towards the Bill.  As far as I can see, the position now is that the total income of the people of this country is going to be reduced while the cost of most commodities is being increased. I quite agree with Senator Foran that as far as is humanly possible, that reduction in income should be shared by all sections, but I would remind him that the attitude taken by the Prices Commission is that they will not allow prices to be charged which they have any reason to believe would increase the profits of any concern during this year.  That creates very considerable <Col N="2036" /> difficulties for manufacturers and others, but that is the definite line that has been taken.  What I am not clear about is this.  If a Bill is passed fixing a rate of wages for certain persons, is that for all time to be regarded as a statutory contract?  If that is the only ground on which this Bill is opposed, I do not think that such opposition is justified, because you might as well say that if I start business and the State allows me to work my employees for ten hours a day at a certain rate of wages, and if the State afterwards passes a Bill reducing the working hours to eight per day for the same rate of wages, then that is a breach of contract, because the law has been deliberately changed to my loss.  If, however, a person accepts an appointment for a specific period at a certain agreed rate, and these rates are changed before that period has expired, I would say that that is a breach of contract.  If I, as an employer, engage a person for a certain number of years at certain specified terms, I should stand by that arrangement whether I lose by it or not.  But if you are going to provide that under no circumstances can conditions of employment be changed, that is entirely a different question.  I should like to hear the Minister deal with this matter, because I am not at all clear on what his views are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us have had to face this question of a cost-of-living bonus, as it is called.  Those of us who remember the last war, what was called the Great War&mdash;I think the name will have to be changed henceforward&mdash;will recall that during that period, you simply had inflation and prices mounted up.  So did wages and you simply agreed to the cost of living without any question at all.  Prices for all classes of materials were increasing and an employer did not mind increasing a wage of £2 to £5 as long as he was getting a proportionate increase for his goods.  The position now, because of our economic relationship with England, whether we like it or not, is very different indeed. While there has been a very considerable increase in prices of certain commodities&mdash;although, perhaps, not <Col N="2037" /> many&mdash;and some lesser increases in prices of other commodities, these increases have not occurred to anything like the same extent, and I think there is no possibility whatever of large profits being made or of profiteering taking place.  I do not think there is any serious danger of that occurring, and at any rate the State is doing its best to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The conclusion I have come to is that, where the rate of wages payable is just bordering on the standard of existence, and where you have people being paid the lowest standard of wages, no matter what happens to the rest, you will have to agree, as a matter of national interest, to an increase in that rate of wages, but it should only apply to those who are on the lowest rates of wages.  So far as I can see, however, there is no ground for anticipating an increase in prices of commodities or in profits in this country which would justify an increase of wages except in the case of those who are paid on the lowest scale of wages, because I do not think we could stand it as a nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>At the very outset I should like to dispose of this matter of a contract that has been talked about here.  There is no such thing as a contract in the ordinary sense between the officials of local authorities and the local authorities.  That was settled in a Monaghan case&mdash;I forget the name of the case, but I think it was Thistle&mdash; where it was decided that local authorities had full discretion with regard to pay.  They have, of course, certain statutory rights, but those rights have been changed from time to time in the past.  Senator Douglas has given us an example of that: where you change the hours of work and so on.  Now, take the position that we have at the moment.  You have here an ascending spiral of prices and costs setting in in the country, and where is that spiral going to stop?  Take the position up to last month.  The bonus rate was 85 at the beginning of this month&mdash;ten points higher than last December&mdash;and it is time to stop <Col N="2038" /> somewhere or to stabilise the position somewhere, because the fact is that other sections of the community are going to suffer, and I believe that civil servants themselves are going to suffer in the end, by the continuance of this spiral.  Is it suggested that they did not foresee that if at some time an emergency of this sort should arise something would be done to stop this thing going up, or are you going to say that it can continue going up and up and that the spiral is never going to stop?  This Bill must be regarded as an emergency Order, because it is following upon an Order of the Minister for Finance dealing with the civil servants.  Naturally, when that Order is brought to an end by the Minister for Finance, the position of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would be untenable if he were to try to keep static the position with regard to the officials of local authorities after the civil servants had been restored to their previous conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only want to deal with the matter from the point of view that it is not a question of any injustice.  It is following the position that has been adopted with regard to the civil servants.  The bonus of the civil servants has been subject to review from time to time. You had a review of the original terms in England, which by way of &ldquo;super-cuts&rdquo; fell heavily on the people with a salary of over £500 a year.  There was no suggestion, even then, that there was a breach of contract with the people affected, because they knew that, if the bonus operated under certain conditions, these conditions were subject to review from time to time, according as circumstances might change.  As I have said, the best example that could be given was the one given by Senator Douglas, where you can change a contract very much against the employer, and which might be very much against the local authorities also, as employers, such as in relation to the hours of working, and nobody can complain that these things might not be good or right in the given circumstances.  This is purely an emergency measure to deal with the position with which we are now faced. <Col N="2039" /> We have to step in somewhere and stop this spiral, because if it is not stopped a very serious and dangerous economic position will be created here.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Dublin) (Amendment) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second and subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to make certain amendments in the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930.  It is also proposed to provide for the incorporation of the Urban District of Howth in the County Borough of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Section 101 of the Act of 1930, which it is proposed to repeal, provided for the appointment of a tribunal to report on boundaries and joint public health services within five years after the passing of the Act and for a further investigation of these problems by a tribunal to be appointed not later than ten years after the passing of the Act. The first tribunal made a very extensive investigation into the problem of joint services for Dublin City and County and submitted a comprehensive report on these matters towards the end of 1938.  In their review of the conditions in Dublin City and County in the years 1935 and 1936 the tribunal had before them a record of development in the previous 10 or 15 years which was unprecedented in the history of the metropolis.  Development in those years proceeded at a very rapid rate. There is no need for entering upon a second investigation of the same problems, and it is proposed to repeal the provisions of Section 101 of the Act of 1930.</P>
      <P>The tribunal in their report did definitely establish the need for bringing the Howth Urban District within the county borough for administrative purposes, and their opinion was subsequently endorsed by the Howth Urban District Council.  This Bill, therefore, proposes to give legislative effect to its inclusion in the county borough.  The urban district is a favourite pleasure ground for the citizens of Dublin, and the future development of the area and the preservation of its amenities should have an important place in city management. The financial effect of the merger will be slight both for the city and the urban district.  The rates for the present year are 22/6 in the urban district, inclusive of a water rate of 2/4 in the £, and 20/9 in the £ in the county borough. The incidence of the rate on agricultural land in the urban district is likely to be higher when it is incorporated in the county borough, as it will then be rated as other agricultural land in the county borough to a municipal rate on one-half the annual rateable valuation.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill incorporates the relevant portions of the Act of 1930, which are considered necessary by reason of the inclusion of the urban district in the city.  The Bill incorporates provisions relating to the transfer of property and liabilities; the preservation of continuing contracts; the continuance of bye-laws, of resolutions of the council, and of any legal proceedings pending; the collection of rates due or accruing to the urban district; the transfer of officers and employees; the award of compensation to officers by reason of abolition of offices, and the application and adaptation of enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also repeals sub-section (3) of Section 53 of the Act of 1930.  It makes provision for the appointment of Dublin City Manager in the manner <Col N="2043" /> laid down in the County Management Act for the appointment of county managers.  On a vacancy occurring in the office of city manager the Minister for Local Government and Public Health shall request the local appointments commissioners to recommend a person for appointment, and the person so recommended shall become thereby appointed by virtue of such recommendation to the office on a date to be fixed by the Minister.  When the office becomes vacant the Minister shall also appoint a person to be city manager until the permanent appointment is made.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two about a matter that may have come to the notice of Senators.  In a sub-leader in a Dublin morning paper, the suggestion was made that, in putting this Bill before the Dáil, I tried to slip something through with regard to this tribunal.  I thought I made that matter perfectly clear in the Dáil.  The person who wrote that article fell into the error of thinking that there was to be a revision of a tribunal every five years. That is not so.  What the 1930 Act provided was that a tribunal to inquire into the position in Greater Dublin should be set up within five years after the passing of that Act, and that, in not less than three years after the appointment of the first tribunal and not more than ten years after the passing of the Act of 1930, another tribunal should be set up.  That would mean that the second tribunal would be set up in this month.  That was to be final. No provision was made, as the writer of this article seemed to think, for the setting up of a tribunal every five years to review the position in Greater Dublin.  I made that matter perfectly clear in the Dáil.  A tribunal was set up in 1935.  It took a great deal of evidence, and it made its report in 1938.  I am proposing to repeal in this Bill the provision that a further tribunal should now be set up.  In the County Management Bill we provided machinery which will help to implement the findings of the tribunal which was set up in 1935, and which reported in 1938.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> There is no purpose, I suggest, in setting up another tribunal when we have got only so far as we have got in implementing the report of the commission that was presented in 1938. That is why I am repealing this provision to set up another tribunal in this month.  Then, again, the present is not a suitable time, not only to set up a tribunal, but to implement the findings of the previous tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as it stands, is all to the good, but what puzzles me is why it should be confined merely to the introduction of Howth into a Greater Dublin.  Since the last extension of the city boundaries there are many peculiarities and irregularities, and I think it is a pity, instead of confining the Bill simply to bringing in the urban district of Howth, that these peculiarities in relation to the existing boundaries were not rectified.  There are districts that are rapidly being developed as housing areas, and they are on the outside of the existing city boundaries, although at the same time they are subject to such facilities as exist in the city in regard to light, water and sewerage.  I think that entails a considerable amount of difficulty between the existing Dublin authority and the authority functioning in the county outside.  It is a pity that this measure was not made more comprehensive, so as to cover such districts as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one portion of land in the north of the county, pretty near the boundary of Howth, which might be regarded as a sort of island.  It is a portion of County Dublin completely surrounded by Dublin City.  It is a pity that matters like that have not been rectified in this Bill.  In Inchicore there was not even the extension of an inch when the boundaries were being extended in 1930, and in relation to that particular case it is a pity something was not done in this Bill.  The area outside the city has been considerably developed since 1930 and, unless we are to have another Bill further to extend the city boundaries, I think it is regrettable that these matters to <Col N="2045" /> which I have referred were not dealt with in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be inclined to think that the body which will now have to undertake the liability, because positive liability there will be, would have been given some opportunity of considering this matter. Dublin City already has had experience of the taking in of urban authorities, such as Rathmines and Pembroke, and it is a great pity that the corporation did not get some opportunity of expressing their views for or against this measure.  So far as I know, this Bill has not come before the corporation.  If there was any indication given of the introduction of such a Bill as this it is quite possible&mdash; I am not saying they would not, but it is quite possible&mdash;that the Dublin Corporation would not have gone to the terrible expense of purchasing the St. Anne's estate.  As we are all aware, there was a huge amount of money expended in that connection. By taking in the Howth area, presumably there will be sufficient space for any extensions that may be contemplated. I do not know that the Dublin Corporation were anxious&mdash;I am speaking now as an individual member&mdash;for the liability they have incurred by the taking in of such a wide district.  I am merely expressing the same opinion as was stated by Alderman Kelly in the Dáil, that it is only reasonable and fair that the corporation should have been given some opportunity of discussing this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Dublin County Council who happens to be elected for the particular area concerned, I must say that I am quite satisfied that this is a good Bill and that it is necessary.  There is more in common between the people and the conditions in Howth and the people and the conditions in the City of Dublin than there is between Howth and rural Dublin.  I welcome this Bill and I regard it as satisfactory.  I do not agree with Senator Healy that there is going to be any burden.  I feel that there is far more in common between <Col N="2046" /> Howth and the city than between Howth and, let us say, Garristown.</P>
      <P>There is one portion of land at Howth in which I am interested, and I should like to know from the Minister what arrangement will be made with regard to it.  It is at Howth Junction, and the people there are nobody's children, as it were.  They cannot get work in the county because of certain conditions, and they cannot get work in the city because they are not in the city. There are 30 families there, and really they often have to wonder where they are.  Can the Minister say what way Howth Junction is going to be fixed? The people are not in a good way, because they are, as I have indicated, nobody's children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of correction, I did not exactly indicate that it would be a burden on the city; I said that possibly it may be a burden.  Senator Tunney is a member of the county council, and it is perfectly clear that he welcomes the new arrangement. Possibly it will relieve him of a burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the other way of saying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain to Senator O'Donovan why we did not bring in other areas.  We brought in Howth because Howth applied and the Greater Dublin Commission recommended it.  That is why we are bringing it in at this time.  I agree it would be more satisfactory if we could go further and get the Greater Dublin report implemented, but it would be a very big problem and I am afraid that this is not a suitable time to go ahead with it.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Tunney referred to, there is a portion of land at Kilbarrack cutting in between Dublin City and Howth.  That portion of land cuts in between the Dublin City boundary and the Howth Urban District, and I was under the impression for some time that it belonged to the county.  I am now informed that that is not so, that the City and Howth Urban District do join there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of a burden or liability, there is not going to be any question of a burden.  The rates are practically the same, and, of course, <Col N="2047" /> there are certain joint services.  The water is taken by the Howth Urban Council from the Dublin Corporation under an arrangement.  There is also an arrangement required with regard to sewerage.</P>
    <P>Howth is a place that the Dublin people have always been looking to see developed.  It has a population of 4,500.  The valuation is about £26,000. You cannot expect a small area like that, adjoining the City of Dublin, to develop as it should or could be developed when you take into account its population and valuation.  It is an area that would not, I imagine, be able to bear the burden of the development that should take place, certainly not over a short period at any rate.  The people of Dublin avail of all the amenities which Howth possesses, and it is for them to make it better than what it is.  That, of course, will be a matter entirely for the Dublin Corporation.  So far as the present liabilities of Howth are concerned, no one, I think, need worry.  It will be a matter for the Dublin Corporation to decide what development should take place in Howth in the future, whether they should add to its amenities and so on.  Howth is certainly an area that should be under the control of the Dublin Corporation. If the water supply and sewerage system there are to be improved, and if many other things in Howth which are not perhaps in a satisfactory condition at the moment are to be attended to, then I suggest that it is the people of Dublin, who avail of the advantages of that area, who should say whether it is desirable or not that these improvements should be carried out.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period for the holding of the local elections from the 30th September this year to the 30th September, 1941.  It was considered&mdash;I think it was the view expressed by all Parties in the Dáil&mdash; that if the present emergency continued until September it would not be suitable to have the local elections held throughout the country during that time.  While power is being taken in the Bill to hold the elections not later than the 30th September, 1941, it will be possible to hold them at any other time if the emergency does not exist or if conditions allow.  I was anxious to have the local elections held this year, because I would much prefer to put the County Management Act into operation after the elections had been held rather than while the existing public bodies are there.  However, it may be possible to put that Act into operation without having the elections.  I am not too sure of that at the moment.  It is a matter that will have to be examined. It was because of representations that were made to me by the National Defence Conference that I decided to introduce this Bill proposing to postpone the holding of the local elections this year.  In any event it would be foolish to think that we could hold them in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that possibly it is a wise thing to postpone the holding of the local elections this year.  Sometimes they give rise to a good deal of local friction.  There is one matter on which I would like to have some information from the Minister. The 1930 Act provides that a <Col N="2049" /> meeting of the Dublin Corporation shall be held each year between the 20th and the 30th June for the purpose of electing a fit and proper person to the office of Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin for the ensuing 12 months.  If the Lord Mayor is elected in June, 1941, and if the local elections are held in September, 1941, what is the position going to be?  The person elected Lord Mayor in June, 1941, would, I take it, like the other members of the corporation, have to seek re-election as a member of the corporation.  Suppose he did not get returned, what would the position be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Before it was decided to bring in this Bill postponing the holding of the elections, we proposed issuing a circular to all public bodies, including the Dublin Corporation, informing them that this being an election year they could not proceed to elect a Lord Mayor.  In the ordinary way, if it is not an election year the Lord Mayors and Mayors of the other county boroughs, the Chairmen of the county councils and of other public bodies, must be elected between the 23rd June and the 1st July.  If it is an election year the Lord Mayors, chairmen of county councils and so on carry on until an election is held.  These offices are then filled immediately after the elections are held.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to give practical effect to the Offences Against the State Act.  In that Act there is provision made for the forfeiture of funds or property belonging to an illegal organisation, but there was really no practical machinery set out under the Bill.  This is the Bill to give practical effect to the provisions of that Act with regard to the forfeiture of funds and property held by illegal organisations when such funds and property come into the hands of the Minister or into the hands of the Gárda Síochána.  There are in hands at present rather substantial sums and it is not clear what to do with them. There is a difficulty.  You find in a house a sum of money of, say, $32,000 or $8,000.  At any rate, there is no label on the money, but we are practically certain that it is the property of an illegal organisation.  The idea of the Bill is to confiscate that money, leaving proper safeguards for anyone who claims the money is his to prove his claim and to prove that the money does not belong to an illegal organisation. An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill, and this explains the reasons for it.</P>
      <P>When the original Act was going through the Dáil the Labour Party objected to it.  They opposed certain parts of the Bill very strenuously, and this part in particular.  I saw the Leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil, Deputy Norton, and he said in view of the emergency they were not opposing this particular Bill.  He asked me to make it a temporary measure&mdash; for 12 months.  I agreed to do that. But I would like to have it understood that this is a permanent measure because it belongs to the permanent part of the Principal Act.  Portions of that Act were not permanent but this belongs to the permanent part of the Act.  In view of the fact that there was no opposition in the other House I undertook to bring in an amendment to make it operative only for 12 months.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment is that the section will operate for only 12 months.  However, when the Act expires at the end of 12 months, the point may arise that the Act has expired and the person could not claim his property because the Act had expired.  As the Section now stands the Act will not have expired, but we cannot act under it in the way of forfeiture.  Therefore it will be in the competence of anyone to claim after the 3rd September, 1941.  It would not be in the Minister's power without the amendment.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill.  As a matter of fact, there is only one matter of importance in it.  In the previous Acts we sought to provide for the compensation <Col N="2056" /> of small curers going out of business. It was provided that the Bacon Board would try to come to terms with the person going out of business, and, if they did not succeed, there was to be arbitration.  It appears that there was something faulty in the legislation in regard to the arbitration.  Even though two of the three arbitrators agreed on a sum to be paid in a certain case, it was held by our legal advisers that a decision could not be carried out unless the three members were unanimous.  In this Bill we are providing for a majority decision, and, if two of the three do not agree, then the Minister will appoint one arbitrator to make the award.  That one will not be the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, because it might be felt that the chairman of the commission would be a little bit reluctant to pay high compensation to those going out of business.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, the Bill provides for some minor amendments which are of no great importance.  One deals with the insurance fund.  It is not clear from the previous Act whether the insurance fund includes carcases not converted into bacon.  There are some factories carrying on both the bacon and the fresh pork business.  It is now made clear that this insurance will cover a carcase, whether it is converted into bacon or not, and that if a claim arises with regard to disease afterwards, it would be paid.  It is really an amending Bill to put right matters which were not properly provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, I suppose, inevitable in the circumstances, although, as things are, one cannot help wondering whether the elimination of all these small curers was the best thing or not.  The Minister, however, has gone so far in his policy of, shall we say, rationalisation that there is no going back, and if the method of determining what the compensation is to be is not satisfactory, it must be cleared up.  There is, however, a matter to which I think I might be permitted to refer in relation to the general position of pig production and sale for some short time past.  The Minister is, I think, aware that there <Col N="2057" /> has been considerable dissatisfaction and disappointment amongst our producers. From every part of the country, one hears the same story: that farmers have taken their pigs to live fairs where the custom has been to sell them and have been unable to sell them or have had to sell them at 10/- a cwt. less than the price which ought to be obtained.  In other districts, where there are bacon factories the factories simply told the farmers: &ldquo;We cannot take your pigs and we will not be able to take them for two or three weeks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In my view, that is not a position which ought to be allowed to develop, and, if it does develop, should not be allowed to continue for one day longer than is necessary to right the position.  In times like these, and particularly when many people have been urging, and, I hope, wisely urging, our pig producers to go in for increased production, you are stopping all production, discouraging producers and creating a situation in which if I, as a farmer with a number of fat pigs on hands, cannot dispose of them to bacon curers, or can dispose of them at a live pig fair only at very bad prices, I am either not going to take the bonhams off the hands of the other farmers or I am going to take them at such a bad price that it will not pay him for producing them.  I am aware that the situation between this country and the country with which we do our trade in bacon was that there was no fixed policy, or that there was a policy being pursued which was unsatisfactory from the point of view that we apparently had more to export than these people were prepared to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that if a situation like that develops again, whatever happens and wherever the money comes from, the Minister, acting on behalf of the State, should clear the market.  He should take the pigs from the people who have them ready for the market and who have produced them at very considerable cost, mainly by the purchase of very expensive imported foods. These pigs ought to be taken off the market and off the hands of the farmers with whom they are growing into weights which are unsatisfactory <Col N="2058" /> from every point of view.  The Minister through the Pigs Commission ought to be able to ensure that our bacon curers could take these pigs and cure them in such a fashion as would make it possible to keep the bacon for six months, if necessary.  I know that our curers to-day adopt a method of treatment of bacon which means that there must be quick sale, but we cannot afford to land into too many of these periods of disappointments for pig producers.  It is very bad not alone for the producers but for the trade of the country.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to accept the decision that I am not entitled to put before the Minister the considerations which I am availing of this chance to put before him, although I am satisfied that were these minor curers in a position to continue their trade, quite a number of these people would be able to take off the market a considerable number of pigs which were not taken off the market.  They were heavy pigs suitable to the home trade, but because they have to be cured in larger factories, from the point of view of export, they are not suitable and the result for many of our <Col N="2059" /> farmers has been very discouraging. If you, Sir, say that I am not entitled to argue that, I do not propose to continue the debate or to get into a general discussion, but this is a very grave matter.  There is evidence from all parts of the country as to its gravity.  I have personal knowledge of it&mdash;I have been hearing it from various people at the Agricultural Commission&mdash;and the Minister, I am sure, is well aware of it.</P>
      <P>My view is that it is a matter of such moment to the State that no crisis of the kind should be permitted to arise again.  The credit of the State ought to be pledged in order to take this food, to cure it and to store it, so that we may be allowed to get on with the production of more; but if we are to leave food like that to grow over-ripe on the hands of our producers, the Minister knows as well as I do what the consequences to producers will be. It is a very bad state of mind to get our farmers into in these days, and the Minister ought not to let a situation like that develop again.  It ought to be possible to get credit to deal with goods like these and to ensure that they will not get into such a condition that they will be unfit for consumption.  We do not know what may happen before the Seanad meets again, but the Minister ought to face up to a position of this kind and adopt stern measures, because we in the country feel that the responsibility is on him to keep us working and to get our goods taken off our hands, when ready.  If they are to be left with us, we will not be encouraged to go back into increased production again.</P>

      <P>I agree with a good deal of what Senator Baxter said.  I am sorry to say that there are complaints, and justified complaints, in the country in regard to the taking of pigs by the factories.  In a number of cases, the pig owner approaches the factory representative and finds that he is not in a position to take the pigs on a certain day or in a certain week, with the result that the pig owner has to hold over his pigs.  When he arrives at the factory in, say, ten or 12 days, the pigs are then overweight and consequently <Col N="2060" /> he is cut in price.  That is an injustice to the man who has the pigs for sale and he has no wide market.  In other words, there is no competition; he is dependent solely on the factory in his own area to dispose of his pigs and to get a price which will in some way recompense him for his outlay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were about 11 small curers to be dealt with in the beginning under this compensation clause.  There are not more than six left.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach has pointed out, this Bill does not deal with that business.  The clause under which these men retired was brought in in 1935 and I think the last date for retiring from business was March, 1937. They are out of business for a long time now, but there was defective machinery for paying compensation. By passing this Bill the Seanad is not doing anything to eliminate curers: they are gone already.  I can recollect three or four who are still awaiting compensation.  They were not driven out: they had the option to remain if they wished, but they themselves opted to go.  That does not apply to them all; some of them did not fulfil the conditions under which they could stay, but quite a number of them did fulfil the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> If the Leas-Chathaoirleach would allow me, I should like to deal with one or two points which may be of some importance to producers throughout the country.  I am quite well aware of the dissatisfaction which existed for some time.  That was due entirely to the want of a market for our bacon. In addition to our home consumption, the quota which the British Government had agreed to give us was not sufficient.  As a result, our curers had a lot of surplus bacon, which they could not dispose of; and curers in turn were reluctant to take pigs.  We tried as hard as we could to deal with this matter, and the Pigs Commission advertised rather extensively that they would go to any market and buy pigs for export.  They went to a good number of markets.  Wherever a Deputy or Senator sent word to me or to them that there was likely to be a surplus of pigs without buyers, they always sent a buyer to take up the surplus. They did not confine that to dealing with requests from Deputies and Senators; wherever representative people from the locality notified them, they always attended.  They did not always get very many pigs.  There were a few instances where I was very much impressed by the case put up by Deputies of different Parties that there would be something approaching chaos if no one attended.  The commission's representatives attended: in one case, they got only one pig and in another case they got no pigs.  However, on an average for some weeks past, they have got 700 or 800 pigs a week in that way, and these have been exported.</P>
    <P>They have been exported in two ways.  Wherever there were live-weight scales available they bought them at the local live-weight price.  On the other hand, if there were no live-weight scales available, or if the producer there wished them to do so, they exported the pigs as his agent, deducting all expenses and giving the producer what he was entitled to after the expenses were deducted.  That, of course, was very favourable as, especially at the present time, they get the same price on the British market as any other exporter would get.  At other times, it might not be so good as, not being in the business before, they might <Col N="2062" /> not do so well; but at the present time they get the same price from the British Food Controller as anyone else. Their expenses would be the same and the commission hand back to the producer the remainder, without keeping anything for themselves.  The ordinary exporter could not do that, as he has to live as well, and in that way it may have been a bit unfair to the ordinary exporter.  Perhaps it was, but it was not unfair to the producers, who should have done fairly well out of it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the trouble is now over because&mdash;as Senators are probably aware from notices in the public Press&mdash;we have got an extra quota for 60,000 cwts. of bacon from the British Food Controller.  That 60,000 cwts. will be going out during this month and next month, in addition to the ordinary quota; and I think there will be quite a good demand for pigs from the curers, as they will find it difficult enough to fill both the ordinary quota and the extra quota and maintain the home market during the coming two months.  For the last few days, it looks as if the number of live pigs going out is already going down, which would indicate that the factories are looking for more.  There is, therefore, every hope that the producer will be able to dispose of his pigs without any difficulty for some time to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the outbreak of war the marine insurance on cattle, sheep, pigs and live stock generally going across to Great Britain has been increased very much on account of war risks.  Fortunately, there has been no loss, and the cattle trade believe that if they were to carry this insurance themselves they could eventually reduce the rate.  It is a few months ago since the cattle trade representatives came to me about this matter and it took some time to draft the Bill.  It is a great pity that it was not possible to bring it in sooner as a fairly substantial fund would have been built up by now.  If they take over the insurance themselves now, they will have to continue the rates as they are at the moment until the fund is built up.  I have consulted the cattle trade representatives about this and they are still anxious to go on with it as they believe it would be better for them to do this insurance themselves than to continue at the rates offered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is drafted more or less on the lines of the Slaughtered Animals (Compensation) Act, 1928.  That was an Act brought in to deal with cases of foot and mouth disease occurring amongst cattle exported.  The Act was afterwards amended in 1932 to include animals detained on account of foot and mouth disease.  It was further amended in 1938 to deal with other expenses that might occur.  This Bill is modelled more or less on the lines of that Act with regard to the constitution of the governing body, etc.  It provides for the legislation being brought into operation on an appointed day. War or no war, the cattle trade intends to go on with this scheme.  In fact, they intend to continue the scheme in peace times.  The present rates are very high.  From port to port the rates in the case of sheep vary from 7/6 to 10/- per head; store cattle, from 7/6 to 10/- per head; pigs, 12/6 to 15/- per head, and milch cows from 25/- to 35/- per head.  These rates only cover transit from port to port.  The cattle are not insured if they proceed beyond the port in Great Britain.  The cattle trade feel that, in these days of air <Col N="2064" /> raids and other untoward happenings, the animals should be insured to their destination on the other side.  This Bill provides for that.  Senators are already aware of the export figures for the past four or five years&mdash;roughly about 600,000 cattle, 300,000 sheep, and 35,000 pigs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a board of eight members who will be appointed for a period of five years by the national executive of the live-stock trade.  At least one of the members must be a person engaged in the business of exporting pigs, and at least four must be persons engaged in the business of exporting cattle or sheep, or either of them.  Everybody will see the necessity of that, because the national executive is composed principally of cattle and sheep men.  The pig-dealers have a very poor look-in there, and, lest for any reason the pig exporters might be squeezed out, provision is made in the Bill that they must at least have one member.  There are the usual provisions that it shall be a body corporate, with perpetual succession, etc.  There will be a fund created known as the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Fund.  The fund will be fed by levies on cattle, sheep, and pigs exported.  These levies will be collected by means of stamps.  They will not be State stamps, but stamps printed by the cattle trade themselves, and they will be affixed to documents which it will be necessary to fill in before cattle, sheep and pigs are exported. The stamps will be on sale at the port.  In that way this insurance body will have an easy method of collecting the money in advance.  There will be no such thing as giving credit.</P>
    <P>The rate of levy will be fixed by the Minister for Agriculture in consultation with the National Executive.  The National Executive, you will observe, will be consulted by the Minister before fixing the rates.  In fact, what usually happens in these cases is that the National Executive take the initiative. They discuss the matter amongst themselves and they make up their minds what the rate should be.  They then send a memorandum embodying these recommendations to the Minister for his consideration.  After he has considered them, he either approves them <Col N="2065" /> or, if he does not think they are suitable, he sends for the members of the National Executive, discusses the matter with them, and suggests that the rate should be changed.  I think you will find that, as a rule, in all these cases the Minister very seldom interferes in a decision of that kind.  It was thought better, however, and the cattle trade agreed, that the Minister should have the last word in the fixing of the rates.</P>
    <P>Where an animal is lost or damaged either on land or sea while in transit, the procedure is that the exporter will put in his claim.  The claim will be investigated by a committee of assessors. That committee is also appointed by the National Executive, not by the board.  They give their award and there is no appeal from it.  A point arose about the time during which an animal is covered.  There may be Senators who perhaps are even less intimate than I am with the conditions governing the export of cattle.  I might explain that when cattle go across, they are detained by the veterinary authorities on the other side for some hours before they are permitted to be moved any further inland.  It is from the moment they leave that detention that the time counts.  It is provided here that they will be covered as regards insurance either until they reach their destination, whether that is a farm or market in Great Britain, or for 72 hours.  In other words, 72 hours is the maximum period.  The insurance cannot cover a period greater than 72 hours, but, in practically all cases, the animals will have reached their destination long before the 72 hours have expired.  They usually reach the market in which they are to be sold the next day, or reach the farm, if they are going to a farm, on the next day. If an accident occurs after the 72 hours it will not be covered even though they have not reached their destination. There must be some limit in these cases otherwise you may have people coming along saying that the animals were merely resting at a particular place and that they had not reached their destination. We do not want to have the board investigating cases like that, followed possibly by legal proceedings as to the interpretation to be put on terms such <Col N="2066" /> as &ldquo;reach their destination&rdquo;.  We, therefore, put a limit of 72 hours on the period.</P>
    <P>There is one difference&mdash;it is not a very big difference&mdash;between the scheme laid down in this Bill and the scheme laid down for the Slaughtered and Detained Animals (Compensation) Act.  In that Act there is a provision that the Minister can suspend the collection of levies after the fund reaches a certain amount.  As a matter of fact, in the particular fund dealing with foot-and-mouth disease, no levies have been collected for some years now.  The fund reached £40,000, which was regarded as a fair amount, three or four years ago, and no levies have since been collected.  Any expenses have been paid out of the interest accruing on the fund.  In this case we think it better that there should be some rate of insurance paid all the time.  If the cattle trade find from experience that the fund has grown very big, they will in all probability propose to the Minister that the rate should be reduced.  The Minister, of course, if he finds a substantial fund there, and if he is convinced from the arguments of the cattle trade that the rate might be reduced, naturally will agree that it should be reduced.  The only other thing I should like to say is that I would like Senators to realise that this is not a war measure.  It will probably be brought into operation even while the war continues, but it is not to be regarded as a war measure and is meant to be a permanent scheme, whether there is war or peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has so fully explained the provisions and the object of this Bill, Sir, that there is no necessity for me to say anything except to recommend the Bill to the House.  I should like to take the opportunity here, however, on behalf of the cattle trade, to thank the Minister and the officials of his Department for the way in which they have met us in the discussion of the provisions of this Bill, and the sympathetic way they have received our proposals and suggestions.  There are some of us, however, who believe that the Minister should have made an order under the <Col N="2067" /> Emergency Powers Act to implement or put into force the provisions of this Bill earlier.  It was suggested to the Minister, and I put it up to him personally, that it should be done at the time.  Possibly there may have been some legal objections to doing so, but I think it is a pity that the Minister did not find some means of putting the provisions now contained in this Bill into force at the time I suggested it to him, that is, at the outbreak of the war, because we would have now £250,000 in the fund, most of which has been paid out to foreign insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that this Bill has been introduced at the request of the National Executive of the Irish cattle trade&mdash;and that is so&mdash;and that it is framed on the lines of the Live-stock Compensation Act.  As some Senators will remember, that Act was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, the late Mr. Hogan, in order to provide a legal way for the cattle exporters to tax themselves by putting a levy on all cattle exported so as to create a fund with which to compensate people who lost cattle which were ordered to be slaughtered, as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, at the British landing ports, and for which the British would not take the responsibility of paying compensation.  That Act provided the means to compensate these people.  The levy was a very small one, but when everybody had to pay it, it mounted up within a very short time to a big sum, and as a result the cattle trade were able to compensate these people, whose claims would not be considered by either of the Governments at the time, and also to compensate everybody who suffered losses since.  The fund became so large that we are now able to compensate for hold-ups, or delays, or anything else, at the ports of landing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Act has been worked well.  It did all it set out to do.  It is suspended now because the trustees believe that the £40,000 which was in the fund is sufficient to meet any claims in the immediate future.  The trustees under that Bill got no remuneration for their work, and the trustees under this Bill are not going <Col N="2068" /> to be paid any remuneration for their work.  It is a mutual insurance scheme which will be worked voluntarily and without any expense to anybody except the cattle trade themselves.  This Bill, which is a mutual insurance scheme, will be of great benefit to the live-stock exporters.  It includes war risk and mortality risk.  We have very little experience of war risk, but we have had a good deal of experience of mortality risk, and there have been constant disputes between the cattle exporters, the shipping companies, and the railway companies.  Now, these disputes will not occur in future because the insurance company will take charge and pay compensation for all those claims under the mortality insurance scheme, which is included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As the national executive has been mentioned in many clauses in this Bill, it may be of interest to the House to know how that body is constituted.  It was formed in 1928 at the request of the then Minister for Agriculture, the late Mr. Hogan, and the object was that there should be some central or responsible authority who could speak for the trade of the whole country and whom the Minister and his Department could consult with upon all matters affecting the trade.  It comprises the chairmen and vice-chairmen of three cattle traders' associations in Éire and of two in the North of Ireland, together with the chairman and vice-chairman of the Pig Producers' and Exporters' Association.  In other words, it consists of 12 members, and these 12 members, constituting the national executive, are responsible for the cattle trade and are the only authority, I believe, that the Minister or his Department will recognise in discussing any general scheme of business connected with the live-stock trade or export trade of this country. These associations comprise about 1,200 members, who represent the biggest and most representative producers of live stock in the State.  They represent practically all the exporters of cattle, sheep and pigs in this country, and some exporters of horses, and altogether they represent an export trade of about £20,000,000 annually, which is the biggest live-stock export trade in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> As I said at the beginning of my remarks, Sir, the Minister has so clearly and thoroughly explained the provisions of the Bill that I do not see any necessity for discussing any of its clauses, and I think I would be only repeating what the Minister has said already if I were to discuss the various clauses.  All I have to say is that I recommend the Bill to the House and hope that it will pass, not only its Second Reading now but all its stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to appear not to agree with Senator Counihan in his praise for the Minister, and one would be almost intimidated by the kind words of Senator Healy, but I think a great deal can be said for the point of view of Senator O'Callaghan. There is no doubt about it that while one can have nothing but praise for the executive of the live-stock trade and of the people engaged in the live-stock trade, if there is money to be paid as an insurance premium on cattle, pigs or sheep exported from this country, we will pay it when we go into fairs and markets to sell our stock. We will be told, probably, by the trader, when we ask a price which he tells us he cannot give, that there is so much insurance to be paid and that he cannot pay any more, which means really that we are paying the insurance. The insurance cannot be taken out of the live-stock trade.  The live-stock trader must have a minimum to carry on with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever is going to be put into this fund is going to be taken out of the farmers' pockets.  I think there is everything to be said for the point of view expressed by Senator O'Callaghan. <Col N="2071" /> While it may be a very admirable thing to build up a very strong fund&mdash;and indeed in these days it is not certain whether a strong fund is the best fund to have or not&mdash;I should not like to see such protection afforded for the export trade in this country at such a cost to our producers as would make them feel that they were being treated too severely in this matter.</P>
    <P>I think there would be a great deal to be said for urging that some one other than the people who are purely the trade should be represented on this board.  I presume the figures are going to be fixed in conjunction with the Minister, and while it is true that a number of live stock traders are themselves producers&mdash;and they are a body of very competent and fairly astute men&mdash;that is not anything against them &mdash;but it is the little fellow in the country, going into the fairs with his stores, who is going to find this money. My view is that it would not be too much to ask that one or two members of the board would be drawn from a group of farmers that would be representative of producers.  I do not think it would do any injury whatever to the board.  I think it would probably strengthen it.  The more harmony you would have between the producers and the trade in a matter like this the stronger would be the position of the trade.  In fact, it is one of the faults of the trade in this country, not only of this branch of the trade, but of other trading organisations, that sometimes they give the producers the impression that they are rather aloof from them and only concerned with what is for their own personal and ultimate good. I suppose there is all haste to get the Bill through now, but I think, if the Minister were prepared to consider it, we could even draft an amendment now and have it accepted which would leave it open to the Minister to draw members of the board from people other than the live stock trade for whom it solely makes provision.</P>

I think there is much to be said for it but, as the Minister has explained, this is really a matter of a change over and it is a matter of urgency.  I think there would be considerable difficulty experienced in giving the cattle producers representation.  To begin with, the cattle producers are not organised as a body.

      <P>The Senator objects to the fact that the producers are not represented on the board.  Many of the cattle exporters, of course, are producers, as Senator Counihan points out, but the fact remains that at present cattle are insured and that the producer is paying under present circumstances, because it always goes <Col N="2073" /> back to the producer.  He has to pay at present for the insurance and he will pay, of course, under this co-operative system amongst the traders also. There is no great change or additional hardship on the producer.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to make is that the Minister has mentioned, it seems to me, flat rates for the different types of animals&mdash;a flat rate for the fat beast, the bullock and the heifer, and another rate for milch cows and sheep, but within these types of animal there is a very great difference in cost.  For instance, Senator Counihan will probably know what I refer to as a &ldquo;screw&rdquo; beast.  If such a beast is being exported, that beast of inferior quality and price will pass the veterinary inspectors.  They cannot stop it because it is not suffering from any scheduled disease, lameness or affliction for which you could stop it.  The point I would like to have clarified is: how is the board to know that the beast has met with an accident or has become a casualty, or is an inferior animal, and not of the same cost as the others?  I notice a clause in the Bill which says that at the port of shipment the shipper, in presenting the veterinary paper, shall insert the value of the animals exported.  If he had to insert the value of each animal, I am afraid he would have a great deal of clerical work in preparing export papers.  I should like responsible authorities taking on insurance to see that an animal of an inferior quality is not included at the same price as the prime beast.  If it becomes a casualty it will not be paid for at the same rate.  Possibly Senator Counihan and his colleagues have some system to deal with that, but it does not seem to be clear in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that this Bill is for the benefit of the cattle trade, and if that is so, the first to benefit will be the producers.  I take it that the Bill will not take away any of the benefits that now reach producers.  Seeing that it is going to reduce costs, it should react favourably on producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator McGee has practically answered the question that was raised concerning producers.  It is really a co-operative effort of the exporters to save a certain sum on insurance, <Col N="2074" /> and in that way to be able to give more to producers for their animals.  If we were to pursue the line that Senator O'Callaghan and Senator Baxter were travelling, we would have to put producers on the boards of the railways to fix rates for cattle, on the boards of shipping companies to fix shipping rates, and on the drovers' trade union to see what they were going to charge.</P>

      <P>Why not put them in the Government and get the thing done right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have them in the Government, but I believe some Senators do not appreciate that.  We should go even further.  I was often at a fair, and when a bargain was made there was a drink, and that came out of the producer's pocket.  There is not a producer on the boards of Guinness or Jameson to see what the price of drink should be.  This is a different matter. The exporters are there and they want to save a little bit on insurance if they can.  It is presumed always in these cases, when exporters of cattle know what their margin is, that they do compete against one another when buying throughout the country.  We have to work on that assumption.  Otherwise we would have to do away with them altogether.  If the producers want all the little margin that is there, the only way is to combine amongst themselves and export cattle, if they want to co-operate to the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised about &ldquo;declared value&rdquo;.  There is some difficulty about that.  That was a matter I discussed with the cattle trade.  As this Bill stands, the exporter declares the value of the cattle. That will not be questioned afterwards unless the declared value was too high. There is a certain danger, I suppose, that a person sending away a boat load of cattle, on seeing warships getting into position for a naval battle, might put too high a value on them in the hope that they would go down.  He must not value them too high, but he can value them too low if he wishes. That is how the Bill stands.  The assessors, in assessing the value of the animals, will not value them higher than he valued them.  If he puts the value at £200 on, say, ten cattle, at an <Col N="2075" /> average of £20 each, the assessors will assume that is the value unless they have reason to think otherwise.  If a beast is of less value than £20, as a rule they will see it.  If it was a total loss they will value it at £20.  If an injured beast lands at the other side they will see it or they will get a report showing if it was as valuable as the other nine.  If it was as valuable they will pay, and if it was less valuable they will pay something less than the average insurance.  I take it the Bill will work on these lines.  It will work as ordinary insurance companies work in regard to injuries to a motor car or where a certain amount of furniture was burned.  They take a percentage of the whole, and then consider what the furniture was insured for and in that way assess the claim.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that it is not entirely exporters are affected.  As a matter of fact when the Bill was before the Dáil sub-section (2) of Section 4, which dealt with members of the board, specified that membership concerned a person ordinarily resident in the State and engaged in the business of exporting live stock.  That was amended to read &ldquo;who is ordinarily resident in the State and engaged in the live-stock trade,&rdquo; because there are men on the national executive who never export cattle.  They are really producers.  Senator Counihan mentioned some names of people who never export live stock, still they would be, perhaps, chosen for the board.  A member need not necessarily be an exporter if engaged in the live-stock business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain to Senator O'Callaghan and to Senator Baxter that there are many important producers connected with the national executive of the association to which I belong who never export a beast.  I want to assure Senators that producers are well looked after and have plenty of representation.  It is not correct to say that there should be a farmers' association brought in.  People who are exporting cattle at the present time have to pay a very much higher rate of insurance than possibly they will have to pay when this Bill becomes an Act.  There is no question of any body looking for representation on these insurance companies.  Senators are quite right in saying that the producers have to pay the piper.  I have always agreed with that and recognised that and I would back up any suggestion to have the producers represented on bodies set up by Bills by which they are to be taxed.  I do not think that it would be right to try to force that position in respect of this Bill.</P>

      <P>If this Act were enforced in a week's time or in a month's time and if one shipload of cattle were to be sunk, would not that make the insurance fund bankrupt practically before it had begun to operate?  Is there any system by which a reserve fund could be established to cover, at least, one shipload of cattle or live stock so that the fund would not be bankrupt before operations had begun under the Act?</P>
