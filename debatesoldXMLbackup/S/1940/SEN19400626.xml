      <P>This Appropriation Bill is an essential part of the routine of the financial system we have here in this Parliament, and generally has grown up to be of stereotyped form.  It serves the two-fold purpose of authorising the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted to meet the cost of the supply services for the current financial year, and secondly, of appropriating to the proper supply service and purposes the sums granted by Dáil Eireann.  These items have been set out in the Book of Estimates and in the Vote on Account.  They have been published in detail, and have been discussed fairly well in detail in the Assembly already.  I do not think it is necessary, therefore, to go in any further detail into the matters, as they have already been published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters I would like to raise, of which I have given notice.  One is whether it would not be possible to issue instructions to the civil population as to their conduct in the event of hostilities.  We know, in the unfortunate happenings on the Continent, how the civil population, partly, I imagine, from want of instruction, very much hampered military operations, and we also know how unauthorised action by the civil population in a moment of excitement may be visited by very heavy and unfortunate reprisals, as those who have seen the monument of the last war at Dinant may well remember.  I do suggest that an essential part of our defence system <Col N="1934" /> is to issue clear instructions to the civil population as to what they are to do in the event of hostilities.  Without these instructions, the whole of our security may be very seriously embarrassed, and these instructions, I suggest, are urgent.</P>
      <P>Another matter which may seem rather an anti-climax in these times of crisis to which I wish to refer is the wanton damage done to public property by youths in the City of Dublin, of which I have had experience, and probably all over the country.  There seems to be amongst these youths a sort of Hollywood gangster spirit which prompts them to break up everything in the way of public property on which they can lay their hands.  I had two personal examples the other day. I went into a public telephone booth and found that the mouthpiece had been wrenched off.  Incidentally, they got my 2d. before I discovered it; but still, I did not take it up with the Post Office authorities.  When passing the booth later on, I found post officials repairing it; and I was told that this frequently happened, not so much in that particular district, but in other districts, and that it is almost a daily occurance.  I also know a house which is in course of preparation for occupation, and in which a telephone had been installed.  Youths came along and pulled the telephone wire off the front of the house, possibly because they wanted an aerial, or probably for reasons of wanton mischief.  In certain public lavatories, fittings have been broken, obviously by some irresponsible parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is any answer to say that all this is the business of the police.  If it is anybody's business, it is the business of the school teachers and the parents, because this thing has to be tackled at the source.  There is this extraordinarily irresponsible spirit. It may be youthful playing at gangsters, as I say, but whatever it is, it shows a very bad sort of national outlook altogether.  I suggest, if I may do so, that it is rather futile taking up this question of higher studies and exploring the frontiers of knowledge, as is proposed in the Bill recently passed, when these elementary concepts of public behaviour are so little <Col N="1935" /> understood.  I hope the Minister will convey this to the responsible authority because I think we have, all of us, knowledge of the way in which these youths and other irresponsible people are destroying public property in the city.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I may be allowed to refer to, as it concerns the Minister for Finance especially.  It is the regret which one feels that it has not been possible to adopt some of the economies which, I understand, were recommended by the body appointed to inquire into economies shortly after the war broke out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Central Fund Bill was before the House in March last, I referred to the difficulty a distinguished journalist had experienced in obtaining information regarding the salaries paid to the officers and employees of the Tourist Board out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas, and the Minister for Finance was then good enough to say in reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Senator MacLoughlin raised one question about the new Tourist Board as to salaries.  If I had the information ready, I would give it to the Senator.  I do not see why he should not get it.  Any member of the Dáil or Seanad is, I think, entitled to any information of that kind.  When money voted by the Oireachtas is being discussed and Senators ask for information as to what amount is paid to a particular individual, I certainly would not think it proper to refuse to give such information.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heartened by that assurance, I formally applied to the Minister's Department for the required information and, in reply, I was referred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I then applied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who wrote me that if I raised the matter when the Appropriation Bill was before the House, the Minister would arrange to attend and give me the information. I hope he has passed on the information to the Minister for Finance, but I do not understand why he could not have passed it on directly on half a sheet of notepaper.  When my journalist <Col N="1936" /> friend first applied for the information, as he was perfectly entitled to do as a taxpayer, he was referred from one Department to another, and eventually refused the information.  When I, as a member of the Oireachtas, responsible for the voting of the moneys under the Bill, asked from my place in the House for the information, it is withheld for two months.</P>
    <P>I do not understand this interDepartmental hugger-mugger, and I think it is nothing short of a scandal that the information should not be readily forthcoming when asked for. In <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>, one can find information on practically all the salaries paid, directly or indirectly, in the public service of Great Britain, and, in the <i>World Almanac</i> published in New York, the remuneration of every grade of public employee is set out.  Yet, in this State, one encounters numberless obstacles when one asks for information regarding the salaries of directors of companies under Government control and of officers of other undertakings in receipt of public moneys.  I now formally ask for the information which the Minister for Finance promised me in March last, and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised me in a letter dated 3rd May.  I hope it will now be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, somewhat unfortunate, from the point of view of the Seanad, that the system to which the Minister refers means that we get the Finance Bill one week and the Appropriation Bill the following week.  I find that if I were to make exactly the same speech as I made last week&mdash;the House need not be frightened; I do not propose to do so&mdash; it would be practically as suitable to the present occasion.  It seems pretty plain that the situation with which we are now faced and the expenditure which the Minister naturally and inevitably, though, as he said himself, reluctantly, has had to agree to has not as yet been estimated for and probably, in the nature of events, cannot be estimated for.  I have great sympathy with the charge he makes against members of this House and of <Col N="1937" /> the Dáil, and to which, I think, we would all probably have to plead guilty, of being particularly interested in some particular type of expenditure and that we would have a strong grievance if economies were made in the particular matter in which we were interested. I cannot help feeling, at the same time, that no matter how much it may offend members of the two Houses, the Minister may find himself in the position of having to see whether he cannot insist on economies in matters which would be otherwise desirable in order to meet what we hope is an absolutely abnormal expenditure.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter closely allied to that raised by Senator Sir John Keane to which I wish to refer, in the hope that the Minister who is here, or some other Minister, may be able to take some steps with regard to it.  I refer to the position of protection of the civil population in the event of the worst happening.  To my knowledge, there is a great deal of doubt and uncertainty in the minds of responsible members of the public&mdash;such as people at the head of business&mdash;as to whether the Government consider they ought to make elaborate precautions to deal with possible air raids.  During the first few months of the emergency, there was very considerable discussion on the matter and, if my memory serves me aright, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures urged people responsible to take what steps they could.  It was a matter of controversy, as the circumstances then were very different from what they are now.  The same public statements with regard to our danger were not being made then and, with the exception of a few wealthy firms with large sums of money, practically nothing was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Estimates for a sum of, I think, £60,000 under the Army Vote.  It is a matter of great importance that the Government should make their position perfectly clear as to whether, in their opinion, this heavy expenditure ought to be undertaken by businesses, either for the public or for their employees, or both. On the other side of the water, I think <Col N="1938" /> it is compulsory and I must confess that, provided there is some way of finding the finance, it would be much better&mdash;if it is to be done at all and if it is the Government's opinion that it should be done&mdash;that it should be compulsory. Trade generally is none too good and competition is keen; and it is extremely difficult for persons in responsible positions as employers, trying to keep their staffs going as long as they can and employing more than they would be justified in keeping on a strictly economic basis, to expend as much money as they might otherwise. Of course, they could employ smaller staffs and spend the money in the provision of air raid shelters.</P>
    <P>In Section 58 of the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, there is a sort of provision relating to this matter.  I say &ldquo;a sort of provision&rdquo; because, reading it in the light of present circumstances, it seems very inadequate.  In, I think, February of this year the Minister concerned made an order for the interpretation of Section 58.  The substance of the section is that where an employer&mdash;whether individual or company&mdash;spends a sum of money, which must be a sum approved by the Department, on the provision of an air raid shelter for employees, an allowance will be made according to a certain rate&mdash;which is set out in the order as £7 per head of the persons which the air raid shelter will cover&mdash;provided that they are actually normal employees. The Government will refund him an amount equal to an income-tax at the rate of 5/6 in the £ on the sum expended.  I do not know if that has been changed: amongst the large number of papers I received, I was not able to find an order changing it, but it may be that I did not receive it or it may have been mislaid.  The effect of that would be something like this. If an employer spends £400 in making provision for, say, 34 employees on the basis of £7 per head&mdash;and £7 per head would be adequate where the number is large but quite inadequate where it is small&mdash;the State would refund him at the rate of 5/6, which would be £110.  He will have to spend his £400 out of his profits for the year, but, when his profits come to be assessed for <Col N="1939" /> income-tax purposes, the £290 would be subject to a charge at rate of 6/6, or whatever the income-tax rate is.  That means that he will really receive an allowance of only £25 out of his £400.  That is the encouragement he will get, provided that he erects the shelter for his own employees.  If he happens to be a public-spirited individual and decides that he would like to include space for the public, he will not be allowed even this small sum. That is an absurd and utterly inadequate provision.</P>
    <P>I do not know the position all over Great Britain, but I know that in London and in some of the other towns in which I have been, if you walk along the main thoroughfares you will find quite a number of shops bearing notices &ldquo;Air Raid Shelter&rdquo; and you can go into those shops to the shelter, which is quite frequently at the back. I may be wrong, but I believe that, if satisfactory financial provision could be made, many shops in Dublin and other towns would be willing to provide shelters for a number of persons in addition to their own employees.  That would be a saving to the State, assuming that it is the Government's opinion that these shelters should be provided. If instructions were given, one or two shops in each street would provide proper air raid shelters at the back, but the present financial provision will not be sufficient for that.</P>
    <P>If a company has to pay out of its profits for a shelter and is not even allowed the amount of such expenditure, it cannot carry out such work unless it happens to be a very large company with large reserves, and, unfortunately, there are very few such in this country.  On the other hand, if machinery could be found for a loan free of interest for five years for the actual cost of the air raid shelter, provided it was double that necessary for the employees&mdash;as I think the provision ought to be, instead of the reverse &mdash;quite a number of firms would be willing to undertake the work. Although I took a figure of £400, which is a small one, it would mean paying £80 a year out of profits.  That is a thing which could be faced, and though <Col N="1940" /> it would mean that the State would have to find some money at the moment, it would be much less expensive than providing a very large number of public shelters.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Government has decided that it is not necessary to take these precautions.  I rather thought that that was the view, until I saw a report of the speech by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  However, the newspapers only gave a passing reference to air raid shelters&mdash;one gave only three lines and another about five; it just read like a hint and could not be read by any member of the public into a statement of what was or was not Government policy.  I do not know exactly what this £60,000 is intended to cover, but I imagine it is for the refund of 5/6 income-tax.  It may be that it is to cover certain other matters, as there is provision for what are called essential undertakings.  This is a matter of very considerable concern to many employers and a clear statement should be made.  If the matter is regarded definitely as urgent in the areas provided in that particular Bill to which I have referred, it may be necessary to make it compulsory.  The expenditure of this money will require some care and some sort of statement should be made at the earliest possible date. Although the question of the 5/6 is a matter for the Minister for Finance, he may not be able to make that statement to-day, but it seems to me to be proper to bring it forward now.  Private individuals would like some guidance, but that is a matter for themselves. Where you are dealing with the question of providing for the public, guidance must be given.</P>
    <P>There is another small point I wish to make.  An announcement was made the other day that, on account of the censorship provisions, one must use twice as much paper in writing to England as was used previously.  I have been wondering if that is necessary. If, because of the censorship you must write on one side of the paper only, it means using twice as much notepaper for ordinary correspondence to England.  When you have a shortage of paper&mdash;I am glad to see that the <Col N="1941" /> Government Departments are using economy envelopes, I got one of them myself this morning&mdash;it does seem rather absurd to force that provision on the public.  If very thin paper were used, I suppose it might be difficult to read it if it were written on both sides of the paper, but the provision that it must be legible surely covers that. That, however, is only a small point.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, as far as the future of this country is concerned, it would be quite useless for us to attempt a detailed examination of a critical character of the Estimates.  My reasons for saying so are exactly the same as those which I gave last week when dealing with the Finance Bill.  I believe that in the present time, small, detailed criticism, except of a helpful character or for the purpose of putting forward matters having relation to the emergency situation, would not serve any useful purpose.  I think, at the same time, that the attitude adopted by certain Senators, and to some extent by the Minister, towards the suggestion of a national Government showed that they did not understand the object of some of us, at any rate, in making that suggestion.  For my part, I am not at all impressed by the idea that you can get the best Government by getting together the best type of brains.  It might be that if you could get the best prophets together, to tell you what was likely to happen to the country, there might be something to be said for a Government of that description.  My feeling is that the very nature of the circumstances means that detailed Parliamentary criticism is impracticable, and that decisions on behalf of the whole State, and which all sections of the community will willingly accept, will have to be made in the emergency. The knowledge that they are made, not by one Party, but by a Government representing all the Parties we have here, would leave no excuse whatever for not accepting these decisions with just the same authority as if they were made by Parliament.</P>
    <P>I think there was a good deal of misunderstanding of the motive which actuated the suggestion.  Some Senators seem to have the idea that the opportunity was being utilised to make an <Col N="1942" /> attack on the particular group you have in power at the moment.  There is, of course, no foundation for that suggestion, but I do not think that the present Government was elected to deal with a situation such as confronts the country at present.  What we want now is a Government to deal with the emergency, a government by people who are leaders of all Parties, and whom the people generally will follow.  No matter how good a Government may be, the very fact that it is a Party Government, many of us feel, will make it impossible for it to carry through certain measures.  For instance, it may be necessary, no matter how unpopular it might be with the people generally, to cut out certain expenditure for the next year or two.  I do not see how any one Party would be ready or willing to do that, and I do not think it would be fair to ask them to do so.  That is a responsibility that should be shared not alone by the two great Parties, but by the Labour Party also.  I do not think that can be done if matters are viewed from a Party standpoint.  I am against detailed Parliamentary discussion at present, because it is almost impossible to discuss items of expenditure in the Estimates without touching upon matters on which there would be acute differences of opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could usefully add anything to the remarks I made last week on the subject of a change in the form of Government. What I said then still represents my viewpoint.  The matters raised by Senator Sir John Keane and by Senator Douglas in regard to the construction of air-raid shelters, I shall have brought to the attention of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence. So far as the subject of air-raid shelters is concerned, I am afraid I must confess that I was responsible for some of the slowing down and the slacking-off in the arrangements that were contemplated and to some extent carried out in Dublin and elsewhere. I may have had considerable responsibility for that.  At that time, last September and October, I was unconvinced of the immediate necessity for making preparations to protect people from air raids and, as Minister for <Col N="1943" /> Finance, I did everything I could to try to stop expenditure on air-raid precautions. I was not wholly successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Remarkably so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say remarkably so.  I was successful to some extent.  In recent times, I have had reason to change my mind, unfortunately from the Exchequer point of view.  When, some time ago, it was proposed that the campaign should be re-started, and that people, and local authorities in particular, should be encouraged to go ahead with the plans for the construction of air-raid shelters and forms of protection for the civil population, I was obliged to consent as it appeared to me that the expenditure was useful and necessary.  Arrangements are being made, I think, or are in operation at present to encourage essential undertakings, private individuals and local authorities to go ahead as much as possible with the construction of air-raid shelters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if any further expenditure than that provided for in Section 58 has been authorised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as much as has been provided for, or arranged for financially, up to the present.  Of course further expenditure may be necessary and that would have to come before the Dáil in the way of Supplementary Estimates at a later date. With regard to the other point raised by Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;the wanton damage carried out by youths to public property&mdash;I do not think the Minister for Finance has any particular responsibility, except that, like everybody else, as a citizen, he is ready to do his utmost to discourage the indulgence of youths in any kind of horseplay that leads to the destruction of public property.  I do not know whether our youths, as some people used to say, have a double dose of original sin.  I wonder if our youths are any worse than those in any other country.  I do not want to make any excuse for that kind of conduct at all. <Col N="1944" /> I remember long ago as a member of the Dublin Corporation the horror with which I used to read the reports of the then town clerk, presented to the corporation, on the destruction of trees and other public property when I and some others were responsible for getting the Dublin Corporation to provide a great deal of money with a view to beautifying the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The destruction is still going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still going on. I wonder will it ever completely end? I am glad that Senator Sir John Keane has raised the matter.  I think it is useful to have it raised in every representative and public assembly, so that the frequent mention of the subject may induce parents of children responsible for this destruction to take steps to have it stopped.  I sometimes wonder if it is children that are always responsible.  I know I came across a number of years ago some cases where people who were anything but children cut down trees, so that it is not always children who are to blame.  I think it is useful to raise the matter here, and in other assemblies of a public kind, so as to get it firmly fixed in the minds of our citizens that this kind of destruction is bad citizenship. If parents and those responsible in the country for the education, guidance and general up-bringing of children were to do everything they could to encourage children to respect public property, in fact, to respect all forms of property, continuous propaganda of that kind would eventually have the effect of stopping a lot of the destruction. I do not suppose we will ever see that destruction completely stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator MacLoughlin, I have only to repeat what I said to him on the last day he raised the subject.  The view I expressed then I still stand by.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I understand, said, in a letter to Senator MacLoughlin, that if the matter were raised again here he would answer it, but as, when I got this note, he expected to be held up in the Dáil, he gave me the information to give Senator MacLoughlin.  He has no objection <Col N="1945" /> whatever to that information being given, but he wanted it asked for, as the Senator was anxious to have it given here, judging by his question. The Minister was quite prepared to come here and answer the question at the earliest opportunity.  The note is as follows: &ldquo;The chairman and managing director of the Tourist Development Board has a salary of £1,500 per annum, plus travelling expenses and subsistence allowances; other members of the board are paid £200 per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">

      <P>On the Fifth Stage of the Bill, Sir, I think we should congratulate the Minister.  I have known him for a long time.  He has very frequently been in luck.  He has been in great luck last week with the Finance Bill and in great luck to-day with the Appropriation Bill, and I do not intend to keep him very much longer here.  On the occasion of the Finance Bill last week, Senator Douglas, who, I think, must be in league with the Minister, raised the question of a national or coalition Government, and the Minister was delighted.  A number of other people raised various points.  Senator Baxter raised a considerable number of points with regard to our economic and financial situation at the present moment.  Now, the Minister, in his reply on the Finance Bill, said not one single word about finance&mdash;not a single word about finance.  He delivered himself of a very long homily on the excellences in various degrees of himself and his colleagues in the Government, but he did not say anything at all about our financial situation or about what precise steps the Government had taken, if any steps have been taken, about the various problems which, for example, Senator Baxter raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to-day, Senator Sir John Keane began on A.R.P., and from A.R.P. he went on to lament the fact that our young people do not display the public spirit that they might display, and that they injure public property; and again the Minister was delighted.  I have not heard&mdash;and I have heard a great many Ministerial answers in my time&mdash;anything more vague than the Minister's statement to-day on A.R.P. He told us that he had been against A.R.P. at first, and that he had stopped expenditure upon it, but that recently he had been converted to the view that more expenditure must be undertaken. With regard to how much, however, or in what directions, or by whom, or whether he would give the concessions which Senator Douglas spoke of, to <Col N="1947" /> business firms who make air-raid shelters for their employees or for the public, he said exactly nothing at all.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, one can only associate the complacency of the Minister&mdash;and in that complacency he finds himself in perfect agreement with Lord Craigavon in Belfast, and I am tempted to call it the smug complacency of the Minister with regard to the present situation&mdash; and the capacity of himself and his colleagues to handle it with incompetency. I am afraid that it is an indication of nothing else but incompetency. There was a good deal of nonsensical talk on the last occasion about Governments which have majorities.  Nobody, or at least nobody on these benches, denies the right of a Government, legitimately elected, to govern, and I for one am prepared to give it every single thing to which it is entitled, and all the assistance in my power; but no matter how much assistance I give it, I cannot give it confidence if, in fact, I have not got confidence in it.  It is worth while telling the Minister and some of the Senators who spoke on his side on the last occasion, that, in the last election, and before the war and before the present emergency, out of more than 1,250,000 votes cast, this Government's majority was less than 50,000 votes.  It is, therefore, true that when you meet 13 voters on the street, six of them are against the Government, had no confidence in it in 1938, and I think have not yet any confidence in it.  Certainly, they have got no reason to have confidence in it, as a result of any of the recent happenings, and particularly as a result of some of the speeches made here.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>On the Bill itself there is just this much to be said.  This is a very substantial amount&mdash;over £31,000,000&mdash;but it does not represent the amount which we will be called upon to find or to appropriate for the present financial year, and while a considerable amount of this money, and of the money we will be called upon to find later on, does, in fact, arise out of the emergency, it must be remembered that the policy of the Government, consistently, from the time they came into office, and in the absence of any emergency of any kind, except an occasional one which they <Col N="1948" /> brought about themselves, was to increase the amount of the Appropriation Bill year by year: in other words, to increase the cost of the public services. The audited expenditure&mdash;not the Estimates, but the audited expenditure&mdash;for the year 1930-31 was £20,925,000, or roughly £21,000,000. The audited expenditure for 1932-33 was roughly £24,250,000&mdash;in other words in their first year of office, expenditure of this particular type went up by £3,250,000.  In 1937-38 the audited expenditure was £28,000,000, in other words an increase of £7,000,000, apart altogether from any emergency.  It is now up by more than 50 per cent. over the expenditure of 1930-31.  Therefore, Sir, apart from the dire necessities of the moment which we must meet, and which we must assist the Government to meet, to the best of our ability, it has to be remembered that the weight of expenditure&mdash; Government services swollen in every direction and Government services increasing in number and expense in every Department&mdash;is something which is part of the normal policy of the present Government which had increased it from 1930-31 to 1937-38 by £7,000,000 or about one-third of the total.  The fact that that was done and that the burden was already here before the emergency arose, has, of course, a very serious effect on any efforts which we may make now to find money for the emergency.  That is all I desire to say now, except that while that is the situation and while great difficulties arise, it is possible for the Minister to be entirely and completely satisfied that nowhere is there to be found any people who have more ability of any kind than any one of his colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>When in the debate last week the question arose with reference to the idea of a really national Government, I had not given the matter much consideration and my views had not become definitely crystallised, but I did I think on that occasion recommend that we should attempt to achieve what I call unity of moral purpose with the Government and people of Northern Ireland.  It seems to me, Sir, that that object has <Col N="1949" /> already been achieved.  Our Government has complete unity of moral purpose with the existing Government of Northern Ireland; both alike are determined to follow the policy of the Vicar of Bray&mdash;&ldquo;Whatsoever king shall reign, I will be the Vicar of Bray, sir.&rdquo;  It is not for me to criticise the proceedings in another Parliament, but, at the same time, I cannot help saying that the attitude of Lord Craigavon in the present national and international emergency amounts to this: that he and his family Party are prepared to put their own local privileges and permanent ascendancy in the Government of that area above and before all other considerations and, that being so, it is legitimate to conclude that they are only half-hearted in the defence of the cause of freedom and democracy.  But is our Government down here one whit better?  Are they in fact not precisely the same from the moral point of view? They, in accordance with the ordinary working of the machinery of democracy, have a majority and that majority entitles them to have a monopoly of executive office and to govern the country, in which they, by no means, command an overwhelming majority of the votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all very well in normal circumstances but, in a time of national emergency like the present, to refuse absolutely to consider the idea of associating with them in the councils of the State, representatives of other important sections of the community seems to me to amount to the same kind of immoral procedure by way of setting partisan privileges and temporary political ascendancy above all other considerations, even the consideration of the welfare of the nation. In fact, if it be the case that by acting in a certain way we might forward the cause of the unity of Ireland which we are all supposed to have at heart, the only inference from the present attitude of the Government is that they are half-hearted in their furtherance of that cause of national unity.  Now, Lord Craigavon was reproached by some independent spirits in his own Parliament with his refusal to take an all-Irish view of his duty in the present <Col N="1950" /> crisis, let alone an all-Allied view. Well, that may be so, but we have here a Government which, so far from attempting to take a Thirty-Two County view of its duty to all Ireland, refuses even to take a Twenty-Six County view, for let me remind, the Government that among the Twenty-Six County citizens whom they govern there are at least 45 per cent., and probably more than 50 per cent., of the people who are not their supporters and who are not in any way represented in the Executive Council of the State.  At the last election their majority was, I might say, probably 50 to 55 per cent.  I am informed by people who know that the tide has been running against them in recent years and if it was purely a question of Party politics, they would stand a very good chance of being beaten in the country. If that be so, and I speak subject to correction, the Opposition Party would have everything to gain by taking a purely partisan view of the present crisis and refusing to associate themselves in any way with the Government. But, instead of that, they are all prepared to sacrifice all possibility of Party gain, and are willing to consider associating themselves with the responsibilities of government in the present national emergency, and yet the attitude of the Government is one of sheer, complete and utter refusal to take this matter into consideration. That being so, I think the Government has shown itself to be morally and politically on the same level with the Craigavon faction which they are so fond of denouncing, and from my own point of view I have the same contempt for them both.</P>

      <P>I had no idea that this subject was going to be raised again to-day and I have no desire to repeat the arguments I used on the last day it was discussed, but it seems to me that the speech of Senator Hayes is of very great importance, if it means what I take it to mean.  There is no particular point in drawing attention to the size of the vote which was cast against the Government at the last general election unless one has something in mind as an alternative to them now.  If the present Government is the <Col N="1951" /> only possible Government, it does not matter what their vote was in the last election, it is the duty of 100 per cent. of the people to give it all possible support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If it is the legitimate Government&mdash;I think it is the legitimate Government&mdash;whether its majority is small or not, it is the duty of all citizens to support it in an emergency and to give it its due, but if another Government were available, that would not enable us to be disloyal citizens, and I would not be so.</P>

      <P>The object of my remarks, such as they are, is not to make any attack on anybody, but to try to carry this extraordinarily important topic a stage further.  We have had a great deal of discussion here about the desirability of a coalition, and rather indignant language has been used by various people, including myself, about the over-complacency of the attitude of the Government.  It did seem to me that, for the first time, to-day we were getting a real step forward when Senator Hayes associated himself with that language.  It really is not much use talking about the over-complacency of the Government, and reminding them of the fact that so many votes were cast against them at the last election unless the Opposition Parties wish it to be understood that they are at any rate open to an invitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes in thinking that there is a great deal of similarity between the line the Government here have taken and that adopted by the Government in Northern Ireland, but that leads me on to make a further remark, which I trust is in order as it arises directly out of what has been said, that I cannot understand the policy of concealing, to so large an extent as it is being concealed at present, from public opinion in the <Col N="1953" /> Twenty-Six Counties that very profound changes are going on in the mentality of the people in the Six Counties, if not in the mind of Lord Craigavon.  Very remarkable letters and utterances have lately been written and made in Northern Ireland.  I think that, inasmuch as they do not emanate from anybody here, either in politics or outside politics, they cannot be regarded as in any way compromising us and, therefore, I am unable to understand why the censorship should not allow these letters and speeches to be published here in full so that the people in this part of Ireland should be able to take note of them as important matters of fact.  Undoubtedly, if published here, whether their suggestions could be carried out or not, even assuming that they could not, they would tend to promote better feeling between North and South and an extension of the All-Ireland outlook that we all want to see.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should have a look at some of these documents and speeches.</P>

I think it is a great mistake to apply the same rules of censorship to things that are said and written elsewhere as may be applied to things said and written here, because we have not <Col N="1954" /> got any responsibility for them and nobody can say that they are any straying from the path of neutrality on our part.  On the other hand, they are of very great interest to us as Irishmen, and we ought, I think, be allowed to know all about them in order to realise the extraordinary change that has been taking place in some most unexpected quarters in Northern Ireland owing to recent events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply to certain matters which I raised on the Second Stage seemed to me to be so vague and unsatisfactory that I wonder whether I made myself clear at all. I emphasised a certain question which I had been going into, namely, the question of A.R.P., and the Minister indicated that he was in a similar position to most businessmen, that is, they thought some time ago that it was not necessary to make an expenditure and now they were beginning to wonder whether it should not be done.  What I wanted to indicate to the Government was that the time has come for a clear lead.  We are told there is a danger; we are told there is a national crisis; there is an emergency, and we are told emphatically certain things. One is that there is a duty either to join the Army, the Red Cross, the A.R.P. services or the local security force.  The Government, quite rightly, in seeking recruits do not mean that they want the whole 3,000,000 to join the Army.  It is perfectly clear to me that there are a great many other duties for people, responsible heads of business, who for various reasons ought not to join the Army at the present time, in my opinion.  They have duties and they want some clear lead as to what should be done in this emergency in regard to other matters as well as on the question of joining the Army. I illustrated one of them, but I do not think it is the only one.  I am convinced that the people are asking for that lead and I hoped that I would have got an assurance from the Government that the question would be clearly considered and that at an early date there would be some clear statement on the question of A.R.P. and other civil duties in an emergency. Closely allied to that is the matter emphasised <Col N="1955" /> by Senator Sir John Keane. I would have stressed it more only that I thought he made it quite clear.  I refer to the duty of the civil population in the event of an attack on this country, which we all hope will not come.  To be prepared is to be twice armed, and to leave it all vaguely, leaving the people to wonder what they might do, without a lead, is, I feel, a source of danger.  A clear lead is necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to raise further arguments except to say that I do not think that Senator MacDermot appreciates or judges the position in this country at all accurately.  I am absolutely convinced that there is no responsible constitutional Party in this country, if it was put up to them that they had a particular service in this emergency, would refuse it.  I am convinced that that is so.</P>

      <P>In any case, it would be quite reasonable to assume that there was collusion between Senator Hayes and Senator Johnston.  Both their speeches were on more or less the same lines, and both their speeches, in my opinion, were very harmful.  They were not harmful to the Minister, to the Government as such, or to the Government Party, but they might do very considerable damage in the country. If people were to take the trouble to read those speeches, their confidence in the national leadership at present might possibly be shaken.  It is very peculiar that Senator Johnston&mdash;I suppose I will again be accused of asking Senator Hayes if he has given up beating his wife, but I suggest that no <Col N="1956" /> such question arises at all&mdash;stated, in very plain words, that it was very regrettable that, while the members of the Opposition were prepared to give their services in a coalition Government, the existing Government refused to accept those services.</P>

      <P>Last week, he said that Senator Douglas indicated a number of problems and indicated as one solution that the matter should be dealt with by a coalition Government.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think he said &lsquo;national government&rsquo; and I apologise to him if I have misquoted him, but I do not think it makes much difference what you call it, because nearly everybody knows or thinks he knows, what it means.  Now, that is a matter which I do not propose to discuss at length, except to say this: that none of our problems, and no problems of any country, can be solved by any form of make-believe, and if a national government merely means that two or three parties, no one of which has a solution of the problems to be solved, come together under the cloak of a national government without any agreement between themselves as to the policy they desire to pursue or the remedies they desire to apply, then that may very well be merely a process of deceiving themselves...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could see that Senator Hayes became quite alarmed when he was accused of being in the position to speak for the official Opposition, but <Col N="1957" /> we cannot have Senator Hayes speaking from one side of his mouth one day and from another side the next day, and expecting us to take him seriously on both days.  We must take him seriously in one way or in the other; he cannot have it both ways.  When I say that both speeches were, or may be quite harmful, I mean that if the general run of the people were to accept the statements made here to-day, the only conclusion they could come to is that they are completely lost, that there is no leadership, no responsible people to tell them what to do, and that there is no use in taking any notice of orders given to them. That is the conclusion which any average person might come to, but I definitely refuse to believe that any such situation exists.  I refuse to believe that the people have lost confidence in the Government, or in their present leadership.  Senator Hayes points out that of 13 people you meet in the street, six are against the Government&mdash;&ldquo;have no confidence in the Government&rdquo; were his words.  I do not believe that any such situation exists, and I believe that, regardless of the fact that certain figures can be produced to show that the majority at the last election was so and so, regardless of the fact that the Government, as a result of the last election, had an overwhelming majority in the other House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dáil.  I am speaking for the non-political side of the House.  I believe that, regardless of these facts, people who were then opposed to the Government, and who even now disagree with the Government on certain sections of their policy, have, since the crisis arose, rallied around the Government.  Even though they may disagree with the policy of the Government, they realise that the only hope for the country is under one leader, and the average citizen, even though he may disagree with the political programme of that leader, thoroughly understands and appreciates that he is the one man who has any hope of leading this <Col N="1958" /> country out of the present situation. Although Senator Hayes may not agree with that, I believe that very many members of his Party think along those lines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the giving of instructions to the civil population, I am in thorough agreement with that, because I believe it is very necessary.  I believe that the people in rural districts especially are taking things a little too easily, and I think some definite instructions should be issued.  It is all very well to say that when the time comes they will get these instructions, but I believe that some indication should be given at present.  If this thing comes to a head, and we all hope it will not, it will be necessary to fortify every house in the country and to barricade every road in the country, so that if we cannot prevent a successful attack by air, we will at least make it very difficult for any force which might enter the country to carry on a campaign so far as land forces are concerned.  If that indication were given, and if it were possible&mdash;I do not believe it is&mdash; to have parish councils organised within the time at our disposal, if some system of organisation were in force and definite instructions given to the people, I believe that, having the confidence they have in their present leadership, the people would rally round the Government in the country's hour of need.  I believe you would have no trouble whatever in getting every village made into a fortress and, as a result, we would at least make it very difficult for any force, no matter how strong, to work effectively here.</P>
      <P>There is nothing further I have to say, except to appeal to Senators to realise that, even though they do not agree with the Government, even though they think the present Government is not the best Government, or that the present Ministers may not be the best men, the only hope we have of surviving as a nation is in rallying round the Government in the present crisis, in giving every possible assistance in rallying the people round that Government, and in convincing the people that the only salvation for the people is to advance in one direction under one Government and one leader.</P>

      <P>Irish, perhaps.  This has to be remembered&mdash;and it is no harm for Senator Quirke to remember it, too &mdash;the truth stands out either in war or in peace, in neutrality or non-belligerency, or whatever particular kind of State one styles oneself as having at the moment.  I did not work for the Government in the last election; I had not confidence in them, nor in that Party, and I do not know that anything has happened since which would win my confidence.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be drawn into that until I have finished with this.  There are hundreds of thousands like me&mdash;many even much more aggressive than I on that point. That is a fact to-day.  Of course, it does not prevent me from supporting the Government, as it is the Government of the moment, and in giving the State whatever power we can give it to defend itself and the lives of the citizens.  That does not indicate our supreme confidence in the Government or in its leadership.  Nothing of the kind.  We do it because we are loyal to the State and because as citizens we realise that it is our job to support the Government in a time of crisis for the sake of the State.  If there were a better Government we would not give less support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke says to-day that a certain thing is our only hope.  He talks about parish councils and does not think they can be made operative now.  It is not councils we want; it <Col N="1960" /> is leadership&mdash;more leadership and clearer-headed leadership.  I may be more stupid than others, but I have asked people&mdash;even those closely associated with the Government&mdash;what exactly is to be done under certain circumstances, and I cannot get any clear indication.  That is what is perturbing the minds of a great number of ordinary citizens in the country and not alone supporters of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>In regard to the remarks made by Senator Hayes, I do not think it is the least bit mischievous in the present circumstances to say that you did not vote for the Government and did not believe in the Government and that you do not believe in the Government now, but that it is your job to support them because they are the Government. I do not see any mischief in that; if we cannot stand that, we cannot stand much.</P>

I do not think it can be alleged that the Opposition are not giving at least as loyal service, as an Opposition, as would be given by Senator Quirke's Party if they were in opposition. Speaking frankly, I may say that I have turned over in my mind in the last month what exactly the situation would have been if the present Opposition were the Government and Senator Quirke's Party were in opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very pertinent to the question, and Senator Quirke has an unfortunate facility for disturbing people and trying to create a wrong atmosphere.  I would be very noncommittal about a national Government, but I should like the Minister to tell us what exactly the situation would be if the Government were on the run and out of the city and were issuing orders as a Party Government.  Does he think that it would be strong enough to withstand that sort of situation?  If Senator Quirke is right and this is the last hope and the only hope we have, I am not too hopeful at all.  The situation is not too bad, so long as we can meet here and express our views and disagree in this House and know that other people can meet and be called into council on matters regarding defence.  If, however, another situation were created here and meetings were impossible and the Government of a Party had the full responsibility of governing and issuing orders under great difficulties, that would be a test, and we would see how the country would stand it.  The trouble is that such things cannot be mended afterwards, and I repeat that what the country needs most to-day is leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put certain questions to the Minister on the last day and do not think they were answered by him.  I am going to give him another chance.  If we are in for a difficult time&mdash;and let us hope that we are not, but you have always to face the worst and aim at the best&mdash;we need to know the position regarding the food supply.  It is true that, since then, the Minister for Supplies has spoken over the radio and told the people what to do.  He has told traders and wholesalers to take in all the stocks they can, and has informed them that if they go to their bankers he feels sure their bankers will meet them.  Have we any information with regard to the quantities of various essential foodstuffs in various parts of the country?  If we were in for a period of internal strife, forced on us by an external power, with lines of communication cut and bridges broken, it would be very unfortunate to have considerable quantities of certain goods stocked in one place and none in the <Col N="1962" /> other, either through want of foresight or business acumen, or through want of cash on the part of wholesalers, or through some circumstance which could have been remedied if the Minister for Supplies had foreseen it in time.</P>
    <P>Have we information as to the quantities of tea, sugar, butter, bacon, flour and such commodities which are stored in different zones that, from a military point of view, would be regarded as having certain relation to internal military strategy?  I wanted to find out from the Minister if there are plans.  Senator Keane gave us some indication that they have been thinking along those lines, but I note that the Minister said nothing.  Are there plans in regard to a situation which may very well confront us here in the event of a breakdown of the present currency system, which is our mechanism at the moment?  These are questions which are in the minds of many people and the amount of confidence which people have in a particular Government, or in any Government, is dependent to a considerable exent on the belief that the Government has foresight and has made plans to meet every conceivable and possible emergency.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke talked about what could be done with parish councils. The worst possible thing you could have at the moment would be too many councils or too many councillors.  A small number of people who knew where they wanted to go, how they wanted to go and whom they were going to bring with them&mdash;these are the sort of people he would find useful, people who would give orders and who would see that orders down the country are carried out.  If you are attached to a local security corps, if you have responsibility even for the partial defence of your local area, you are wondering whether there are, for instance, wireless transmitting sets in the local barracks or in areas adjacent by which communication can be carried on with headquarters.  Obviously, the men in the local defence corps known to one another as John, Tom, Mick and Pat, not ordinary professional soldiers at all but rather men of the type you had operating for a number of years from 1916 onwards, young fellows with a good spirit and <Col N="1963" /> properly equipped, can be a tremendous asset.  In fact, in the circumstances which we might have to face, they might be really more effective than professional soldiers who, drawn together by the necessities of the moment from different parts of the country, know one another far less well.  That is the consideration which many people have before their minds as a point of view which is worth considering and putting into operation. Yet we have no indication of what is being done about it nor can we get any information.</P>
    <P>Various references have been made to the situation in the Six Counties and to the point of contact between Lord Craigavon and the Government here with regard to the treatment of minorities. I am not speaking of the minority here in the sense that the minority in the North are talked of.  There is no doubt at all but that the successful defence of this part of the country is being very badly hindered by the partition of the country and by the position in the Six Counties.  It has been further complicated by the attitude of the minority in the Six Counties&mdash;a perfectly understandable attitude.  The minority there do not feel that they can co-operate.  They do not feel that they have any right to co-operate because many of their rights have been taken from them.  My view is that there should be a clear indication from the Government with regard to its attitude at the moment in relation to defence, and particularly in connection with the minority in the Six Counties.  I know personally how distraught that minority are, and the many difficulties in which they find themselves to-day&mdash; their inability to do anything for themselves, the tyranny inside the area and what they regard as the disregard of their difficulties outside.  I feel definitely that our capacity to defend ourselves here is very considerably hampered by the existence of Partition. There is no doubt whatever&mdash;a week has passed since I first made this statement, and I repeat it now&mdash;that a great number of the people in the Six Counties, people in the majority there, are very much concerned because of their <Col N="1964" /> inability to defend themselves, due to the fact that Partition exists.  I think that if we had a real leadership in the Twenty-Six Counties we would be much closer to a real union of the 32 Counties than we have been for many years.  I believe that we want that leadership now.  If we were sufficiently cognisant of the frightful position of the minority in the Six Counties, the outlawed feeling they have, the tyranny they are experiencing, we would realise that there are factors in this internal situation of ours which are terribly dangerous.  We cannot close our eyes to all these dangers.  If we are to be prevented from saying that there is no clear-headed leadership because it would raise certain doubts in the minds of our people, if we close our eyes to the fact that grave dangers threaten us, then these dangers may come upon us, and come upon us because we unwisely have disregarded the biggest menace of all.</P>
    <P>I urge again that, in defence of the Twenty-Six Counties, Government policy with regard to the Six Counties should be made known.  The time for that policy to display itself is now.  We are non-belligerents in this war, and I do not think there can be any question of that position being changed except we are attacked by some external force. If we are to save ourselves from such an attack, we ought to go to the utmost limits we can, and employ every available means to secure ourselves against attack.  If we could rid ourselves of Partition, I believe we would be going very far to secure the 32 Counties from attack.  That is where real leadership should display itself.  Perhaps that is the one question on which all of us here can be united.  If Senator Quirke feels that it is unfortunate that these things should be said, or that we should have to express doubts in regard to the capacity of the Government to employ all the means that are essential for our protection, we cannot help that.  We have one blessing, undoubtedly&mdash;the liberty here to say these things, but it cannot absolve us from our obligation to support the Government in the conditions that exist here at the moment.  Certainly, it cannot be said that we, on this side of the House, are not doing as much in that respect <Col N="1965" /> as those on the other side.  Such differences as exist should not prevent us from doing our duty, nor should it absolve any citizen from doing his part in the crisis which we have before us.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If we could rid ourselves of Partition&rdquo;&mdash;that is a very fine sentiment, but Senator Baxter did not tell us at all how we can rid ourselves of Partition.  He told us that the minority in the North were not at all satisfied with the Government here, not satisfied with the Government's efforts to end Partition.  I question that statement.  I think the minority in the North of Ireland would be quite satisfied with the efforts made by the Government in this part of Ireland to abolish Partition.  I think the people in the North of Ireland who do not agree with the Government here are the people who are in the majority in the North of Ireland.  If the people who are in the majority in the North of Ireland would only learn sense, act decently, and give up tyranny and oppression, it would be possible to solve the Border problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am in the same predicament as Senator MacDermot, and I am wondering why Senator Baxter did not provide us with a solution.  He was so anxious to blame the Government for its failure to end Partition, that he failed to find any solution himself or to give any idea as to what the Government might do. Apart from Partition, I suppose we are here to criticise the Government for its <Col N="1966" /> financial management of the country. We are supposed to find fault with a lot of the expenditure that has been incurred during the past year, and to endeavour to find ways&mdash;and many of us, I am sure, would be only too glad if we could find ways&mdash;for reducing that expenditure.  I wonder, however, how many of us endeavour to visualise what is likely to happen in this country, say, even next winter, which is not very far away from us, as a result of this terrible conflict that is being waged at present, a conflict that is approaching nearer and nearer to us every day and a conflict that, perhaps, before next winter, may utterly destroy the economic and political life of the neighbouring country.  Do we realise what the effect of that is likely to be in this country, and what the position will be in our towns&mdash;especially in our towns&mdash;during the coming winter?  It is all very well for the people who can afford to store food, and to store fuel, but what about the vast numbers of our people who live from day to day, who buy their supplies in small quantities, and who, perhaps, may find themselves in the position that, when they go for their daily food and their daily fuel next winter, they will have nothing to get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My complaint is that we are not taking sufficiently serious notice of the position that is likely to be facing us. I do not at all agree with Senator Baxter in his condemnation of parish councils.  Circumstances very in different parishes in this country.  You have the rural parish, the city parish, and the town parish; and the men on the spot, and the women, of course, are the people who are best fitted to examine and inquire into the local conditions and provide against the dangers to which I refer.  Now, of course, the arrangements that could be made need a lead, and perhaps I might agree with Senator Baxter to the extent that the lead may not be strong enough or definite enough.  If we form a parish council, that council, of course, has no statutory authority.  It could only act to a great extent as an advisory body. I suppose, but it could do very valuable work and it might be the means of saving the people from the very severe economic stress with which we <Col N="1967" /> may be faced in the coming winter.  As I said already, I do not agree with Senator Baxter in his condemnation of the parish councils, but they could do good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, the lead need not necessarily come from the Government. It could come from the public bodies, and if the public bodies in various places were to move in the matter, get the people in the different parishes organised, and help to organise them, I think it would be quite effective.  I think it was Senator Baxter who made reference to the change in the attitude of the Northern Ireland Government.  Well, the Northern Ireland Government are cute people. Perhaps they see the writing on the wall, and they may be anxious to change their attitude towards us people in the South.  Now, some of us will remember 1913 and the attitude of the men who spoke for Northern Ireland at that time.  I believe it was pretty well known that at that time some very prominent people in the North of Ireland were actually inviting a possible belligerent to come across to the North of Ireland in the event of certain things happening here in the South.  There was a danger of Home Rule being passed at the time, and certain people in the North threatened to kick a certain sovereign's crown into the Boyne in the event of that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with Senator Sir John Keane that enough is not being done with reference to air raid precautions, but the attitude of the people in the smaller towns is this.  They say that there is no danger in the small towns at all and no necessity for A.R.P.  They believe that such precautions will only be necessary in the larger centres, such as the City of Dublin and, possibly, the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford, <Col N="1968" /> and so on, and that there is no danger of any attack that would necessitate the use of A.R.P. methods in the small towns at all, and therefore they are not bothering.  For instance, we were warned months ago about the necessity for gas masks, but gas is not being used in this war at all, and we all hope that it will not be used by either of the belligerents.  Apart from that, however, the people feel that there is no necessity for A.R.P. in these smaller towns, and that is why nothing is being done in the matter.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on one note.  I disagree with Senator Baxter when he says that nothing that was done by the Government during its period of office has changed his opinion as to the Government's effectiveness.  I think that quite a number of people in the country to-day would not agree with that view.  But for the Government's policy in certain matters during the past few years, we here in Ireland would find ourselves in a far more dangerous economic position than we are in at the moment.  The former policy was to leave us dependent to a great extent on supplies from outside sources, supplies of necessary articles, such as foodstuffs, clothing and other essential things.  The work done by the present Government during the past few years&mdash;work that is not at all approved of by Senator Baxter and others, I am sure&mdash;has had a very useful effect up to the present and it is now that we are realising the full benefit of it.  I agree with Senator Baxter that we should all do all that we possibly can, in the interests of the whole country, to support the Government, not because everybody here believes in the policy of the Government&mdash;and, of course, there are many things in which we will always differ&mdash; but because a time such as this is not a time for carping criticism at all and because the position now is that every one of us will be facing very difficult and dangerous times.  In that connection, it must be remembered by all of us that the first people we have to consider are the people who are unable to look after themselves, who have to live from day to day, and whose position, when the real danger comes, will be very precarious indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with some points that were raised by Senator Baxter.  Senator Baxter asks for leadership.  He says that the people of Ireland have not confidence in the leaders at present in office.  Now, that is not true.  On every occasion, during the last three or four years, that the people got the opportunity&mdash;despite all the talk of Senator Baxter and his friends, and despite all the propaganda that was used&mdash;they renewed their confidence in the leadership of the present Government and they still have that confidence.  The people are very grateful that the present leader of the Irish people was in office during these times, because it was through his leadership that we now can enjoy the privilege of being a neutral State, even for portion of our country, at the present time.</P>
      <P>Were it not for his statesmanship since he came into office, we could not be here to-day.  Our declaration of neutrality would have been of no use were it not for the fact of, as I say again, the leadership of the Government and of the Taoiseach in particular in securing that the foreign army had left, at least, our ports in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I think it does not require a lot of intelligence to understand that if our ports were now occupied by the fighting forces there would be very little use in declaring neutrality when you had the enemy already in your country.  The people of the country recognise that and appreciate it and they have confidence that the man who has brought them through such stormy periods in the past is the one man they can rely on to bring them through the present struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand this &ldquo;supposed-to-be-unity&rdquo; we have at the present time&mdash;I can find no other words to describe it.  We hear the Opposition say that they are 100 per cent. behind the Government, yet at the same time, and almost in the same breath, they state that the Government has not the confidence of the people.  I cannot reconcile the two statements because every statement of that kind is an encouragement, to my mind, to those people outside who say that the Government has no right to govern at all.  Every statement that is made here that the Government are losing the <Col N="1970" /> confidence of the people, particularly at this stage, and in the future with dark possibilities before us is damaging. Should the worst come, it will be of absolute necessity that the people should have confidence in their leaders and in the Government, whatever Government is in office at the time, and I think that those statements that are made from the Opposition that the Government are losing confidence have a very bad effect.</P>
    <P>Appeals have been made for a national Government by the Opposition or, I should say, from the Opposition Benches.  Senator Johnston, in particular, pleads for a national Government and, at the same time, in the same breath, he states he holds the present leaders should be condemned as much as the Craigavon Government. I cannot reconcile those two statements.  On the one hand, you are pleading: &ldquo;Open the doors and let us in to assist you in this emergency&rdquo; and at the same time, you say: &ldquo;We are going in, although you deserve the greatest condemnation.&rdquo;  Senator Baxter, in his plea for leadership, brought in what seems to be very important nowadays, the Northern question. I know the leadership in which Senator Baxter would have confidence. They would be some of those leaders who, to my mind, have done more in the past to establish Partition as a permanent feature of this country than anybody else and I think that the people want no more bargains.  They want to see in office the people they have confidence in and, in my opinion, the idea behind all this plea for a national Government is this: some people are afraid that the present Government are putting this State first and foremost and above all, and not giving that consideration to some other particular State that those particular people would like to have given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate beyond saying that I hold that recruiting down the country is not receiving the attention it should be given, and I have to agree with some of the Senators when they say that there is need for a proper lead.  The lead should come from the Defence Council set up here.  A <Col N="1971" /> number of people are, unfortunately, not aware of the crisis that exists at the moment and there is no one to take upon himself the responsibility of teaching and educating them to it.  It was mentioned here that from 1916 to 1920 you had, to my own knowledge, organisers in every townland in the Twenty-Six Counties and probably in the 32 Counties.  You have not got that assistance to-day.  One is comparing with the other, and there is a feeling that if a politician such as a Deputy or a Senator exerts himself or tries to encourage the youth to join the National Army and give it every support, they are out for themselves, that they have a good job and should not be followed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is true, and what is wanted most is the help of the older military men who have given service to this country, men whom the people know in different parts of the country, who did their work when it was needed and whom they trust.  I think they would be the best men to send out through the country to get the youth to join up, to get the middle-aged to assist and to go to the homes and the people of the country and facilitate them in every possible way.  That is my feeling on this particular point but, before you get that, you want to get leaders here to exert themselves and to have men in each of the Twenty-Six Counties responsible for the working and running of their county.  If you get that in each county, we will be all prepared to give obedience and assist in every possible way.  The same would apply to food supplies and to the distribution of the food in the event of trouble. That is essential, just as essential as are the men with the rifles and the guns.  I hope, Sir, that in a short time the leaders and the Defence Council, men of principle and intelligence, will see their way to have something put into operation and that people will get the habit of assisting in every possible way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the Mininster concludes, these matters were adverted to last week and I cannot say that I was satisfied at all with the answer given by the Minister.  He said, <Col N="1972" /> in reply to statements made here concerning the economic position of this country which was likely to arise, which we feel is more than likely to arise, that the Government had given great consideration to all these matters.  I do not think it is satisfactory, from our point of view, to be told that the Government has given consideration to these matters.  I think the Government ought to indicate more clearly than that what they have done by way of planning to meet the situation to which reference was made here.  Senator Goulding, in his remarks a few minutes ago, also seemed to think that more information in regard to planning food supplies should be given.  With that I am absolutely in harmony.  Why this information is not given we cannot say. It seems to me that it is advisable in the public interest that something in this regard should be done.  The British Government, I am given to understand, has divided Great Britain into 800 food areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of these areas is to be as independent within its own confines as possible.  They are looking to the future with regard to food. There is one thing alone which the British Government has undertaken.  What have we done in the same regard?  This situation may be thrust upon us at the earliest moment.  Looking into the war situation, one feels that the next few weeks or the next few months will not pass by without a major military effort being made by Germany against Great Britain.  This must inevitably bring us up against serious problems and we are not satisfied&mdash;especially those of us, as I said here last week, who speak for big organisations of working people in this country, who are undoubtedly likely to be most affected by anything that would happen&mdash;we are not satisfied at all, in so far as we have been told, that the Government are doing all that is necessary to meet this situation.  I hope we are not unduly pressing them, but we feel that we are expressing the views of our people in regard to a very grave situation which is likely to arise. How that planning may be done or how this House or Parliament or those responsible may be taken into the confidence of the Government with regard <Col N="1973" /> to these matters, I do not know, but I am certainly complaining that the responsible people in this country have not been given what we consider necessary information in regard to a very serious and probably most disastrous situation which is calculated to arise in the near future.  The matter is of sufficient importance and sufficiently out of the ordinary for the Government to seek out of the ordinary methods for dealing with a situation such as that. So far as the organisations that I speak for here and elsewhere are concerned, they are quite prepared to give every help and assistance they possibly can to meet that situation.  We think, in effect, that something should be done in the way of a plan.  In other words, at least a blue print should be drawn up.  The emergency may never arise, but if it should, and if plans are not ready to meet it, then you will have the situation which Marshal Petain referred to&mdash;utter and complete chaos, nobody knowing what to do, nobody having thought out the situation, and, consequently, utter and complete chaos descending upon us.  I hope the Government have thought out the situation.  We have been told they have, but I think the Government ought to go beyond that and ought to tell certain people who are is responsible positions what they have thought out and how, in their opinion, the situation is going to be met.</P>

      <P>Last week I got the impression from the speeches made here that a number of Senators were suffering badly from the jitters.  To-day I do not know whether it is that they have gone childish and somebody has been shouting &ldquo;bogey man&rdquo; at them, but they seem to be suffering from something very silly or queer.  I must say that I am very disappointed at the tone of some of the speeches made here to-day.  They are anything but a credit, I should say, to members of this House, particularly at the present time.  I wish to say that, as far as I am concerned, I protest strongly against them.  The Opposition, if it is an Opposition, has an excellent chance, on coming into this House, to criticise and to show something in the way of leadership.  As far as I am concerned, I have seen no indication, <Col N="1974" /> good, bad or indifferent, of leadership on the part of the Opposition, either to-day or on the last day. During the past week I have spent a good deal of time reading the reports of the proceedings of this House, and of the other House.  I read them very carefully.  The result of my reading those reports, and the result of whatever thought I have been able to give to the problems, is that I never had more confidence in Party government, and I never had more confidence in the present Government than I have to-day. I only wish the Government would take it into its mind to call the Recess immediately, and get on with its own particular work.  There are people in this country who do not like this Government.  I know that.  Everybody knows that.  But I would say that if there were an election to-morrow, the present Government would come back stronger than it is at the present time. That is my own conviction.  There is no use in twitting the Government with regard to the figures of the last general election.  I meet a great many people. I travel this country very often from end to end, and my conviction is that the Government never stood higher, and that the leader of this Government never stood higher in the estimation of the Irish people than he does to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter made an interesting speech last week.  He might have left it at that, but he convinced me from what he said to-day that he has not given any thought to the difficulty and complexity of the problems that are arising.  Otherwise he would never have pressed for a specific indication from the Minister regarding Government planning in connection with many of the questions which seem to worry him. The simple reason is that you just cannot forecast what you are going to do in regard to many of these problems, and besides, how is one to foresee all the problems which may arise?  It reminds me of a letter I received some time ago from a certain citizen, asking me if I would ask the Minister for Defence if he would indicate where he expected an attack in this country.  If we knew all the problems that are going to arise, and how and when, we could make our plans perfectly.  I want to <Col N="1975" /> say that I was quite pleased with the speech of the Minister for Finance last week, and I think that if Senators had read it, and had taken a reasonable attitude, especially in view of the emergency, they would have been quite satisfied with the Minister's assurances on these matters.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Finance said (col. 1919):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think I can say to him and to the House in general that the Government is fully conscious and fully aware of the situation&mdash;of the European situation and of the world situation&mdash;and of our intimate relationship to it and to what might come out of it.  It has been under discussion at meeting after meeting of the Government for many months &mdash;both at frequent and long meetings &mdash;and there is no aspect of the question raised here to-day which has not been thought of, discussed and canvassed in some measure at those meetings of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on and said further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I repeat&mdash;with all the seriousness and emphasis I can use&mdash;that no aspect of the matter has been overlooked by the Government.  I do not say that everything has been foreseen. Even with the variety of points of view, the variety of talent, and the variety of experience we have got here and in the Dáil, I doubt if we could forecast the things which might come to pass out of this war, and the way in which we may be involved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied with that statement and I have reason to be.  A number of people put up certain suggestions to me that might be brought before certain Ministers.  The Ministers concerned were good enough to see me and I put those suggestions to them.  There were about ten or 12 of them and I found that every one of them had been covered already by those different Ministers.</P>
    <P>As far as leadership is concerned, I am quite satisfied with the leadership from the Government as it is.  What I think is wrong is that the Government <Col N="1976" /> has done its work too well.  If the Government had been less competent, people would be more aware of the seriousness of the situation. Nobody in this country so far has gone short of anything.  If the Government had been less competent, as I say, people, and young people especially, would realise more the seriousness of the situation and they would be quicker to rally to the national call that has been made to them.  I agree largely with what has been said by Senator Douglas in regard to A.R.P.  I think the time has now come when a definite lead ought to be given to the country on the matter.  In Galway, for instance, I do not think that anything has been done.  Galway is rather peculiarly situated, and the possibility of making underground shelters there is not very great because the city is built on solid granite rock.  What might be done there, I do not know, but I do think that, since Senator Douglas has raised the matter, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures should go into it and give us some indication as to what we in the country might do with regard to A.R.P.</P>
    <P>If I am in order in doing so, I should like to suggest that something might be done in the matter of organising people into corps of volunteers such as we had in the past.  I should like to discuss it further, but we have not got time in view of the Minister's appointment, but I suggest that it would be well worth while considering the possibility of organising the young men of the country into volunteer corps such as we had in the past and I ask the Minister for Finance to put the suggestion before the proper authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to this cry for a national Government for a considerable time and I am really at a loss to understand what it means.  If the members of the present Government, collectively and individually, are not national, I do not know what they are.  Would it improve the situation or make us any better citizens if we dismissed the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government and put in two other men from the Opposition?  Would it make the <Col N="1977" /> Government any stronger or any more national?  It would not, to the minds of most people.  If that has to be done in order to make us do our duty as citizens in time of crisis, it is a very sad commentary on our citizenship.</P>
      <P>With regard to recruiting for the Army, I think recruits are coming up in sufficient numbers and as fast as the Army authorities are capable of dealing with them.  In my own county, about 1,200 young men have presented themselves for the regular Army.  Of these, only the very best, only those who are perfectly fit, to the number of 750, have been selected and are already in training.  For the local security service, 1,500 men have presented themselves in the small County of Clare, and those men have been accepted.  I think very fair progress has been made and there is no indication that the people want a greater lead than they have at present.  I think every young Irishman ought to know his duty and it should not be necessary for members of the Seanad or the Dáil to make a house-to-house canvass to get young men to do their duty.  That is not the way it was done in 1916 or in 1921, 1922, or 1923.  Every man saw his duty then and stood up to it.  For a time, perhaps, it is true that one waited for the other, that young men waited &ldquo;Until we see what So-and-so does&rdquo;.  Happily, in most cases, those who were looked up to in that fashion have done their duty and have offered their services to the Government, and the others are now following them.  If it were necessary to get these recruits more quickly, I think there should not be any hesitation on the part of the Government in calling on young men of certain ages, say, from 18 to 30 years, to register immediately. The authorities of the local committees could then select those whom they thought could best be spared.  But if anybody thinks he can shirk his responsibilities by waiting for somebody else, I think the Government has power to call on those who do not do it voluntarily to do it in another way, and to call them to the Colours at once.</P>

      <P>I think that, in the matter of leadership, we have in the <Col N="1978" /> present Government as good a leadership as we would get from the Government which preceded it.  The members of this Government and the members of the Government which preceded it have records of courage and hard work which need no commendation to anybody in this country.  I do not intend to labour that point, except to say that the Government deserves all the support it can get from the people.  I think it was Senator Hayes who referred to the smug complacency of the present Government.  I think that may be a reflex to some extent of the smug complacency of the people as a whole. I mix with the people of this city probably as much as, if not more than, any member of this House, and everywhere I go I find an attitude of complete indifference to the present situation. I think it would be no exaggeration to say that it would be difficult to convince even one in 1,000 people that any danger exists for this country.</P>
      <P>I find that attitude of indifference and complacency everywhere, and if one listens in buses, trams or on the street, one will hear extraordinary points of view expressed in that regard. Only the other night, in the picture house near where I live, an announcement was thrown on the screen stating that a meeting of the local A.R.P. personnel would be held on Monday night, and at least 50 per cent. of the house rocked with laughter. It was the most appalling thing I ever saw&mdash;absolutely half of the house rocked with laughter when the announcement was thrown on the screen.  The Taoiseach told us last Sunday that this danger may overtake us in a day or in a week, and it is in that regard that I have to complain of the attitude of the Government.  The Government, I am quite certain, has made plans in conjunction with the military authorities for the defence of this country.  None of us wants to know what those plans are, but I certainly do say that, so far as the civilian population are concerned, it is the duty of the Government to let the people know what preparations they have made. There are certain air-raid shelters in the city, but I guarantee not one person in 10,000 would know what to do if there were an air raid on the city to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> In that respect I do criticise the Government.  The Government has the press, the wireless and other means of conveying that information to the public, and I think it is their absolute duty to make these plans known immediately. None of us, as I say, wants to know what the military preparations are, but I have had considerable complaints, particularly from elderly people, with regard to plans for the civilian population.  It would be absolutely useless to try to convince the young people that any danger at all exists.  From 13 to 30 years of age, they just laugh at you.  Bearing in mind what the Taoiseach has told us of the danger that threatens the country&mdash;I have no reason to doubt what he says, and I accept it&mdash;I think we ought to make every effort to let the people know what preparations have been made.</P>
    <P>Thank God, other nations have not had any experience, so far, of gas attacks, but the war may develop in the near future to such an extent that gas attacks will be made against the peoples of different countries.  In that connection, I should like to know what has happened to the gas masks which are in store for the use of our people. An authority on the matter tells me that unless these gas masks are attended to fairly frequently, they deteriorate and become useless after a certain time.  I am not an authority, but I mention the matter so that the Minister may convey to the proper authorities the complaint made in that respect with a view to having it inquired into.  I think that much of the discussion on this Bill has been futile, and I do not think it is necessary to criticise the Government so far as leadership is concerned.</P>
    <P>Speaking personally and frankly, I am quite prepared to believe that the man at the head of the Government is as competent as any man in the country to lead the country in the crisis which confronts it.  I believe that equally of the Government that preceded it, but I seriously urge the Minister to bring to the notice of the other members of the Government the absolute necessity of publicising the <Col N="1980" /> steps they have taken so far for the protection of the civil population.  The Minister for Supplies in his broadcast the other night gave some indication as to what we ought to do.  I think it was a most useful broadcast.  The same steps should be taken to bring to the notice of the public in general the plans which the Government has made for the protection of the civil population. They should be told what they are to do if and when certain events occur.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter. Industries have been in a very parlous plight at the present time.  I understand that many industries have not more than a fortnight's supply of raw materials.  I have that information on the authority of the secretary of a concern embracing many industries: a questionnaire was sent out recently and it was found that something like 2 per cent. have a supply of raw materials sufficient to last for a fortnight. Every one would like to help in trying to solve these matters.  Every one of us here would like to be dealing with economic and social matters arising out of and subsequent to the war, rather than be sitting here week after week engaging in futile and unnecessary criticism of the Government as such.  Many of us are not competent to do certain work, but there is something which each of us can do if we are allocated to it.  I trust that the Minister will bring these matters to the notice of the proper authority.</P>

      <P>The first Senator who spoke to-day&mdash;Senator Hayes&mdash;in this discussion, accused me of not having spoken a word on finance when we debated the Finance Bill last week. I have since looked up the report of the proceedings, and I find that about a third of my speech related to matters peculiarly referring to the Finance Bill&mdash;about six columns.  Of course, I may not have touched on the points in which Senator Hayes was particularly interested, or on the points in which some other Senators were interested; but I think that I touched on almost all of the points raised, either directly or indirectly.  It is not true to say that I did not deal with finance and the Finance Bill.  The Official Report is the <Col N="1981" /> best evidence of the truth of my statement, if anybody wishes to examine it. When we were discussing the Finance Bill, I took the liberty to comment on the width of the ambit of discussion to which this House is accustomed, and it seems to me that the comment I made then is applicable also to the discussion to-day.  We had a discussion ranging from gas masks to Partition. Surely, the Minister for Finance is not expected to answer matters like that in detail.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Senator that I am not going to do that. Senators can complain to their hearts' content, and the complaints and growls will roll off me quite easily.  Those who have not heard it should read the speech delivered to-day by Senator Johnston on the question of a national Government or a coalition Government, and, if they do so with unbiassed judgment, they will find the best answer, and the reason why we could not have a coalition Government, or, at any rate, one on which those with his mentality would be represented.  The answer is, in his own words, very plain for anyone to read.  I dealt with the Finance Bill, but not to the extent with which I would have dealt with it if other problems and questions had not been raised.  They were problems and questions, which I gathered from the Senators who spoke, were the things uppermost in their minds, and which they wished to have discussed, and on which they wished to have the comments of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke at considerable length and have no objection at all to discussing this at greater length and to staying here as long as the members of the Seanad wish, but I suggest that I put myself into the mood of the Seanad on the last day and answered the questions and problems which they put to me.  I did not want to dodge anyone and do not want to do so to-day.  There are questions which I am not competent to answer.  I am not competent to give a detailed answer to many of the questions raised here to-day.  In regard to a point raised by Senator <Col N="1982" /> Douglas on the question of air raid precautions, he said that my answer was vague.  It was an answer to his question.  It is quite a fair thing for the Minister for Finance, discussing an Appropriation Bill, to say that he will bring the matter raised by that Senator, and by other Senators, to the notice of the Minister concerned.  I do not think he can expect anything more than that from me.  I cannot give detailed answers on the question of the arrangements which have been made or are being made at this moment to deal with the protection of the people in regard to air raids.  I told the House that eight or nine months ago I was not convinced of the urgent necessity at that time for spending large sums of money and that I had, as Minister for Finance, tried hard and succeeded, to some extent, at any rate, in curtailing expenditure.  I do not feel of the same mind now.  I do not think I can say any more than that.</P>
    <P>I said the last day that the expenditure of this Government is heavy, as illustrated by the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill that we have here now and the Book of Estimates which goes therewith.  I do not deny that at all.  Accepting the figures quoted by Senator Hayes to-day, expenditure is much heavier now and has been gradually increasing during the period of this Government over the expenditure during the period of office of the last Government.  Taking one instance alone, where it has increased as compared with the last year of the existence of the last Government, I think the figures given by Senator Hayes for the total audited expenditure for 1931-32 and the last audited figures&mdash;for 1938-39, probably&mdash;show that there has been an increase of nearly £10,000,000. I do not object to Senator Hayes emphasising that and calling attention to it.  It has been emphasised over and over again in the Seanad, and that will be done again.  Even so, it will have the same effect politically in the next five or ten years as it has had in the past.  The Senator can &ldquo;put that in his pipe and smoke it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>You will get plenty of it, if you want it.  We are here by the votes of the majority of the people. If we had not a sufficient majority this Government would not be here.  When the people fail it, it will go out, and that will be, I suppose, when it fails the people in the people's eyes.  At any rate, we have had general elections, several of them, and the majority has gone on increasing.  We are told that we have a smaller majority to-day than we had at the time of the general election.  Who knows that?  Who has any authority to say that?  Anybody here, as Senator Hawkins stated to-day, knows that Senators on this side of the House are just as much entitled to say that we have vastly greater support.  But that is a foolish thing to say.  Nobody can say that until we have a general election, and we are prepared to face that at any time.  Listening to some Senators here to-day, notwithstanding the fact that we have national union&mdash;we have a facade of it apparently, but if some of these gentlemen had their way, there would not be much reality behind <Col N="1984" /> that facade&mdash;it would appear from the tone of their speeches that they were willing to wound but afraid to strike. They can strike any time they please, if that is what they want.  It is hard to know what they want.</P>
      <P>We have admittedly spent a great deal more money than the last Government. We have spent it on housing, on old age pensions, on widows' and orphans' pensions, on unemployment assistance, on free milk, on public health services&mdash;millions of money.  I think that money has been usefully spent.  Some people may say we are spending more than we can afford to spend.  That is a question that can be debated and argued.  I do not object to anybody holding that viewpoint.  I am prepared to discuss and to argue it with any Senator on any side of the House at any time.  I think it was necessary to spend that money on housing and on social services in general. I think it would be necessary for a good many years to continue expenditure at the same rate or at a greater rate.  I know it would be a difficult job for the Minister for Finance, whoever he is&mdash;certainly a very difficult job in these times&mdash;to find the money.  In fact, we cannot spend at the same rate in these days, considering what we have spent on defence measures, but I make no apology on behalf of this Government for the additional expenditure, so far as these items of social services are concerned.  Other items that would add to these millions I need not go into in detail.  We stand for it, defend it and uphold it, and in normal times we shall continue to expend money in similar directions. Senator Johnston says this Government stands a very good chance of being beaten in a general election.  That is a wild statement.  Where did he learn that?  I hope it was not from his books of economics.</P>

      <P>The Senator will not do much to save the country, not a great lot, and certainly, if one is to judge by his speech to-day, he will not be asked to do it.  I am not so full of <Col N="1985" /> righteousness, of belief in myself, and in the capacity of this Government that I do not admit, as I said the last day, that it is a human Government.  It is human and, as a human instrument, it has certain weaknesses, but, as I said the last day, and as I repeat now, I am blowed if I can see where you are going to get a better one, individually and collectively.  You certainly would find the greatest difficulty in getting a body of men in whom the country would have greater confidence.  I do not think any coalition or so-called national body that would be drawn out of the hat, or drawn anyway you like, drawn out in secret or by open vote by selection here, that would come in now in this emergency could beget greater confidence.  I cannot see any body of men that would get a greater backing or that could give the country a greater sense of security than this Government does.  It is not a full sense of security, I admit, but a greater sense of security than at present exists you cannot get, I believe, out of any reconstruction. That is my firm belief.  Personally, I would not stand in the way of a better Government, not for one minute.  I would happily step out. That is my personal feeling on the matter.</P>
      <P>I should be quite happy to get out if a decision were come to in our elective assemblies that we should have a national institution of any kind better able to meet the emergency, better able to lead the country, better able to secure for it its rights, better able to maintain its security.  If any such body is suggested by our elective assemblies I know I would not stand for as much as one half minute as an obstacle in the path.  I am sure I can speak for others as well but I honestly believe, and have the firm faith and conviction that, search all Ireland, the Twenty-Six Counties or the Thirty-two Counties, and you will not get any half-dozen men who will combine in themselves the ability to lead this country that is found in the one man, Eamon de Valera.  I do not care what half dozen men are selected&mdash;known public men or unknown men.</P>

I cannot tell the Senator what wireless transmission sets there may be at the disposal of the various forces.  I know that there are some.

      <P>I said that I took it that that was one of the Defence problems proper, arising out of this emergency, and said that there was no aspect of these matters that had not been discussed, considered and canvassed by the Government.  Senator Sir John Keane elaborated on it a bit, <Col N="1989" /> as he was entitled from his position to do, and said that there had been conferences with the Government by the banking community&mdash;the officials who represent the Banks Standing Committee. There have been.  There have been frequent and detailed discussions. I cannot say that satisfactory plans have been evolved for everything that may arise, but the matter has not been lost sight of.  That is all I can say to the Senator.  There have been meetings, and there will be more.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter referred to the minority in the Six Counties, and asked for a clear statement of the attitude of the Government in that connection. Well, all this talk about Partition comes well from the people who were responsible for fixing Partition on the country.</P>

      <P>At any rate, if there is anybody in this country capable of getting rid of Partition it will be this Government.  I am hopeful that we will get rid of it, and I can say that the matter is receiving attention, and those who run may read.  I cannot give, and it would not be wise or helpful to give, any further information at this moment.  Those who read the papers&mdash; certain newspapers referred to by Senator MacDermot to-day&mdash;can see that there is something moving, and that the matter is a subject of live interest at present; and I can say, in reply to Senator Baxter's remark that we would be closer to the unity of the country now if we had real leadership; that the leadership that is here to-day, the real leadership of this country that is here, will undo, with God's help, the crime of Partition that was fixed on the country by those to whom Senator Baxter gave his political allegiance. We have not disregarded that great danger&mdash;the danger of Partition, that is there.  We have not disregarded it&mdash;far from it.  I believe that it will be a great day for this country when we can get rid of Partition; and I say that no month of the years that we have been in office has passed without some effort being made, in one direction or another, in Ireland and outside Ireland, to get rid of Partition.  I am sorry that these efforts have not fructified <Col N="1990" /> earlier, but I have the belief&mdash;I hope not a misguided or misplaced belief&mdash;that Eamon de Valera will yet succeed in ending the crime that was committed when the Boundary was erected in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not know that there are any other questions.  I think that covers all the notes I have made, except that I should like to deal with the question asked by Senator Lynch.  On the matter of food supplies, as on other matters,. I am not in a position to give detailed information, but the Senator knows that there is machinery open to him, and to representative people like him, to get that information.  I am sure that, so far as it is wise to give it, it will not be refused to the Senator if he asks for it in the direction I have indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second amendment of the Principal Act.  The Government has decided to ask for these powers because they felt that they are absolutely necessary.  As Senators are aware the Bill is a very short Bill.  It proposes to delete certain words from the main Act.  These words were designed to prevent trial by court-martial of people not subject to <Col N="1991" /> military law.  That was a safeguard against trying anyone by a military court who was not subject to military law.  In this Bill we are proposing to remove those words in Section 2; and in the next section of the Bill, which I had better read, the object is explained:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government may, by an order under Section 2 of the Principal Act, make provision for the trial, in a summary manner, by commissioned officers of the Defence Forces, of any person alleged to have committed any offence specified in such order, and, in case of the conviction of such person of such offence, for the imposition and the carrying out of the sentence of death, and no appeal shall lie in respect of such conviction or sentence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, that Act is operated by means of Orders, and an Order will be made, if this Bill is enacted, providing for the setting up of a military court.  That court will be composed of three military officers who will be taken from the five members of the present Special Criminal Court. Three of those members will be appointed to form the new court and there will be no appeal from its findings. In the case of the Special Criminal Court at present, there is an appeal.  The new court will also fix its own procedure.  The offences which will be triable by that court will be set out in the schedule contained in the Order, but before anyone, even a person guilty of any of these scheduled offences, is triable by the court, a certificate by the Government will be necessary, and if a person is brought before the court and found guilty there will be only one sentence.  The court will be used only in the most extreme cases and the only sentence which it can impose will be the sentence of death; and, also, the sentence will be carried out speedily, if the Government does not decide to commute or remit the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to review the circumstances which <Col N="1992" /> have induced the Government to ask for these powers.  The other House accepted the Bill without debate, but I am not asking the Seanad to do that. It was not without a very great sense of the dangers of the situation&mdash;everyone in the country is aware of what the danger is&mdash;that the Government decided to ask for these powers.  In an emergency like the present, people who go around with guns or fire at officers of State in the execution of their duty, or try to take the law into their own hands, or to upset the Government, will have to be dealt with in a summary and drastic fashion, and the Government is determined that should certain people persist in acting as they have been acting they will have to be dealt with in a drastic way.  I do not think it is necessary to speak at length on the Bill but, if the Seanad wishes to debate it, I will try to reply to any points that may be raised.</P>

      <P>I can quite understand why the other House did not debate this Bill.  I have rarely had a Bill which I liked less.  I think the attitude at the moment is that no one is prepared to take the responsibility of refusing powers to the Government. For my point I do not propose to debate it or to approve or disapprove. We are dealing with abnormal conditions and if the kind of powers that are contained in this Bill are declared to be necessary, I would give them with much less reluctance to a thoroughly representative Government composed of all Parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have made that point clear.  That is not so.  This Bill is intended for a state of affairs such as existed in the immediate past.  For some time past there has been no shooting or blowing up of public buildings, but if a state of war should come, there will be a more drastic order. This Bill will suit either the present state of circumstances or a state of war, but the order which it is proposed to make will provide, in present circumstances, <Col N="1993" /> for an appeal to the Government.  At least the Government will have to be the confirming authority.  They will not exactly have to confirm but they may refuse to remit a sentence, and if they refuse to remit, the sentence will be carried out. In the case of actual war, if it happens to come, nothing short of drum-head courtsmartial will meet the situation. It may happen&mdash;we all hope it will not &mdash;that a state of war might arise and if looting and conduct of that kind occurred, it will be necessary to vest in the commander of an area drastic power to deal with troubles of that sort.</P>
      <P>It might not be possible to get in touch with the Government in times like that, and it might not be desirable, because it might be necessary in war conditions to take immediate action.  Everyone who knows anything about wars as they are waged abroad &mdash;luckily we do not know very much about real warfare here&mdash;can see how easily an emergency state of affairs could be brought into existence where there is looting, robbery and conduct of that kind.  The commanding officer would have authority in such circumstances to act summarily and to have a drumhead court-martial.  To cover a case like that, there will be a special order but it is not proposed at present. Under the present procedure, there may be an appeal to the Government. The order will provide for a report to the Government on the sentence of the court and the Government may commute or remit the sentence.  It will be seen from that that the Bill is not for a state of war alone; it is for conditions like those we have had in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to make certain amendments in the law relating to instalment orders, maintenance orders, and affiliation orders, and to authorise the release in proper cases of persons imprisoned for the non-payment of debt. An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill and perhaps all I need do at present is to refer to the three principal defects in the existing law, which the Bill is intended to remedy.  The first defect is that under the existing law arrears of weekly sums due under maintenance orders and affiliation orders have to be sued for in the same way as ordinary civil debts. This is a slow and expensive procedure, and I understand that many women who obtain maintenance orders and affiliation orders make no attempt to enforce them when they discover the difficulties involved.  Section 8 of the Bill is intended to provide a simpler and more effective procedure for the enforcement of such orders.  The second defect is that when a man is imprisoned under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, for failure to pay an instalment of a debt, he cannot be released before the expiry of the period for which he is committed, unless he pays the whole debt.  Payment of the instalment for which he is committed is not sufficient.  Section 6 (e) of the Bill is intended to remedy that defect.  The third defect is that there does not appear to be any clear authority for the release of a person imprisoned for the non-payment of debt even in a case where the creditor <Col N="1995" /> asks for the release or in a case where for health reasons it is undesirable that the debtor should be detained in prison.  Section 9 of the Bill is intended to authorise the release of debtors in proper cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking generally, I support the Bill but there were one or two points raised in the Dáil some of which the Minister partly met and some of which I think he did not meet. I understand that his reasons were that he thought they should be in another Bill but it seems to me a great pity that it is not possible, without waiting for a long time, to have some sort of register.  I know the views of certain people&mdash;I am thankful to say I am rarely one&mdash;who have to go to a great deal of trouble to collect debts.  At the same time, I would be much more concerned with trying to prevent credit being given to people who are not credit worthy than I would be to find methods of enforcing punishment against them.  For that reason I believe easy access to a register would have the effect not of enforcing court orders but the effect of making it not necessary to have the orders to enforce to such an extent and to that extent it would be remedial. While I am not prepared to debate at length with the Minister whether it should or should not be included in this Bill, I do express the opinion that it is a pity we have to stand on ceremony and say that because it should be in another Bill it could not be provided now.  I believe it would be of the greatest possible value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a difficulty with regard to the question of the release of men who have been committed.  They could not be released before unless they paid the whole debt.  I am not sure whether we have not gone to the other extreme now by providing that they can be released on payment of the one instalment even though by that time a further one has become due.  That is a difficulty which seems to be rather a flaw in the Bill because the minute a man is released because one instalment <Col N="1996" /> is paid you may have a proceeding all over again, which takes a couple of months, for the next instalment.  When you are now providing that there will be a definite limit of, I think, six years, and there will be no such thing as payment of debts over a long time, I am not so sure that it is necessary to go quite as far as the Minister has done in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I dealt with that fairly fully in the Dáil.  The main purpose of this Bill is to enforce court orders, principally in the case of affiliation orders and maintenance orders and, of course, when we were doing that, we though it well to provide for the release, in proper cases, of people whom it was doubtful we had power to release otherwise.  As I said in the other House, Ministers from time to time have been faced with the problem that the creditor has actually asked to have the person released but it was not clear that they had that power. We simply provide for these things and, as I said to Deputy Dockrell, the other matter is not a matter of enforcing court orders, but a matter of safeguarding creditors in ordinary business and would fall more appropriately to be dealt with in a Bill dealing with the amendment of the bankruptcy laws or something of that kind.  There is something being done in that matter.  I think the position at present is that the Department is waiting for suggestions from some section of the business community in that regard.  We do not think that this is a proper Bill for keeping the register or for going any further than we are going.  It is not that we do not see that it is a serious thing to have people getting credit who are not credit worthy but we do not think this is the Bill to deal with it.  I have not heard any reason to depart from that opinion.</P>
