      <P>The bell, which Senators see on the Table, has been presented to the Seanad by Senator P.T. Kelly.</P>
      <P>The bell is a reproduction in somewhat less than half size of the historic Clog Beannuighthe, or Bell of Armagh, which is at present in the Royal Irish Academy Collection in the National Museum.  The original bell was found about the year 1725 at Ballynaback, between Tandragee and Scarva, in County Armagh, and is dated by the incised inscription at early tenth century.</P>
      <P>The Clog Beannuighthe passed into the possession of the then Dean of St. Patrick's in 1840, and upon his death in 1842 was purchased by the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
      <P>The reproduction was made by courtesy of the Director of the National Museum, and the replica is the work of Dublin craftsmen throughout.  The bell was cast by the well-known firm of Matthew Byrne and Sons, Bell Founders, James Street; and the base, which is of Irish yew, was made in the National College of Art to the design of one of the teachers there.</P>
      <P>I desire to convey to Senator Kelly the thanks of the Seanad for his appropriate gift.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, the main purpose of this Bill is to clarify an ambiguity which some people have professed to find in Section 26 of the original Act.  The clarification becomes necessary by reason of the fact that if an interpretation contrary to that which the Oireachtas understood the section would bear in its plain and ordinary meaning were to be accepted now it would be necessary for this State to find, in respect of moneys already withheld from it, no less a sum than £63,000 and, in respect of moneys which might be withheld from it in future years, an annual sum of between £14,000 and £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that this Bill was to make clear that the meaning which hitherto has been ascribed to the section by the Government and by a number of the local authorities concerned is the meaning which the Oireachtas intended that section should bear when it was passing this Bill.  I think there cannot be any doubt in regard to that matter, if the debates which took place in this <Col N="678" /> House and in the Dáil during the passage of the Bill be referred to.  The issue, shortly, was this: whether the poundage, by means of which the contribution which the local authorities were to pay towards unemployment assistance is raised was to be levied upon the gross valuation&mdash;as defined by certain Acts&mdash;or whether it was to be levied upon what might be described as the effective valuation. That net point was raised on a number of amendments which were put down to the Bill in the Seanad and by two other amendments which had been put down to the Bill in the Dáil; and, in both cases, the decision was taken by the Oireachtas that the poundage was to be levied and the contribution was to be based upon the gross valuation of the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>It was upon that understanding that the local authorities themselves proceeded to act, and for a period of four years the more important of the local authorities&mdash;I should say virtually all the local authorities; there were, in one year or another, certain minor exceptions to the rule, but they were not regarded as being significant&mdash;acted upon the same basis, that is to say, they took the same view as we did in regard to this matter.  For the purpose of raising their contribution to unemployment assistance, they struck a rate which was in excess of the rate prescribed by the Bill.  In the case of Dublin, for instance, when the contribution was to be the equivalent of a rate of 1/8 in the £ upon the gross valuation of the city, the corporation struck a rate of 1/10, as they knew, of course, that a rate of 1/8&mdash;since it would be collected only upon the effective valuation-would not provide the sum of money which would be necessary to enable them to pay their due contribution to unemployment assistance.  They struck that rate at 1/10 because a rate was required.  Since it would only give a yield from the effective valuation, a rate of that figure was required to be struck to provide the equivalent of a rate of 1/8 on the gross valuation of the city.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the interpretation which for four years has been placed <Col N="679" /> upon this section, that the meaning which had been taken out of it by all the Parties concerned, was the correct one.  However, there are people who challenge that.  There might, perhaps, be good grounds for that challenge if, as I said, the issue had been raised in that form when the Bill was going through and if there had been, in the minds of those responsible for the administration of the Act, any doubt as to what the Oireachtas and the Government of the day really intended in this regard.  In that event each Party might, perhaps, go to the courts and ask the courts to determine the issue between them and see which of the interpretations is the right one.  But of what advantage is that going to be in the end?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might be proved to be wrong; and there would be no advantage in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that some politicians&mdash;I hope there is none of them in this House&mdash;might look for a little Party advantage out of that; and, to that extent, the Government might be discredited.  But what good would it be to the taxpayer and to the ratepayer? That is really the issue here. Supposing that it were found, not that the Government was wrong but that the advisers upon whom the Government must depend in these highly technical matters of drafting were wrong, what advantage would there be, except the paltry partisan advantage of which the Senator has reminded me?  What advantage would there be to the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>£63,000 to the Dublin ratepayers would be one advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to show the Senator that the advantage which he thinks might lie there is a pure illusion.  After all, the finances of this Bill were very carefully framed.  The reason why we are justified in asking the local authorities who control areas of more than a certain size, to contribute substantially to the cost of unemployment assistance is that, for one reason and another, it is necessary to <Col N="680" /> pay unemployment assistance at greater rates in those areas, and that the recipients of unemployment assistance at those enhanced rates spend in those areas the money which is received. Accordingly, we feel that we are quite justified in asking the local authorities of those areas to make some contribution, and a significant contribution, towards the cost of paying unemployment assistance at, as I have said, increased rates in those areas.</P>
      <P>For instance, take the case of Dublin. If unemployment assistance were paid in the county borough of Dublin at the same rate as that at which it is paid in any country town of 2,000 or 3,000 people in the rest of the country, the burden upon the Unemployment Assistance Fund would be, I think, about £240,000 or £250,000 less than at the moment it actually is; and it might be said that the Exchequer would be relieved, even though not to the extent of £250,000, because the Dublin Corporation does contribute something&mdash; about three-quarters of it, about £171,000&mdash;towards the additional cost of paying unemployment assistance in Dublin at a rate over and above that at which it is paid to recipients in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I was saying that the very fact that we have to pay unemployment assistance at greater rates in Dublin than elsewhere justifies us in asking the local authority which controls this wealthy area&mdash;where you have almost one-sixth of the total population and the valuation of which is far in excess of the valuation of any area of equivalent size in any other part of the country&mdash;to bear some part of the burden which the citizens of Dublin would otherwise throw upon the Exchequer.  That was carefully considered when the Bill was being drafted, and the proportion was prescribed with reasonable exactness roughly on the basis that at least we were justified in asking Dublin to pay three-fourths or so of this sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, therefore, the contention of those who represent the Dublin Corporation were to be upheld in the courts, what would be the final result?  Do you think we would be justified in accepting that <Col N="681" /> position?  Bearing in mind that we have responsibility not merely to the ratepayers of Dublin but to the taxpayers of the country as a whole, would not we be bound to come to the Oireachtas and say, that by reason of the decision in the courts the financial structure of the scheme had been upset and that we did not think it was reasonable that the poorer parts of the country should have a greater burden cast upon them by reason of that decision in the courts, particularly when the decision was occasioned by some ambiguity which had crept into the phraseology of the Act, that it was due to a verbal mistake, a clerical error, and that the decision of the court, based upon the drafting of the Act, had indicated that the phraseology had not given effect to what was the plain and clear intention of the Oireachtas when this Act was passed? That would have been the final position. If we had an adverse decision in the courts it would have been essential, I believe, in the larger public interest, in order to ensure that justice would be done between one section of the community and another, for the Government of the day, whatever Government it might be, to come to the Oireachtas, to point out how the financial provisions of this Act had been originally planned, and to ask the Oireachtas&mdash;which is the supreme legislative authority in this matter and the supreme taxing authority&mdash;to correct the phraseology of the original Act in such a way that this time, beyond yea or nay, the intention of the Oireachtas would be made effective. That is what would have to happen, naturally and inevitably, if we had had an adverse decision in the courts.  With that in front of us, what benefit or advantage could the people of this State hope to secure by allowing a matter of this sort to be thrashed out in the law courts?  The result would have been inevitably the same.  We should have had a Bill brought in to clarify the position, since some people had expressed doubts and since, apparently, these doubts might have been held to be well-founded by the courts. Mind you, it is a matter of much doubt as to whether the courts <Col N="682" /> would or would not uphold our decision, but whether they upheld it or rejected it, as I have said, the result was going to be the same.  In the light of that fact, what justification would there be for the Government on the one hand to fritter away the taxpayers' money to allow this matter to be tested in the law courts, and on the other hand to permit the local authorities in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and elsewhere, to fritter away the ratepayers' money in the same futile pursuit?</P>
    <P>Nobody was going to get any benefit or advantage out of a course like that except, as I say, the lawyers.  Certainly the ratepayers of Dublin, about whom I gather Senator Michael Hayes seems to be concerned, were not ultimately going to get any benefit or advantage because the Minister for Finance felt he had got to get what was due to him, due to him not in his personal capacity, but as the representative of the taxpayers of this country. Let us not forget that it is not the Government that gets this money.  If the Government puts a measure of this sort before the Oireachtas it does not do it because it has any purely Party end to serve.  It does it in order that the burden of maintaining this essential social service will be properly, justly and equitably distributed, that the general mass of the taxpayers, who live outside the county boroughs, will not be called upon to pay more than their fair share.  That is really what is involved here, and that is the justification for putting this Bill now before you: first of all, to see that the original financial structure of the scheme is preserved, secondly, to see that the financial responsibility which this scheme imposes upon the people will be properly and equitably distributed between one section of the taxpayers and another, and thirdly, to avoid, to obviate, and to prevent public money, the taxpayers' money on the one hand and the ratepayers' money on the other hand, being frittered away in useless litigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister for a long time, and I never cease to wonder at him.  He is the greatest fighter of sham battles that ever <Col N="683" /> appeared in any Parliament in the world.  He has just fought a magnificent sham battle with a whole lot of arguments that no intelligent person would advance about this particular measure.  He has vanquished every single opponent of his own creation and has not dealt, good, bad or indifferent, with what is in this Bill, with the real core of the Bill.  I should not have interrupted him.  He might have been more lucid, perhaps, if I had not interrupted him, but I interrupted him for the purpose of removing doubts and I removed them all.  The Minister has not a single argument for this Bill. I read the debate in the Dáil and I did not find any there.  He is worse here than he was in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This is called a Bill to remove doubts.  To remove what doubts?  It is called a Bill to remove ambiguities, a Bill, the Minister told us, that was to remedy a clerical error.  Did anybody ever hear of anyone getting up in Parliament to say there was a clerical error in an Act of Parliament, and in an Act of Parliament which taxed the citizens?  This, we are told, is a Bill to clarify ambiguity, to rectify a clerical error.  This is not a Bill to remove doubts.  There were no doubts in the law as it stood.  This is a Bill to change the law, not to remove doubts about the law.  This is a Bill to change the law as it was passed under the aegis of the Minister's Government in 1933.  It is a Bill to change the laws that existed and to charge the ratepayers of Dublin, in particular, with moneys which they were never legally liable to pay.  That is what it is.  It is a Bill to make the citizens of Dublin now pay retrospectively money which they were not in law bound to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that there are much more important things in the world than Party advantages.  There are certain principles which ought to be observed in government, in legislation and in taxation.  One of them certainly is that money should not be taken out of anybody's pocket except by due process of law, and that money should not be taken out of people's pockets by <Col N="684" /> retrospective legislation, which is exactly what the Minister is doing here.  He told us, for example, that he did not go to the courts because he was not sure about the decision of the courts, and because that would be an expensive process.  It may be an expensive process, but, if you look at the law charges of the Government&mdash; not only the Minister's Government but the previous Government&mdash;you will see that they have no scruples about bringing taxpayers to the courts and paying all the expenses.  If they wanted to show that somebody must pay them 12/6 extra income-tax they would go to the Supreme Court.  The Minister was not saving money when he did not go to the courts.  He was saving his face, a different thing entirely.</P>
    <P>Then he told us that no matter what the courts decided, he would have brought in the same legislation.  Surely the Minister, in spite of all his sham battling, does not mean to tell us that if the corporation was not liable under the Principal Act to pay certain amounts, he would bring in another Bill to amend the law and make the corporation liable retrospectively after the court decision?  Nothing would surprise me, as I said, but that would be a hard thing to do. First of all, we ought to understand what the Bill is about.  There was a time when Ministers promised that they would abolish unemployment altogether. They did not succeed in doing that.  They passed legislation to provide unemployment assistance, and they imposed half of the burden on local bodies by means of the Act passed for that particular purpose.  The Minister knows that reference to debates in the Dáil or Seanad would not be allowed in the courts, that when you pass an Act, all you can rely on is what the words in the Act mean.  He cannot quote the debates to show what the Minister for Finance, or the Leader of the Opposition, or the back-bencher from any place in particular, said the Act meant.  He can only quote the Act.</P>
    <P>The original Act was for the striking of a certain rate by the Dublin Corporation and other local bodies.  The <Col N="685" /> corporation struck the rate for a number of years in accordance with the interpretation placed on the Act by the Minister.  Later on, when doing that, a doubt was suggested to them, and in accordance with their duty, which they could not evade, they sought legal advice.  They made no attempt of any kind to evade liability, and no attempt to avail themselves of any ambiguity or clerical error.  They simply did their plain duty in discovering what their liability was, and how much they were supposed to pay.  They took legal advice and got a very clear and unambiguous opinion from senior counsel. That opinion was in two parts.  In the first part, it said that they were liable to pay a special rate of 1/8 in the £ on the net valuation and not on the gross valuation.  The second part stated that they could deduct from the next payment the amount overpaid in previous years.  I am not discussing the justice of the matter&mdash;I am only discussing the legal aspect.  The corporation, having got that advice, was absolutely bound to act on it.  If they had continued to pay they would certainly have been surcharged by another Minister, the Minister for Local Government.  There could be no doubt about it.  Where a local body takes a legal opinion, the auditors of the Local Government Department will always take exception if the local bodies pay more than they are considered legally liable for.  Therefore, the corporation acted on the legal advice they got, and if they had not acted on it, as I said, they might have been surcharged. Further, any citizen could have taken action in the courts and could not only have broken this particular rate of 1/8 or 1/10, but broken the whole rate as well, causing great expense and confusion in the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a legal remedy open to him which he did not take. After all, if there was any weakness in the Principal Act, that was not the fault of the Dublin Corporation or any other local body.  It was the fault of the Oireachtas, the Government and their advisers.  What is happening now is the Minister for Finance is going to make the corporation pay for the mistakes with which they have had no concern <Col N="686" /> whatever.  The mistake was his, and he is remedying it at the expense of the people.  The law determines what should be paid, and the corporation paid it in a particular way.  It was a matter of accounting.  If the Government, by any kind of mistake, made an over-payment, they would lose very little time in taking it back.  For a number of years, I think, one of the Estimates contained a note stating: &ldquo;This officer was over-paid, and annual repayments of the sum claimed by the Minister for Finance are being made.&rdquo;  They have no compunction, when they make an over-payment, in getting the money back, but for the moment I am dealing with a particular point.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Act was to place a particular burden on the corporation. The burden of the corporation has, in fact, increased, and it is really extraordinary to have the Minister for Finance telling us that Dublin is a wealthy city and must pay its share. One would imagine from that that the city and the ratepayers were not prepared to bear their share.  They are prepared to bear their share but they are concerned only to pay their legal share.  It is not right for the corporation or any local body to pay money which it has been advised it is not legally required to pay.</P>
    <P>The city is not a wealthy city&mdash;the Minister has seen to that.  There is an immense number of unemployed. They come to Dublin from the country, so that Dublin has to solve to a large extent what are national problems in both unemployment and housing.  I have heard a great many arguments in the other House, as well as in this House, but I never heard an argument like that of the Minister why Dublin should make an additional contribution to unemployment assistance.  It is argued that the people who get unemployment assistance spend it in Dublin City and that Dublin should make an additional contribution on that account.  I think the Minister hardly meant that.  He simply threw that off at the time that he was wrestling with this particular problem.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  The Minister <Col N="687" /> is collecting retrospectively from the corporation £63,000 which it never had any legal liability to pay.  I would like to know whether he is going to try to collect it in one instalment.  The rate will be struck next month.  Is there any indication whether this sum must be paid in one year or whether it may be spread over a series of years? An amendment was moved in the other House asking that repayment should be spread over ten years.  That may be too long and, perhaps, a period of two or three years would be more workable. Perhaps the Minister would give some information as to how he intends to impose this burden.  It would be very unfair and unjust to expect payment in one year.  Perhaps he could tell us if it is going to be spread over a period and, if so, over what period? Meanwhile, let me say that this Bill is not a Bill to remove doubts or ambiguities.  It is a Bill to change the law and to make the corporation liable for payments which they were not liable for during the last seven or eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>From experience in other matters, I can well appreciate the Minister's point of view, because in the original Act of 1933 it called for 1/8 in the £ on all rateable properties and hereditaments, meaning exactly 1/8 in the £ on the gross valuation.  If the Government had framed the Act, as it is done between county councils and urban councils, to say that they wanted a certain amount of money, it would be for the corporation to strike a rate which they would be sure would bring in that amount.  For instance, county councils make demands on urban councils.  They do not ask them to strike any particular rate but they demand, say, £5,000 from an urban council.  A rate of 10/- in the £ on the gross valuation might be required to make up the amount but, in order to realise the demand, you have to strike a rate of approximately a shilling more to bring in the required sum. Whether there is ambiguity about it or not, I think it is fairly clear that the Government intended to get the effective sum that could be raised on <Col N="688" /> the gross valuation by a rate of 1/8 in the £.  Apparently the Dublin Corporation understood that quite clearly when they struck a rate of 1/10 in order to get the amount required on the effective valuation.  I do not think there is much ambiguity about it at all except for the difference between the effective and the gross valuation.  To my mind it is quite clear that 1/8 on the gross valuation was intended to be the rate under the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very largely with what Senator Hayes said.  In the course of his remarks the Minister, I do not know how many times, said that the object was that taxation should be properly and equitably divided.  I do not think any of us wants to dispute that proposition, but you have to deal with the situation as it was presented to us.  It is the kind of situation that not infrequently arises in business, and there is a fairly well recognised method of dealing with it.  If, through an error, I as a businessman send out a wrong, quotation or put in a letter something which is not specifically clear, I stand by that until I find out that an error has been made.  I then write and change the quotation for the future, and I state that it did not represent my intention.  If there is a doubt, and it is decided that my quotation conveyed a certain meaning to my customer, I have to stand by it. That is the usual recognised practice. Local bodies, the Dublin Corporation or any other local body, are, if you like, in a subordinate position to the State. They are administrative bodies who have a duty to those to whom they are responsible, and they are placed, to my mind, in an extremely unfair position by the attitude adopted in this Bill.  If an error is made in any Bill contrary to what the Government of the day who introduced it&mdash;assuming it to be a Government measure&mdash;intended, I do not think it is right that the Government should seek to rectify that error retrospectively and demand from some subordinate body something which that body found they were not, after the passage of the original Bill, liable for. I do not think that is a wise or sensible method of dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> I sympathise with the Minister's remarks in regard to litigation.  In fact, if it were in order, I could criticise the action of the Government in certain cases that came to my knowledge where the Government for very small sums had gone to the Supreme Court at the expense of the taxpayer.  To that extent, I am in agreement with the Minister to-day.  I go further and state that if he had made up his mind that this Bill was to be retrospective, then there was no use in going to court, but I think where you had two statutory bodies, one the Government of the country and the other a local authority, and where there was a doubt as to the meaning of an Act, as far, at any rate, as the retrospective portions of it were concerned, if they both could not agree as to what was the right interpretation of the Act, or if they could not reach a compromise upon it, it would be definitely much better to incur the expense of going to court and have the matter put right for the future.</P>
    <P>Involved in this measure is another matter.  I have no doubt that the Government in 1933 meant that the amount should be collected on the gross valuation, but I think they were wrong in fixing it on the gross valuation. If the action of the corporation put it right, it is not, as the Minister said, inevitable that you must make it wrong again by doing, as he said, the right thing.  There have been many cases where Acts of Parliament were operated on altogether different lines to those intended by the Government but yet all that turned out for the best.  The Government does not always seek to rectify all these errors by legislation.  I am not convinced at all that the gross valuation, which includes a large proportion of the valuation upon which you cannot collect rates at all, is the most equitable method of collecting the contribution towards unemployment.  The more there are premises unoccupied within the area of any administrative body, the less able is that particular local body to contribute.  The system adopted by the Government is the exact reverse of being equitable, and the more empty houses or empty shops there are in any district the <Col N="690" /> more inequitable this method of collecting the rates becomes.  I cannot agree that it is a proper and equitable division, as stated by the Minister, taking the country as a whole.  I think I stated that at the time the original Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, two matters to be considered in connection with this Bill.  One is that you are making retrospective the provisions of this Bill to 1933.  I think it would be much fairer if the rate for this contribution were calculated on the actual valuation, even if there had to be adjustments in the rate the following year to compensate for that.  In other words, the local authorities who suffer most as a result of bad trade, or through a depletion in valuation, should not be penalised by that fact, in relation to the amount they have to pay for unemployment assistance. There was another statement made by the Minister with which I also disagree. He seemed to imply that because one area&mdash;he referred to Dublin &mdash;had more unemployed than another it was better able to pay, because the unemployed spent this money in the city.  Taking the country as a whole, does anyone really believe that those areas in which there is the largest number of unemployed are best able to pay this contribution?  Is that not an absurd contention?  The position is the exact reverse.  The small amount which these men are paid&mdash;and goodness knows it is small enough&mdash;and which they have to spend would in no way make up for the contribution which a particular area has to pay. I think the principle as enunciated by the Minister is entirely fallacious and the position, as I say, is the exact reverse.</P>
    <P>I also think it is a mistake to collect this contribution on the gross valuation. Secondly, I think it is quite wrong that when a dispute occurs between one legislative body and another &mdash;the local body though, in a small way, is also a legislative body&mdash;it should be settled by the stronger and higher body simply turning round and saying to the smaller body: &ldquo;We will make you do it.&rdquo;  Every effort should be made to have the dispute settled <Col N="691" /> amicably, to adjust it legally and equitably.  If it is impossible to arrive at a settlement by consent, the matter should be settled by law.  If it were then found that the Government were seeking to enforce a wrong principle, by insisting that the contribution should be paid on the gross valuation, it would be quite proper to bring in a Bill by which the future working of the Act could be regulated.  I think that the less retrospective legislation there is, the better it will be for all concerned.  It causes discontent and it upsets arrangements which have been made in perfectly good faith in the past.  I am not prepared to say that it should never be resorted to, but I do say it should be utilised only on the rarest possible occasions.  It is a pretty well accepted principle that it is wrong to make a man punishable for something which was not an offence at the time he committed it.  It is not a very far departure from that principle, which is so generally accepted, to say that it is not right to make ratepayers liable for something for which they were not legally liable at the time this rate was struck.  On the whole I think the Bill is a very bad one.</P>

We come along here, again, as I say, the supreme law-making authority in the country, and try, to the best of our ability, to make the meaning of the statute plain and clear even to the most deficient intelligence, and we have the allegation hurled at us that we are trying to enact a piece of legislation which is going to be retrospective in effect and going to have, from the point of view of the public liberties, all the ill consequences which Senator Douglas has put before the House.</P>

      <P>I said that, for certain reasons, unemployment assistance had to be paid at greater rates in the City of Dublin than elsewhere, and the Senator who interrupts me is the farmer's friend.  I do not know what action he is going to take on the Bill, but if he votes against it, let the farmers, about whom he is so concerned, know this that he is going to ask them to foot the City of Dublin's bill in regard to this matter of unemployment assistance.  However, that is perhaps a digression.  What I want to come back to is the allegation by Senator Douglas that I used the argument that because there were a greater number of unemployed in the City of Dublin than in any other part of the country, Dublin ought, accordingly, to pay a contribution over and above that paid by the general body of taxpayers towards unemployment assistance.  I repeat now that I said nothing of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say that unemployment assistance was paid at higher rates to those who live within the boundaries of the county borough <Col N="694" /> than is paid throughout the greater part of the country, and that, accordingly, since it was paid at higher rates, and since, of course, the money was spent in the city, I did not see any reason why the ratepayers of Dublin ought not to contribute towards this payment of higher rates.  I did not say what Senator Douglas has said because, in fact, the proportion of the citizens of Dublin who are unemployed is very far from being the highest in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There are congested areas and congested districts along the whole of our western seaboard, where the proportion of unemployment or under-employment is greater than it is in the City of Dublin, and one of the reasons why the Government feel constrained to come to the Oireachtas and to ask the Oireachtas definitely to put the Corporation of Dublin out of court in this matter is that, if we were to acquiesce in the position taken up by the corporation in this regard, we should, in fact, be putting a greater burden upon those areas, where, because of unemployment or under-employment, the need is very much greater than it is in the City of Dublin.  That is one of the reasons for our coming here, and, so far from having used the argument which Senator Douglas ascribed to me, one of the justifications for putting the Bill before the Oireachtas is that if we did not do so, we would be accepting the position which he ascribed to me.</P>
      <P>Another argument which the Senator used was that, if this were a transaction between ordinary private individuals, if, for instance, he had entered into a contract, or had sent out an invoice or account, and it had been shown to him afterwards that he had made an error, he would stand by the error.  That would be merely in accord with the ordinary canons of good business, but if the private citizen stands by an error in business, it is his private loss. Nobody else is going to be damnified, but this is not a case of private citizens dealing with private citizens.  This is a case where the Government is charged with the responsibility of seeing that justice is done as between one section of the citizens and another. We are trustees for the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> It is upon the Government and upon the Oireachtas that the obligation rests of seeing that if, by reason of a dispute that has arisen, one section of the citizens is going to be prejudiced, and unreasonably, unfairly and unjustly prejudiced, by that action, those who cannot protect themselves and who have no other means of securing redress in a matter of this sort, are protected.  The responsibility rests upon us, in such circumstances, of asking the Oireachtas to correct that situation and to remedy it, and that is what this Bill is doing.  There is no use in setting up false analogies between what a citizen may do in his own private affairs and with his own private moneys, as Senator Douglas has done, and what is to be done with public moneys.</P>

This, however, is a case where public moneys are involved and, as I say, there can be no analogy between them.  There can be no use in talking, as politicians often do, as if the moneys concerned in transactions of this sort were the private property of the Government.  We are only here as trustees and custodians of moneys for the public as a whole.</P>

However, if there were no doubts in this matter, would the Senator explain to us how it is that for over four years the Corporation of the City of Dublin levied a rate the proceeds of which would be equivalent to 1/8 in the £ upon the gross valuation of the city?  Does not that, at any rate, impugn their custodianship of the corporative rights of the city?  Does it not reflect upon them?  The Senator says now that there were no doubts.  I will agree with the Senator to this extent, that for four years the corporation had no doubt as to what was the plain meaning of this section and, acting in that absence of doubt, proceeded, as I have said, to impose a rate on the effective valuation which would give us the equivalent of the statutory rate <Col N="697" /> it levied upon the gross valuation of the city.  Mind you, they did that also in the year 1938-39, and in sending out their demand notes they pointed out that the rate of 1/10 in the £ was being struck in order to enable the Dublin Corporation to meet its obligations, under the statute, to the Exchequer, in regard to unemployment assistance.  The corporation did that, and must not have had much doubt when the rate was struck.  Unfortunately, and perhaps somewhat conveniently&mdash;one does not know which&mdash; a doubt did arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unfortunately, I must say, we got the benefit of the worst part of the doubt because, while they collected some £170,000 from the citizens, they only paid into the Exchequer £118,000 and retained something like £50,000 or £51,000.</P>

At any rate, they collected that money on the plea that it was to enable them to meet their obligations to the Government and the public Exchequer.

      <P>Does the Senator suggest that the Exchequer is going to misuse that money?  Mind you, that has been one of the undercurrents and one of the innuendoes running right through this debate&mdash;that this money is being misused in some way by the Government.  However, we can leave that for the moment.  Let us see what was the other argument put up in order to justify the action of the corporation, not perhaps in withholding some part of the moneys due for the year 1938-39, but in going back and recouping themselves for moneys which, they held, had been overpaid in the preceding years.  It was this: that the corporation took legal advice and got a clear opinion.  Yes, but does the Senator think that we acted without legal advice?  We were equally fortified with legal advice and we had an opinion which, we think, is as good, as reliable and as sound as the opinion which the Dublin Corporation had.  We will put it on this plane at any rate: that it was at least as reliable.  There may have been a great deal more consideration, perhaps, given by the legal advisers of the Government to this question than may have been given by the legal advisers of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I do know that the whole matter of the drafting of this section was the subject of very serious and prolonged examination and consideration by our legal advisers when the Bill was going through the House, and that arose out of the fact that both in the Dáil and in the Seanad amendments had been put down which went to the root of this matter.  We were satisfied, and those who put down the amendments were equally satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing they were advised that they were entitled to retain the money, I put it to the Seanad that we had legal advice on the other side which was equally strong.  I am going further, I am saying that our legal advisers were likely to have given much deeper consideration to this matter than the legal advisers of the Dublin Corporation.  That is not to impugn the care which the advisers of the Dublin Corporation might have given to a question of this sort.  I am saying that the probability is there, because of the fact that when the original Act was going through this House this very question was raised in a net form on amendments put down. In considering those amendments, the phraseology and wording of the original section of the 1933 Act was very carefully scrutinised.  Our advisers are, I think, as good and as capable as are to be found anywhere else.  They advised us that the section as drafted could mean only one thing and that <Col N="700" /> was that the poundage was to be levied upon the gross valuation of the municipalities concerned.  That was their advice.  Senator Hayes has said that the Dublin Corporation was bound by the advice of its legal advisers. Naturally, if we get legal advice on the other side, we are bound to act on it, too, in the interests of the general body of the taxpayers&mdash;which includes the general body of the ratepayers of Dublin.  The obligation rested upon us just as much as it rested upon the Corporation of Dublin, to maintain the point of view of the general taxpayer as to how this issue was going to be resolved.</P>

It might be necessary or desirable to have the matter argued out in the courts, but here where, as I say, the debates in the Seanad and in the Dáil make it clear that the Oireachtas intended this poundage to be levied upon the gross valuation, what was the use of going to the courts to get a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks about the Oireachtas having made it plain and clear, but it seems to me that the only way in which that can be done is in the text of an Act.  There is no use in talking about one set of legal advisers advising one thing and another set of legal advisers advising another thing.  The only solution seems to be to leave it to the courts.  The courts have been set up in this State to decide, not what is meant by speeches in the Oireachtas, but what is meant by what is actually set out in the text of the Act.</P>

      <P>The fallacy in that argument would take too long to disentangle. The position was that the intention&mdash;whether they succeeded in expressing that intention without ambiguity or not is, perhaps, a question at issue&mdash;of the Oireachtas was clearly that this poundage was to be levied upon the gross valuation.  All I have got to do is to turn up the text of the amendments which were put down in the Dáil and in the Seanad in regard to this matter.  In the Dáil an amendment was put down by Deputy Corish to insert before the word &ldquo;rateable&rdquo; the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo;.  Now, the issue that has arisen in this matter is whether the poundage is to be levied upon the effective valuation.  An amendment was put down, as I have said, by Deputy Corish, to insert before the word &ldquo;rateable&rdquo; the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; so as to make it clear beyond doubt that effective valuation was intended.  When the matter came up here, Senator Michael Staines had a whole series of amendments with, in some cases, &ldquo;effective&rdquo; and in other cases &ldquo;assessable&rdquo;, but the whole purpose of those amendments was to confine the levy to the effective valuation. That was the point.  Those amendments were defeated in both Houses of the Oireachtas; they were defeated because the Oireachtas decided that it wanted to have this poundage levied upon the gross valuation.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot say what the intention of the Oireachtas was.  I may tell the Minister that, when I was in the Dáil, there were times when a clause of a Bill was before me and it seemed that there was a desire to attain a certain end, and I did not propose an amendment because I was satisfied that the Government was misinterpreting it.  The Minister would not be able to determine my intention or the intention of the Oireachtas: the only way the State can know that is by the text of the document as determined by the court. If anyone were to get up and say that there were other intentions, it would be <Col N="702" /> an arrogant action.  Even the angels do not know the secrets of hearts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being an angel, I have sometimes to read mundane documents, and know that, when a person proposes to insert the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; in this particular section before the words &ldquo;rateable valuation&rdquo; it is the clear intention of the person who wanted to put that word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; in&mdash;if the record of his words means anything&mdash;to ensure that the section would be interpreted as the Corporation of Dublin interpreted that section in 1938/39.  That is my view of the matter and I am perfectly satisfied, without dialectical hair-splitting, that that is going to be the view of the House in regard to this matter, just the same as it was the view of the Dáil in regard to it.  I am afraid these digressions have caused me to wander a bit from the point.</P>
      <P>I was asking what would be the upshot, supposing we allowed this question to go to the courts.  As I said in introducing this measure, and I wish to make it clear again, if the courts had found that the section had not given effect to what was the clear intention of the Government of the day in regard to the financial structure of this Bill, all we could have done would have been to come here with a Bill of this sort, and re-establish the financial structure of the Bill as we had believed it to exist prior to the judicial decision. What is involved is this: whether we are going to fritter away the taxpayers' money on the one hand and permit the Corporation of Dublin to fritter away the ratepayers' money on the other hand, in order to arrive at the same conclusion, which is, that the financial provisions of the Bill should remain as the Government which introduced the measure intended them to be at the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to require all sanitary authorities to make reasonable provision for fire-fighting services in their districts.  The Bill also lays down a form of procedure regarding the inspection of buildings, and the service of notices on the proprietors of dangerous buildings, so as to ensure the maximum protection for life and property in the event of fire.  At present rural sanitary authorities have no power to provide fire brigades, that power being restricted to county boroughs and the towns to which the Towns Improvement Act, 1854, applies.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the sanitary authority may themselves provide a fire brigade with the necessary machinery and equipment, or they may make an arrangement with an adjoining fire brigade authority or other body for the use of the fire brigade service maintained by that body.  It may be found that greater efficiency, combined with economy, can be secured in many cases if the brigades to be established have a wide area of operation, and my Department, in the administration of the Bill, will encourage any necessary steps towards reasonable unification of local control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in towns where fire brigades already exist, the present law in regard to the inspection and control of buildings is inadequate, and Sections 7 and 8 are among the most important provisions of the present Bill.  These sections give the local authority power to inspect all buildings for the purpose <Col N="705" /> of ascertaining whether they would constitute an exceptional risk to life or property in the event of fire.  If the sanitary authority, as a result of the inspection, are of opinion that a building comes within the definition of a &ldquo;potentially dangerous&rdquo; building, whether by reason of the numbers of persons resorting to it, the absence of means of extinguishing fires or of escape, the material of which the building is constructed, or the nature of the articles stored in it, the local authority will have power to serve a notice on the proprietor requiring him to cease to use the building for the purpose which renders it dangerous, or to carry out specified alterations.  The proprietor has a right of appeal to the District Court against such a notice.</P>
    <P>If this Bill becomes law the obligation to provide fire-fighting services will rest on the sanitary authority in each district.  Town commissioners are not sanitary authorities, and the Bill contains provision accordingly for the transfer to the sanitary authority of fire brigades, apparatus, etc., at present maintained by town commissioners. As all expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the powers conferred by this Bill will be chargeable on the whole sanitary district, including, in the case of county health districts, the areas of towns under town commissioners, the responsibilities of the sanitary authorities would overlap with the present powers of town commissioners if the latter were left unaltered.</P>
    <P>In the event of a sanitary authority failing to make reasonable provision for fire-fighting services after the Bill comes into force in its district, complaint may be made of such default to the Minister, who is empowered to have the complaint inquired into and, if found proven, to require the sanitary authority to comply with its responsibilities in the matter.  This procedure will constitute the only remedy against the local authority.  No action will lie against them in connection with damage to persons or property as a result of fire.</P>
    <P>A day will be appointed for bringing the Bill into force in each sanitary district.  In districts where fire brigades <Col N="706" /> are already functioning it may be possible to bring it into force immediately; in other districts it will be necessary to allow a reasonable time for the local authority to consider whether they should provide their own service or enter into an agreement with an adjoining local authority, and in the latter event, to conclude the necessary agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much by way of contention in this measure. There is, I think, one vital point to which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to address himself in replying. I think it will be generally conceded that the country would be better off, even in normal times, if we were better equipped with fire-fighting apparatus throughout the country generally.</P>
      <P>Now this Bill is making it obligatory on sanitary authorities to provide fire fighting equipment within their areas or in conjunction with the sanitary authority in an adjoining area and if they will not do it the Minister is going to see, when somebody writes up to him that they will not procure it, that they will be required to procure it.</P>
      <P>I understand the position at the moment is that all this equipment has to be imported and that a revenue duty is imposed on these machines.  I want to get it quite clear if that is the position, because if it is, local authorities are going to be confronted with a situation which seems to me ridiculous and absurd.  It looks as if we are all out to get revenue and that we must get it justly or unjustly.  These machines are not machines which can be procured or are being manufactured in this country.  In a good work people ought to be encouraged, but in a case like this, where they are not going to injure any local industry, and where the importers of these machines are not going to be put into competition or to put something we have locally out of existence, what is the justification for imposing a tax other than to collect revenue?  If we are reduced to straits like that to obtain revenue, it is impossible for this State to survive.  It does not seem just and above all, it does not seem sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that inasmuch as these machines are machines which local authorities will be compelled to buy, that local taxation everywhere is sufficiently high to justify local authorities being permitted to import any machines requisite for fire fighting purposes free of duty.  There can be no justification for the imposition of the duty on such machines when they are not being manufactured in the country.  I think there is general agreement that the Bill can be a useful measure but it ought not to be used in a harsh way and I suggest, A Leas-Chathaoirligh, if I understand the position aright, that the first step the Parliamentary Secretary should take, in order to make his measure acceptable to the country, is to see that the duty imposed some time ago should be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 5 of this Bill, the Minister or the Government takes power to insist that these appropropriate bodies shall provide fire fighting arrangements.  Now, I cannot say anything against that but I myself had experience of two fires in Continental towns&mdash;one a large town, a very well known town, and the fighting of that fire was very adequately done.  The moment the fire was notified the brigade came forward.  That brigade was a brigade of volunteers.  In the other place, a much smaller town, I happened to be one of the volunteers fighting the fire.</P>
      <P>Now, we are passing this Bill imposing on the local ratepayers the obligation to provide equipment and organisation.  I do not see why in this country every time there is any such service required the people have got to provide it through the payment of rates.  I do not see why the idea of service should be utterly repugnant to the people and that nobody should be asked to give voluntary service for the general good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only glanced through the Bill but I would like it to presuppose, as in the large urban areas already equipped with fire-fighting equipment, that when it comes to smaller areas there should be voluntary organisation <Col N="708" /> for the maintenance of the fire-fighting equipment.  I would like to know if the Minister anticipates that there should be a voluntary system or whether the unfortunate taxpayers are going to be asked to impose on themselves the cost of maintaining further employees and increasing the burden of rates.  Apart from the mere economy of it, I do feel that in this country the idea of voluntary service for the general good is overlooked.  A lot of the work we are paying for could be done by volunteers, and especially when it comes to small communities the natural thing should be that they would have a voluntary organisation that would periodically meet and be available in case of need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with Senator Fitzgerald that an effort should be made to encourage local bodies to form voluntary brigades. The reason I speak so strongly on this matter is that in the town in which I live we had a very dangerous fire lately.  Two houses were practically gutted and were it not for the fact that volunteers came forward and did what Senator Fitzgerald points out would be a useful thing, the fire would have been far worse than it actually was.  One thing struck me very forcibly and it would need looking after.  The Bill at the moment confines itself to each sanitary district.  In many districts the nearest fire brigade is in another sanitary district, possibly in another county, and in the case to which I referred a moment ago the Cork fire brigade had to be summoned.  That brigade had to drive 40 miles and when they came to the town the hose fittings were not of the same standards as the hydrants in the town and they were, therefore, useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be advisable that there should be some co-operation between the various sanitary areas in the country.  If by any chance a brigade had to be summoned from a neighbouring county area there should be no doubt but that the hose fittings would fit the local hydrants so that there would be no danger of a brigade being summoned and, after dashing to the place, finding their hoses and other <Col N="709" /> equipment useless.  Many of the sanitary areas in the country are practically all rural areas.  There may be one or two large towns, but the greater portion of the area would be composed of small villages and towns. In many of these towns there is no water supply at all, and in others the water supply is rather inadequate and the pressure that could be generated would be so low that it would be almost useless in a hose.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty there and I think it could be surmounted if some central area were taken in a county and a brigade established in that area so that it would not be outside a 20 mile radius of any portion of the sanitary district, because it would be obviously impossible to have a fire brigade in every town and village in the county or sanitary district.  On the other hand, where a water supply is available, I thoroughly agree with Senator Fitzgerald that every effort should be made to get volunteer bodies to act with the local Gárdaí and hold an occasional practice so that when a fire would occur there would be no danger of panic and the men would know what to do.  In the case of my own town, the volunteers had no previous practice.</P>

      <P>They had none except that the local town commissioners had provided a fire hose.  However, it could not have been effective but for the action of the volunteers who came forward at their own risk.  They got wet to the skin, spoiled their clothes, and ran the risk of catching pneumonia.  I think that in such cases there should be special clothing available so that the volunteers could guard themselves against such dangers.  Oilcloth overcoats or helmets would be a safeguard against the dangers that the men referred to encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to be said against the Bill&mdash;everybody is in support, and, <Col N="710" /> after what happened in my own town, everyone is crying out that it should have been brought in long before.  At the moment there are fairly large towns in every county exposed to terrible dangers.  In many cases hydrants are provided, but the pressure is so low when the hose is attached&mdash;very often after it has been years in storage without attention&mdash;it is not very effective. Another trouble is that the fittings on the hydrants are almost rusted.  All these things require constant attention if unfortunate results are to be avoided.  There is nothing to be said except in favour of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Bill does not seem to deal with water supplies, and that the Minister has given us extremely little information.  As a matter of fact, I had an example in my own town where the water supply was very poor.  Up to last year, they had to save the water for three days in order to have sufficient to wash porter glasses on Puck fair day.  I think we are entitled to know before the ratepayers are asked to provide this large amount of money what these services are likely to cost, how many brigades we have now, and how many more are required.  I put this question because the cost of the Bill seems to fall entirely on the ratepayers.  At the same time, letters are being sent to the county councils saying: &ldquo;You must keep down your rates because you have got them so high already that the ratepayers cannot meet them, and you have to work on overdrafts&rdquo;.  I have seen a letter like that during the past week.  At the same time we see a certain amount of camouflage carried on in the fact that there is a reduction in the Estimates in the Vote for the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should have some actuarial figures before we incur any liability for an expenditure of this kind, particularly at a critical time like this when we are urged by the Government to reduce expenditure. There is an enormous variation in the areas of the different sanitary authorities and some of these authorities will have to bear an altogether disproportionate <Col N="711" /> expenditure in setting up these fire brigades.  I think it will be entirely unjust if the Government insists on these schemes being carried out without giving any assistance towards them.  Finally, has the Minister got any actuarial figures from insurance companies as to the danger of fire in this country now, as compared with ten or 20 years ago, or as to the danger of fire in this country compared with other countries?  All these are matters about which we should have some information before we pass this Bill.  Then there is the question of the personnel of the brigades.  Having regard to the present position in the City of Dublin &mdash;you will find the definition of &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; in Section 1&mdash;I suggest that the personnel of the fire brigades should be organised on the French system under which members of the fire brigade are not allowed to strike. Their emoluments are fixed by the State and they are exactly in the same position as a member of the Gárda or of the Army.  They are available to save State property or ratepayers' property at any time whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that some fire-fighting machinery is necessary in every town but this Bill will mean an additional burden on the already overtaxed ratepayers and I think some provision should be made for a contribution from some other source.  The most that an urban authority can do is to provide the machinery and the fire-fighting forces must be organised on a voluntary basis. It is very discouraging to such voluntary workers to find that they get very little sympathy from anybody after a fire.  I have known cases where such men turned out to a fire in their Sunday clothes.  Their clothes were rendered useless&mdash;they were ruined, in fact, and yet the insurance companies would not contribute a penny towards making good the damage these men suffered in giving their services voluntarily. These services were given more for the benefit of the insurance companies than for the benefit of anybody else.  I do not know if a provision <Col N="712" /> could be embodied in this legislation that insurance companies who receive very heavy premiums&mdash;even in a small town they receive a couple of thousand pounds in the year&mdash;should be compelled or induced to contribute in some way towards making good the loss suffered by these voluntary workers on the occasions of fires.  My experience has been that not alone do these workers suffer damage to their clothes and to their bodies, but their enthusiasm has also suffered when they find that nobody has any sympathy with them, not even to the extent of providing them with new suits of clothes.  I know that fire brigades are necessary but I am wondering if the Minister could devise any means, such as a small levy on the insurance companies, to create a fund out of which voluntary workers would be indemnified against personal losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should all welcome this Bill.  To my mind, it provides for one of the most urgent needs in the country at present.  We have all had the experience from time to time of taking up a paper and of reading of some shocking fire.  The necessity for having proper fire-fighting appliances in every town is then brought home to us.  I think that where the preservation of life is concerned, there should be no question of expense.  The only question that should enter our minds is how to have an efficient service.  That should be the prime consideration in the case of fire-fighting as in every other service&mdash; to have the service efficient.  An important consideration in this connection is to see that fittings throughout the country are of a standard type.  Anybody who knows anything about plumbing will appreciate that there are different makes of fittings and different couplings.  One coupling will not fit into another of a different type.  If the fire brigade from a certain district is sent to an adjoining district, it is possible that the fittings in that district are of a type different from the fittings in the district from which the brigade came, and the fire brigade would then find that they are practically unable to render any assistance. <Col N="713" /> In connection with the inspection of premises, I think a good deal can be done by that means to eliminate the possibility of fire at all.  We all know of hotels and restaurants where large numbers of people congregate and where no proper provision is made to cope with an outbreak of fire.  I do not think that a voluntary brigade service would be practicable because the members of such a brigade would have to attend to their ordinary work during the day and it might be found that they would be very far apart when a fire occurred.  I do not think a voluntary service will provide a very efficient service.  I hold that expense should not be considered in this matter.  It is an important matter, and it is only when its importance is brought home to us when we read of deaths at fires that we see the necessity for the Bill.</P>

      <P>The title of this Bill&mdash;Fire Brigades Bill&mdash;is not, I think, exactly fortunate because what the Government and all of us really have in mind is fire-fighting and fire prevention which goes a good deal beyond the mere providing of fire brigades.  I know that the matters touched on by the various Senators were before the minds of the framers of the Bill, but very important also is the attitude of the people in respect of fires.  I think there should be some sort of training for everybody so that they may know what to do in case of fires and so that they will not lose their heads.  That is very important and it is very important, too, that all householders should see that there are no defective electrical fittings in their houses.  A very common cause of fire in old houses arises from putting new fireplaces over old joints near the ground.  Several fires have occurred in the middle of the night from this cause and people ought to know the dangers.  I do not know what means could be adopted, but if fire brigades were organised in the bigger centres, lectures could be given on how to act in case of fire and on the ordinary precautions that anybody can take.  There is a danger of fire in nearly every house now and everybody should know, in a rough kind of way, <Col N="714" /> how to take the initial steps to prevent it.</P>

      <P>The first point raised by Senator Baxter as to importation free of duty can, I think, be met under existing conditions.  So far as fire engines are concerned, and I think, most of the fire-fighting appliances, such as ladders, which are imported, on application to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence, permission to import free of duty is given.  I cannot take it upon myself definitely to state that permission is invariably given, but so far as I know it is the usual practice to permit importation free of duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear on this because I am certain I read some time ago of a local authority close to Dublin which proposed to bring in a second engine.  I think there was considerable duty payable on it and, as a result, the proposal was dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into the point, but that is my information at the moment, that the Revenue Commissioners give a licence to import free of duty.  There may have been some other reason why it was not given in the instance the Senator has mentioned, but I will look into it between now and the next Stage.  Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Goulding, and most of the Senators who spoke, raised the matter of voluntary services in fire-fighting. I hope that under the Bill we shall be at least able to maintain the voluntary effort that has been made in the past, and indeed to extend and improve it.  If, under the operation of the Bill, we have one reasonably well-equipped and reasonably well staffed fire brigade in each county, I think we would be doing fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to be able to get a degree of co-ordination between the various sanitary authorities.  There may be three or four towns in a county, and a number of villages in a rural sanitary district, and we hope, under the managerial system, to get a considerable degree of co-ordination in regard to the fire-fighting equipment and services <Col N="715" /> established in the county.  A town and, very possibly, the largest town, or the town with the best fire-fighting equipment at the moment, would, in all probability, become the central fire-fighting station for the particular area. I think that some small trained personnel, employed on a more or less permanent basis, will be necessary, but it is intended that we should enlist the services of the general community and avail of the services of the trained personnel to train the general body of people who volunteer for fire-fighting services in the different areas.</P>
    <P>As to the question of cost, I cannot give Senator The McGillycuddy any actuarial figures as to what the fire-fighting services which may be set up under the Bill may ultimately cost.  It will depend on a variety of circumstances and will be governed, in the main, by the steps which a local authority considers it wise to take in order to be in a position to cope with any outbreak of fire in its area.  Some sanitary authorities will probably be more easily satisfied as to the precautions necessary than others, and some will probably spend less under the Bill than others.</P>
    <P>On the question of water supply, it is quite true that we have not an adequate and efficient water supply in every town in Ireland, but it is also true to say that we have an adequate water supply in a very large number of towns and villages and that, in recent years, we have made very rapid advances in the provision of adequate water supplies in our towns.  Where an adequate water supply is not available, it would be unreasonable to ask a sanitary authority to provide fire-fighting services.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every sanitary authority shall make reasonable provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and it would be unreasonable to ask any sanitary authority to establish a fire-fighting service in an area where no water was available.  We hope to continue the provision of water <Col N="716" /> supplies, to improve the systems where they require improvement and to provide water and sewerage systems in the towns and villages in which they are not available at present.  That, too, however, is a matter of finance and, apart from the financial end of it, there are very often geographical and other difficulties which make progress in that direction fairly slow.</P>
    <P>The question of standardisation has been raised by Senators Goulding and Hawkins, and I think by some other Senators.  That is an important point, but at the same time I do not think there is the degree of chaos that has been suggested by some of the speakers here, or that there is a real danger that, if a fire brigade is called in from a neighbouring area, they will not be able to avail of the water supply because of the fact that the equipment is not standardised.  It may occur, and especially in areas where the water supply has been put in many years ago and where standards may have changed considerably, but in so far as recent water supplies are concerned an effort has been made in my Department to secure standardisation of fittings as far as it is possible to do so.  I understand that so far as hydrants and hose connections are concerned, there is now a uniform standard, in general.</P>

Well, as I said earlier, to a limited extent that will be possible under the operation of the Bill.  If we have even one person in a county trained and skilled in fire-fighting I think that, by a series of lectures, instructions and demonstrations at different centres in the county, we ought to be able, even with that one man, to build up a fire-fighting service that might be of tremendous use to us in a time of crisis.</P>

It seems to me that, in the light of existing experience and the various appliances for fire-fighting that exist in certain districts in this country and elsewhere, it should be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some figure, even an approximate figure, of what the cost of this is going to be to the whole country.  I think that we are very prone in these days to take on legislation of a similar nature to this without going into the possible cost, and I should like to know if the Minister could give us an approximate figure or a general idea of what this is going to cost the ratepayers to carry on&mdash;even for a certain area.

Normally, when bringing in legislation before the Oireachtas, it is a matter for action by the Government, and when the action of the Government brings in any activity an estimate is generally given of what the cost will be.  It seems to me that there is a certain amount of irresponsibility in the fact that we should legislate here, not to impose a duty on the Government, but for the Government to impose a duty on somebody else, without some idea being given of the cost. The Dáil insists that an idea of the cost should be given and, as we are now proposing to put on additional taxation, I think it is eminently right that we should have some idea as to the cost, and I imagine that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I think that Ministers ought to apologise or, if not apologise, to give us some explanation, when coming in here in connection with a Bill of this kind, in view of what used to happen.  When I was Minister for Defence I had to bring in a similar Bill every year, and every year, rather wearisomely, I had to deal with the question of when there would be a permanent Act.  When the new Government and the new Minister came in, about eight years ago, they said that they would shortly bring in a permanent Bill, and I have never had an apology for all this humbug that was going on when I was Minister.  Another point that used to be made, and it was rather unfortunate for those who made it, was as to when Army costs were going to be reduced.  Leaders of the Opposition used to get up and argue that the Army should not cost more than £1,500,000.  As a matter of fact it duly came down to that.  Again, they brought it down to £1,250,000 and £1,000,000.  As a matter of fact, when it got so dangerously near the low level of £1,000,000, I think there was a proposal that it should not be more than £750,000.  Now, we are being asked to renew the Defence Forces Bill, and, personally, I am not going to vote against it, but it must be remembered that the Government is one, that it is a unit, and that, therefore, the Minister who comes before us now, as a member and as a portion of that unity, has full responsibility, just like every other Minister, and must accept full responsibility, for what has happened under his predecessor.  I have no doubt that the Government was very wise in removing the Minister's predecessor from the office of Minister for Defence and putting him into this other office which, I think, is commonly called in Army language a &ldquo;buckshee&rdquo; job. On the 23rd of last December people began to query what was wrong with the Army in connection with the rather lamentable event that was able to take place at that time.  It is a rather ungracious position to be in, to get up here and say: &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; but I should like to point out that most discussions about the Army flow from the revelation that was made on the night <Col N="720" /> of 23rd December last, and I think it is significant that, before that&mdash;I have forgotten how long before, but I think it would be about a month or two previously, as Senators will remember&mdash;I got up here in the Seanad and told the Minister that my information with regard to the Army was that its general morale and discipline had seriously disimproved.  Not only did I state that just as baldly.  I explained the reasons why&mdash;or the most important and most effective reasons why&mdash; that disimprovement had taken place. Nobody was more grieved than I was when the gloomiest things I had said were adequately proved on the night of the 23rd December last.</P>
      <P>First of all, on the cost of the Army, one of the Senators&mdash;Senator O Buachalla, I think&mdash;actually had got up and said it was absurd that we who had struggled for freedom should now make any query about the cost of the Army to defend that freedom.  He did not want any reference to it; he thought we should not lower ourselves by discussing it.  The point I tried to bring out was that it does not follow that an Army costing the nation £5,000,000 is necessarily as good as an Army costing £1,000,000; that is, an Army costing near the £5,000,000 mark compared with one costing&mdash;I gave the figure&mdash;£1,170,000.  The assumption that, because an Army is costing more it is going to be better, not only does not flow necessarily but, as I tried to point out on the last occasion, the contrary is the case.  When the Army was being run properly and the cost was being cut all the time, rather rigid control had to be maintained. One might have appeared to be rather mean in the control one maintained, nominally and immediately in the interests of economy, but that rigid control, that rigid watching, actually had a good effect on the Army discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I was speaking in the House on this subject, I referred to the fact that, in the case of the mobilisation of these volunteers, I knew of an instance where a two-ton lorry went 100 miles to bring in one reservist.  A Senator afterwards came to me&mdash;a <Col N="721" /> Senator of the Government Party&mdash; and said: &ldquo;You are an awful man.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;What have I been doing now?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;Bringing in that thing about the two-ton lorry.  That is just a mean reference; what does it matter about a thing like that?&rdquo;  I mention that just as an incident that came to my mind to illustrate a point. If you have a condition in the Army in which a two-ton lorry goes 100 miles to bring in a Reservist it means there is a general slackness and a loosening of discipline.</P>
    <P>I also gave another reason, as I understood it, for this disimprovement of Army discipline.  The Government instituted this system of Volunteers. When I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, matters came up before us of looseness in the control of public property and money.  One thing brought out by the Comptroller and Auditor-General was that when these Volunteers were started and Volunteer halls were set up around the country, the men's uniform, boots, guns and so on were Government property and should have been safeguarded, but, as a matter of fact, there was constant disappearance of these things.  I was a member of the Opposition, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and I refused to take a very strong line on that, as I knew that, once the Dáil sanctioned this system of Volunteers as established by the Government, it was quite impossible, if you are going to have Volunteer halls in villages all around the country, to prevent certain troubles arising.  The Army system is a hierarchical system, for a body of men living together.  It is quite different from the police force.  The men live in barracks or camps; there is the O.C. of the camp and there are various grades.  There is the responsibility of one man to the other, the responsibility of the man above for the man below.  That is the way the Army works, and it was a dangerous thing when these Volunteer halls were distributed all over the country.  You might send an N.C.O. or an officer down: we do know times when the behaviour of these people was thoroughly bad.  I do not see how <Col N="722" /> central control of the Army could control this as rigidly, under these circumstances, as they could in the normal conditions of the Army.</P>
    <P>The Government started this Reserve system, and, as I understand it, when a young man proposed joining these Reservists he was encouraged to join on the ground that if it became burdensome to him or if his mode of life required that he should cease to be a volunteer, he could leave by giving seven days' notice.  In all these matters we have to recognise the ordinary slackness of human nature.  Men who are in charge of the training and discipline of men are working to an end. They are working to have a disciplined body of men and they may put considerable sweat and labour into trying to create a well disciplined body which will be effective when required.  When a man is labouring and striving to discipline men to give them that necessary sense of order, there does seem to be a natural reaction when he realises that, at the end, after his sweat and his struggle, that man can turn round and say that he is giving a week's notice and that he will cease to belong to this body in a week's time.  It is natural that a man will not exercise the same energy and control as he would if he thinks the man is going to be there for a fixed and regular time.</P>
    <P>That is why it is, when the ordinary soldier joins the Army, he does not come in just as he would to an ordinary job, subject to a week's notice or to a fortnight's notice: a man who joins the Army joins for a stated number of years and if, during that time, he is not on his job when he should be he is arrested as an absentee or a deserter. That code is not just an arbitrary thing; it is because human nature has shown that these men, on whom money has been expended to make them effective soldiers, are not going to be allowed to go anywhere else when they have been made effective soldiers. There is a lien on them, making them available when required.  Then, we had this system of Reservists who could resign and cease to be members on seven days' notice; and it was quite natural&mdash;I have no blame whatever for <Col N="723" /> the officers&mdash;that the same rigid discipline which is only achieved through hard and particularly arduous labour, could not be imposed upon them or demanded of them, as they could resign on seven days' notice.</P>
    <P>Another and less worthy thing which was operating, I understand, was this: a great many of these men who came into the Reserve were known to be members of the Fianna Fáil Party, men who were related to the secretary of the local Fianna Fáil club or related to some Minister or Deputy.  Unworthily in this case&mdash;if what I am told is true&mdash;the officers felt a certain diffidence, a certain difficulty, in imposing rigid discipline.  Irrespective of whether there is any foundation for that or not, it was in the natural order of things that the same discipline could not be imposed on men who could resign in a week's time and disappear. The ordinary soldier has to attest for a period of years and if he is not available or seeks to get out of the Army, he is dealt with according to military law.  What happened here? These men were recruited all over the place.  If they had any discipline at all, it was not the discipline necessary and appropriate for men in the regular Army, or in any way comparable with the discipline established and maintained amongst the ordinary members of the Army.</P>
    <P>Then, suddenly, the Minister mobilised these men all over the country. To begin with, it was rather unfair to men who had joined on the assumption that they could resign on seven days' notice, when they had failed to do so to find themselves called up.  One knew many cases of hardship.  Men with good jobs, possibly earning £4 or £5 a week, were called out and in most cases they had not foreseen such a thing.  They joined the Volunteers feeling that they could give a week's notice if they felt it was inconvenient for them to continue.  This has caused very considerable dislocation in the lives of these men and often in the businesses in which they were employed.  I understand&mdash;and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong <Col N="724" />&mdash;that it happened that there were battalions or companies of the regular Army men, with a standard of discipline, called up along with companies of the Reservists with a lower standard of discipline.  I understand that the policy of the Government was to infiltrate these Reservists into the regular battalions.  One might say that the idea of putting them into the regular battalions would tend to lift them up to the standard of the regular soldiers but a little ordinary prudence and judgment would tell one that the contrary is the case.  Discipline does not just happen and remain.  It only remains in so far as it is actively maintained.  An officer in charge of a body of men of the regular Army insists on a certain standard from them and maintains it, but when the regular battalion or company, or whatever it might be, consists of regular troops and these Reservists, you cannot demand of one what you can demand from another.  You cannot demand from an elementary school product what you may rightly and appropriately demand from the product of a university, although often the products of the university leave a lot to be desired. The natural effect of that is that the officer in charge cannot expect from men who have not the appropriate training, standards which he can expect from or impose upon the battalion of regular troops.  Although you cannot expect the greater from the less, you can get the less from the greater and the effect was to reduce the general standard of discipline in the Army itself.  It is much easier to descend than to ascend. I am giving you what I understand and I did not have to wait until the 23rd December to know about it.  I say now practically the same as I said four or five months ago.  The effect of bringing these new men in was to lower the general standard of discipline in the Army.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the position of the Army in my period of office. When I left the Army I had a tremendous respect for the men who had worked under me and with me.  I did not expect perfection although I am afraid a great many of those men who <Col N="725" /> were under me did feel that I was always demanding an impossible perfection. In handing that body of men over to the Government coming in I did think that I was able to give an assurance that the Government could expect from these men an undeviating loyal service and that these men, although they could not achieve what I might call an impossible perfection, had attained a remarkable degree of discipline, a remarkable degree of efficiency, judged in the light of the opportunities and the experiences of the previous years.  I said all this, as I say, a number of months ago.  Nobody was more disappointed than I was, nobody felt more sympathy with the men in the Army than I did, when it transpired, on the 23rd December, that a body of blackguards could go into the main Magazine Fort in this country and seize public property and could reveal that the ordinary disciplinary methods, the ordinary routine of an army, was not operative there.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Buckley, on the last occasion, demurred that anybody could complain about the cost of the Army. What I have been trying to point out is that the unfortunate people of this country are being robbed of additional millions of money, not to receive greater value, but in fact receiving lesser value.  Why was all this additional expense indulged in?  In the year before last September there was a general uneasy situation in Europe culminating last September in the declaration of active warfare in Europe.  All sorts of countries had to take special measures in the light of what had happened in Europe.  When you are taking any special measure, when you are doing anything, you conceive a possibility which you have got to meet and you can see the best way and most appropriate way to meet that possibility.  I often notice in listening here, even in this matter of fire brigades which we discussed a while ago, that people think, is it a good thing to have fire brigades? if so, let us have them.  As one Senator said, do not let any question of expense operate.  In life you have to have a certain amount of danger.  Some people think that if you think there <Col N="726" /> could possibly be a fire then at any cost we must have a fire brigade.  That is the way the human mind works, particularly the Governmental mind.  If there is a possibility of a fire they think it is absolutely necessary to have a fire engine, but, then, that fire engine costs a certain amount of money and you have to weigh up the likelihood of a fire, and even if a fire is likely, its cost and so on, and in the light of such judgment, you might say that although a fire is costly the continued maintenance of fire brigades will be costlier even than an occasional fire.  The same thing applies to a war. There is no country at any moment of history that can say: &ldquo;There is no possibility, whatever, it is actually impossible, that we shall be involved in a war.&rdquo;  There is no safety, whatever, in human life.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there is a war in Europe.  We begin promptly splashing around about 4,000,000 unnecessary pounds on the Army.  I am giving my own point of view.  In my opinion these are unnecessary pounds.  What should the Government do?  It should consider, bringing its mind to bear upon the available data, are we likely to be involved in this war.  It is clear that we cannot be involved in this war. We cannot go to the war.  The only thing is that the war will have to come to us.  I admit that that is not as impossible as the proposal in the song when the child sings, &ldquo;Don't go down the mine, Daddy, let the mine come up to you&rdquo;.  Then it should use prudent judgment.  I cannot get up here and now and say that there is no possibility, that it is absolutely impossible and cannot happen, that this country will be invaded.  Nobody can say that. We may be.  But you use your human judgment there and ask what are the possibilities&mdash;what is the likelihood?  I maintain that the likelihood of our being invaded is 100 to one against. The way I see the situation is this: if we were invaded, by whom are we going to be invaded?  The ordinary man will say, possibly by Germany.  If the great military power of Germany is able to get here it will mean that it has overcome the British Navy on the high seas and if it has done that I do not <Col N="727" /> see what is our position.  You can spend any number of millions, you can rob the unfortunate people of the country, but once that has happened, if the Germans insist on coming here and invading us, and if they succeed in doing so, having wiped the British fleet off the map, then what is our policy? It may be very unpatriotic, it seems the truth very often is unpatriotic, but the best thing we can do is to ask, &ldquo;What are your terms?&rdquo;.  A £5,000,000 £10,000,000 or £1,000,000 Army is not going to make one-half-pence worth of difference.</P>

      <P>I am speaking here because I feel the danger facing this country at the moment is not a military danger.  I admit anything is possible. There is no certainty in life&mdash;the only thing you are sure of in life is that you are going to die, but using human judgment as to what is dangerous is, I suggest, what we should do and then provide against it.  In my opinion, the danger is an economic and financial disaster in this country and I submit that that economic and financial danger is the most urgent matter to be considered. That is far more imminent and likely than any invasion by an enemy&mdash;England, Germany or anybody else.  What is the Government doing in view of the virtual impossibility of invasion?  It is spending £4,000,000 of money and, by its actions in spending this money, is imposing a lower standard on the people of this country and leaving this country more than ever open to much more likely financial and economic disaster.  We are spending <Col N="729" /> an extra £4,000,000 as I said four months ago&mdash;and it was as though somebody went out to prove how right I was&mdash;to have a less efficient Army for the purposes for which the Army exists.

      <P>That is leading me to believe that Senators on that side of the House are more stupid than they really are.  I am not going to vote against the maintenance of the Army, but I do object strongly to the fact that the Government has wasted money on the Army and made it less efficient and I do object strongly also to seeing a lot of men degraded beneath human dignity by being put to accept labour on something that is absolutely futile, ridiculous and useless. That is the digging of holes in Merrion Square and other places in the city on the pretence that there may be air raids on the country, and on the further pretence that if there were air raids those holes would serve <Col N="730" /> some useful purpose.  We are just pitching money away at the very time when, as I said, the real danger to this country is financial and economic.  We are pitching that money away, not for the betterment of the Army, but demonstrably to have a less useful Army than the one we had when it cost £1,270,000.</P>
      <P>I know something of army men and I have got great sympathy for them and I understand human weakness. We had this happening on the 23rd December.  At the moment, there was a Minister and there was another Minister in a &ldquo;buckshee&rdquo; job and you had the various hierarchy of the Army upwards.  When you established a military inquiry&mdash;it was an old English principle that a man must be tried by his peers and there must have been some particularly moral foundation for that&mdash;it should be obvious that if you take soldiers or officers of the rank of colonel and put them into the position in which their report may have to assign guilt or negligence or fault of some kind, those men are placed in a completely false position when they have to enquire into the conduct of and possibly condemn their colleagues, when they have to hear evidence against men who are their superiors in rank and who hold their fates in their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great belief in the faith, conscientiousness and integrity of purpose of officers in the Army but I have no exaggerated idea of human nature.  The task they were set would require superhuman virtue.  They were going to be put on a board of inquiry and they were told witnesses would come before them and they would have to question and examine them to try to get the complete truth.  If it transpired that the witnesses shared the guilt to some extent, then they were expected to cross-question them and to get the full truth.  But, remember the Minister is still in office, and when you put men in a position in which they may be required to condemn the Minister or to imply criticism of the Minister, remember this: you may be up before that Minister a couple of weeks later, called on to render account to him of your <Col N="731" /> actions.  That Minister has the power, through the Government &mdash; he is hierarchically your superior&mdash;to ruin your professional life.  Is it fair to a man to put him into that position?  It imposes a severe strain on a well disciplined Army to put its officers in the position that they may have to condemn a member of the Government for something which occurred through the operation of the policy imposed on the Army by the Executive.</P>
    <P>I have not seen the report of the inquiry but, before there was any incident or inquiry, I was able to give some indication that things were wrong in the Army.  It does seem to me that it was against all justice and prudence that, while these Ministers remained in office, their subordinates in the Army should have thrust upon them the responsibility of inquiry into the responsibility for what happened on that night.  It was most unfair, and if it were a fact that the evidence tended to react against the Minister, against his prudence, his wisdom, his good judgment or efficiency, it was too much to ask those men to go out solely controlled by love of duty, when that love of duty might easily lead them to condemn their superiors and possibly ruin themselves for the rest of their professional careers.  Looking at this morning's paper I noticed that the Minister, apropos of something regarding the Army, said that it had had the sanction of the Army experts.  I have great respect for the Army, but I am not so much impressed by the experts in relation to European events.  When it comes to what should be done with the Army, in the light of circumstances existing in Europe, strictly speaking it is not the Army experts who should be consulted.  Strictly speaking, functionally, in relation to whether or not we require to expend more money on the Army, to have more equipment, the possibility of invasion or of our being involved in hostilities, the experts you should apply to are not the military experts but the experts of the Department of External Affairs. That is the Department that should have advised on that point.  I am <Col N="732" /> sorry to have taken up so much of the time of the House and to impose such a long drawn-out agony on Senator O'Donovan.  He, however, seems more agonised when speaking himself, judging by the tone of his voice, than when he is listening to me.  I do think that this House, with its responsibilities to the people of the country, should raise a unanimous voice against pouring out the people's money on disimproving the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy of the Reeks The McGillycuddy of the Reeks">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points arise out of Senator Fitzgerald's speech.  I am afraid I cannot agree with his contention as to the constitution of the court of inquiry being wrong.  If the officers of the Army are worth anything at all, then they should be able to conduct a court of inquiry within that Army and report, without regard to any views of their superiors, as to the actual facts of the occurrence.  There is however one matter upon which I very much agree with Senator Fitzgerald and I speak as a soldier of many years' experience, both as a regimental soldier and a staff officer.  I refer to his remarks on the system which apparently has been adopted of infiltrating into the regular units, men who are called up from the reserve and the Volunteers.  The result of calling up untrained personnel and fitting them into disciplined units with very high standards of efficiency, with traditions, amongst others, of service to the colours presented to them by the State, has the effect of not only doing harm to that particular unit to which they are infiltrated but also must have very unfortunate results on the units which are called up for service, who have got feelings of their own and who served in peace time in various stages under wholly different conditions.  I would suggest that it would be very much better to keep men who had been called up on mobilisation under trained officers in separate sections attached to the various companies and formations which existed in the regular Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I hitherto have been very loath to give full value to the statements which have been made here and elsewhere on the subject of <Col N="733" /> Army discipline, particularly as most of the reflections have been levelled at the rank and file.  At our last sitting, I raised this question with An Taoiseach and I was amazed to hear him explain the circumstances which surrounded the unfortunate raid on the Magazine Fort as consequent on the difficulty of ensuring that a systematic rule of opening and shutting the gates by order and numbers should be carried out.  I do not ask for one moment that there should be a disclosure of the findings of the court of inquiry but I do demand that the Minister should give us an undertaking that there will be a really close overhaul by experienced, and possibly independent, people of the way in which the functions of our commanders and our staff of formations throughout the Army are carried out.  I think we are entitled to know one thing.  So far as one can see the lower ranks, who were directly responsible, have been brought before the court of inquiry and several junior officers have been retired from the Army but we do not know, and I think we are entitled to know, what preparations, in view of the emergency which apparently existed in the mind of the Government, an emergency which necessitated the passing of a special Act for the defence of the State, were made to ensure that that very large amount of ammunition was kept in safe custody.  Were there any alternative means of communication over and above a single telephone line?  Were there any patrols outside the guard which was in the Fort itself? Was it considered at any time whether the ammunition might not be safer in the magazine of some barracks elsewhere?</P>
    <P>I have already observed that I was inclined to think that the state of indiscipline in the Army was overstated. I held that view and I still hold that view, but I have moderated it somewhat after reading the report of the Government prosecutor's statement in the recent shooting episode in Cork.  That was really a most astounding occurrence.  The facts roughly are that a non-commissioned officer confined a private for some breach of duty.  A friend of this man objected <Col N="734" /> to that and roundly stated two days before to several persons that he would get even with the non-commissioned officer.  Then another officer took this man and several others on escort duty and issued them with arms and ball ammunition.  On their return from escort duty they were allowed to stop at two places and have drinks. Finally, when they got back to barracks the most incredible slackness, which extended both to officers and non-commissioned officers, was shown in the manner in which the ball ammunition which had been issued to these men was handled.  It is a cardinal rule in military life that not a single round of live ammunition should ever reach a barrack room, but this rule was broken on this occasion with the greatest casualness and with results that were extremely unfortunate. I quote this case only because I want to lend weight to my argument that such indiscipline as may be in the Army is due more to an inadequate realisation of their responsibilities on the part of officers than to any direct indiscipline on the part of the rank and file.  I think in a country like ours, with our peculiar mentality, it is absolutely essential that an armed force should be kept small and should be trained and disciplined up to the standard of the <i>corps d'elite</i> in other countries and kept up to that standard. Although the standard was maintained at a very high point for many years. it has evidently deteriorated to some little extent for various reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can put the entire blame for these irregularities with any justice on men straight from the bogs who say that they are going to take the stripes off a lance corporal.  They do not realise where they stand because they have not been sufficiently trained. The amount of training they have had in their local units has possibly been of a slip-shod character and they have not had the benefit of example.  Where there is slackness, I think the real blame must fall on the officers, and do not forget that it is the officers who make an army and it is easier to make an army than to maintain it.  Once you have made it and got it up to a standard, <Col N="735" /> it is absolutely essential that it should be pushed further and kept in a high state of discipline, or, like many other things, it will go backward.</P>
    <P>I think that in this country we are rather prone to rise to great heights and then to slack off.  That is a thing we must guard against.  It is understandable that possibly this indiscipline is confined to one or two units, and it is a well-known fact that a bad commanding officer can, in a very short time, destroy the <i>esprit de corps</i> and efficiency of a really good regiment.  I know, of course, from long experience that continuous training becomes irksome and that weariness which comes from continuous training is a particularly difficult problem in our country where, except under extraordinary circumstances, an ordinary private, unlike a soldier in Napoleon's Army, will not find a baton in his gas mask.  For that reason, every care must be taken to maintain the units at the high standard up to which they were built. I think the situation calls for the very closest overhaul of our system and, wherever it is possible, for the elimination of everybody whom our resources do not permit to be trained to the highest standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Having said all this, I should like to finish on another note.  I think the energy displayed in the recovery of the ammunition by the Army was beyond all praise.  It points to the fact that the Army is really absolutely sound and just wants sharpening up in one place or another and a readjustment, as Senator Fitzgerald suggested, of the provisions in regard to infiltration together with a reduction of the surplus personnel whom we cannot possibly want.  Furthermore, the Magazine Fort incident draws attention to another point, and it is that the quick and almost complete recovery of that ammunition shows that the people in the country are certainly not behind any persons desiring to overthrow the present Government of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intrude on this debate, but it is very hard to listen to the arguments of <Col N="736" /> Senator Fitzgerald and the way in which he gives expression to them. He proceeds chiefly on the line of slashing the Government because some ammunition was stolen, and he says that Ministers are solely responsible. Then, when action is taken and certain officers are removed for negligence, or for whatever reason, following the disappearance of that ammunition, Senator Fitzgerald and others of his type of mentality immediately rush forward to condemn the Government for their action.  That general principle is brought into every sphere by the Opposition Party&mdash;running with the hare and hunting with the hounds continually. That is the worst form of policy and the worst form of debate. There is neither sincerity nor merit in it, and, with all our experience now of Parliamentary usage and procedure, it is nearly time we got down to some basis of merit in the arguments people have to listen to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing, anyhow, which can be said in favour of the Army&mdash; and I do not hold any love, personally, for the Army&mdash;and it is that in the space of a couple of weeks they recovered practically all the ammunition taken.  If they were so incompetent and if there was such negligence or lack of supervision by the Minister concerned, this result could not have been secured and if there were not whole-hearted co-operation and control by the officers concerned, they would not get such results.  Let us at least look on the bright side of the situation.  The results were good.  A <i>coup</i> can always occur once and such a <i>coup</i> can do an army or a country good.  Things were jogging along very peacefully in this country since this Government came into power&mdash;there has never been such peace in the history of Ireland as there has been since this Government came in&mdash;and we were becoming settled and complacent about everything in life, and it is only natural and human to think that a few of the wiseacres could bring off a <i>coup</i> in such circumstances.  After all, it is not so serious as to warrant our talking so much about it and advertising it to such an extent that we became <Col N="737" /> the laughing-stock of every country in the world because of a little incident of that sort.  It is a very poor form of patriotism to make us such a laughing-stock for such a small incident.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald made a great point about the resignation of a Minister. This House has already been told by the Taoiseach that he can have a Minister's resignation at any time he wants it.  Surely to goodness, once is enough to be told that, instead of this business of constantly bringing up such matters.  It is the prerogative of the Taoiseach to demand the resignation of a Minister whenever he should think fit to do so, and surely the Taoiseach has more brains and is in a better position to decide whether that prerogative should be used than Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to say this much also in favour of the Army, and this is a matter which I think the Minister should take a note of and convey it to the Minister for Justice.  During all the round-up of civilians and others that occurred since the ammunition was taken&mdash;and there was considerable annoyance, if you like, caused to the public at large, although the public took it very well and facilitated the people concerned in the recovery of the ammunition in every way they could-it is a well-known fact that the public were facilitated and treated with very much more courtesy by the Army, both the rank and file of the Army and its officers, than by the Guards.  Now, it must be remembered that the Guards are very much nearer to the public, and I think it should be only natural to expect that they would be more courteous to the members of the public than the Army, since the essence of the Civic Guards is courtesy; but I am sorry to say that I have heard it stated on more than one occasion, and indeed I have experienced it myself, that very much more courtesy is extended by the rank and file and officers of the Army than by the rank and file and officers of the Civic Guards.  Well, perhaps I should not say the officers of the Civic Guards, but I certainly say it is true of the rank and file, and I think that the Minister should have it <Col N="738" /> conveyed to the Minister for Justice that it would seem that some of these people are beginning to forget their manners.  After all, courtesy costs nothing, and I think it would be much better to have courtesy, even when crises do arise.  However, I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>There was another point of Senator Fitzgerald's which, if we were to follow his argument to its logical conclusion, would mean that either we should have no Army here at all or one that would cost something like £1,270,000, which is something like the Army he had when he was Minister.  However, when the Senator was Minister for Defence, I am sure that if he were asked for some minute detail connected with his Department, he could not have given it without referring to some civil servant.  As we all know, he was much more interested at that time in garden parties and top hats than in doing any genuine work.</P>

      <P>Well, I am always listening to Senators here talking through their hats.  I may be talking through my own hat now, but the fact remains that that was the position. Now, in connection with this country, there seems to be a complex in the minds of many people here which causes them to be always going around telling us that we are not able to afford to pay for this or that, that we cannot afford an Army and so on.  I think that this country can easily afford an Army of a standard sufficient to enable it to defend, at least, the honour and prestige of what has been known for many hundreds of years as the fighting Irish race&mdash;the race that fought under many a flag and on many a foreign field, but that at least never turned their backs when there was fighting to be done.  If there is anything that this country should stand for, I say that it is in making the necessary preparations for the defence of our national prestige and our national honour and national pride.  It is possible that we might be wiped out but, at least, in God's name, let not that be done without making a fight for it.</P>

      <P>You never know.  I would not trust any of the big fellows. I would not trust any of the big Powers to-day.  They are all aggressors so far as we are concerned. I am satisfied, however, and I am sure that the people of this country are quite satisfied, that an Army should be maintained here, regardless of the material-minded people who are constantly going up and down the country and saying every day of the week that we cannot afford these things.  I think we can be very proud of the Army, and I am satisfied that the Army will justify itself and maintain the honour and prestige of the fighting Irish race in defence of their own nation.  I am satisfied that the expenditure incurred by the Government under existing circumstances was well advised in order to maintain it, and to stand or fall by it.  If the people do not want it, that is their own fault.  The people will get the Government that they want, and if they want a type of Government that is without a sense of national pride in anything and that is willing to depend on volunteer effort for everything in which we take pride, then the people can get such a Government, but it will not last, and I hope that the Government will show a strong trend towards all matters of national defence in order to see that our people and the homes of our people are rendered more secure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it can only do harm to attempt at this date to minimise the importance of the raid on the Phoenix Park arsenal.  It seems to me to be absurd for Senator McEllin to pretend that it is merely partisanship for Senators of the Opposition to talk of that matter as if it were something serious.  Nobody could have treated the matter more seriously than the Taoiseach himself treated it in this House when he said that it had made such an impression on him that, if the people were to ask <Col N="740" /> the Government for their resignation as a penalty for what had happened, he could not blame the people.  Now, I do not think we ought to go on harping on the Phoenix Park raid, but it can only incite people to go on harping on it if Senators rise up here and try to treat it as a trifle.  It was not a trifle.  It was a very unfortunate occurrence, but I fully coincide in what Senator The McGillycuddy said, and what Senator McEllin also said, about the efficiency which the Army showed in the recovery of the armaments that had been stolen.  In fact, I think I must say that everything Senator The McGillycuddy said was well worthy of the attention of the Minister for Defence, and particularly the Senator's remarks on the matter of discipline in connection with what took place recently in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer.  I differ absolutely from Senator Fitzgerald when he says, in effect, that we ought not to have an army except for internal police purposes.  I think we owe it to ourselves and to the world, as well as to the cause of freedom, that we should have a genuine, efficient and highly-trained army that would be prepared, in case of need, to fight for our freedom.  In fact, I would go further than that.  There was a meeting, recently reported in the papers, of a new organisation, which calls itself a &ldquo;Movement&rdquo;, not a Party, and which has undertaken to propagate a republican ideology.  I read the programme, if programme it could be called, with interest, and there was little of it indeed with which I could agree, but there was one item which, naturally enough, was selected by the <i>Irish Press</i> and featured by them as probably the most unpopular item in that programme; namely, conscription.  Well, to me that was the one item with which I have some sympathy.  I believe that democracy implies the duty of every individual citizen, in case of need, to come to the defence of his country, and I should like to see behind our small and highly-trained regular Army, not a mere force of volunteers, of a fluctuating and indeterminate number, but the whole manhood of the nation trained <Col N="741" /> in military service and ready to be called upon in case of need.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that if any invader found his way here&mdash;I presume that leaves out the British, but if any invader, such as, let us say, the Germans, should find their way here&mdash; it would be all up with us and there would be no use in putting up a fight because the arrival of such an invader would mean that the British Navy had been crushed.  That is not necessarily so.  During the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the British Navy was mistress of the seas, as it is to-day; yet French expeditions found their way here&mdash;not big ones, it is true.  A small German expedition might quite conceivably find its way here, either by sea or air, or perhaps troops might be dropped by parachute, perhaps they would be brought in several vessels and we might find ourselves with a force of a few thousand Germans landed in this country.  If so, I certainly think we ought to be in a position to deal with that situation.  I am very glad that we have an Army to deal with it&mdash;an Army that, I am sure, would carry out the orders of the Government and fight for our freedom against any aggressor who might put his foot in this country.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rádh, agus níl mórán agam. Senator Fitzgerald seems to have based his whole argument regarding disimprovement of the Army on the incident in the Phoenix Park on the 23rd December last.  That seems to have been exaggerated very much.  We all realise that, where a secret organisation exists, a <i>coup</i> can be carried out and that the time selected was a very favourable time, being the night before Christmas Eve.  We can understand that an incident like that could occur. If what I am saying is not proof enough we certainly have it in the recent raid which was carried out in Ballykinlar, though we do not hear any argument put forth that the British Army discipline has been disimproved in any way as a result of that raid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things will occur and, unfortunately, they do occur; but when they <Col N="742" /> do occur one can only see that precautions are taken to prevent their occurring again.  I was interested in the argument we hear now and again from the little Imperialists as regards the present position of Germany and England. I do not wish to say anything here which would be looked upon as in any way abusing our neutrality here, as has been decided on by our Government. We hear this talk about the possibility of a German invasion in one form or another.  I have some little knowledge of Irish history and I look back to see whether the German nation ever injured this nation, and I find that German scholars&mdash;Zeuss and Kuno Meyer, for example&mdash;came here and studied our language when British Imperialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is an answer to the little Imperialists.  I am sorry that I have been forced to stress this, but I could not sit here patiently and listen to speeches made at Seanad meeting after Seanad meeting without making some answer.  In view of the attitude the Chair is taking up, I do not intend to proceed further than to say that the incident in the Phoenix Park should not be exaggerated, seeing that a similar <i>coup</i> was carried off at Ballykinlar in the face of the great British Army without a disimprovement in their discipline.</P>

What I do say is that it would be quite wrong to minimise the importance of the raid&mdash;it was certainly an important matter&mdash;but it would be just as wrong to exaggerate its importance.  If members of this House and of the other House have erred at all, they seem to have erred from the point of view of an exaggeration of the importance of the raid.</P>

      <P>Senator MacDermot says: &ldquo;Especially the Taoiseach.&rdquo;  In his speech, the Taoiseach, in my opinion, dealt very thoroughly with the matter, and if other people would take the line he took, things would be very different, and would not have turned out as they did in the debate which followed.  We should not try to minimise the importance of the raid&mdash;it was one of the most serious things which have happened in this country for a considerable number of years&mdash;but the majority of those who have spoken against this Bill, in this House and in the other House, set out to gain political kudos from the Magazine Fort raid.  The attitude of any sincere member of the Oireachtas should be to do what he can to prevent that raid from having serious effects on the Army or on the country.</P>
      <P>I am not including Senator The McGillycuddy in that connection at all. His statement was a fair statement and, though he may have made a couple of remarks with which I do not agree, his speech was, generally speaking, made with the very best of intentions. When he says that certain things might have been done because of our peculiar mentality, I fail to see what he is aiming at; I do not agree that we have any peculiar mentality, any more than people of any other country. When it comes to the point as to whether we believe there is serious danger that our country may be attacked or that our neutrality may be broken, it is the business of the Government of the country to take the necessary precautions to secure that such things will not happen.  Senator Fitzgerald said that an invasion was almost impossible.  That may be so: I hope it is so; but anything can happen, as we all know, if this war continues. I am not going to point out where an invasion may occur, or where it might come from, but it would be up to us to take the necessary steps to repel that invasion, and if the Government did not take those steps I would deem them lacking in fulfilling their duty. With regard to the attitude of the politicians in regard to this raid&mdash; naturally, it is the politicians on the Opposition that I am referring to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would say that they have gone out of their way to do damage, perhaps not intentionally to do damage to the country, but in the hope that they may get a little political kudos for their own Party out of this misfortune.  I make no secret of terming it a misfortune.  Since the Magazine Fort raid, on every available opportunity, we have had speakers representing Fine Gael in this and in the other House suggesting that it was a desperate thing that the Minister for Defence and, I believe, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures did not resign immediately. We are quite accustomed to having lectures here as to what has been done in other countries.  While I say that we are not concerned so much with what has happened in other countries or what the people do in other countries, but are concerned with our own business, I do not mind referring those people to what happened in England when the Royal Oak was sunk.  That-was a far more serious matter for the British Government and for the British people than the raid on the Magazine Fort was for the Irish Government or the people of this country.  We did not have anybody standing up in the British Houses of Parliament demanding that the Ministers should resign at that time, so far as I know at any rate, and if they did stand up, the Ministers did not resign.  While the inquiry went on in connection with the sinking of the Royal Oak, I think I am right in saying that the same Minister who was responsible for the administration of that Department at that time was still in office.  But, because it happens here in this country and because certain people may think they will get a little political kudos from the fact, they have no hesitation at all in making statements which can have no other effect than to create unrest in the country and in the Army.</P>

If Senator Hayes says so, I must only take it as correct.  In any case, I think, as other speakers have said, that the fact that the ammunition was recovered in the very short time in which it was recovered is a sufficient answer to those who would suggest that the Army is completely demoralised and that there is lack of discipline, lack of control and lack of everything else.  I would like to join with the others in saying that for a long time nothing has, made such an impression on me as the attitude of those members of the regular Army and the Volunteer force in connection with the round-up following the raid on the Magazine Fort.  I was probably held up as many times as anybody else and had my car. searched and I must say that the courtesy with which that procedure was carried out was really an example to the rest of the country and a proof, if such proof were necessary, that the accident in connection with the Magazine Fort was not to be taken as an example of the condition of affairs in the Army as a whole.</P>

I made the mistake of going out the very first day to make a series of calls.  I was stopped nine times, not knowing any search was going on.  I agree about the courtesy with which it was carried out by the regular Army and Volunteers, but there is another conclusion of the Deputy's with which I do not agree.</P>

      <P>It is a great thing that Senator Hayes and myself can agree on something, and if Senator Hayes had been here he would know that practically every speaker expressed the same ideas and that I merely wanted to include myself with the majority of those who have already spoken.  With regard to the expenditure of the money on the Army, we have, naturally, all kinds of experts, not in the Army at all, but here in this House and in the Dáil, telling us that the money should not be spent.  Before it was proposed to spend the money we had the very same people getting up and criticising the Government and criticising the Minister for Defence because he was not taking and had not taken the neccessary measures to protect this country in case of war.  Surely we cannot have it both ways.  I think myself that if anybody is in a position to decide what amount of money is necessary to put us in the desirable position of being capable of defending ourselves, it would be the Minister for Defence and the Army experts, or headquarters staff of the Army.  It is scarcely necessary to go into this matter as to whether we should or should not defend ourselves. I am all for defending ourselves. I believe we would be the first generation of Irishmen for very many centuries who took any other line, and I believe that as long as this country remains anything at all like what it is or has been in the past it will never find itself without at least an overwhelming majority of the people of this country being in favour of defending the country in the event of its being attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to how the country would be defended in the case of attack is another matter altogether, and while Senator Hayes may think that I would be 100 per cent. in agreement with everything the Minister for Defence or the Government would suggest, I would like to say now that there is one point on which I do not agree.  There is one item&mdash;expenditure on mechanised transport in the Army&mdash;which I believe is a matter which really deserves very serious consideration.  I cannot see that it is wise to go whole-hog into mechanised transport, for the <Col N="748" /> simple reason that in whatever else we should have self-sufficiency practised, it should be practised in the Army. Of course, while I am driving a motor myself, I cannot say that everybody should be driving horses, but while I do agree that it is necessary and desirable to have a certain number of motor vehicles and a certain amount of motor transport, I think it is a very shortsighted policy to go whole-hog into mechanised transport in the Army in a country like this.  We have practically an unlimited supply of horses here.  Quite obviously, our intention would be to do any fighting we may have to do in our own country, and if we were to go whole-hog into mechanised transport, it is quite possible that we would find ourselves in the position of being unable to supply the replacements for those mechanised outfits in the event of the war continuing for a considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inclusion of Volunteers in the Army, we have had that coming up over a number of years. The controversy started at the time the Volunteer force was formed.  People immediately started to raise objections to bringing into the Army men whom it was proposed to put in charge of Volunteer units and who had not previous training in the Army.</P>
    <P>Now, in my opinion, that was one of the wisest moves made by this or any other Government.  We all know the situation which existed here before that time when the Volunteer force was formed.  We all know that when the force was formed that men were brought in who held rank in the I.R.A. before and during the civil war.  I happened to be among those present at the commissioning ceremony at Portobello Barracks, and it made an everlasting impression on me, and if the other people who are speaking against the policy of the Government were there at the ceremony, they would agree that it was one of the best things that was done.  At that ceremony I met people I had not seen for 20 years, and I am satisfied, as a result of my connection with them, that they went into the Army as soldiers and were accepted as such by the officers and men of the Army that fought against them during the civil war.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised that some of the Senators took Senator Fitzgerald's remarks as seriously as they appeared to have done.  I did not take the Senator's remarks in the same serious strain as Senator McEllin or Senator Healy or even Senator Quirke. I wonder if the Senator's colleagues can see the danger signal that is straight in the path of Senator Fitzgerald. He appears to be advancing, slowly but surely, along the path down to the sere and yellow stage.  He is talking about the good old times when he was in charge of the Army, those halcyon days when everything was ideal.  According to him, it was a Utopia that existed then and that has never existed since.  That was the strain of Senator Fitzgerald's remarks. I had occasion in the Dáil to refer to the remarks of Deputy Dillon as being ill-informed.  His speech was well informed by comparison with the remarks I have heard from Senator Fitzgerald.  Senator Fitzgerald does not seem to realise that the conditions that existed in respect of Volunteers at the period at which he was speaking no longer exist, and have not existed for several months.  A Volunteer in the early days had the right to resign, if he so desired, on giving notice to the authorities for seven days.  We found certain weaknesses in the operation of that regulation.  We found that men came along after they had received specialised training and handed in their resignation, and, according to the regulations, they were able to go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of expenditure had been incurred in the training of these individuals, and it was felt that the system was wrong.  That regulation was revoked and does not exist any longer.  A Volunteer now joins the Army for a period of five years, and if he desires to leave the Volunteer movement, there are certain ways in which he can do it.  He can purchase himself out in the same manner as a regular soldier can purchase himself out, or he can be dismissed the forces for some indiscretion, or he could be released on compassionate grounds, but these are the only grounds on which a Volunteer can leave the Army, and a Volunteer to-day is as much a <Col N="750" /> regular soldier, except for the fact that he has to do only three months continuous training, as is the regular soldier himself.</P>
    <P>The question of the infiltration to which some other Senators seem to take exception, is one which has not been practised so largely as the Senators appear to think.  It has certainly taken place.  It did, in fact, occur in the garrison that was occupying the Magazine Fort on the night of the raid.  That was a mixed garrison of Volunteers and regular soldiers, but I visited several camps and I found the camps to be composed solely of Volunteers.  It is true that in the commands, brigades and so on, there are companies of Volunteers, but they are wholly Volunteers.  There are battalions of Volunteers, and they, too, are completely Volunteers, but I do not think that there is a case of a regular company being mixed up and blended together with Volunteers.</P>
    <P>There have been many derogatory statements made in respect of the Volunteers and the Volunteer movement, and I say that they are most unfair to the Volunteer movement itself, which is a movement which this nation might very easily have to depend on for its protection, and it is a movement we should be proud of, if we ever have to rely on it.  It may be one we will be proud of.  I could cite many incidents which have been brought to my notice by the executive officers of the Army of acts carried out by the Volunteers, and I will cite two of them that seem to me to be worthy of citation.  One is in connection with the raid itself on the Magazine Fort.  I wonder if the Senators are aware of the fact that it was a young Volunteer officer, accompanied by a section of Volunteers, who, on very flimsy information, rushed his party from Portobello Barracks to the Magazine Fort and who, very quickly and with tremendous initiative, sized up the situation, captured certain people he saw in the Phoenix Park, went to the Magazine Fort, realised it had been raided, and immediately garrisoned it with his little force and, at the same time, informed the people in Island-bridge that the Magazine Fort had <Col N="751" /> been raised and robbed.  I think that young man showed initiative that was worthy of the most experienced officer of the regular Army, and I think he deserves great credit.</P>

      <P>No, he is a lieutenant. He has not been promoted, but he has certainly been commended.  The other incident which I might cite is in connection with an ordinary Volunteer doing coast watching duty down on a very desolate portion of the south coast.  He was on duty by himself and he saw what he believed to be a boat out at a great distance to sea.  He got a glass and fixed it on the boat and decided on his own that it was a boat with shipwrecked sailors.  He could only see one individual rowing.  He immediately went to a nearby house, telephoned to the Gárdaí and then telephone to the command headquarters in Cork City.  Again using his own initiative, he asked the people in Cork City to send an ambulance as he believed this boat contained shipwrecked sailors.  Command headquarters accepted the message and sent an ambulance to the scene and this young Volunteer, by the aid of semaphore signalling, brought the boat into the only possible place it could have landed on that desolate coast.  The sailors themselves who had come in the boat from the wrecked vessel tried to induce this young man to take whatever small amount of money they had on them as a mark of their esteem and appreciation for his initiative and extraordinary action.  These are two simple cases of what Volunteers have done.  They are two cases of many others, not so outstanding perhaps, that have been brought to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I would desire to put to Senators here&mdash;and I should like it to go further, to Deputies in the Lower House and to the general public&mdash;is that these Volunteers are our own people.  They are our own flesh and blood.  They have our own weaknesses, no doubt, but they have our own good qualities also.  Whatever we may do <Col N="752" /> to encourage them, we should be very careful before we commit ourselves to saying the derogatory things that have been said since this unfortunate incident occurred in December last.  I think every crime that could be laid against the Volunteer movement has been made against it since that unfortunate incident.  I think the sooner that stops the better.  There has, in fact, been too much propagandist use made of that unfortunate incident.  It is true it was a serious incident.  Every person of responsibility regards it as a serious incident.  It is a very sad thing to think that at this period in the life of the nation, these men should be surprised, that there should be a body of individuals in this country prepared to surprise them and prepared to do the things that were done on that night. That is the most regrettable feature of the whole affair.  I have no doubt that these men, realising that they were near a season of peace and goodwill, were taking things more easily perhaps than they might take them at another period and the people who set out to raid the Magazine, fortified by the belief that that would be so, used that opportunity to surprise them and to steal ammunition. Senator Fitzgerald would appear to think that these things never happened in his time.  They did happen in his time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be in a position to do that just now.  If we make allowance for the little bit of propaganda value which this raid has provided, I do not think that Senators in general, nor even Deputies or the public in general, believe that the Army is in any less efficient state now than it ever was.  The fact is that the executive officers of the Army to-day are the same men who were the executive officers of the Army in Senator Fitzgerald's time.  Senator Fitzgerald, I do not think, had any more dictatorial power than I have, and he could not do anything more than I do.  It is my desire to see the Army as efficient as possible.  Perhaps if I were to push my ideas of efficiency as far as I would like, I might burst it instead of achieving the results which I set out to achieve.  There is, however, a happy medium and I think the efficiency of the Army is just as high to day as it ever has been.  There is no doubt that here and there there may be weaknesses. We are going after these and, wherever they are found, they are being corrected.  Wherever it is necessary to make changes, where individuals have been too long in the same positions we deem it good judgment to remove them and to put them into other positions. We are doing these things in the belief that if there is any laxity, such action will settle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army, as everybody here knows, has not the same continuous flow of new blood as an army like the British army, the German army or the armies of other great countries have.  When we get in recruits, they remain in the Army for a very long time.  If they are officers, they serve for anything up to 20 years.  Chances and openings do not occur as regularly as they would in other greater armies.  The men themselves remain in the Army for <Col N="754" /> five, ten or 20 years as the case may be.  There again the same state of stagnation, if you like to call it such, exists.  That is an unfortunate fact which cannot be got over unless we reduce the periods of service and keep changing the officers.  You cannot do that with men who take up soldiering as a profession.  You have to offer them something that is at least semipermanent. That is the position that exists to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need say anything further, except that the permanent Bill, which would obviate the bringing in of this continuing Bill, has been practically completed.  It consists of, I think, 310 sections.  It is a gigantic voluminous document.  It is my belief that it would be advisable not to bring that permanent Bill before the Dáil in this present emergency, because I feel confident that, as a result of this emergency, the Defence Forces Regulations would still have to be changed.  I am satisfied that arising out of the present emergency there will be need for very many more changes.  Because of that I decided that the Defence Forces Regulations Bill, which is at present in the office of the Department of Defence, should not be brought forward. In the near future, I shall be bringing forward a temporary Bill which will give me the necessary powers in regard to the coast-watching service and a few necessary regulations in regard to the Volunteers.  I shall have that before the House in the very near future and, no doubt, there will be another opportunity afforded then for debating the whole question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome a statement of policy by the Government regarding the Irish currency and its connection with sterling.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad is well aware, the Irish pound is interchangeable with the pound sterling, and our currency is backed by a mixture of gold and British securities.  It must have occurred to many people since the war started to wonder what would happen to this country if the war went badly for Great Britain, and if anything developed in the course of time in Great Britain at all resembling the appalling inflation in Germany after the last war.  I am very conscious of the advantages of keeping an exact parity with sterling, and I am also conscious of the economy of backing our currency to as large an extent as possible by interest-bearing securities rather than by gold, but, under present circumstances, one is tempted to wonder whether we ought not to go further than we have so far gone in reducing the amount of the sterling securities backing our currency, and either increasing the quantity of gold held or acquiring dollar securities.  One is also tempted to wonder whether it is possible at all for the Government to plan in advance some means of extricating ourselves and our currency in case of emergency, an emergency that I hope will never arise, from the sort of collapse to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be looking very far ahead, for I am afraid this war will go on for a long time.  I do not imagine that, actually during the war, anything fantastic is likely to happen to the British currency; but if, by misfortune, Britain were to suffer defeat, the question is whether to any extent at all we could get out from under, and whether there are any steps we can take now to make our position somewhat more secure. The arguments, it seems to me, are all against any hasty departure from sterling.  We have, even in this war situation, the experience of Denmark, our principal competitor in the British market, to guide us.  The Danes left the sterling group at the beginning of <Col N="756" /> the war, and I do not say they could help doing so, but the results have been disastrous.  None of the Scandinavian countries, and, in fact, none of the neutrals, has suffered as much economically from the present war as the Danes.</P>
    <P>Their currency was allowed to appreciate only 10 per cent. above what it had been in relation to the pound, but, even so, the phenomena that have accompanied that change have been extremely discouraging to anybody who might be tempted to do likewise. Their bank rate, instead of being 3½ per cent., is now 5½ per cent.  Owing to shipping difficulties, imports have not been made less expensive to the Danes as might be expected to happen on account of the currency appreciating. Their import prices have actually gone up by 45 per cent. between August and September.  Their export prices, on the other hand, have risen only by 15 per cent. and the prices of all Danish securities have depreciated to a catastrophic extent.  That is certainly a warning to us that even the very unusual circumstances of the war should not hurry us into any departure from sterling.</P>
    <P>The main object of this motion was not really to make these remarks about the war situation, which could have been made in private, but to try to bring the Government face to face with the very active campaign in various quarters to popularise certain monetary conceptions which involve the overthrow of the present arrangements with regard to the Irish pound and sterling.  What I want to do is not to deliver an economic lecture to the Seanad, a task for which I am not qualified, but to induce the Government to take proper note of what is going on.  I am afraid that if all this propaganda is left unchecked and unanswered, a time will come when it will be impossible to settle the questions involved simply on grounds of reason and logic, that so much feeling, so much prejudice, will have been imported into the situation that it would be psychologically impossible to resist the demand for revolutionary changes in our system.  This agitation is supported by the Labour Party, by <Col N="757" /> various university professors, the most conspicuous of whom, I think, is Professor O'Rahilly, by the new movement started a few days ago in the Mansion House, which has distinguished itself by bringing together such men as Mr. Con Lehane and General O'Duffy, and by a very widely-circulated influential religious newspaper called <i>The standard.</i></P>
    <P>While I do not feel myself qualified to deliver a technical economic lecture to the Seanad&mdash;a task that, indeed, I think ought to be unnecessary for anybody to do in view of the immense amount of material that is accessible to every Senator in the report of the Banking Commission&mdash;I do feel myself capable of dealing with the arguments that are being used in the course of this popular campaign of which I have been talking, arguments that are unsound and mischievous and far more directed to the emotions than to the head.  I might as an instance, refer to a speech that was made ten days ago by the Lord Mayor of Cork to the Galway branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The characteristic of youth is that it should see visions of what should be.  The old dream dreams of what has been.  They are tempted to accept things as they are.  We must be rebels&mdash;rebels against the worldly interpretation of life which conflicts so openly to-day with the law of God. We must rebel against the humbug and pretence of the world of money and credit.  I am not now referring to those who are doing imprisonment for their gambling on the stock exchange.  I am referring to those who are held in honour, the men of big business and big bankers.  Many of them are good men, but they are blind&mdash;blind to the present and to the future.  They are in possession of everything, and tell you that economic laws are so binding that they cannot help if you have nothing. These men have been warned by Pope Pius XI in his Encyclical.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so forth, at great length.  Now, Professor O'Rahilly, like the Lord Mayor of Cork, when discussing this <Col N="758" /> matter, makes constant references to Papal Encyclicals, and so does <i>The Standard</i>, and the implication in all these speeches and articles is that they are preaching the cause of the Church and the doctrine that the Church has enunciated, to which cold and worldly men, either because they are bad at heart&mdash;perhaps, even Freemasons&mdash;or because they are just plain stupid, are shutting their eyes.  I think that the first great truth that ought to be accepted by everybody in connection with this subject, is that the division of opinion is not between those who are indifferent to poverty, unemployment and suffering and those who want to cure them.  We all want to cure these evils.  I think that none of us is indifferent to them, but the conflict is as to the best way of reducing their proportions, and the assumption of a superior moral status by those who are advocating expedients which I believe to be unsound, fills me, I must say, with indignation and even with disgust.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in connection with this &ldquo;hot-gospelling,&rdquo; quasi-religious handling of an economic question that ought to be borne in mind by any man of common sense.  First of all, it must be remembered that poverty and unemployment are not new; that they are not the invention of the present day or even a result of the 19th Century industrial movement or of the form of capitalism that developed as a result of that industrial movement.  Secondly, the ideas of social justice that are embodied in Papal Encyclicals are not just recent discoveries of the Church.  The Church, during all the years of its existence, has had the same fundamental principles in regard to social justice that it has to-day, and the Papal Encyclicals merely sought to set forth those principles in a manner that was applicable to the particular disorders of our present time.  The principles themselves are not new, any more than poverty and suffering are new, and if it merely required a good heart and the acceptance of the Catholic Faith and of Catholic sociological views in order to wipe out poverty and unemployment from the world, then those things would have been wiped out a very long <Col N="759" /> time ago.  There was a time when the Popes themselves were the rulers of temporal dominions.  In certain cases the Papal States were often unjustly abused, and naturally enough, by the enemies of the Papacy, but this much at any rate anyone with a knowledge of history must realise&mdash;that even in the Papal States poverty and unemployment and the hardships of life were not abolished.  That was because these things were very difficult to abolish, and not because the Popes were blind to the principles of social justice then any more than they are to-day.</P>
    <P>When you take the Papal Encyclicals and extract a number of passages from them, as <i>The Standard</i> or, let us say, Professor O'Rahilly does, and say that if these ideals have not been attained, your present financial system must be all wrong, I believe that that is faulty reasoning.  These are aims set forth for us to struggle towards, but it does not follow that, because we have not attained these aims, we should plunge into wild and dangerous experiments, even though some people have convinced themselves and would endeavour to convince you that the adoption of these ideas would have miraculous effects.  The question is whether they would have better or worse effects than the economic policies that obtain at present.  If one is to proceed by the method of quoting extracts from Papal Encyclicals, divorced from their context, and unbalanced by other quotations, one arrives at absurd results.  Here for example, is an extract from a famous Encyclical, <i>Rerum Novarum:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To suffer and to endure, therefore, is the lot of humanity; let them strive as they may, no strength and no artifice will ever succeed in banishing from human life the ills and troubles which beset it.  If any there are who pretend differently...</P>
    <P>I omit some words here;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...they delude the people and impose upon them, and their lying promises will only one day bring evils worse than the present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, if one were to pick out a sentence like that and nothing else, it <Col N="760" /> would perhaps discourage anyone from making any attempt to improve things. I am far from wishing to discourage any such attempt, but I do say that the quoting of selected passages can be very misleading.</P>
    <P>After all, mankind in all its efforts for social betterment is necessarily limited by physical conditions.  If you took, shall we say, Professor O'Rahilly, and handed him 100,000 unemployed and sent him off on an expedition to the Aran Islands; if you gave him possession of the Aran Islands and told him to get on with the work on the basis of his economic ideas, fortified by the Papal Encyclicals and the assurance they gave him that economic conditions might be made ideal by their proper application, he would necessarily fail.  There is a limit to the resources of any country, and it is absurd to argue&mdash;as these people constantly do&mdash; as if there were no limit at all to what can be attained provided you are prepared to stimulate the people living in the country with immense doses of Government credit. The doses of Government credit may be absolutely monumental, yet they will be of no use if the national resources are not there.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in an appendix to the Majority Report of the Banking Commission by the Bishop of Raphoe and Mr. George O'Brien that humility is needed in approaching the interpretation and application of the Papal Encyclicals, and that it is undesirable that individuals, however learned, should take upon themselves to dogmatise confidently about them and abuse other people for not taking the same view as they take.  The Bishop of Raphoe and Mr. George O'Brien pointed out that, if anyone were asked to name the country in Europe which had founded its whole policy for years past most consciously, consistently and loyally on the Papal Encyclicals, one would probably name Portugal; and the financial policy of Portugal, which, incidentally has proved very successful, has been ultra-conservative.</P>
    <P>Far from increasing their public debt, they proceeded on the basis of reducing it; they have been paying all the expenses of the State out of revenue <Col N="761" /> and balancing their Budget.  Surely, that is a very obvious warning to people who interpret the Encyclicals as imposing upon us the duty of doing something revolutionary.  So much for what I may call the quasi-religious side of the propaganda being pressed upon the people, and especially upon the young people, of the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is another side, one which I find less objectionable and more natural, but not any wiser.  It is what I may call the nationalist side.  It is alleged to be beneath our national dignity to have our currency connected with any foreign currency.  The new movement of which I have spoken has announced that what we have got to do is to get back to Gaelic economics. What are Gaelic economics, especially in relation to currency?  I looked up the question and found that the unit of value in Gaelic times was the cow, and when it was not the cow it was the female slave.  That does not seem to help us to find the solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the unit not still the cow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no female slaves and should find the cow inconvenient as a form of currency, whatever merits it may have in other respects.  What is the Gaelic economy we have to get back to?  From my reading of the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Lough Cé, I would say that the last thing Gaelic economics provided was economic security.  One could not say it was easy in Gaelic times to be sure of the morrow, or to be sure of a just compensation for one's labour.  In fact, it pains me to say&mdash;as one deriving from a Gaelic clan&mdash;that the prominent men of the country, even before the British came and corrupted us, seem to have borne a marked resemblance to the modern Chicago gangster or racketeer.  I should be sorry to go back to the system of economics in which, from one day to another, Gaelic bands were making raids on each other's territory and carrying off either cows or female slaves.  The economics of some other countries in those days were <Col N="762" /> no better.  The barons in England behaved in much the same way as the Gaelic chiefs in Ireland.  I do not think that there is much sense in the sort of nationalism that wishes to cast aside every economic development that has taken place since the days when the Norman-Welsh first set foot in this country, and go back to the Gaelic scheme of things in the domain of economics.</P>
      <P>Apart from Gaelicism, there is, of course, a nationalist argument.  It does seem at first sight, to anybody who has not thought very much about finance or had much experience of international trade, that there is a limitation upon one's freedom when one is not able to do exactly what one likes with one's own currency.  But if one wants to have any international trade, one obviously cannot do so, because people will not trade with you unless you have some standard of value as acceptable to them as to you. Look at Japan: Japan has no great liking for the United States, and still less any great liking for England, yet until quite lately the Japanese tied the yen to sterling.  Now they have tied it to the dollar.  The Japanese are an intensely patriotic and nationalist people, but they are practical enough to see that, if international trade is to go on&mdash;and they wish it to go on&mdash;it is desirable to have their currency yoked up to one of the great groups of the trading world.  If we were, for any reason, to divorce ourselves from sterling, we would have to yoke ourselves to something else, presumably to the dollar.  As we can never hope to have the trade with the United States that we have with our neighbours in Great Britain, it seems more natural, more sensible and practical, to yoke our currency to sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people from nationalist or other motives express the desire&mdash;as the Labour Party do in their official programme, &ldquo;planning for the crisis&rdquo;&mdash; to see the abandonment of a fixed rate of exchange with any foreign currency, one feels inclined to ask them what it is they wish to do with our currency when they get it free.  Do they wish to make the Irish pound more valuable or less valuable?  If it is to be less <Col N="763" /> valuable, how are we going to compete with the appalling increase there will be in the cost of our imports and the consequent rise in the cost of living, which is already far too high for the liking of most of us?  If, on the other hand, the Irish pound is made more valuable than the English, what is going to happen to our farmers?  How is it going to continue to be profitable for them to produce for the British market if they are going to be paid in pounds that are worth substantially less than the pounds they have to pay out here for living, for their raw materials, for keeping their farms going?  Those who clamour for that sort of freedom do not as yet condescend to make clear what it is they really want to do with it.  I gather that on the whole they wish to depreciate the Irish pound because they link up these proposals for changing our currency arrangements with other proposals for immense issues of credit by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go at all deeply into the probable effects of large issues of credit by the State, but this much can be said: Nobody can deny that credit is at present readily available from the banks for any purpose that is likely to show a profit.  Anybody of repute who has a business to finance can get credit as readily as in any other country.  He can get it more cheaply, and always has been able to get it more cheaply, here than in most countries in the world.  So far from any connections we have had with British finance and the Bank of England having tended to make credit more expensive, it has had precisely the opposite effect.  For a small country, our credit is marvellously cheap.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that the bankers here have performed their two main functions with very great success.  They have kept the savings of the people secure, and, Heaven knows, that is more important to the small man than to anybody.  It is important to the man who makes his little nest egg from a life of hard toil, that the bank should be able to pay him that money any time he wants it.  There has been <Col N="764" /> no bank failure in this country for, I think, 50 years.  They have had an extraordinarily fine record in giving security to the people in the care of their savings.  The second thing to be said of the banks here is that nobody can justly charge them, or even plausibly charge them, with failing to give credit to those who deserve it.  The sort of credit that the Labour Party and others want the State to create is not credit that is to enable an immediately profitable business to be carried on.  It is credit that may have results of a productive kind only in the fairly distant future.  In regard to afforestation, drainage and so forth, it is very doubtful, if these large sums were expended forthwith, whether there would ever be an adequate return for all that expenditure.  But, assuming that the return did come some time, it certainly would not be now, and the immediate effect of this creation of credit, the most noticeable immediate effect of it all, would probably be a further steep rise in the cost of living.  What you gained momentarily in employment in one direction, you would very possibly lose or more than lose in disemployment in other directions.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I think that those who for nationalist motives are eager to free our currency from any connection with outside currencies are misguided, and that, as their proposals would tend to diminish the resources of this country, to weaken us financially, they would make us not more independent of, but more dependent on outsiders.  Instead of being able to hold our heads high, as we have done up to the present, the time might come when we would find ourselves going to the British or to somebody else, with our hats in our hands, for succour.</P>
    <P>There are moments, say, in listening to Senator Healy, when I feel we jumped over a precipice in 1916, and that we have not yet got to the bottom, that we must go on until we get to the bottom, and that things must get worse before they get better.  In that sort of mood, one might be prepared to do anything, including cutting all connection with sterling and destroying all trade with Britain; but except in that <Col N="765" /> mood of desperation, it is not the sort of measure that I feel the people of this country, and the young people of this country, ought to have pressed upon them in the name of patriotism. The youth of this country, like the youth of other countries, are naturally ardent and naturally caught by new ideas, especially if they are pressed upon them with unlimited self-confidence in the name of religion and in the name of patriotism.</P>
    <P>I think this campaign to which I have been referring has had a good deal of success in influencing the minds of our citizens, and especially of our young citizens.  I hope that the Labour representatives who are here in the Seanad will take the trouble to make more specific, more definite, the rather vague and cloudy proposals that have appeared elsewhere in their name, so that we may have something concrete to examine, to consider, to criticise or to adopt.</P>
    <P>But I wish still more that members of the Labour Party, however well meaning, as I am sure the Lord Mayor of Cork is, and that university professors, however learned, as I am sure Professor O'Rahilly is, would in future abstain from clouding the issue and preventing the people of the country from considering these things, these very complicated technical subjects, with cool head, and that they would cease from making passionate appeals to them, based on the supposition that those who take conservative views of finance and who believe, as the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Supplies have recently indicated they believe, that the one road to prosperity is the increase of production, the improvement of our efficiency, especially our agricultural efficiency, thrift, hard work, more knowledge, more enthusiasm in the ordinary daily round, are necessarily villains or freemasons, or devoid of patriotism or blind and deaf to the teaching of the Papal Encyclicals.</P>

      <P>Senator MacDermot has set me some difficulty in not affording me room to criticise, because as one of these hard-boiled orthodox believers in the present financial system, I agree entirely with what he has said. I am not prepared to follow him on his interesting excursions into the financial structure of our early ancestors in the Gaeltacht.  I think there must be a considerable element of doubt and surmise about it, but I am reminded of once talking to a historian and asking him what was this &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; we heard about.  He said, &ldquo;I have read about it, but in those days did anybody die in his bed?&rdquo;  I gather that in those days there was extraordinarily little stability of life, financial or human, at all, and this golden age of which we are told was largely mythical and legendary.</P>
      <P>So far as these practical aspects of currency are concerned, I feel that the Government has got a very complete answer in the fact that there have been two expert commissions into the matter since the State was formed.  There was an inquiry in the early days by the Parker-Willis Commission in, I think, 1926, which recommended after full and expert inquiry that our currency should be tied to sterling.  There was no particular affection for Great Britain.  I do wish to challenge this extraordinary doctrine that because we choose the currency of a certain country, therefore we are committing a political crime.  The gentleman who was chairman of that commission was actually an American and he might very well have suggested that our currency should be tied to the dollar. Then, of course, there was the Banking Commission which recently reported and which has endorsed that view, and given full approval to the views of its predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that there are certain anxieties in the present position due to world conditions.  When the whole of the world has gone mad who can feel safe?  If the Government could afford it, I do not know if it would be unwise to cover our sterling with a larger purchase of gold.  That means a larger portion of expenditure on a non-interest bearing asset.  In our state of <Col N="767" /> economy we want all the interest and revenue we can get.  Some people say that some day gold may be found to be a myth and that the gold myth may be exploded.  There are a great many countries carrying on to-day with little or no gold but still I think it would be generally agreed that if you could afford it a larger backing of gold might be desirable.  The Senator dealt very fully with the effects of making the Irish pound dearer than the pound sterling&mdash; that is, than the pound of the country with which we would have to trade.  It would have a very serious effect on the farmers, and the farmers would not at all like it.  In fact, if you were to depreciate the pound there would be almost a revolution in the country from our main wealth producers.  I think that although the situation must be watched, the Government has got ample justification for the attitude it has taken up now in the fact that the subject has been examined by experts on two commissions.  When you come to these fantastic notions of developmental credit, and giving everybody something for nothing, I am bewildered. I say quite frankly that I do not understand it.  I do not follow the arguments. You can, of course, borrow largely and by borrowing you can spend and create the illusion of wealth. Anybody who has any money saved can create an illusion of wealth by spending his capital, but the day of reckoning will surely come and the last state of that man will be worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I got an insight into the mentality of these gentlemen.  Let me say that I do not impugn their sincerity. Two gentlemen came along to an institution in which I am interested. They were very earnest about a complete new economic order.  They had a blue print worked out, something in the fashion of those genealogical tables or one showing the hierarchy in authority with something at the top and lines of descent.  The whole of industry was there on a formal and completely new structure.  Heavy industries were in a group, and so was agriculture, and there were lines going from one to the other rather like the interlocking of the Royal Mail that <Col N="768" /> appeared once in a financial paper.  All the interlockings of the various industries&mdash;the tourist industry, Government services, brewing had a group of its own, iron and steel was in another group&mdash;all these were set out with very considerable diligence, but apart altogether from any reality, and apart altogether from what is going on in the world, as if everything had been swept away and we were going to build up a new structure.  These gentlemen were. They wanted to begin building up this new economic order, and they asked: &ldquo;Are you going to help?  We must get credit.&rdquo;  We asked: &ldquo;How do you expect to begin?&rdquo;  and they said they would make a beginning with an industry which has since been started, the cement industry.  They said: &ldquo;We think cement is a basic, heavy industry and we want money from the bank to start a cement factory.&rdquo;  They were asked what security they had.  The reply was: &ldquo;Oh, nothing but the security of the industry itself.&rdquo;  Then they were asked what experience they had, and they replied: &ldquo;Personally, we have no experience, but undoubtedly we can get experts to do it.&rdquo;  That is not exaggeration.  It is a true picture and a very terrible picture of the minds of a lot of these people.  They think you can start out of the blue with no experience and no resources, and get money from somebody, and they feel aggrieved if you have not got it.  That would spell disaster in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that Senator MacDermot paid a well-deserved tribute to the generosity and the patriotism&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;of the banks.  I speak from what I know.  I have never known banks to refuse credit to people who were hard-working and credit-worthy, and have got behind them some experience, and who know their job and can make a success of it.  With those credentials, banks are every day taking risks, and the cases where they do hesitate are those of people with wild schemes, without experience of any concerns that are not likely to be productive, that are not profit-producing, or are concerns which are liable to come under the pressure of political agitation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> We have had cases where the security is not a security that can be realised and where, if it has to be realised, there is political pressure to prevent that being done. In that case the banks must act in the interests of their trustees. They must have regard to their trustees and to the interests of those whose money they hold.  There is some fantastic notion that the banks' money is owned by rich men.  If you examine it you will find that the percentage of the banks' resources and the money they use, owned by individually rich men, is comparatively small.  I have not worked out the figure, but I think that three-quarters of the resources used by the banks represents money for which they are trustees. Naturally, their first duty is to obtain security for those people who have entrusted them with the money.  That is the basis of the whole thing, and it would be criminal for those institutions to lend out money on schemes such as those we hear coming from irresponsible quarters, or for such purposes of developmental credit merely to give employment for no productive purpose and possibly no real increase in our national wealth.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Senator refer to the experience of Portugal.  I was in Portugal some years ago but, just as a visitor, one cannot get to very close quarters or become very intimate with the financial methods of a country.  The Portuguese system of finance, as I understood it, is not of a character that we would enjoy ourselves.  If we were to model ourselves on the Portuguese method&mdash;one that I personally would welcome&mdash;we would all have to tighten our belts very much.  We would have to put a stop to Government borrowing to a large extent, to unemployment assistance, to all these various credit schemes and to all this uneconomic housing.  We would have to have a very much lower standard of living.  I am credibly informed that the standard of living of the working classes in Portugal is almost as low as that of any country in the world.  That is deplorable, no doubt, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot is right in stating that you cannot have a higher standard of living than the country can <Col N="770" /> afford.  That is the danger, that we are striving to maintain a higher standard of living than the country can afford. We may maintain that illusion by borrowing for some time but, sooner or later, disaster must come and the last state will then be worse than the first. It is perfectly true, as the Senator stated, that the measure of what is possible is determined by our resources, and we are a country that is not rich in resources.  Agriculture is our main resource, and the only way, to my mind, that we can really increase our wealth is by more expert methods and development in that primary industry. There is very great scope for education, for greater efficiency and greater production. We have only got to look at the example of Denmark to see how far they outstripped this country in the technique of what is our chief industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more to be said.  I agree almost entirely with the Senator who has just spoken. Probably it may be due to tradition but I hold these orthodox views. Honestly, I am quite open to conviction but I have never seen any of these loose statements based on generalisations ever put in a form that could be put into practice without great danger to the savings and the resources of the country.  If they were put in a form in which they would be practicable, I am sure that a number of people who are now doubting Thomases might give them a trial.  Until they are put in a convincing form, and until you can point to the experience of other countries that have tried these methods and made good with them&mdash;because that is the greatest argument of all&mdash;I think you are running a great risk in embarking on remedies of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is only one further remark that I wish to make.  It may be one thing to secure your currency against inflation by adopting some other form of currency or by going on to gold or to the dollar, but you must remember that will not protect a large proportion of the savings of the country which are held in sterling securities.  They would in any case be bound to suffer if there was any measure of inflation or any untoward results from the unfortunate struggle now proceeding in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise somewhat apologetically, appreciating my limitations in speaking, especially after the illuminating review which we have heard from Senator MacDermot. Every Senator here, with any sense of responsibility, must feel considerable difficulty in approaching a matter of this kind.  If I might throw out a hint, with all respect, to the Government I think they would be well advised to set up a committee consisting of Senators and Deputies, who would sit <i>in camera</i>, review every angle of this abstruse delicate question and discuss many matters which it would not be judicious to discuss here.  There are just a few points that I would respectfully submit to this House, but at the outset, in order that I should not be misunderstood, let me say that I do not advocate here and now any attack on sterling.  I think the Minister for Finance ought to give to this House an undertaking that he and his advisers would keep this question constantly under review.</P>
      <P>Let us for a moment examine our currency structure.  On each of our consolidated banknotes is stamped: &ldquo;payable on demand at the bank of issue in Dublin.&rdquo;  The bank thus guarantees to exchange that consolidated banknote for a legal tender note. Let us look at the legal tender note and we find stamped on it: &ldquo;payable&rdquo;&mdash;£1 or whatever the amount may be&mdash;&ldquo;on demand in London.&rdquo;  So that the legal tender note is based on paper whose value is definitely guaranteed in terms of the pound sterling.  Prior to the crisis in 1938, this guarantee was given by the Bank of England because the Irish Currency Commission always held British gilt-edged securities equivalent in value to the amount of legal tender notes issued.  When the threat of war came in 1938, our Government, in my opinion, very properly converted some of the gilt-edged securities into gold, so that the cover of our note issues is partly gold and partly British gilt-edged securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the outbreak of the present war, however, some very important developments have taken place.  Nearly all the gold in the Bank of England has been transferred into the Exchange <Col N="772" /> Equalisation Fund, with the object specifically of keeping the external value of the £ steady.  The £ has dropped from about 4.68 dollars since the war to 4.03 dollars, at which it was pegged.  Notwithstanding that it was pegged at that point, it has since fallen much below that official figure. The financial editor of <i>The Observer</i> stated recently that it has fallen lower than even 3.76 dollars, and he calls attention to the unfortunate impression of collapse in the £ which the New York movement is liable to create in foreign centres.  Now that the arms embargo has been removed by the United States and colossal quantities of arms and war material must be purchased and paid for by cash, the pressure on the £ may easily become greater and it will require very careful handling.  Another point which is of some significance is that, within the last couple of months, the French Minister for Finance, according to reputable English journals, came to London and they point out that the French and British gold may have to be pooled for the successful prosecution of the war, so that our £ is linked not alone with British securities, but with the French franc.</P>
    <P>When England went off the gold standard in 1931, a number of other countries followed suit, including the Scandinavian countries, and linked with sterling in preference to gold, but, since the war, nearly all these Scandinavian countries, as well as Japan, have gone from sterling and have linked with the American dollar.  As Senator MacDermot pointed out, even the Danes have left the sterling group, and if my memory serves me aright, Denmark, which is akin to our country in that it is largely an agricultural country, and Ireland were the two countries which the report of the commission held some 20 years ago or less held out as creditor countries.  Let me repeat at this point that I am not advocating here and now any break with sterling, and still less am I advocating any of the wild-cat schemes of those who seem to think that all our ills are due to some mysterious and sinister influence over our affairs by the Bank of England.  I am not advocating the <Col N="773" /> policies of those half-baked theorists who think that the only cure for this country's ills is to get more money. Yes, we can get all the paper money we want as fast as the printing presses can turn it out, but it will have such a deleterious effect on the economics of this country that, in a short time, a Senator's allowance will scarcely buy a box of matches.</P>
    <P>Whatever arguments have been adduced in favour of a fixed relationship in normal times between England and this country lose their relevancy in war-time, when all England's currency is involved in the prosecution of the war, but even the experience of 10 or 12 years of normality has shown that this enforced restriction of currency issues has been accompanied by all the indications of decay in this country &mdash; increased unemployment, emigration, a decline in population and birth-rate, lower marriage figures and general impoverishment in rural towns and villages.  If this tremendous upheaval had not happened, it is inexplicable to me why our Government, with the knowledge to be gained from the Banking and Currency Commissions, and with unemployment and emigration, permitted this restricted currency which was restricted arbitrarily, without any regard for the changing needs of this country, and which created unemployment, distress and decay.  But we are no longer in normal times; we are no longer in the position in which we were from 1914 to 1918.  For good or ill, we were then part and parcel of the British Empire, sharing her privations and with all the advantages of big expenditure and unrestricted currency.  We are now a neutral country and, so far as the British are concerned, we are a market from which they may get all the goods they require at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>One thing, in my opinion, is certain &mdash;the British currency will be manipulated to meet the problems of international exchange which confront that country, and unless our fiscal policy is radically modified, our currency will join in all the gyrations without the <Col N="774" /> smallest influence on our economic life. It is inevitable, and it must be the general consensus of thinking and responsible men now, that there will be an inflation of the currency of the belligerents, and if there is an inflation there is always the possibility that after this war you might have the same condition of things operating as happened after the last war when French currency was de-valued so greatly.</P>
    <P>Our peculiar position seems to be that the limitations of our currency will preclude and prevent us from enjoying the privileges and advantages of inflated currency if it should happen, whereas if there is a de-valuation after the war, with our inflated currency, it will have disastrous results in this country.  If our connection with English currency is to continue, any measure of inflation in that country ought to be accompanied, <i>pari passu</i>, by an inflation of our currency.  Would it not be absurd, if we have to buy from England on a currency basis on 100 per cent. gold, that, because of our limitations of currency, England should buy from us our cattle and agricultural exports and goods on a currency based, perhaps, on 10 per cent. gold?</P>

      <P>My attention had been called to the fact that there was a motion put down that the Seanad would welcome a statement by the Government on this matter, and I am quite prepared to address some words to the Seanad in connection with it. I was not quite sure whether I should wait until the motion would be passed or put to the House, and I asked the Leas-Chathaoirleach a short while ago about it, and he said that it was a matter for myself.  If the Seanad is agreeable, therefore, I shall address to them now whatever I have to say in the matter, and I should like to do so now, particularly as it is probable that I shall be engaged all day tomorrow in the Dáil, and could not attend here for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker, Senator Madden, started his address by suggesting that the Government should set up a commission to inquire into and examine&mdash; I think he said, <i>in camera</i>&mdash;this abstruse question.  I presume that the question of currency and credit is what the Senator had in mind.  I think the Senator is aware, and I am sure that the Seanad as a whole is aware, that we had sitting here for a period of three years a commission composed of very representative men, and some experts from different parts of Europe to assist and advise the other members of the commission who might not be regarded as experts on the matter of finance or credit.  That commission went very fully into all aspects of the problem that is under discussion here to-night.  We also had another commission, which was set up in 1926, and which reported in 1927, and that commission <Col N="776" /> went into the matter at that time, probably fully also.  Its report was not as voluminous and it did not hold as many sessions as the later Banking Commission, but it went fully into the matter at that time.  Accordingly, we are not, at any rate, without advice of recent date on matters of this kind, and I doubt, with all respect to the members of the Dáil and Seanad, whether if the members of the Dáil and Seanad were to pick the best people that could be picked by them, it could be said afterwards that the advice was better or more trustworthy than the advice that has already been addressed to the Government and the country through the medium of the Banking Commission reports.</P>
    <P>This question of currency is one, as Senator MacDermot said, that is of very great interest, particularly in these days.  There is a campaign going on.  Perhaps it is a fairly widespread campaign.  I do not know how widespread it is, but it is fairly evident, at any rate in the daily and weekly Press in advocating a change in our currency system and advocating views of various kinds of credit reform, and sometimes social reforms of a very extensive, not to say revolutionary, character.  I read these papers and keep in touch with them.  I do not regard myself as being in any sense an expert.  In my capacity as Minister for Finance, however, I have expert advisers in whose advice I place great confidence and trust.  As an ordinary intelligent man, however, I take an interest in these questions that are raised, and I must say that I have given some time to studying questions of credit and credit reform. Innumerable books have been written about that subject during the last 10 or 15 years, and especially since the end of the European War, and I must say that I have not yet been convinced that any of the reforms of credit that are most widely advertised in these days would be successful.  Conviction has not been brought to my mind that it would be of advantage in this country if these systems were adopted and put into operation in place of the system of credit and currency control that is operating in Ireland at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> I think that the position in this country is comparable to what has been said by Senator MacDermot, and perhaps by Senator Sir John Keane, about Portugal.  I think we can claim here that we also are living within our means.  I know that there are people who dispute that, but I think we are living within our means and balancing our Budgets so far.  I hope we will be able to continue to do so.  I hope that the Government will try always to live within its resources.  It would not be a good thing for the country if it did not try seriously to do that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of currency in general, we have had advice, as I have said, from very reliable quarters on this matter in recent times.  It is within everybody's recollection that for, I suppose, a century at any rate, if not longer, our currency&mdash;the currency circulating here in Ireland&mdash;was identical with that of Great Britain. Up to 1927 we used the British currency; it was in that year that the Currency Act was passed, and provided that our own Irish pound be maintained at par with sterling.  Other Senators have stated&mdash;and it is true&mdash; that the Government at that time&mdash;in 1927, when the Currency Act was passed&mdash;was free to choose that course or any other course that would be of advantage to the country.  The choice was made without any dictation from anybody, whether inside or outside the country, and without any suspicion of pressure of any kind from any corporation or body&mdash;banking, financial, political, or any other&mdash;outside this country.  The choice made then was a choice freely made by the Dáil in the name of the people and at the recommendation of the Government.  That choice has continued to operate ever since; the choice then freely adopted can be as freely changed at any time it suits.  The decision was actuated solely by the interests of this country, and if any other course seemed to be more advantageous to the country, I am sure it would have been adopted.</P>
    <P>The Banking Commission of 1926 advised that the link and the parity should be adopted.  Senator Sir John Keane reminded us of the fact that the chairman of that commission on banking <Col N="778" /> and currency was an American, a man of distinction, Professor Parker Willis who, I think, has since died.  I agree with Senator Sir John Keane's suggestion that, perhaps, as an American, he would probably favour getting any country, Ireland included, to tie up with the dollar rather than with the pound, if he had a personal choice; but his advice at the time was that the wisest thing for this country was to tie up with sterling and to adopt parity. He spoke as a man presumably of independent mind and judgment, and as one who had wide knowledge and experience in these matters.  If any other course had been more advantageous, as I have already said, or more profitable, I am sure it would have been selected and put into operation by the Government of that time.</P>
    <P>Then we have the Banking Commission which was set up in 1934 and which reported some time in 1938.  The majority of that commission&mdash;16 out of 21&mdash;recommended the maintenance of the link with sterling.  They gave reasons for that.  Probably most Senators have read, if not all of the report, the principal parts of it and the reasons given will be within their recollection. I summarise some of them here:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The maintenance of the link ensures to this country the advantage of exchange stability with the British market, which is of the greatest importance for our foreign trade, and in which the bulk of our foreign investments is held;</P>
    <P>the link has the further advantage of possessing the confidence of the Irish public and, conversely, any suggestion for relaxation of it would meet with distrust.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a summary of some of the outstanding reasons they gave for recommending that we maintain our present relation with sterling.  They also advised that we should maintain the present parity, that it would be unwise to change it, and they said, in backing up their opinion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such a change would introduce an element of uncertainty for the future, as it would be impossible to prevent the anticipation of further changes, <Col N="779" /> and this uncertainty would be a grave deterrent to enterprise and would prejudice the maintenance of low interest rates; further, the effect of an increase in the value of the Irish pound in terms of the British pound would be a fall in the payments that Irish producers receive for their exports in their own currency, while the effect of a reduction in the value of the Irish pound would be a rise in the cost of all imports and an accentuation of the present tendency to a rise in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are very important and, I think, convincing, reasons why there should be no change&mdash;at any rate, under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Up to the outbreak of the war, none of the advocates of the severance of the link with sterling proposed that course with the aim of increasing the value of the Irish £.  The Minority Report No. 1 of the Banking Commission told us that it was overvalued at the present parity.  Those who signed Minority Report No. 1&mdash;I think Senator Campbell was one of them&mdash;desired, even if they did not say it clearly, to depreciate the value of the £: perhaps, they realised that depreciation would be an inevitable result of the policy which they were recommending in other fields.  I hold strongly to the view that, however one may disguise the depreciation, whatever name one may give it, you could not long disguise, and no exchange control could mitigate, the evils that would result from depreciation of our currency in terms of the currency to which long experience has made the people accustomed as their standard of value.  Any such depreciation would seriously shake public confidence in Irish currency, in the solvency of the State and in the banking system.  It would, consequently, have the effect of raising rates of interest on Government borrowings and on advances for industrial and commercial enterprises, thus placing new difficulties in the way of the Government's housing and public works policy and adversely affecting business activity and employment.  There may be an initial advantage to exporters, but that initial advantage would be <Col N="780" /> short-lived and would be more than counterbalanced by an immediate increase in the cost of all imports.  All these factors would accentuate the upward trend in prices, with resulting social unrest and demands for higher wages, accompanied by a fall in the standard of living of persons with fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to fix a new legal parity with sterling, the natural tendency to discount the possibility of further measures of depreciation would lead to an increase in prices of imports out of proportion to the decline in the legal value of the Irish £.  In the view of the signatories of the First and Third Minority Reports&mdash;if that view were accepted&mdash;no new parity would be fixed, but a so-called Exchange Equalisation Fund would be established to render as gradual as possible any movement of exchange rates which were the result of an active policy of internal development.  As the inflationary policies advocated in these reports would cause a consistently downward movement in the value of our currency the operation of this miscalled &ldquo;equalisation&rdquo; fund would involve the State in heavy losses.  These reports, moreover, give no indication as to the manner in which or the sources from which this &ldquo;equalisation&rdquo; fund is to be constituted or its inevitable losses met.</P>
    <P>A rate of exchange which is fluctuating or is known to be liable to fluctuate, benefits the speculators, the people who can turn their assets into cash overnight and take advantage of any alteration in the exchange rate which is anticipated or known.  It does not assist trade and commerce&mdash;it cripples them because every trading transaction becomes a speculation with the dice heavily loaded against the trader.</P>
    <P>Senators have mentioned here the effect of the war on our currency.  That is a subject that is frequently referred to these days in correspondence and articles in the daily and weekly press. Naturally, it is a subject of vital interest and importance to us in these times and it is one to which I, charged with the control of the finances, have given considerable thought.  It is true <Col N="781" /> that since the Banking Commission Reports were presented and published, the international monetary system and the prospects of sterling have radically changed.  There may have been reason in March, 1938, for believing, as some people then believed, that our currency was over-valued in terms of sterling. If the war goes on, however, and if we can maintain our neutrality and pursue a reasonably sound general policy, our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> Great Britain is likely to improve to such an extent that the question will not be whether the present parity with sterling is an over-valuation but whether it is an under-valuation of our currency.  It may be suggested that in such circumstances it would be in our interest to break with sterling.  Unless, however, the British are forced to an extreme of inflation, which the British Government seems determined to do everything in its power to prevent, I believe that the balance of advantage for this country lies in the maintenance of the present parity.  An increase in the sterling value of the Irish pound, though its consequences would be less harmful than those of depreciation, would have many serious results.  It would mean, in terms of our own currency, lower yields on our investments in Great Britain and lower prices for our exports to that country.  The British securities held by the Currency Commission and the Irish banks would presumably have to be revalued, and in a downward direction.  This, in the case of the Currency Commission, would cause a deficit in the Legal Tender Note Fund and, in one way or another, that deficiency would have to be made good by the State.  For the Joint Stock Banks a serious depreciation in the value of their sterling assets in terms of Irish currency would mean, possibly, bankruptey unless they were enabled to write down their liabilities to depositors&mdash;and it requires very little effort of the imagination to visualise the agitation which would arise and the shock to the confidence of the people in our whole financial system and in our banks that such a writing-down would cause.  I am convinced that we should not risk these consequences of a higher valuation of our currency unless and until <Col N="782" /> it becomes clear that inflation in Great Britain cannot be kept within moderate limits.</P>
    <P>Exchange rates and exchange mechanism exist to facilitate trade, and it is of the utmost advantage to be linked with the currency of the country with which we do the bulk of our business. There is the kernel of the whole situation.  We do the vast bulk of our business with the United Kingdom, and it is of advantage to us to have parity with sterling for that purpose. The relative importance of our export trade with the United Kingdom in agricultural goods has been increased and not diminished by the war.  The market for such goods in the United Kingdom has become wider and is less well supplied from other sources, and on the other hand we are unable, by reason of transport and currency difficulties, to take advantage of such Continental markets as were opened since about 1932.  They were of some advantage to us, particularly in times of economic stress and trouble, but there is nobody who will suggest that they could be substituted for the market where we have for so long been able to find a place to sell the greater part of our agricultural produce.  Again, considerable increase in the price of imported goods has been caused by the war.  Scarcity, unlimited armament demand, increased transport charges and enormously increased insurance charges are contributing factors.  As the price of imported commodities rises, we will become more dependent on our exports to maintain our imports and so maintain our standard of living and avoid serious economic and social dislocation at home.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested frequently in the past&mdash;and Senators here this evening have referred to the fact&mdash;that many people in this country, long months before the war started, thought and think still, that it would have been advantageous to us to have left sterling and joined our currency with the United States dollar currency.  Some people seem to think that if we had done that 10 or 12 years ago it would have been a wise step for this Government to take and that we would have profited by it.  I think if there are <Col N="783" /> any Senators who have gone into that matter and have studied the rise and fall of financial affairs in the United States over the last 10 or 15 years, they will believe with me that we would have lost rather than gained by such a change.</P>
    <P>However attractive monetary association with the United States of America may appear, we must realise, first, that we have no considerable amount of trade with that country, and, second, that even the limited amount we have is likely to diminish as the war continues.  If the pound sterling remains stable in terms of the dollar, there would be no difficulty for us in linking with the dollar later and we might as well stay where we are. If the pound sterling depreciates in terms of the dollar and our currency is linked to the latter, then we are appreciating in terms of the pound sterling and all the difficulties of trading under a fluctuating exchange arise.  It is desirable that, subject to what I have already said, we should remain linked to the currency with which we have the overwhelming bulk of our trade.</P>
    <P>In this country the ordinary man with goods to sell, whether it be cattle or any other kind of produce, does not know or realise anything of the difficulty that arises where there is a fluctuating exchange.  Here in our own time, and in our father's and grandfather's time&mdash;in all our time, in fact&mdash; we have been used to a stabilised currency. We have known every day when we got up to go to the market, and looked at the newspapers, what the value of our currency was and the value of the goods we sold for export in terms of our own currency and of English currency, and we knew what to expect and what we should get.</P>
    <P>If we had a rate of exchange and a currency subject to the fluctuations of that rate of exchange from day to day, and sometimes from hour to hour as in many countries, the difficulties for our traders, and particularly for our exporters, would be multiplied.  Sometimes it might be to our advantage and sometimes to our disadvantage, but at any <Col N="784" /> rate it would be a sort of gamble.  We would not be sure any day when we sent our goods to the market what exact value we were going to get in return for them.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of war a number of countries have broken the link with sterling, and have associated their currency with the United States dollar.  It has been suggested here and in different parts of the country, and in the Press, that similar action should be taken with regard to the Irish pound. All those countries that have changed from sterling have had, however, special reasons for acting as they did.  The most common reason given was that they had important trade relations with countries other than the United Kingdom, and they did not want to be paid on a sterling basis for their exports. There were also difficulties caused by the operations of the British war-time currency control which in some cases ran counter to their special interests.  It was a war measure designed to meet the situation, and we have it to a certain extent here, and naturally England uses her control of the currency to her own advantage and where it suits her she facilitates other countries.  Where it suits her better, she refuses facilities to other countries. Therefore, countries which had some of their trade with Great Britain and some with other countries, did not want to be tied up by the English regulations with regard to the control of currency, and, perhaps, did not wish to be paid in sterling, as they believed that sterling was falling in value relative to the other currencies.  They changed, and what they did we are free to do, when we are satisfied and convinced that it is to the advantage of this country that we should change.  If we are convinced that a change would be for the good of this country and its trade, we can make the change.  I wish just to mention the fact that some countries had difficulties since the war began.  Where they were formerly associated with sterling and had broken away, they have had difficulties about currency and financial matters with Great Britain, but we here have not experienced any such difficulties since the war began.</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  The law that tied us to British sterling was passed by the Dáil and it can be repealed at any time.  It is a matter for the will and wish of the Oireachtas at any period, to continue or to make any other arrangement they please.  It is a matter entirely for the Irish people, acting through the Oireachtas and the Government.  As I said, we in this country have received favourable treatment from the British currency control as regards meeting our requirements of foreign exchange for the purchase of essential imports from countries other than Great Britain.  We have to import, as you know, great quantities of foodstuffs of different kinds&mdash;maize, wheat and other things&mdash;and for these we have to pay in foreign currency.  Up to the present we have not failed to get the currency necessary to pay for anything we have imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it was previously urged that on the breakdown of the gold standard in Great Britain in 1931 we should have severed the link with sterling and tied our currency to gold or to the United States dollar, it is of interest to examine what the consequences would have been if we had followed such advice.  If, prior to September, 1931, a large block of our sterling funds had been shifted to the New York stock exchange and the Irish pound linked with the dollar, it is true that we would have escaped the depreciation of sterling which reached a low level of 3.18? dollars to the £ on December 3rd, 1932, at which level, in the popular phrase the £ had declined to 13/1d.  On the other hand, our investment in American Bonds would have declined in the ratio of 90.9 to 69.5 as between 1931 and 1932 on the average while an investment in a selection of 420 American common stocks would have shown a depreciation as between the same years in the ratio of 94.7 to 48.6. Furthermore, from November, 1933, until the September crisis of 1938, we would have been in a worse position than that which we tried to avoid as during that entire period of nearly five years the pound sterling was at a premium in relation to the dollar as <Col N="786" /> compared with the old gold parity, the rate having touched as high as 5.43 on November 22nd, 1933, as against the parity of 4.86?.  Thus, even if we had the foresight to provide against the break-down of the gold standard in Great Britain in 1931 we would have lost, on balance, and created new problems for ourselves into the bargain.</P>
    <P>There is one other argument I think I could use with advantage on this question and it is also an argument that bears on one of our great problems, perhaps the greatest political problem of to-day, and that is the matter of Partition.  The severance of the link with sterling and the break with the existing parity would involve the creation of different standards of monetary values as between the 26 Counties and the Six Counties.  The first result would be to present a whole new series of problems for the banks that now operate on both sides of the Border.  Furthermore, the inter-trading, great and small, that goes on between both sides of the Border would be further impeded.  Such an event would lessen still more the relationships between the 26 and the Six Counties and it would serve to reinforce Partition.</P>
    <P>That is a view that at any rate appeals to me, and I think it is a fact that it would make dealings more difficult between ourselves here and our people across the Border, and possibly it might have an additional influence in reinforcing Partition.  Nobody would like to take any step, such as a break with sterling, without having all these facts in mind and seeing what the consequences would be internally and externally from the political as well as the financial point of view.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these arguments, which are only briefly outlined here, against any departure in present circumstances from the existing parity with sterling, I am of opinion that the continuance of the present statutory relationship between the two currencies is in harmony with the interests of this country.  The Government would only consider proposing an amendment of it if a change of circumstances were to occur of such a nature as to render the preservation of the present parity <Col N="787" /> between our currency and the British clearly disadvantageous to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to stress that we are free to take any step we like in this direction.  There is no power outside this State that can interfere with us in doing anything we please with regard to our currency.  We can tie our currency to the American dollar, the Canadian dollar or other currencies if there are any other more stable currencies.  I do not know if I can refer to the American dollar as so stable either, but if there is any more stable currency besides the British, and if we think it is an advantage to the country to tie our currency to it, we can do so. It is a matter entirely for our own consideration, our own discretion and our own action.  The question relating to currency is one that is under constant observation, and if, at any time, it would appear to the Government that greater advantage to our country, to our trade, to our economic and financial position could be achieved by a change in any direction, we are always prepared to consider that change and to make it, so long as we are convinced that Ireland will benefit.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I am entirely satisfied with the Minister's statement.  As one reason for bringing forward this motion was to give certain members of the House who might have unorthodox views on the monetary question, an opportunity of expressing these views where they could be met in public debate and where the Minister could define his attitude to them, I am quite prepared, as seconder of the motion, to move at this juncture that the debate be adjourned.  Any Senator who would like to ventilate his views will have an opportunity of ventilating them on a later occasion.  So far as the Minister is concerned, I, personally, am quite satisfied with his statement and with the soundness of his attitude on the monetary question.  I am glad to have his statement on record.</P>
