      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of sub-section (1) of this section shall be construed as having retrospective effect, and the amendments of Section 26 of the Principal Act effected by those paragraphs of that sub-section shall come into force as on and from the 1st day of April, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill amends the Principal Act by making bodies liable for the amount of money which they would have had to pay had the Principal Act been drafted after the fashion that the Minister intended.  I am proposing this amendment, that nothing in certain paragraphs shall be deemed to be retrospective, in the confident hope that the Minister will accept it because on the Second Stage of the Bill he told us that this Act was not retrospective and lest we might make more mistakes, in order to get the Minister's intention properly into the Bill, I suggest that we should say definitely in the Bill that it is not retrospective. In column 691 of the <Col N="790" /> debates for the 6th March of this House the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have never listened to so many specious arguments in my life as I have just listened to from Senator Douglas.  He wound up with an attack upon this Bill upon the plea that it is proposed to be retrospective in its effect.  It is not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it is not retrospective in its effect it seems to me that the simplest thing is to say that quite clearly as it is put in this amendment.  Then, I think, if the Minister accepts the amendment, he could delete Section 4 which is put in to make certainty more certain.  The Minister was foiled in his last effort to get certain amounts of money from certain local bodies and in this he is making assurance doubly sure.</P>
    <P>On the merits of the amendment, the Principal Act of 1934, I think it was, purported to place a certain burden upon local bodies.  A legal opinion was taken by the Corporation of the City of Dublin, which stated to them quite clearly that the burden was less than they had been paying and less than the Minister had demanded.  The legal opinion told them further that they were entitled to pay only the smaller amount and to recover from future payments the amount which they had overpaid in the past and they did that. The Dublin Corporation is, of course, a subordinate body and having got legal opinion was bound to act on that legal opinion.  The Government is not in that position.  The Minister spoke on the last occasion about legal advice but I think he refrained from saying that the Government had legal advice that their view was correct and, so far, the only legal opinion that has been produced or alluded to and the only name of senior counsel that has been mentioned are the opinion given to the Corporation of Dublin by a particular named member of the Bar.  I do not know whether the Minister had any opinion.  If he had any legal opinion it certainly never saw the light and he never gave it to anybody.  The position is that the Corporation of Dublin acted within the law and, having acted within the law and having fulfilled their legal obligations, this Bill now proposes to make them <Col N="791" /> pay money, in 1940, for which they were not legally liable before the date of the passing of this Act.  That, I think, is a vicious principle, apart from the sum of money involved, which is £63,000.  If it were even 6/3, I think the principle is a vicious and a wrong one and could not be upheld. Since the Minister is at one with me in being against retrospective legislation to make people liable for sums that they were not liable for in the past, I hope that he will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that this Bill was not retrospective in effect, and I do not intend to be a party to any action which would cast doubts upon the truth of that declaration.  It is quite clear that if this amendment were introduced the acceptance of it by the Government would imply that the Bill was really of retrospective effect and that the doubts which had been expressed by the Dublin Corporation in regard to this matter were well founded.  We are not prepared to accept that position at all.  This Bill has been introduced, as I have said, to avoid litigation which would be futile, though expensive both to the ratepayer and to the taxpayer alike. This amendment, far from settling anything, would unsettle everything and would leave us in exactly the same position as if the Bill had not been brought in.  It would render nugatory all the efforts which the Oireachtas has made to clear up the situation and to leave it, as we hope it will be left after the enactment of this measure, without any ambiguity or any uncertainty whatsoever. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the House that there is clearly an ambiguity? The Minister made it perfectly clear that he did not regard this Bill as retrospective, and he was quite politely and kindly sarcastic at my expense because I believed it was.  He referred in his last speech&mdash;certainly he referred to it at some time on the last occasion&mdash;to the fact that if one turned to the discussion on the 1934 <Col N="792" /> Act one would see that there was a clear intention on the part of the Oireachtas, as shown by the speeches of Ministers and others, but he said that certain doubts had arisen.  If, as I think is the case, this Bill will make certain local bodies, the Dublin Corporation in particular, liable for payments for which they were not legally liable before this Bill was passed, payments in respect of previous years, it has a retrospective effect.  The Minister held that it was not retrospective, and we held that it was, but if the Minister still contends that it is not retrospective, I certainly think that he should be willing to have this amendment inserted.  It seems to me that this is very largely a matter of words, because I hold that, if after legal opinion was secured the corporation did not make any payments and no action was taken to force them to do so, then it must be assumed they were not liable at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the position is now that the Minister is by law making certain people liable for payments for which they were not legally liable before this.  Some time ago, in his capacity as Minister for Finance&mdash;if it was not he, it was the present Minister, at any rate, the Minister for Finance&mdash;gave notice that income-tax from next month would be levied at the rate of 6/6 in the £.  If, instead of giving notice that income-tax would be raised in that way after a certain period, he had announced that the income-tax for 1937-38 would have to be paid at the rate of 6/6 in the £, think of the fuss that would be raised about it if he made people liable for sums which at the particular moment of the announcement they were not liable for.  He could call it a Bill to remove doubts and to get more money. Similarly, if the corporation were to strike a rate higher than that which they had originally announced, owing to the Minister's machinations and operations&mdash;and that is what is going to happen&mdash;and supposing they were to say that that was also to be the rate for 1939, the Minister would immediately say that that was improper and illegal.  But the Oireachtas can do that.  There is no doubt that the <Col N="793" /> Minister can do what he is trying to do, but it is an utterly vicious and a wrong principle.  It is a sound principle that when any person or any body makes a mistake, that person or that body should pay for the mistakes. The Minister, his advisers and the Oireachtas made a mistake in the framing of the original Act, and they are now going to compel the citizens of Dublin to pay for the mistakes of somebody else.  That is a very bad principle.  It is one of the things that brings Parliament into disrepute.  I suggest that the Minister is doing a very vicious, a very improper and unjust act if he uses the Parliamentary machine to enact retrospective legislation of this kind.  It would be regarded as an extremely unjust act if the corporation sought to increase rates retrospectively, but that is, in effect, what is being done in the case of this taxation.  I might give expression to this view.  I believe myself that the Minister got legal opinion from his own legal advisers that the corporation was right in their action, and that is why he brought in the Bill that is now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to keep on chopping arguments and prolonging the debate unnecessarily, because it is quite clear from his own words that Senator Hayes does not seriously believe in the arguments he is advancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, Sir.  They are quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the first of his arguments: that it is a sound principle if a body makes a mistake that it should pay for that mistake.  Apply that to the corporations.  If there is any doubt as to what was the interpretation of Section 26 of the 1933 Act, then the corporations were mistaken in the interpretation which they put on that section in the years 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and up to the year 1938.  They were mistaken when they were levying and collecting rates for the purpose of making their due contributions to the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  If mistakes should be paid for by those who make them is the principle upon which the Senator is basing his argument, then I think he has destroyed <Col N="794" /> the case for his amendment.  The effect of the amendment would be to relieve the corporation of the consequences of the mistake, which he holds they made during those years.  Our view is not, however, quite on all fours with that of the Senator.  We do not think they made any mistake during those years.  We think they interpreted the Act during those years correctly, and accordingly all we are seeking to do is to ensure that there will not be any future doubt as to how the Act is going to be interpreted.  The purpose of the Bill is to clarify the situation, and I could not possibly stultify the Dáil and the Government by accepting the amendment which would suggest that there was still a doubt in the minds of the Government or its advisers as to what the true effect of the section was.</P>
      <P>The Senator has suggested that the Government had not been advised that the interpretation which we placed on the section was the correct one.  I pointed out on the last day that the net point upon which the corporation founded its attitude in the matter was raised on amendments submitted to the Dáil and to the Seanad.  In the case of the amendment in the Dáil, I think the issue could not be stated more precisely. The amendment was:</P>
      <P>To insert before the words &ldquo;rateable valuation&rdquo; the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the corporation ground their attitude upon the presumption that the words &ldquo;rateable valuation&rdquo; used in the section of the Principal Act must be interpreted as meaning the &ldquo;effective rateable valuation&rdquo;.  That issue, as I said, was raised in the Dáil, and the amendment which was put down by Deputy Corish was defeated. Again, here in the Seanad, Senator Staines put down a series of amendments. I think this matter was discussed on every stage of the Principal Act as it was going through the House, and on each occasion, the end which Deputy Staines was aiming at was to ensure that when the corporation contribution came to be assessed, it would be based upon the effective rateable valuation of the municipality.  The Seanad at the time took the same view as the Dáil did in this matter, and, so <Col N="795" /> far as words could ensure it, they saw that the section was drafted in such a way that the corporation's contribution was to be assessed, not upon the effective rateable valuation, but upon the gross rateable valuation of the city. That was the net issue raised on these amendments.  The Oireachtas decided, I think wisely, that the assessment should be on the gross rateable valuation and not on the effective rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>The Corporation of the City of Dublin, and most of the other local authorities, assumed when the Act became operative that the section of the Act had been drafted to give effect to that decision, and they acted on it for four years.  If a doubt has been raised in this matter since, it would be much too an expensive matter to go to the courts and to have the courts decide the question whether the Oireachtas or the technical advisers of the Government had failed to express the clear intention of the Oireachtas in regard to it, or whether because of some verbal failure or, as I put it the other day, a textual error, the original intention of the Oireachtas had been defeated. Moreover, the ultimate result would have to be the same, some representative of the Government would have to come here and say: &ldquo;The equities of the situation are such that we feel that the contribution to be paid by the Dublin Corporation and the other large municipalities to the unemployment assistance fund must be of such an amount; the courts have held that the section, as drafted, does not, in fact, provide for that, and it is necessary for us to ask the Oireachtas to amend the law accordingly.&rdquo;  Therefore, the only thing that would be gained, as a result of taking another course, of taking the course which appears to appeal to the Senator, would be, not that the burden of the Dublin Corporation would be ultimately lighter, but that the burden on the ratepayers of the city and upon the taxpayers of the country would be heavier as a result of the legal expenditure needlessly incurred.  That is the position as we see it.  The Senator has constructed a very long argument <Col N="796" /> about the ill-effects of retrospective taxation, but suppose we were to accept his amendment, what would it do, except to necessitate retrospective taxation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will turn to the Budget statement of last year, he will see that, in framing the Budget, account was taken of the fact that £63,000 had been, as we deemed it, wrongfully withheld by the local authority.  We were expecting that the law would be so clarified in this year that the local authorities would meet their just obligations to the Exchequer, and accordingly, to that extent, taxation was not being imposed.  But if we accept the Senator's amendment, it simply means that we, as the representative of the taxpayer, forgo this sum of £63,000 which is owed to the public Exchequer by the local authority.  We then would have to come formally to the Dáil to impose additional taxation, but the effect of which would be equivalent to taxing the people retrospectively in order to make good this £63,000 deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are no merits whatever in the amendment.  For four or five years a certain interpretation was placed upon this Act by all the parties concerned, and it was acted upon.  In 1938, the county boroughs&mdash;whether as a result of consultation among themselves or not, I do not know, but the coincidence was, shall we say, remarkable&mdash;decided, although they levied a rate for the purpose of paying this contribution on a certain basis and had collected the proceeds of that rate, to pay only part of it over to the public Exchequer.  We cannot allow that sort of thing to continue.  We could not allow that sort of practice to form a precedent and to be set up as a model to imitate.  The position is that the money having been collected from the citizens for this purpose, we think we are entitled to get it, and to get it, we hold, on the true interpretation of the section.  If there is any doubt in the mind of any other interest concerned, it is the duty of the Oireachtas to clarify the doubt, and to make the <Col N="797" /> position plain and clear.  That is all we are doing, and we are not introducing a measure the purpose of which is to collect taxation retrospectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a good deal, but he did not say that, in 1939, he got any legal opinion as to the meaning of the Act.  The Minister has been eight years in office, and he is not unintelligent, to put it in its mildest form.  He knows as well as I and all intelligent people know that when a lawyer was asked, in 1938, to say what the Principal Act meant, he did not read the Dáil or Seanad debates.  He was spared that.  He did not read what Deputy Corish said, what Senator Staines said, or what the Minister for Local Government said.  He simply read the Act, and found that the Act meant a particular thing.  This Oireachtas is all powerful.  The corporation is a subordinate body, and there having been a doubt, the corporation was bound to take an opinion. I suggest that the Minister did take <Col N="798" /> the opinion of a lawyer who did not read the debates, but who said: &ldquo;The corporation opinion is right; you will have to amend the law,&rdquo; and this is the amendment of the law.</P>
      <P>It is a vicious and a bad principle, and the Minister's attempt to suggest that the county boroughs did something mean, something in the nature of sleight-of-hand, is quite unworthy and quite untrue.  He is a trustee for the people; these corporators were trustees for the ratepayers; and they simply took the obvious steps to find out what their obligations were.  When they found what they were, they paid them, and the Minister now says to them: &ldquo;You are going to pay me what I thought your obligations were, no matter what the law was.  I am going to make the law right now, because I have the big stick.&rdquo;  There is no doubt that he has the big stick, but he is very foolish to use it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> The purpose of Section 4 is to make assurance doubly sure that the Minister will get this money retrospectively, but I will not argue that point any further.  Obviously however, a considerable amount of money is to be paid&mdash;some £63,000&mdash;which is much more than would fall to be paid in a normal year, even under this Bill, when it becomes an Act.  In the other House it was pointed out to the Minister that it would be advisable to spread the payment of that money over a number of years.  In that House an amendment to the effect that it should be spread over, I think, ten years, was rejected, and an opinion was expressed that three years would be a reasonable time.  I think that the Minister indicated, at any rate, limited agreement with that view, and I have put down this amendment in order to give him an opportunity of saying now whether he has come to any conclusion as to how this burden will be put upon the various bodies concerned, and whether it will be collected in one year or spread over a period of years, and, if the latter, over how many years.</P>

      <P>In view of what I said in the other House I think I should be entitled to resent an amendment of this sort going into the Bill.  I have not been approached by the Dublin Corporation yet as to the manner in which they propose to discharge the liabilities under the Bill, if it is enacted.  Perhaps it has been premature to expect them to come. But I did indicate in the other House that we should be prepared to consider an arrangement on lines which would provide that the Exchequer was not at any loss.  By that I mean that the Minister for Finance might be disposed to regard the moneys withheld as a repayable advance to be repaid within a reasonable period.  I have had some discussions with the Minister for Finance in regard to the matter and I believe that he would be prepared to meet the corporation reasonably&mdash;I may say, with much more consideration for their position, and with a greater desire to meet their convenience, than they evinced in the contrary direction.  However, that is the position and I think <Col N="800" /> the Seanad may take it that, bearing in mind our obligations to the other sections of the community, no undue hardship will be imposed on the Dublin Corporation or upon any other local authority by the Exchequer in exercising its rights under this Act.</P>

As I stated on the Second Reading here, the cost will depend on a variety of circumstances that it is not possible to fully anticipate at this stage.  For example, in an area that might be taken as a typical area, reasonable provision might already exist: the local authority may have incurred considerable expenditure in the past in providing fire fighting services.  In such an area, the expenditure under this Bill would be small.  In other areas, nothing has been done by the local authority in relation to this particular service and the expenditure in such an area will be correspondingly greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> I might be asked if it is not possible for me to find cut in my Department the areas in which an efficient fire fighting service already exists.  It is; I grant that.  It is not, however, possible to anticipate to what extent the local authorities of the future will face up to this problem.  The matter of expenditure will be primarily one for the sanitary authority&mdash;one sanitary authority may take a much more serious view of the problem than a neighbouring sanitary authority.  The expenditure will also be related to the extent to which use is made of the provisions in the Bill providing for agreement as to the use of the fire fighting services of one sanitary authority by another. I hope that such agreements will be reached in many instances and that, in that way, it will be possible to avoid, to a very full extent, the duplication of services.</P>
    <P>I have here the cost of the fire engine in a town of average size.  This may be taken as a fairly safe indication of what the fire engine and accessories would cost in the average provincial town.  The figure is £1,075.  A tender for the erection of a fire station was approved recently at a cost of £409.  These are definite figures that indicate, at any rate, the approximate cost of equipment and of housing the equipment.  How far trained personnel may be employed on a permanent basis will again be a matter very largely to be determined by the local authority.  One local authority probably will be satisfied with a very skeleton staff; another local authority &mdash;perhaps because of experience in the past or of dread of the future&mdash;will say: &ldquo;This money is well expended and we will ensure that the lives and property in our area will be adequately safeguarded.&rdquo;  I cannot give any further information to the House on that point.</P>
    <P>On the question of the £100,000, I do not think that Senator The McGillycuddy looked upon that figure, in the exchanges that took place between us in the last debate, as being in any way a considered figure.  I think he appreciates the atmosphere in which the figure of £100,000 was mentioned.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter of expenditure in order, not to establish a principle, but to recall the Parliamentary Secretary and all of us to a certain principle, that is, that when we introduce legislation there should be some pre-vision of the cost.  I do not want to be personal, but, after all, if the Parliamentary Secretary or myself goes to order a suit it is an elementary precaution to ask what that suit is going to cost, and where we are responsible to the general public and to the ratepayers, particularly in a time of great emergency in regard to money, such as this, I suggest that before a Bill of this scope was before the House a circular letter might have been issued to the sanitary authorities asking them to submit proposals for what they consider, in accordance with the words in the Bill, would be reasonable fire-fighting precautions for their area.  If that had been done the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to come before this House and give us a very close figure of what the cost of the appliances is going to be&mdash;and may I draw attention to the fact that it will all be capital going out of the country&mdash;and further, the annual maintenance and the consequent cost to the ratepayers. That seems a very simple way of doing things, and it seems an astounding thing that this Bill has apparently gone through the Dáil without any inquiry as to what the final cost to the ratepayer is going to be.  That is why I have raised the point.  The Parliamentary Secretary has helped us as far as he possibly can.  I am quite satisfied with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected rather more from the Parliamentary Secretary. Normally when a Bill is introduced which relates to activity carried out by a Department the Department has to include the expenditure in its estimates.  In this case the expenditure is going to be farmed out to local bodies.  As a matter of fact, their activity will be largely controlled by the Department.  For instance, the Parliamentary Secretary states that he does not know how far there will be co-operation between one local authority and another.  I presume his <Col N="804" /> Department will more or less give orders in relation to that.  Also, his Department, presumably, will watch to see that there is no wild unnecessary expenditure by any individual authority.  Therefore, it does seem to me that his Department should have some idea of the cost.  When you bring in a service like this, the general idea is that it is a splendid, beautiful service and no question should be asked about it.  Always in life you have to take a certain amount of risk.  An ordinary man insures himself against third-party risk in his motor car.  The Army does not insure its motor cars because it has so many motor cars and, estimating the risk, decides that the premiums for insurance would be heavier than the cost per annum that might fall upon them through accident. In relation to fire-fighting, there are certain things that can happen that cannot be equated to any financial sum.  For instance, you cannot equate loss of life to any sum of money, but it might easily happen, taking the average occurrence of fire in this country, that the diminution of damage brought about by the service we are going to inaugurate would be less, financially, than the sum we are going to spend.  In all these things there is a certain amount of common sense. The question is, is it worth it?  A person who is going to insure asks what the premium is and may decide that the premium is too high and decides to do without the insurance.  In the same way this may mean a burden on this country&mdash;I do not know&mdash;that will be heavier than we have any need to provide on the incidence of fires in the country.  If, as I say, this was going to be operated directly by the Department of Local Government, then that Department would have an annual estimate for both the initial expenditure and the annual expenditure thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not ask for too much from the Parliamentary Secretary, but I think he ought to have in mind where the men are going to be got, whether they are going to be volunteers or semi-volunteers. I know one city on the Continent where certainly there have been very big fires.  It is a very well-known <Col N="805" /> city and would count as a big sized city here.  There are semi-volunteers there who get about £8 a year, and for that £8 they can be called upon at any time.  I think if we are going to have full-time men it will be very costly.  The Parliamentary Secretary might give us some idea of what he has in mind.  He might take an average county and say what additional immediate and recurring annual expenditure will be involved.  I think that bringing in a Bill like this absolutely <i>in vacuo</i> without any indication as to what the cost is going to be is not normal Government procedure. We are going to impose upon the people of this country a certain financial burden.  It may be very good business to impose that burden, because the expenditure of that money would have such advantages that it would more than obliterate the consideration of the financial burden put on the people, but I do think we ought to have some general idea&mdash;it need not be too detailed&mdash;as to what we are imposing on the people that we can relate to the value of the service we are getting.</P>

      <P>On Section 3, am I to understand, in relation to the question of cost, that the Minister has power to see that agreements will be concluded between sanitary authorities so as to provide not only for the most effective but for the most economic operation of fire-fighting services?  One of the things the Parliamentary Secretary announced just now, in what the Chair <Col N="806" /> indicated was a rather disorderly discussion, was that the cost of the services to local bodies would depend upon the agreements made.  Does he take power here&mdash;and, if not, is there power anywhere else in the Bill&mdash;to see that there will not be a multiplicity of small services instead of a reasonably good service in an area not too big?</P>

      <P>Might I submit that, as we are discussing the way in which sanitary authorities are to arrange between themselves, we might be able, at least, to explore avenues for suitable co-operation amongst these authorities, and even to go so far as to ask whether the Minister ought not to have some power in this regard?  Senator Mrs. Concannon referred to the position in the Border counties.  When I was speaking of Border counties, I was thinking of a case such as Senator Goulding mentioned, in which Cork and Waterford would be interested.  Take Roscrea as another example, or Clonmel. Clonmel might have a fire brigade of its own, but the fire brigade for the county might be in Nenagh.  If Clonmel has not got a fire brigade of its own, it is nearer to Waterford than anywhere else.  I am not a member of a local body, and I do not know what the outlook is for a member who may be anxious to localise the position. There may be power in the general Local Government Acts, which would enable the Minister to make certain suggestions, at any rate, to the local bodies on this point.</P>

      <P>Although I may not be strictly within the rules of order, might I be permitted to raise one point, even if I have to depart from the rules of order?  I asked the Minister on whom the responsibility rested for the enforcement of the Act.  If it has to be enforced this year I think some consideration should be given to the fact that the estimates of local bodies have been already considered and finally determined.  The sanitary authority in my county would be the board of health, and there we have to face an increase in the estimate of £54,000. Since the Minister has not given any clear indication as to the financial commitments which will be imposed on my county, I want to know if this Act is to be enforced this year.  We do not know what are the financial commitments which will be imposed on each board, and I wanted to get some information on that point.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I can give any further explanation than I have already given.  Senator Hayes has in mind the possibility where A might desire to enter into agreement with B, and B might decline to enter such agreement.  B might in fact, from a geographical or other standpoint, be the best sanitary authority with which A could enter into such agreement.  The Senator wants to know could the Minister intervene at that stage.  If B declines to enter into agreement with A, A appeals to the Minister.  The Minister could at that stage, having examined all the circumstances, suggest that A should enter into agreement with C, and a more suitable arrangement could be made in that way.

It seems to me that he should take power to approach the other sanitary authority himself.  Of course, he has power to make the suggestion, but he has not power to make the first sanitary authority approach any other one, and I think he should have that power.</P>

      <P>I think he has that power even within Section 2.  In Section 2 a sanitary authority is under a statutory obligation to make reasonable provision.  The question of what is, in fact, reasonable provision has ultimately to be determined by the Minister.  If a sanitary authority sets out to make an arrangement that is <Col N="810" /> not a desirable arrangement, or is not a reasonable provision the Minister will say: &ldquo;You must proceed in another direction.&rdquo;</P>

I am a believer in the old saying that prevention is better than cure, and I should like to have definitely inserted <Col N="812" /> in the Bill a provision that the person who will be the authorised officer, for purposes of inspection, shall be a fully qualified person.  If we are to have a number of small fire brigades throughout the country, it is quite possible that the officer in charge of a brigade may be a man who, while being very efficient as an officer, may not have the necessary experience of inspection work, and may not be able to suggest to the people whose premises are being inspected the alterations that would put them in proper condition and obviate the danger of fire.  I suggest that the section should be amended to provide that the person appointed will be an engineer, because I think it very important that the man selected for this purpose should be fully qualified.</P>

I quite appreciate the point made by the Senator, but the sanitary authorities have at their disposal already, for consultation purposes, an engineering staff, and if the sanitary authority, as the fire brigade authority, require any technical advice in the operation of this measure, it will be available without the necessity of specifying that only such and such a person with such and such qaulifications can be appointed as authorised officer.  It is assumed, as it has been assumed in the case of many other measures, that sanitary authorities will exercise a sense of responsibility and will only appoint an authorised officer who is competent to discharge the duties which will fall to be discharged under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There are pretty extensive powers of pulling down buildings which are not necessarily on fire but the pulling down of which is considered necessary in order to deal with the original fire.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary is quite satisfied that that would not affect insurance, that is to say, if a building is not on fire but is pulled down in the belief <Col N="813" /> that it is necessary to pull it down in order to extinguish the original fire, is there any danger that an insurance company would say that that did not come under the heading of fire?  If a building is partly affected by water, an insurance company generally recognises that to be the same as fire.  I have had actual experience of that myself, but there is just a doubt, and I should like an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will look into the matter and see that it is covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the section to add the words:&mdash;&ldquo;The conditions of employment shall provide that officers and servants employed under this section shall undertake not to withhold their services because of a dispute until at least two months after such dispute shall have been submitted to the Minister for his advice by the sanitary authority and it shall be obligatory on a sanitary authority to <Col N="814" /> so submit any dispute on the request in writing of not less than one-third of the employees in any fire brigade under its control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section provides that the power of engaging the personnel of local fire brigades is left to the sanitary authority, and it seemed to me, in view of certain events which have taken place in our recent experience, it was highly desirable that some provision of a reasonable character should be made to prevent hasty strikes.  I think it was probably a matter of very considerable surprise to most people that it was legally possible for a fire brigade to go on strike, and it is not at all clear to me why, if it is illegal for civil servants and for the Army to go on strike, a body such as a fire brigade, which may be vital not only to property but also to life, should be in a position to leave a city like Dublin, as did happen for some time, with a skeleton fire brigade.  The amendment I move, and which I hope will be accepted, does not go so far as to make a strike by a fire brigade ultimately illegal.  Apparently the position at present is that it is legal, and I am not proposing that we should take that right from them, at any rate until we are quite clear that there is no other way out that would not be subject to abuse.</P>
    <P>The essence of the amendment is to provide that the conditions under which men shall be recruited for a fire brigade will provide an undertaking by them that they will not go on strike until at least two months after the sanitary authority has submitted the matter of dispute to the Minister, and the Minister has been given an opportunity to suggest a way out.  That is a moderate proposal, and one which I think ought to be accepted.  The one thing I feel sure of is that the public would expect us, when a Bill of this kind is before us, to endeavour to profit by experience and to make some such provision. I do not think it needs very much argument. The case is clear to us all, and I suggest that my amendment is reasonable, though I am not in any way tied to the words of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  I raised the point on the Second Reading and I <Col N="815" /> think it of the greatest importance, because two of the outstanding principles for the prosperity of a country are the preservation of peace and the preservation of property.  I think that something on the lines of Senator Douglas's suggestion is the only way to ensure it.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this amendment should come before the House at present.  I have been speaking to a number of my colleagues and we are in sympathy with the amendment up to a certain point.  I think it would be worth while, for the sake of unanimity, if Senator Douglas would withdraw his amendment and re-submit it in altered form on the Report Stage. We realise the importance of having a fire brigade which can be relied upon, in the case of fire, to do their duty; at the same time, we recognise that fire brigade men have certain rights as well as responsibilities, and an allowance of time, say, a month or two, to adjust any legitimate grievance they may have does not seem excessive to us.  In view of that, I think that if the Senator withdrew his amendment now he would get unanimity on it on Report Stage as far as the words &ldquo;sanitary authority&rdquo;.  To that extent it is quite acceptable to our people, but the remainder would, I think, lead to complications and misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>At any rate, I think he admits that the amendment was rather hurriedly drawn up, and perhaps an amendment might be prepared and submitted in the meantime which would eliminate all recriminations or references to the situation existing in the City of Dublin at the present time.  If the Senator would agree to re-submit an amendment on these lines for the Report Stage, I think it would be worth while to do so.</P>

      <P>I would ask Senator Douglas to agree to the proposal that has been made because I understand from what Senator Foran has just said that he has no objection to the principle involved here.  I can quite see the Senator's objection to this particular case being discussed at length in the <Col N="816" /> special circumstances existing at the moment, although it is because of these existing circumstances that this has arisen.  However, I take it that this matter will not be finished to-day and that the Bill is not a matter of urgency, and I feel that if an amendment of this kind were to be passed unanimously and with the support of Senator Foran and his friends it would be of much greater value than any other type of amendment which would not receive such unanimous support.  I suggest that the putting down of this amendment has already done a great deal of good and that, if it is only a question of the wording of the amendment, this particular amendment should be postponed to the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, Sir, I believe that if such a principle is to be adopted by the Government or by this House, it ought to have uniform application to the essential public services, <Col N="817" /> and to my mind the essential service of maintaining a water supply is of even greater importance, and considerably greater importance inasmuch as a supply of water is essential to all members of our community, rich and poor, and a fire fighting service cannot be maintained if a water supply is not available.  Consequently, I want to put to the House the viewpoint that, while the whole principle behind this amendment is one that ought to be examined&mdash;and it is a very important matter&mdash;it ought not to be examined in a piecemeal manner.  It ought to be examined in relation to the entire problem of the sudden dislocation of essential public services.  The matter of trade and labour disputes is not in my particular sphere.  It is a matter for the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it seems to me to be perfectly obvious that I should withdraw this amendment with the permission of the House, but I want to make it clear that I hope to submit another amendment, if possible, in agreement with Senator Foran's suggestion, and I should be very much surprised if I should not be able to do so.  In the meantime, I would urge the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary not to adopt hastily the line the Parliamentary Secretary is now taking.  At the moment it would appear that we have one particular problem on which there is a possibility of a measure of agreement between people who do not by any means always agree, and the basis of that agreement is a recognition&mdash;if I <Col N="818" /> understand Senator Foran rightly&mdash;of a duty to the public on the one hand and, on the other hand, and on my part at any rate, not to remove certain rights that have been recognised.  If the Government intend to deal with a similar principle in relation to a water supply, they will certainly have my blessing, and the sooner the better, but there are many other matters, and water is not the only one.  I hope that I shall be able to deal later on&mdash;possibly to-day&mdash;with the principle involved in some of the matters raised by the Parliamentary Secretary, but I think that when we have a Bill on which such a matter as this can be dealt with, we should deal with it and should be allowed to deal with it.  If and when a general Bill is introduced later, and if that Bill is in a form which will supersede any section of this Bill, it is the simplest possible thing to put in a provision that the particular part of the section is amended accordingly. Where I differ with the Parliamentary Secretary is that I think it is a wrong attitude of the Government to say that, when an amendment is proposed, on the principle of which there is agreement, nothing can be done until you have time to think out all the problems involved.  I think that is a mistake. However, if the House agrees, I propose to withdraw this amendment with a view to introducing another amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This seems to be a rather dangerous paragraph.  As Senators will see at the end of it, the money borrowed under these borrowing powers is not to be reckoned as being part of the debt of such authority for the purpose of any limitation on borrowing imposed by the former Acts. We know that the situation existing in a great many counties at present is that they have borrowed almost to the limit of the legal provision, and as, during the last few months the cost of living has gone up very considerably&mdash;<Col N="819" /> and is likely to go up a great deal more &mdash;they have, in actual fact in relation to the banks and to their security, borrowed a good deal beyond their assets.  Over and above that, a great many of them have got heavy overdrafts, and the increased cost of living has meant large arrears of rates, a great deal of which will become entirely unrecoverable under present circumstances.  It seems to me, therefore, to be very dangerous to extend the present powers which the county councils and sanitary authorities have for borrowing money, and so put the payments for new things of this class on the long finger.</P>

      <P>Senator the McGillycuddy apparently has missed the same principle in Bills which have been before the House.  Perhaps I am wrong in that but, at any rate, the same principle has been incorporated in other measures passed through the House, and I understand that so far it has escaped. The position that the section is intended to safeguard is the case where a sanitary authority had already reached the limit of its borrowing powers, and had not made any provision for a fire-fighting service.  It is probable that such instances will be few, but the House will agree that a case might arise where it may be very desirable to provide a fire-fighting service in an area and, if the sanitary authority cannot borrow for the purpose because of the fact that its borrowing powers have already been exhausted, then a fire-fighting service cannot be provided.  The fact that such a provision is made does not mean that a large proportion of our sanitary authorities are on the verge of bankruptcy or have exhausted their borrowing powers.  That is not the case, but I do think it is desirable that such a provision should be incorporated in the Bill, and we may all join in the hope that it will not be necessary to avail of it.</P>

      <P>The particular point I wish to raise now has not been discussed.  This means additional expenditure and additional rates, and there is a point as to who could possibly benefit from these services. Obviously, it is the people living in the towns and in the big villages where there is a water supply who can definitely benefit, but thousands of farmers &mdash;big and small&mdash;who have not got water appliances of any sort or kind may not benefit; yet, under the general provisions in this Bill, they will have to foot the bill and the incidence will come on them exactly as it will on the others. In the case of various sanitary authorities, there are going to be very different circumstances, owing to their geographical position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the incidence is going to be very different in many cases owing to the rateable value of the different authorities&mdash;as we know, they vary all over the country from 5/- to 22/- &mdash;and some consideration should have been given to this matter with a view to making a grant from a Government fund where this cost is going to be pressed on the sanitary authority.  I do not for a moment say that, if we can afford it, it is not desirable there should be some form of fire appliances, but I think this is a very big point which should be considered.  In the case of the fire brigade, where only certain people can possibly benefit, the <Col N="821" /> principle of the imposition of a general rate is quite a different thing to where it is a question of roads or hospitals or medical services and, therefore, I think a different procedure should be adopted and a grant should be given in certain circumstances, where the cost is going to be excessive, from the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>Fires occur in rural districts as well as in urban districts, and cases might occur where the services of the fire organisation would be needed to put out a fire in a farmer's premises.  Haystacks have been known to go on fire and very often they, and also farm buildings, cannot be saved because no fire fighting apparatus is available anywhere in the neighbourhood. Those of us who come mainly from rural districts are always facing the opposition from the farming section of the people because they are taxed for the supply and support of an amenity that is only of use in the urban areas.  Unfortunately, when you have to provide these things, you cannot confine the taxation to the smaller towns and villages only; you have to make it a county service and then it is available for the large farmer as well as for the urban dweller.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation seems to have changed somewhat recently.  I cannot visualise any small town which has an urban authority having a fire fighting appliance at all.  That is a reply to Senator The McGillycuddy. The county authority or the county council will not be responsible so much at all, but, fortunately for themselves, the urban authority and the sanitary authority will have to establish these fire brigades.  I was troubled originally regarding the expense of the matter.</P>
      <P>I can visualise, in our own town or any town like it, that you can possibly afford to have only what you may call a voluntary fire brigade there with a sanitary officer as leader.  He is in charge of the waterworks and would, I suppose, have the borough surveyor as technical adviser.  Even a voluntary force of that kind will call for some expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I had in mind was the question of providing for cases where there may be personal loss such as that <Col N="822" /> which I mentioned earlier.  I have known voluntary fire brigade men to lose their clothes or render them entirely useless for the future.  Possibly, an accident may occur.  What provision has been made for that sort of thing?  I was anxious to find that out, as somebody must be made responsible. Even though a man may be only a voluntary fireman, if he should lose his life or become seriously injured or damage his clothing during the course of a fire, somebody has to be responsible for him, as well as for his personal loss without injury.  But I can see at once that it is on the urban authorities much more than the sanitary authority of the county board of health that the great responsibility will fall.  Perhaps the smaller towns will arrange with the urban authorities for the use of fire brigades.  A little clarification is needed as to how the expense is to be met.  That is the only point I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Stage of this Bill is going to be postponed until after Easter.  Would it not be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary, before he replies, to make investigations on the two points that have been raised, namely, by a calculation of county by county to arrive at a maximum figure which will not be exceeded as the total cost to local bodies, and also to see whether he has sufficient powers in the Bill to ensure that, by a certain combination of local authorities, where that is thought proper, the expense will be reduced and, of course, at the same time, possibly, the efficiency increased.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make investigations on these two points&mdash; the maximum cost, and whether there is sufficient power in the Bill to ensure that there will be both economy and efficiency where there are overlapping authorities or borders that do not correspond with what would normally be described as proper areas for a fire fighting force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some confusion of thought regarding this particular section and, in fact, I think <Col N="823" /> regarding the entire Bill.  I do not know if I am right in assuming that some Senators appear to be under the impression that the initiative will rest largely with the rural sanitary authority.  In my opinion, the rural sanitary authority will incur very little expenditure under this Bill.  The normal development would be that the town that is best situated geographically and that has at present the best fire fighting service already established will become the hub of the fire fighting service of that county.  As I said at an early stage in the debate, one efficient fire fighting service in a county may be found to meet the full requirements, and the obligations of the sanitary authorities in the smaller towns and villages and in the rural areas will be met by entering into an agreement with the sanitary authority that has equipped and is maintaining an efficient fire fighting service.  Where it will be possible to have such agreements in any area where an efficient fire fighting service can be got within a reasonable distance&mdash;such agreements will be undoubtedly possible&mdash; the cost to a neighbouring sanitary authority of securing the use of that fire fighting service will be exceedingly small, comparatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it was Senator The McGillycuddy who suggested that because of the fact that a water supply will not be available in a rural area, rural sanitary authorities or, at least, the people living in a rural area will derive very little benefit under the terms of this Bill.  I do not agree with him in that, mainly for this reason, that there is something more at stake in fire fighting than merely turning on the hose.  The fact that skilled fire fighters will be available for rescue work and for controlling the outbreak is, to my mind, an important feature of the Bill.  It is true that in most rural areas an adequate water supply will not be available, but it is at least equally true to say that the availability of an efficient and trained fire fighting machine will be a great asset and protection to people living in a rural area and, I think, would be well worth what it would cost.  But, normally, the rural <Col N="824" /> area will be served by the urban area by virtue of an agreement entered into between the two sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of loss of life and personal loss by persons engaged in fire fighting.  I think the loss of life or personal injury would be covered under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  It will be open to sanitary authorities to make provision in their schemes for personal loss such as damage to clothing and the other matters that the Senator mentioned.</P>
    <P>I think I have already dealt with the points again raised by Senator Hayes.  The general purpose of the Bill is to secure co-ordination, reduction of costs and a more efficient service, if it can be done.  I think that that degree of co-ordination that might appear at the moment to be almost impossible will be rendered not only possible but easy of development under the managerial system because the county manager will be the chief executive officer of all the sanitary authorities within his county.  So that I think we will get the co-ordination in that way that on the face of it would appear difficult to get otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary has not quite convinced me on the question of the general charge.  I give a concrete case of a farmer living a distance from the town, with a haystack and a thatched roof quite close to each other, and the wind blowing in the direction of the house.  He has very little chance if his hay catches fire.  He has got to get a horse and trap to go in for the fire engine, or whatever appliance there is there.  That man is going to pay probably more towards the cost of this scheme, according to his valuation, than the man in the town with the hydrant opposite him, whose fire can be put out at once.  Time is an enormous factor.  I am not convinced, therefore, that the man who is a distance from the main hydrant and from quick assistance should pay on the same basis as the man in the town who is quite close to it.  I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider the matter to some extent, and have a smaller charge for the <Col N="825" /> people outside a certain distance from the central organisation.  That is a point I want to make about it.</P>

      <P>Might I say, in further explanation to Senator The McGillycuddy, that the man in the rural area will not, in fact, pay the same as the man in the urban area, because the rural area normally will not be maintaining a fire-fighting service.  The urban area will, but the rural sanitary authority, by virtue of agreement with the urban area, will have the use of the fire-fighting service in the urban district, and the rate will be comparatively small in the rural area for the use of the service as compared with the rate on the urban area, where the service has to be built up, established and maintained.  In fact, in one area such an arrangement already operates in Cork, where the rural sanitary authority has entered into an agreement with a neighbouring urban authority, and the cost on the rural authority is, I think, three-twentieths of a penny in the £.  At any rate, it is small, as compared with the cost on the urban area.</P>

There is a good deal of misapprehension through ignorance in this country as to the status of officers.  My experience, hitherto, always has been that no officer is entitled to ask for a court-martial on his conduct, and that he can only have a court of inquiry on his conduct in other countries by permission of the Minister for Defence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the natural order of things that an Opposition when debating any matters are, if you like, at a certain disadvantage. Senator McEllin last week, speaking in reference to the Taoiseach's power to deal with Ministers, said that the Minister was more brainy than I am. I am not exactly agreeing with that, <Col N="828" /> but, if it amounts to anything, I quite agree that the Minister has more sources of information at his disposal. The caretaker of the British Museum Library has enormous means of knowing almost everything, but I am afraid that he does not avail himself of the opportunity thus afforded him.  While the Minister feels, as he says, bound by certain conclusions that may be arrived at, the Minister may bring out certain information not hitherto known showing a thing in a completely different light.  Senator McEllin talks about my slashing at the Government, but I was guilty of nothing of the sort.  I quite realise that a representative of the Government closely in touch with the relevant facts may be able to throw a light on an incident which would completely vitiate the criticisms put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this matter, it does not matter what I said.  One can really judge by the defence put up.  I think, looking over the debate of last week, that the condemnation of the present control of the Army comes from the defence put up for it.  I shall take one or two things mentioned in the debate. I do not know how far Senator McEllin can be considered a representative of the Government but he seems to misrepresent practically everything. He says that I went on the line of slashing the Government because some ammunition was stolen and that I said that Ministers were solely responsible. I think the other Senator&mdash;&ldquo;cúpla focal a rá agam&rdquo;, Senator Healy&mdash;also suggested that I based everything I said about the Army on the fact that there had been a raid on the Magazine Fort. I did nothing of the sort.  What I said last week I stated practically in all its details a month or two before the Magazine Fort was raided.  The significance in relation to what I did say of the Magazine Fort raid was that it came along, perhaps I should not say as a most unfortunate proof, because a single item does not prove anything, but rather as a confirmation or as giving greater stress to what I had stated.  I had stated a month or two before the Magazine Fort raid took place that I understood that the general discipline of the Army had <Col N="829" /> disimproved.  What Senator McEllin said did not advert to the case I made, or to the facts which I cited, one of which was the infiltration into the Army of Reservists.  The Minister said that I did not know what I was talking about as a reservist was no longer able to resign on giving seven days' notice.  I am quite aware of that but what I do not understand is why a higher standard of discipline should be expected from men who could resign on seven days' notice.  Remember that was Ministerial policy.  That was not the independent policy of any individual officer or of any individual section. It was general Governmental policy.</P>
    <P>These reservists were formed, and it is in the natural order of things that when men&mdash;and the Minister admitted this&mdash;can resign on seven days' notice, we cannot expect that the same discipline will apply as in the case of men attested for a number of years, where you are guaranteed their services after they have been properly trained. These men were suddenly brought into the Army, and the Minister agrees that, in certain cases, they were actually infiltrated into existing formations. Apart from that, when you have men who have been in an organisation under relaxed discipline in the same barracks with men who have a more rigid and more perfect discipline, it is very hard to maintain that perfect discipline of men who have been trained for it with other men who have not had that discipline demanded of them.  The Minister even agreed as far as the Magazine Fort was concerned.  The Magazine Fort affair was, strictly speaking, irrelevant.  It was merely a horrible example which turned up after I had spoken, to give some force to what I had said.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllin suggested that, when I was Minister for Defence, I would have had to refer to officials in any matter of detail.  There is an element of truth in that, but I must say that the general criticism of my regime in Defence was that I butted in far too much, and was too much in control of details.  The Minister came along rather heavily and suggested that I was advancing into the sere and yellow stage.  He said that, according to me, <Col N="830" /> a Utopia existed when I was in full control of the Army, and that it had never existed since.  I suggested nothing of the sort.  Quite obviously, when I was Minister for Defence, I sent inspection staffs down the country and these staffs reported to me.  Very often their reports indicated a great lack of perfection.  My argument was that at a time when the Army cost £1,170,000 there was a certain degree of discipline, but one did not sit back and say: &ldquo;That is perfect.  There is nothing more to be done.&rdquo;  To begin with, discipline does not just stay where it is.  It has to be maintained. The Minister said that that was the strain of what I had to say.  It was nothing of the sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is not implying that that does not occur still?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I quite agree that it occurs still, but it does not occur enough, as I think has been illustrated. I think it was the general control of the Army which tended to bring about the decay in discipline.  I am not criticising the bringing in of these men when you had them as separate formations, as it might have been desirable at that time, but you should not suddenly bring these men in, as the Government seemed to do, in panic at the same time as they began digging up Mountjoy Square, with this sudden mobilisation which, to my mind, was doing harm to the Army and costing an enormous amount of the taxpayer's money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that a Volunteer in the early days had the right to resign, if he so desired, and that they had found certain weaknesses in the operation of that regulation.  I think that was foreseeable, and I am not blaming him for the fact that there were weaknesses. What I am criticising is the fact that these men were suddenly brought in and infiltrated into existing formations when commonsense says that the effect would be a general disimprovement in the Army.  I do not believe that we got any strengthening of the Army in numbers or general quality, and the bringing in of those men put enormous additional cost on <Col N="831" /> this country.  The effect of bringing them in, as I have maintained already &mdash;and no attempt has been made to deal with the case I made&mdash;merely diminished the aptness and suitability of the Army.  That was the case I made and, if that was so, it does appear to me that officers in the Army, working under Ministerial control, have to accept the Ministerial policy, and that that Ministerial policy was the root cause of the disimprovement in the Army.</P>
    <P>That was the case I made, and no attempt whatever was made to meet it. The Minister tried to reply by saying that this infiltration did not take place in every case.  I was dealing with the Army at a given time, costing a certain amount and having a certain degree of perfection or imperfection, and comparing that with the Army at a later stage, costing an enormously larger sum, and having, as I think, a lesser degree of perfection and a greater degree of imperfection, and that seems to me to be rather a crime against the people of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that a great many of the Senators on the other side seem to think that Parliamentary institutions in this country should be abolished, and I am not saying that I am against that.  I am not saying that I do not think there is a lot to be said for it, but so long as the Constitution and the Government of this country maintain the order we have at present &mdash;the Fianna Fáil Senators have not themselves the power of completely abolishing the institutions in this country&mdash;I am acting under the Parliamentary procedure permitted in this country, and even if what I say gets <Col N="832" /> under the skin of a Fianna Fáil partisan now and again, it is one of the things that they have to suffer.  But do not take me as upholding the order which we have here at present.  While it is here, however, we must work it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Magazine Fort affair, coming more than a month after the statement I made here, there was a case of infiltration, and there it was demonstrated that there was a lack of discipline, and the Minister did receive from me a warning of that situation a long time before that.  He then comes along to justify the raid on the Magazine by the statement that when I was in charge, Mountjoy Prison was raided.  My direct association with Mountjoy was merely to be an inmate there.  It was never actually under my charge, but nevertheless I recognise that every Minister has joint responsibility with every other Minister.  The Minister is unable to give me the date, and it makes it rather difficult to deal with it; but I do not think it happened while I was Minister for Defence.  The Minister could have done much better. He could have referred to the fact that in October, 1922, the prisoners in Mountjoy had guns and land mines, that they murdered two of the officers in Mountjoy, and that one of them was shot.  He could possibly show that the Army to-day has quite a number of virtues which were not so pre-eminent in it in 1922.</P>
      <P>I quite agree, but the situation then was quite different.  We had to put an army together very hurriedly to fight a rebellion in this country and the Minister inherited from us an Army not by any means perfect, an Army which was possibly costing a little more than it should cost, but the whole movement of the cost of which was towards reduction, and an Army whose discipline was not absolutely spotless; but one would expect that, with the intervening years, as the Army got further away from its rather chaotic beginnings, the movement would have been towards improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as I say, could have done much better by going back to 1922, and I could help him there in <Col N="833" /> a very considerable criticism.  There had been an advance, however, in economy, an advance in discipline and an advance in efficiency from 1922 to 1932.  In 1932 the present Government took charge.  I would not feel quite so qualified to criticise if, instead of reducing the cost of the Army as they inherited it, and as I think would have happened if they had not come into power, they had failed to decrease the cost or even increased it, even up to about £1,500,000&mdash;because there might be times, one year more than another, when war-like stores had to be purchased&mdash;I would not feel so qualified to criticise, as I say, if there had been any increase in the efficiency and the discipline of the Army.  My argument is that the cost of the Army has gone up and that its efficiency and discipline have gone down.  In 1927&mdash;I think the Minister is probably wrong in his year, because it certainly was not until after September, 1927, when I took charge of the Army, and my memory is pretty good&mdash;if the Army were in charge at Mountjoy when that incident happened and I were the Minister, there would be an inquiry, court-martial, and so on, which I would have been quite aware of.  The cost of the Army in 1927 was a lot more than the figure I gave of £170,000, but from 1927 to 1932 the cost of the Army diminished while the discipline and effectiveness of the Army increased.</P>
    <P>Now, it is a tremendous asset for anybody to be able to think clearly, but it would seem that nobody can discuss things intelligently with the people opposite, because they have not the intelligence to see the value of things.  The Minister says that he does not think I had any more dictatorial power than he has.  Well, the Minister has been only a short time in charge of the Army, and I shall not criticise him. I admit I did use the powers that I had and used them to the maximum to which they could be used in the circumstances of the time, but then we have Senator McEllin, with that sort of &ldquo;yahoo-ism&rdquo; which is so painful and so painfully common in this country, saying that we were occupied at that time with attending garden parties and wearing top-hats.  Now, that is the sort of dope that is put out by yahoos <Col N="834" /> for yahoos.  According to the Senator, we were preoccupied most of the time with wearing top-hats and attending garden parties and so on.  Very well, that is what the Senator says, but in the spare time that we had between those preoccupations we were able to build up an Army from nothing and to train it, equip it and make it efficient. It cost a lot of money but, wherever we could economise in the people's interests, we did so.</P>
    <P>At any rate we built up that Army and had it in good condition when the present Government took over office.  The Minister himself admits that they inherited from us a well-trained, loyal and efficient Army, but a lot of ignorant yahoos now say that we went around during that period doing nothing but attending garden parties and wearing top-hats.</P>
    <P>Apparently the members of the Government Party have some sort of idea now of dodging the wearing of top-hats where the Irish people could see them.  At any rate, however, when the Government came into office they had that machine there ready to their hands, but what did they do with it? They multiplied the cost of the Army by five or thereabouts, and at the same time they disimproved the Army.  Yet, when one gets up here and makes a reasoned case&mdash;in answer to which, I quite admit, there might be some new light thrown by the Government which might completely negative the criticism put forward, and we recognise that&mdash; what sort of reply do we get?  We get a most ignorant reply which dodges every point that has been made and which practically confirms even the arguments that were put forward.  That is done both by Fianna Fáil Senators and by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>In 1931 we introduced a Bill, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said a month or so ago in the Seanad, which was necessary then.  As a result of that Bill, from the time of its introduction until we went out of office, there was not a whimper out of the I.R.A.  When the new Government came into power, almost their very first act was to let out the blackguards who were in jail&mdash;to let out the enemies of this country and the enemies of the <Col N="835" /> people of this country.  I think that, as a result of that appallingly bad policy of the Government&mdash;of course, I cannot prove that it was the direct result of it &mdash;a number of unfortunate people have been murdered in this country.  From the time that we took these special powers until this Government took over office there was not a whimper out of the I.R.A., but they were taking the line completely of trying to save themselves. Then, however, the present Government came along and allowed these people out of jail and things went from bad to worse.  They did not go from bad to worse in a straight line, but whenever the I.R.A. got more active than usual the Government took a certain line, and then the I.R.A. knew that they would only have to lie quiet for a time until the Government would say: &ldquo;Everything is peaceful now&rdquo;, and then they could get going again.</P>
    <P>At any rate, that was the position when we handed over in 1932.  I heard people saying at the time of the 1932 election that the result of the election might mean a civil war, but I assured these people that that would not be so, because at that time we had a disciplined force and had abolished the anarchy of early 1922 and 1923, and that if anybody wanted to bring about civil war in this country we had a disciplined and well-trained force to deal with such people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Appropriately enough, we have come to the consideration of this Bill from a discussion of the Fire Brigades Bill.  I used the word &ldquo;appropriately&rdquo; because, just as the Fire Brigades Bill had for its purpose the provision of protection of the lives and property of the citizens of this country, so this Defence Forces Bill has for its purpose the provision of a well-trained, well-armed, well-disciplined, loyal and efficient armed force to protect the citizens of this country, to protect their lives, their liberty and their neutrality, which they have declared and which is the greatest proof of their liberty, against the danger of being involved in the conflagration which has spread over so many countries.  It must be remembered that the war is very near to us, and much nearer us than Senator Fitzgerald would seem to think, since six of our counties are occupied by the forces of one belligerent.  Therefore it is necessary for us to have a well-trained, well-equipped, disciplined and loyal Army, and it is because this Bill provides for that, that it is the subject of such intense interest at this particular moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason we come to the discussion of this Bill with a grave sense of responsibility, but that responsibility does not only derive from this realisation of the dangers to our country that are inherent in the present condition of world affairs.  It ought to arise, and it should arise every year, when we are discussing this Bill, from a realisation of our duties&mdash; duties to the Army and duties that we assumed, tacitly at least, when we accepted the honour of membership of the Seanad.  I would remind Senators that, under Article 15 of the Constitution, the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas&mdash;Dáil <Col N="837" /> Eireann and Seanad Eireann&mdash;and no military or armed forces other than the military or armed forces raised and maintained by the Oireachtas shall be raised and maintained for any purpose whatsoever.  From the point of view of our responsibility that is a very important thing, and we ought to study it and take its lessons to heart.</P>

We ought to regard these things with care and conviction.</P>

      <P>In this connection, I was very glad to hear the tribute paid to the young officers of the Volunteers who recently got commissions. That tribute was paid by Senator Quirke and by some other Senators. I am particularly interested in that, as a great many of these young officers, I am proud to say, belong to the Regiment of Pearse, which is largely recruited from the young men of the Universities.  I speak, therefore, I am sure, with the same mind as every University representative in this House when I say that we are proud of that tribute, and that we are proud to see the close connection between the University and the Army.  We have very great regard for both of them.  As a representative of the National University, and speaking, I am sure, for the sister University of Dublin, I would like to say that we are very proud of these young men and very grateful to those who, in a critical hour of the nation's history, came forward in a sense of patriotism to give their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> In speaking of that I would like to mention a point which I have very much at heart.  Everybody recognises that the gallant fight made by the Finns was largely due to the high standard of education in that country. I am afraid we all have to admit that, compared with them and with other countries, our standard of education is very low.  I see in the Army, a great instrument for good; we have educational facilities in the Army, and I would like that the Minister should pay particular attention to that as the best thing we could have in this country is well trained young men, men with character, men with discipline, men who are well trained, who are good, hard-working young men.  In the Army, if it is properly directed&mdash;and I am sure that it is&mdash;those men will get the chance to develop themselves, and they will come out of the Army better Irishmen, better citizens and better men.</P>

She might also have said that we are, in a military sense, especially in a naval sense, almost at the mercy&mdash;in fact, as much at the mercy as one nation can be at the mercy of another&mdash;of one of the belligerents and that we depend upon their goodwill for the obtaining of the supplies we need for our daily life.</P>

Therefore, it would be very foolish for any of us to consider this country as unconcerned in the conflict going on, even if we assume that there are no questions of right and wrong to be considered, that there are no ideals involved.  What caused me to rise for one moment was not in order to say that, but to say something else.</P>
      <P>I share very keenly the annoyance expressed by Senator Fitzgerald at the kind of boorish insult which was sprung at his head the other day by Senator McEllin, on the subject of top hats and garden parties.  I hope to heaven that we will be able to keep as far away from that sort of thing as we can from the reminiscences of 1921-1922.  I do feel that there is a certain amount of justification for the irritation that has been felt by some Senators at the sweeping attacks which have been made on the discipline of our Army, attacks which have been unsupported by evidence.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that we should have to fall back on repetition of the debate on this measure on the last occasion, in order to provide political propaganda for the Opposition. That is what it amounts to.  On the last day we had speeches made here which had a very bad effect on the country and which were badly received. They did not deceive anybody; the average thinking citizen knew well that the speeches of the Opposition on the last day were designed for one purpose &mdash;that of trying to create unrest and <Col N="840" /> doubt in the minds of the people as to the actual position.  Unfortunately, I was not here for all of Senator Fitzgerald's speech, but I heard enough of it to know what he was driving at.  He said: &ldquo;That was the position when we handed over.&rdquo;  We are asked to believe that, when the Fine Gael&mdash;or the Cumann na nGaedheal, as they were then&mdash;Government handed over, everything was going like clockwork in the Army.</P>

      <P>Nothing of the sort.  I accept his apology.  At any rate, he said that the Army has deteriorated since the Fianna Fáil Government came into power, and suggests that, if Fine Gael had remained in power during that period, everything would still be all right.  He tried to put up, as proof of his theory, that because the Magazine Fort raid was really possible, everything was wrong, and that no such thing could happen during their time at all.  I am not trying to minimise the seriousness of that raid, but I say that similar things have happened in every Army and, in fact, more serious things have happened during the regime of the previous Government. As I say, I do not want to minimise the thing at all&mdash;it was very serious and it was very regrettable, and it is something which every responsible person in the country should deplore&mdash;but when the previous Government were in office and when they were on a war footing, similar things happened all over the country.  I myself was responsible for one incident&mdash;I am sure Senator Fitzgerald will remember it&mdash;on the borders of Kilkenny and Tipperary, where I was able to walk up personally and capture three of the enemy posts.  By an enemy post I mean one that was under the authority of the previous Government.</P>

I am sure it would suit a lot of people if that were never again discussed, but as long as I am able to talk it will be discussed.  All I say is the sooner the members of the Opposition accept the offer of the Taoiseach to set up a commission to inquire into the causes leading up to the Civil War, the sooner we will have settled conditions in this country.  As long as that situation remains in doubt&mdash;there is no doubt in my mind, and there is no doubt in the minds of the majority of the people &mdash;Senator Hayes laughs&mdash;arguments will be needed to convince.</P>

I say that is not so, and I am pointing out as proof of that fact that certain things happened during the previous Administration. I am glad to see that Senator Hayes and Senator Fitzgerald can take their past responsibilities so lightly, but it is a relief at any rate to find that Senator Desmond Fitzgerald and Senator MacDermot can at least agree on one or two things.  Perhaps if they were to get together and agree to ask for this commission, to inquire into the causes of the Civil War, it would have the desired results.</P>

      <P>The Bill is quite obviously necessary if we are to maintain our present position, and if we are to maintain the very important position of neutrality.  In my opinion, the most recent declaration of our independence was the declaration of our neutrality.  I hold that any statement made which would be detrimental to that neutrality is at the same time detrimental to our independence.  On <Col N="843" /> the last day we were here we had considerable evidence of what has been done by the young volunteer officers, and, I think, rather than discourage these men in the work which they have taken on they should be encouraged in every possible way.  There is no question about the attitude of the country in regard to neutrality, and I believe that we here, as Senators, should do everything we possibly can to maintain neutrality rather than take the opposite line.  We had very unfortunate speeches made in public not very long ago.  I have one of them before me, but I do not think it is necessary to read it. Senator Fitzgerald might like me to read it, but Senator MacDermot might not.  The fact is, in any case, that our neutrality is the most important thing at the moment, and I think it is our duty as Senators to show the example in that way, and do everything we possibly can to make our Army as efficient as it possibly can be made, and to give the young Volunteers every encouragement to do their work as the country expects them to do it, and as they have been doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this matter.  This is a Bill to renew a temporary measure in the absence of a permanent measure for the Army.  Complaint used to be made in the other House that there was great delay in the production of a permanent measure.  I think some complaint was made also in this House to the same effect.  But, as we all change our minds a little, may I confess that I have changed my mind on this matter?  It seems to me, from the point of view of a Senator and the Seanad, that the introduction of this continuing measure every year is a much better thing than the introduction of a permanent Act, because this particular measure gives us an opportunity which we would not otherwise get every year of discussing, if we choose to discuss it, the Army. The Army Estimate, of course, gives that opportunity in the Dáil, but the Estimates are not submitted to us except in the form of a Central Fund Bill which, I suppose, we will have to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> An Army is certainly essential to us, and I agree entirely that we should be proud of it and, for my part, I have always been proud of the national Army and have always had friends in it.  I have never run it down in any degree, and I will not imitate those who have spoken before me by raking up any old sores.  But some people are very recent converts in their admiration of the national Army, very recent converts indeed, and nothing is more disgusting&mdash;although it is relevant&mdash; than the smug unctuousness of the people who get up to praise the Army in 1940 when a very short time ago they were calling them the &ldquo;Green and Tans.&rdquo;  So much for that.</P>
    <P>Our neutrality has been brought into this debate.  I do not think the Army and our neutrality are very much connected. They are about as little connected as our neutrality and our so-called new Constitution.  Our neutrality derived from certain measures taken over a period of years to vindicate our status and to make it clear, as was made clear as long ago as 1925, that in the case of Great Britain being at war, this country&mdash;the Irish Free State, or whatever you like to call it now&mdash;had the right to maintain its neutrality.  Whoever gets the credit&mdash; I do not think it matters very much&mdash; it is a very important fact that we can declare our neutrality, and we ought to take such steps as may be open to us to remain neutral.  I have always praised the Army, as I say, but I am not prepared to praise the Army in the way in which Senator McEllin praised it&mdash;by running down the Guards.  That is a pretty poor method of praising one institution of the State. I agree we ought to learn that you cannot run any State on the basis of any Party attacking the institutions of State.  The fact that the institutions of State have survived and that the Army has survived is of great credit when one considers how much criticism they have had to meet from time to time.</P>
    <P>There is a very considerable difference between a state of war&mdash;whether it is a civil war or otherwise&mdash;and a state of peace.  We are passing here an Army Act; we are giving the Minister <Col N="845" /> continuing scope and authority. Under that Army Act the Minister has certain powers, and he also has certain obligations.  He is empowered, for example, to make a number of defence regulations, and having made those defence regulations, the members of the Forces, officers and men, are bound by them, and so is the Minister.  It appears that quite recently&mdash;and I think this is relevant, because the Seanad has no other opportunity of discussing these matters&mdash;drastic action has been taken against certain commissioned members of the Army without all the requirements of the defence regulations being operated. That, I think, is very undesirable.  I quite understand that discipline is necessary in an Army, and that drastic action may be necessary at times, but whatever action has to be taken should be taken within the law and within the regulations.  Anything that is done outside of that is very reprehensible indeed, and apt to create very bad feeling that there is much better treatment, for example, for Ministers than for officers and soldiers.</P>
    <P>When this war broke out, the Minister who had been in charge of the Army was removed from it.  He was made a Minister without Portfolio. He was not put on half-pay.  He was considered, in a particular situation, to be incompetent to run the Army. He has become Minister without Portfolio, and special legislation was introduced in the other House and here in order to regularise the payment to him of a salary for the doing of nothing in particular.  He has not been placed upon half pay.  His responsibility for a particular situation has not, I presume, been investigated, or, if it has been investigated, there have been no results.  So we have the spectacle of officers dismissed and of officers retired on half pay, and the Minister who is considered unfit to run the Army is put into a position where he has no portfolio, as head of no recognised Department of State.  He is in receipt of a salary of £1,700 a year, plus a car, driver and petrol which in 1937 cost £625.  Now, seeing that a better car has been obtained for Ministers and <Col N="846" /> that petrol is dearer, his car would cost at least £800.  Having been found incompetent to run the Army and having been removed from office, this Minister is still costing the State £2,500, and has no function to perform for practical purposes.  That is different from the treatment meted out summarily, without going over all the conditions of the Act and the regulations made out under the Act, to certain officers of the Army.  I content myself with that.</P>

      <P>I only desire to say, by way of supplementing the remarks I have already made on this Bill, that I cannot entirely agree with Senator Hayes on the question of what might be called a constitution for the Army.  I think, considering that we have been an independent nation for nearly 20 years, it is high time there should be a written constitution for the Army.  Any points <Col N="847" /> that require to be raised can always be brought forward in either House on the motion for the Adjournment or every year on the Estimates.  I do not think a yearly discussion of this type on the Army, a discussion on various officers and men, really serves any good purpose from the point of view of Army discipline, loyalty, or the division of Army officers from political matters.  It gives the politician many opportunities of raising particular cases and bringing before the public several which it is undesirable they should know.  Elsewhere there is a written book of what I would call Army regulations which you can buy at any booksellers and the general public are made fully aware of the conditions under which officers and men join, and serve in the Army.  I think the general public in this country are very ignorant on that subject, and it would be most advisable if some publication were made available which people generally would be able to look up and see, when anything such as these recent occurrences arose, what was the actual law in the matter. When an amendment is required to that Book of Regulations, it is published under the signature of the Minister, after discussion with his council, in the shape of an Army order, and it is added to the volume already published.  I think the suggestions which I have made and which are most essential to the maintenance of discipline in the Army, should have the attention of the Government at the earliest possible moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question I would not have risen to speak at all were it not that I noticed in the Official Reports of the Debates that my name was mentioned when this question of the Army was under discussion on the last day. Senator Fitzgerald, because I said that we ought to look for money and spend money on the Army, and ought to <Col N="848" /> take every step we possibly could to ensure national defence and national security, in a way implied that I stand for inefficiency.  I should like just to assure Senator Fitzgerald that if there is one thing for which I do not stand, it is inefficiency in a man, in a machine or in an organisation if it is at all avoidable.  We are at one on that.  I assure him that I do not believe for one moment in bolstering up inefficiency in the Army or anywhere else. If I felt there was inefficiency in the Army, I would be as severe in criticising the Minister as he himself would be.  The trouble has arisen over the fact that the Government has demanded extra money in connection with the Army.  I am not a military expert, but it seems to me that, in the state of emergency that has arisen, more men, more machines and more equipment of every kind are needed. We have a very long coastline and many important points throughout the country that have to be protected, bridges and so forth.  That certainly calls for a big increase in the personnel of the Army and for extra equipment.  Senator Fitzgerald says that high expenditure does not necessarily imply an efficient Army.  That is quite true, but at the same time I fail to see how without spending money on the Army we would put it into a position to defend all the points that need to be defended.  I do not see how it can be done without extra men and money.</P>
    <P>A lot of criticism has been made of the Volunteer section of the Army.  The only thing I can say about that is that whether or not I was right in doing so, I went so far as to inquire among a few officers&mdash;to be quite precise, two officers&mdash;as to the position of the Volunteer forces.  These men agreed that there were certain difficulties in connection with the Volunteers. Firstly, you cannot expect the system to be as tight, as rigid, or perhaps as efficient, in a short time as in an army which is composed practically of hand picked men.  But as far as these officers are concerned, on the general question of discipline and the quality of the men and so on, they have no complaint to make.  There are isolated <Col N="849" /> cases of difficulties, but on the whole they say that the Volunteer Army comes up to the mark.  That is the only thing I have to say.  It is the general opinion, I think throughout the country, that this particular branch of the Army does not deserve all the hard things or anything like all the hard things, that have been said about it in recent times here.  In regard to the Army itself, shortly after Christmas when we met here, Senator Fitzgerald gave us an account of the conditions in the Army.</P>

      <P>I pay great attention to anything the Senator says about the Army, because he had a long connection with it and great experience of it.  Anything he says about the Army should be listened to, and the same applies to the Minister for Defence.  He is in a position to get information, to form opinions and anything he says must be listened to with great respect.  At that time, I felt very uneasy about the position in the Army because the picture painted by Senator Fitzgerald was not a very happy one and, when I was speaking on that occasion, I suggested that some assurance should be given to the public in regard to the position in the Army and as to its loyalty, discipline and so on.  At that time, the Taoiseach himself spoke on the matter and gave an assurance that there was nothing to worry about in that respect, that the Government was assured of the loyalty of the Army and that its efficiency&mdash; I do not know whether he used these very words, but the implication was there&mdash;was all we might expect.  Here again, in the last few days, statements have been made, just as they were made before Christmas, the effect of which is to make people uneasy.  From the few inquiries I have made, I am satisfied that there is no need for uneasiness and, in view of the statements made, I should like the Minister to give us an assurance&mdash;he will give it in good faith&mdash;that there is no need to worry as to the discipline, quality, effectiveness and loyalty of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> There was one point raised by Senator Concannon which has to do with the Regiment of Pearse.  I am sure that everything she said with regard to the loyalty of these men and their willingness to come forward to serve the country is well deserved, but there is just this I should like to say: that regiment bears a very honoured name and I, for one, should like to see these men, every one of them, bearing themselves more in keeping with the spirit and traditions of the man whose name the regiment bears. In a word, I should like to see that regiment more Irish than it is.  I do not question their loyalty to the State, their bravery, or their willingness to make sacrifices, but I am certainly not satisfied that, as they stand, they are worthy of the name which their regiment bears.</P>

      <P>It is a well-known fact that Mr. Frank Aiken not only did excellent work in the Army, of which the Army itself would give evidence, and, I think, would proudly give evidence, but he did it outside the Army.  He did magnificent work in respect of the development of turf fuel and many other things.  The Senator can smile sarcastically, and it would be foolish of me to expect the Senator to believe these things, but they are, nevertheless, facts.  The Senator was somewhat perturbed because I mentioned Mountjoy Prison.  I merely mentioned it in passing. I merely desired to show that a raid on the Magazine could happen and that a raid on a place like Mountjoy Prison could just as easily happen.  I stated that, in my opinion, Mountjoy Prison was a fortification much stronger and much more difficult to secure entry into than even the Magazine Fort, but all I desired to point out was that what could be done in the régime of one Government could equally happen during the régime of <Col N="852" /> another.  That is the only reason I mentioned it.  It is a historical fact.  I did not come in here armed with the date, because I did not expect it would be necessary to deal with the matter at all, but the Senator appeared to think that such a thing would have been absolutely impossible during the lifetime of the Government of which he was a member.</P>
      <P>The Senator seems to think that there is something seriously and radically wrong with the infiltration of Volunteers into the Army.  I suggest there is not.  For instance, the Senator would not suggest for a moment that these Volunteers should not fight shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues of the regular Army, if there were a war.  He would not think it wrong that these men should man gaps of danger and fight side by side.  He does not suggest for one moment, I am sure, that the raising of the 250,000 young recruits every three or four months in England and their infiltration into the Expeditionary Force, is wrong.  I do not think it is wrong at all, and while I do feel that as far as it would be possible, for the Volunteers' own sakes, they should be trained as a separate unit and used as a separate unit, if that were possible, but only in the defence of the nation, I do seriously say to the Senator that infiltration means nothing from the point of view of weakening the Army.  I do not think there is anything more that I have to say.  I regret very much that the Senator took the line he did in respect of attempting to draw in the period of the civil war and so on.  That is a period that I, personally, would like to forget, and I am sure that the Senator himself would be anxious to forget it.</P>

      <P>Yes, but Senator Fitzgerald jumped in very quickly to take advantage of it, and seemed like a man who was gloating at the opportunity given him to take advantage of it.  I suggest that, as a responsible Senator and as a man who has had <Col N="853" /> the responsibility of Government himself, he at least ought to give an example to his colleagues and to the country in general in trying to forget that unhappy period, because it was an unhappy period.  If it came to participating in a debate on 1922 and the happenings of that time, I suppose I could be just as dirty as the Senator.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to do so, however, but as I said already the Senator has a power of incitement that he does not appear to know he possesses.  The fact is that he does possess it, and for that reason I suggest that he should restrain himself. For instance, with regard to his talk about the Army, I suggest, Sir, that if that sort of thing were to be said often enough and to be continually dinned into the ears of the men in the Army, the men of the Army will begin, possibly, to think that they are what the Senator describes them as being, and probably will begin to believe that the Army is as inefficient as the Senator would like everybody to believe it is.  We have only to say such things long enough, and then possibly something might happen.  I appeal to this House, as I appealed in the other House, that it is time that we should forget that.  I never called the National Army &ldquo;green-and-tans&rdquo; and I doubt if any of my colleagues, who represent the Government, ever called them &ldquo;green-and-tans&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I can say this, at any rate, that when the present Government took over the Army they took it over as it was, and I defy the Senator or any other Senator to show where we made a single change in the Army. If we had taken it over in the spirit in which the Senator seems to think we did, we would have cleared out <Col N="854" /> officers, bag and baggage, but we did not do so because we had sufficient trust in these men as Irishmen to carry on their duties in the Army, and the men who are carrying on the Army and its responsibilities to-day are the men who carried on in the Senator's time.  That is the spirit in which this Government is trying to face the situation here.  We are endeavouring, so far as it is humanly possible to do so, to reunite all sections of the people, and I think that when members of this House can show that they at least can be united in the decencies of debate we will go a long way towards reuniting the people in regard to the things we should be doing for this nation.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann would welcome a statement of policy by the Government regarding the Irish Currency and its connection with sterling&mdash;(Mr. MacDermot).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>As I moved, the adjournment of the debate on the last occasion, Sir, I take it that the position is that I should resume the discussion.  In doing so, I want to make a few general remarks about some general principles which we should keep in mind in all considerations of currency policy.  There has been a good deal of talk about the fact that our currency is based on sterling.  Well, that might mean various things.  Actually, our currency is based on sterling in the sense that our currency is supported at a parity with sterling on a £ for £ basis, but it would be perfectly possible to have our currency based on sterling and to have the Irish £ worth, say, 25/- English, or worth, say, 15/- English. In fact, the currency of the Dominions, New Zealand and Australia, is based on sterling, but as we all know, the Australian £ is only worth 15/- English, <Col N="855" /> and the New Zealand £ is much the same.  In any event, whatever parity we adopt in relation to sterling, if the basing of our currency on sterling is to have any real meaning there must be in this country some institution which maintains balances in terms of that foreign currency, sterling, on which our currency is based, and which is prepared to buy and sell our money in unlimited quantities at a fixed price in terms of that sterling currency.</P>
      <P>That is the sense in which our currency is and must be based on sterling, and whether the £ is worth 15/- English, or 25/- English, it is essential that there should be some national institution which is prepared to buy and sell our currency at that fixed rate, and in no other way can a fixed value of our currency be maintained&mdash;a fixed value, that is, in terms of sterling.  Of course there is another alternative, and that is that we should abandon the effort to maintain a fixed value of our currency in terms of sterling or any other foreign currency, but that is a policy which I hope will never have to be adopted and which is open to very grave objections, as every country, which has suffered from fluctuating foreign exchange values of its national currency has realised in the last 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot, in the course of his remarks, mentioned as a point of interest that there was a time in our history when the national currency was cattle, and it might be true to say that even now there is a sense in which our national currency may be said to be based on cattle.  After all, if the meaning of our currency being based on sterling is that we maintain important sterling assets or sterling balances in another country&mdash;if that is the meaning of that phrase&mdash;then the question of how we acquired those foreign assets becomes interesting and important. The only way in which we could have acquired those foreign external assets is by the export, on balance, of a greater volume of goods than we import and cattle, as you know, play a central part in the total volume of our exports of all kinds.  Our currency, <Col N="856" /> therefore, is based on the fact that we have sterling assets and that is due to the fact that we have export balances because we have exported more cattle and other goods than we imported.  That is by the way.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes argued that instead of basing our currency on sterling, we should base it on the national credit, whatever precisely that phrase may mean.  Now, in my view, in basing our currency on sterling, as it is now based, it is in a true sense based on the national credit, for it is based on something which we, as a nation, have by way of credit or claim, on a neighbouring nation.  Our currency represents, on the one side, a debt of our monetary authority to the people using that currency but, on the other side, it represents a claim possessed by that monetary authority against the resources of a neighbouring economy. Therefore, in a true sense, it is based on the national credit because it is based on a credit which we, as a nation possess, having the form of a claim on the economic resources of a neighbouring country.  A currency not so related to a neighbouring currency and not so supported by external assets held abroad might be and would be nothing in its essence other than a form of national debt, a debt due by the State to the persons circulating and using the currency of that country.  On the whole, I prefer that our currency should be based on the national credit in the sense in which it is so based rather than that it should be based on nothing but a national debt.</P>
    <P>Now, the fact that we are one of the few European countries which enjoy a creditor position in international financial relations is a considerable national advantage.  It gives us a strength in dealing, even with greater and more powerful neighbours, which other countries have not got and which other countries envy us for having.  In that respect, the fact that we are to a substantial degree a creditor in terms of sterling of our neighbours, places us in a much more advantageous position in currency and other matters than, for example, New Zealand or Australia. As many of you probably know, in <Col N="857" /> recent years New Zealand exhausted her sterling balance, or came very close to the point where her sterling balance was exhausted, and they had to walk the plank in their dealings with English financiers before they would obtain the accommodation necessary for them in order to continue their economic and financial life.</P>
    <P>It might not be without interest to give a brief historical retrospect of the circumstances in which our currency came to be sterling or based on sterling.  In that connection, I would remind the House that we have had no familiarity in present or recent generations at any time in the last 100 years or more, with those difficulties of currency and problems of fluctuating foreign exchanges which have been so familiar and so disastrous in other countries.  We have also been fortunately free from any serious bankruptcies of any of our banks for the best part of a century.</P>
    <P>But, if we look back over the long history of Irish currency, we find that the happy position we have enjoyed in recent generations was by no means characteristic of the history of our country in the centuries running from the 14th to the end of the 18th century.  In fact there were many centuries during which Ireland did not enjoy a firm, stable exchange rate with England, centuries in which Ireland had no currency of her own, although she had her own monetary system, because she was deliberately prevented by British policy from having her own currency while at the same time she was prevented by British policy from using sterling.  Henry VII forbade the export of sterling coins to Ireland, and this prohibition of this export was rigorously enforced, especially in the time of Elizabeth, though, in fact, it was evaded, because coins have a way of being exported in spite of regulations.</P>
    <P>The only reputable coins circulated in Ireland for many centuries were foreign coins, sterling and others, because the country was forbidden by British policy to have a mint of its own, while at the same time difficulties <Col N="858" /> were placed in the way of free circulation of English coins.  Queen Elizabeth, as part of her policy for the destruction of the army and cause associated with Hugh O'Neill, deliberately imposed on Ireland a debased, or, as we now call it, an inflated currency, and the object of that issue of debased coin in Ireland was to deprive the Irish of the facilities they had of importing munitions of war by the use of coin of sterling character, whether foreign or sterling:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard that the rebels drew to themselves a great part of the sterling coins that were in circulation, to buy munitions and provisions for the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So Queen Elizabeth, as a measure by no means friendly to the Irish people, deliberately depreciated our currency, and any section of the community to-day who sought deliberately to depreciate our currency would be acting in the spirit of Queen Elizabeth and would be producing somewhat similar effects on our economic structure.  They would be giving us a currency of fluctuating and uncertain value in other countries, a currency with which we could not buy as much abroad as with our present currency and with reference to which we would be quite uncertain how much it would buy at any time at home or abroad.  That would be the effect of a deliberate depreciation of the currency associated with a lack of parity with any other currency.</P>
    <P>There was, as students of Irish history will remember, another famous occasion on which the currency was debased or inflated.  That was in the reign of James II when he coined a lot of gun metal into current legal tender money of the realm and called four-pence worth of old gun metal &ldquo;five pounds.&rdquo;  It is on record that creditors who were paid £5 worth of debt with fourpence worth of metal were not at all satisfied with the transaction, and when the new monarch, King William, put an end to that particular form of debased currency, we had the origin of that slogan which is repeated to this day in Northern Ireland: &ldquo;Here's to the glorious, pious and immortal <Col N="859" /> memory of William III, who saved us from Pope and popery, brass money and wooden shoes.&rdquo;  The brass money is the particular point germane to this discussion, and I would suggest that if we are going to emulate James II, and introduce a new form of brass money, we will not be contributing to that reunion of Ireland under a common Government which all of us have at heart.</P>
    <P>On certain occasions, inflation of Irish currency has been disastrous to the nation, and fluctuation in its exchange value has been and was for centuries, a continuous cause of injury to Irish economy, but equally a deflation of Irish currency, that is a deliberate increase in the exchange value of the Irish currency unit has on one occasion proved disastrous.  As I said before, although there was an Irish monetary system there was no Irish currency as such, but what happened was that coins, Spanish, Portuguese and English circulated in Ireland and were given a certain value in terms of what one might call an imaginary Irish monetary system.  For example, the English guinea at one time circulated as 26/- Irish and at another time as 23/- Irish.  The Moydore, a Portuguese coin had a value of £1 10s. Irish and at another time had a lesser value.  In 1695, the English guinea was fixed at 26/- Irish and, by the same token, English shillings circulating in Ireland in those days, instead of being called 12 pence Irish, were called 13 pence or 14 pence Irish.  We had the phenomenon of foreign coins circulating and being called by different denominational values in terms of Irish and in terms of the English system.  The same coin would be called 13 pence in Ireland and 12 pence in England.  The English guinea was fixed at 26/- Irish in 1695, but, for some reason or another which I have never been able to ascertain, the Irish Government changed the value of the English guinea to 23/-. That was an appreciation of the Irish monetary unit making it, so to speak, heavier in terms of gold than it had been before.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> Before 1701, an Irish person exporting to Great Britain who sold a guinea's worth of goods had the means of paying a debt or remitting a rent having a value of 26/- Irish.  When the change took place, by selling a guinea's worth of goods, after 1701, he could only pay a debt having the value of 23/- Irish, and, consequently, the effect of that change was to compel the export of a greater quantity of goods in payment of our liabilities, to &ldquo;absentee landlords&rdquo; and you like, than was the case before.  By the appreciation of our monetary unit, which took place at that time, we imposed a burden on all our export industries, we depressed the export prices and, generally speaking, contributed in no small measure to that acute depression of Irish economic life which lasted for about three decades.</P>
    <P>Most economic historians attribute the depression of the Irish economy in the early 18th century to the restriction on the woollen export; but, from what information I have obtained on the matter, I have come to the conclusion that the appreciation of the Irish currency unit was the primary cause which pushed our economy at that time into acute depression.  That being so, it looks as if neither a violent depreciation nor a violent appreciation has been attended by happy consequences in the history of our currency.</P>
    <P>However, I set out to explain as best I could the circumstances by which we attained to a sterling basis for our currency.  Right down nearly to the end of the eighteenth century we were still suffering from the consequences of the British policy which refused to allow us to have a mint of our own, and which refused to allow the free circulation of English coins here.  We did the best we could with all kinds of foreign coins, using those coins and whatever English coins we could illegitimately get hold of up to 1775.  Then the situation improved considerably and more sterling coins were in fact coming in and were being more widely circulated by custom.  In that year the Government of Ireland passed legislation to give to sterling coins the sole right of legal tender in <Col N="861" /> the country, whereas before that the legal tender quality belonged to a whole list of foreign coins&mdash;Portuguese, Spanish, French, as well as sterling&mdash;so we may say that, in 1775, we changed for the first time to a sterling basis for our currency.  At all events, sterling became the exclusive currency of the country and from that time we have, in one form or another, maintained the sterling basis. Actually, even when we achieved that result, we still called the English shilling 13 pence and Irish money was supposed to be on parity with English money when you had the relation of £13 Irish being exchanged for £12 English.  It was only in 1825 that this difference in the denominational value of the two currencies disappeared and, since 1825 up to the present day, we have circulated coins in every respect similar to sterling; in fact, they were altogether sterling until the separation of the currencies in 1927.</P>
    <P>The moral of that rather long history is that the sterling parity of our currency was not lightly achieved in the course of our long history and, in my view, it should not be lightly abandoned.  Inflation and deflation of our currency in terms of sterling have been nationally injurious and, therefore, the whole rational attitude to the problem is that we should, as far as possible and unless very definite and unforeseen circumstances arise, adhere to a rigid sterling parity whereby the £ Irish will be exchangeable at par for the £ English.  Certainly, under present conditions, if anyone wants inflation, he is quite likely to get enough of it from the inevitable degree of inflation that will probably come in spite of all efforts to prevent it.  Any person desiring inflation should have no need to depart from sterling.  On the other hand, in certain unforeseen circumstances it may become a matter for consideration whether the Irish £ should be appreciated in terms of sterling. If that situation arises, in consequence of some disaster threatening our neighbours, our whole outlook would be so gloomy in common with theirs that it would be of no use to try to save ourselves from that common disaster by any form of tinkering <Col N="862" /> with currency.  They would be dead and damned and we would be dead and damned along with them.  Mainly as a matter of theory, it may be that we might give some consideration to the point whether and in what circumstances it would profit us to appreciate our currency in terms of sterling, or rather to try to prevent our currency unit suffering an excessive degree of depreciation in terms or sterling.  Whether that was going too far or not, it would be a change which should not be made lightly either.  If our currency is appreciated in terms of sterling, one can imagine the howl that would be raised by farmers.  For example if a farmer were selling a bullock for £40 English and he were only going to get £30 Irish for it I think it would be extremely difficult&mdash;in fact, almost politically impossible&mdash;to maintain a state of affairs in which our currency would be allowed to appreciate.</P>

      <P>What about the reverse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The reverse would be equally objectionable. on the other hand, if we deliberately depreciate our currency in terms of sterling&mdash;and I think there is no necessity whatever for that&mdash;even if it were contemplated, and if we did, then a situation would exist in which all those unpatriotic people who insisted on leaving their investments abroad in sterling securities would have the laugh over the others who brought them home in order to invest them in Irish industries.  In that case, Irish securities would become less valuable pound for pound than if the money were left in English securities and people who took money out of sterling to invest it in Irish securities both industrial and national would get in the language of my Ulster fellow-countrymen, the &ldquo;queer gunk.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another objection to depreciation of our currency is that if it did take place prices, especially the prices of export and import products, would certainly rise.  The rise in these prices would for the time being perhaps benefit especially farmers but, if I know anything <Col N="863" /> about urban labour, I think it is highly probable that urban labour would exert itself to bring about an increase in the cost of urban products which would do its best to keep pace with the rise in the prices obtained by farmers for export products.  If past experience is any guide, I think we might say that the probability is that while prices enjoyed by the farmers would rise for a time they would ultimately fall again, but the prices of urban goods and urban services having been once raised would remain high for all time, for, as you know, our whole economy has been distorted and many of our present misfortunes are due mainly to the fact that in the decade following the Great War, while agricultural prices and agricultural incomes rose and fell again, urban prices and urban incomes rose and did not fall again.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would remind the House that a very wise man called Bishop Berkeley in a much quoted and very famous book called <i>The Querist</i>, said that money is only so far useful as it stirreth up industry enabling men to participate mutually the fruit of each other's labour.  There is any amount of money available for all the industry now carried on and more industry if only we could arrange to carry it on. There is no obstacle preventing the banking system from lending money to people who have some project in view which commands a prospect of profit and which is associated with adequate security from the banking point of view.  The banks are only too eager to increase their lending of money to persons and industries enjoying credit, but the banks have to remember that they can only lend to the extent that they are able to borrow from depositors. The ultimate real lenders are always the depositors and the banks are essentially trustees for these depositors and cannot, without violating their trust, use their financial power in such a way as to incur heavy losses which ultimately might injure their depositors.</P>
    <P>It is not scarcity of money that restricts our economic activity.  There <Col N="864" /> is plenty of money-creating capacity in our banking system and there is plenty of legal tender money available through the machinery of the Currency Commission. If more legal tender money is needed for our legitimate purposes the Currency Commission is in such a strong financial position that it can easily add to the amount of legal tender currency that the nation may require for ordinary purposes.  What limits our prosperity and prevents industry from being stirred up to the extent that it could be is not then the absence of money but it is something else: it is this disorder in the price structure, this lack of balance in the national economy which was created by the events of the last Great War and intensified by the events of the subsequent decades and especially by those of the great depression and by our so called economic war.  The object of money, according to Berkeley, is to stir up industry, enabling men to participate mutually the fruit of each other's labour.  This, as I say, depends on a suitable balance and relationship between the different elements in the price and income structure in the national economy.  I would suggest that if agricultural incomes were £10,000,000 a year higher than they are then our agricultural producers&mdash; 600,000 of them&mdash;would participate more fully in the fruits of urban industry and, equally, I would suggest that if urban wages were lower than they are then perhaps far more people would be employed in urban occupations, the aggregate of urban incomes would be higher than it is, and they as a class would participate more fully than they now do in the fruits of agricultural production.  So, get that balance right between the different sections of our economy and we will all participate mutually in the fruits of each other's labour but, so long as the national economy is distorted, no amount of tinkering with the monetary system will in any way solve our problem of unemployment.</P>

      <P>When this motion was placed on the Order Paper I do not think any of us anticipated that we would have such an interesting discussion <Col N="865" /> as we have had.  We have had reviewed in the course of the debate a number of matters from the days of good Queen Bess to the tribal wars in this country, and the interesting lecture which we have just listened to from Senator Professor Johnston must be of great value to all of us.  I would not indeed intervene in this debate at all were we not challenged. The motion was for the purpose of securing a statement on policy by the Government regarding Irish currency and its connection with sterling, but that statement was given by the Minister for Finance last week and it is difficult for me to understand why the debate of last week should have been converted into a demand for a statement with regard to currency and kindred matters by the Irish Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We, apparently, have been provoked to saying something in regard to this extremely difficult, intricate and involved question of currency. I do not know whether I can be more interesting than Senator Professor Johnston, but at all events we will endeavour to say something, not in regard to this motion, as that is not what we are called upon now to debate, but rather in regard to certain views which have been promulgated by our Party elsewhere.  This, I may say, is a rather unprecedented attitude for the Seanad to take up, but perhaps they are interested in the theories of finance and economics such as may be propounded by Labour representatives through the country from time to time.  Whether or not the Labour Party views are heterodox is entirely a matter for the Labour Party itself, and it is no more obliged to render an account in this House or to any member of it for its views than is any other Party in this House or any member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot may catechise the Labour Party and say the views they express in their private documents are &ldquo;unsound and mischievous.&rdquo;<Col N="866" /> That is his view and he is entitled to it, but the Labour Party can readily retort that the orthodox financial and economic views of Senator MacDermot, being borrowed originally from Manchester&mdash;a place that will not be unknown to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;are entirely foreign to a Gaelic Ireland and this financial orthodoxy is now responsible for the horrible condition of slumdom, poverty and general misery which are all too prevalent throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of this country, not even in the days of the Four Masters, to which Senator MacDermot adverted, was there such squalor and personal destitution.  Never had Ireland 120,000 people capable of work and hungering in a terrible personal way for food, and that despite the advance in machinery, machinery which should come to the aid of man and enable him to gain more food.  Yet, despite this mechanisation and mechanised aid, we have to-day worse squalor, more destitution, more poverty in this country than ever we had in the time when the North was protesting against Wood's pence or Queen Bess was endeavouring to debase our currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To what then can we ascribe this misery for which no parallel can be found even in the Ireland of &ldquo;foraying clans&rdquo;?  It is due entirely to the maintenance of the School of Manchester Economics of which Senators MacDermot and Johnston are such shining advocates.  It is not at all surprising that the real Ireland is hidden to these people; the real Ireland of a once happy and contented people, the Ireland before it experienced the Manchester School of Economics. Reared apart from the real Ireland, and steeped in a school of foreign economics, these Senators have no remedy to propound to save this country from the disastrous consequences of Manchesterism but: &ldquo;Support Adam Smith's &lsquo;Wealth of Nations&rsquo; and the Majority Report of the Banking Commission as the Old <Col N="867" /> and New Testaments of national finance and hence national ruin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But, is Senator MacDermot satisfied with the position despite his declaration that he desires no change?  Listen to the doubting Thomas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One is tempted to wonder whether we ought not to go further than we have so far gone in reducing the amount of the sterling securities backing our currency, and either increasing the quantity of gold held or acquiring dollar securities.  One is also tempted to wonder whether it is possible at all for the Government to plan in advance some means of extricating ourselves and our currency in case of emergency, an emergency that I hope will never arise, from the sort of collapse to which I have referred... the question is whether to any extent at all we could get out from under, and whether there are any steps we can take now to make our position somewhat more secure.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He says he wonders if we should not reduce our holding in sterling securities and increase our gold holding. Further he would, apparently, hedge on these holdings, for he asks whether it is possible for the Government to plan in advance some means of extricating our currency in the case of emergency. Could he get out in time before the ship sinks with our part of the cargo, is what he means in plain language.  In regard to our securing of gold, perhaps he is not aware that at one time 1,000,000 gold sovereigns were collected in this country and automatically sent to the Bank of England &ldquo;because it was not the policy of the Currency Commission to speculate in gold values.&rdquo;  Recently that same gold was bought back for £2,000,000.  That gold was sold when gold was 74/- per oz., and bought again when gold was 148/- per oz.  Repatriating gold is, therefore, an operation to-day that is hardly a sound financial one, even if the British Government would agree, which is most unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to transferring our British <Col N="868" /> securities to dollars, to which he also refers, any reputable economist will tell him it makes no difference normally so long as the external assets are ample to meet our external obligations.  But it is not a question of amplitude that disturbs the Senator's mind, but obviously the parlous position of those securities to-day in the present international war situation.  These fears of Senator MacDermot show conclusively that he is mentally in the same condition as those who, he says, are concerned in &ldquo;an unsound, mischievous campaign&rdquo;, to which he is so anxious to direct the attention of the Government. There is, however, this difference between the Senator and those he belabours, that whereas the so-called &ldquo;campaigners&rdquo; are concerned, in their advocacy of certain theories, with the best interests of the people as a whole, especially the destitute, the Senator is concerned primarily with the money interests of a privileged class.</P>
    <P>The Senator is concerned to pay encomiums to our banking institutions. We have no disagreement with him on this score.  As private concerns, the banks of this country deserve the greatest praise for the excellent manner in which they provide for the needs of their clients.  Having, however, said that we must also remark that the banks are not meeting the new situation, and it is doubtful, constituted and directed as they are, if they could meet the situation.  Banks, having reached a monopolistic position in modern society, are necessarily anxious to maintain undisturbed their monopoly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could bring the Lakes of Killarney to Purgatory, I would get a guinea a drop for them. Thus, while banks cannot and will not meet the needs of modern society, and provide the necessary fluid life to keep the wheels of industry revolving, they will fight against any other authority <Col N="869" /> performing that necessary and vital work for the community.  I must, therefore, digress from my main theme for a moment and read some expressions of opinions regarding financial institutions which will clearly indicate the power banks have and intend to hold&mdash;even in the face of Governments &mdash;so that the private provision of currency and credits shall be maintained intact in their hands.  No less an authority than Mr. Gladstone said in reference to the growing power of banks:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the time I took office as Chancellor, I began to learn that the State held, in the face of the banks of the city, an extremely false position as regards finance....  The hinge of the whole situation was this, the Government itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of finance, but was to leave the money power supreme and unquestioned. In the conditions of that situation I was reluctant to acquiesce, and I began to fight against it by financial self-assertion from the first.  I was tenaciously opposed to the governor and deputy-governor of the bank, who had seats in Parliament, and I had the city for an antagonist on almost every occasion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In a letter to the London <i>Times</i>, dated 3/3/23, Sir Josiah Stamp said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The interdependence of the money policies of the U.S. and Great Britain, or&mdash;not to put too fine a point upon it&mdash;the dependence of the latter upon the former, has just been dramatically demonstrated.  We are informed that the bank rate must certainly be raised from 4 to 5 per cent. next Thursday.  There is nothing in the present position of British industry, which would in itself call for an increase in the rate.... The incident seems to show clearly who it is that cracks the whip and obeys the signal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now listen to how a banker threatened Mr. Snowden, Chancellor, in 1930, at the centenary meeting of the Union Bank of Scotland:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" />&ldquo;It was probably the banks alone who could effectively curb the extravagances of Governments by dealing with them as drastically as with the borrowing individual spendthrift.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was only the banks who, by limiting supplies, could curb lavishness of Governments and individuals, and control those doubtful credit schemes now being pressed upon them for acceptance at the instance of Ministers and their Departments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fortunately the real power was still in the hands of the independent banks, when they liked to combine in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Lloyd George had also some strange things to say about banks. Speaking in the House of Commons he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to urge the Chancellor again not to be too frightened of the City of London.  Since the war the City of London has been invariably wrong in advising the Government.... Rapid deflation was a mistake, and it had an injurious effect....  The precipitate establishment of the gold standard was another thing which undoubtedly dealt a staggering blow at our export trade.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have been wrong every time....  Now there is no doubt at all that they are using the whole of their tremendous influence for the purpose of restricting the raising of money for national development. Take the cause of depression throughout the world at the present moment. There is not a man who has examined it who will not tell you that a very large part of it is due to the mishandling of monetary questions on the advice of the money barons.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These men who have mishandled this monetary question not merely advise what to do, but establish a veto upon every proposal which is made for national development.  We got rid of the veto of the House of Lords.  Take care that you do not establish a more sordid one.  If you <Col N="871" /> go to the City of London what is their only remedy for depression? Their only remedy is by placing artificial barriers to prevent plenty from reaching want.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The city is the stronghold of reaction. All the time when I was Chancellor of the Exchequer up to 1914, I had to fight the city.  And then in 1914 the city had to come crawling to the Government for assistance.  Talk about public control!  It was that that saved the city in 1914.  No Government will ever get a big programme through unless it is prepared to face up to the reactionary money interests in the City of London.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You will, therefore, see that while banks behave with great probity to their customers, they will fight against any alteration of the system whereby they have a private monopoly of credit facilities and general monetary provision. But we are concerned with something more than that.  We are concerned with the provision of work for 120,000 idle persons and the decline in the trade of many others because of this colossal unemployment.  The maintenance of all the citizens in an adequate standard of comfort, having regard to the capacity of wealth production in the country, is the paramount duty of the nation.  If the private control of monetary machinery is incapable of performing this task, then that private machinery must be altered to meet this vital and pressing need of the people.</P>
    <P>It is reassuring to hear Ministers say that if they cannot find a remedy for this condition of affairs within the system, they will have no hesitation in going outside the system.  If they are concerned to save the country from disaster and consequential worse evils, they will not hesitate much longer, for the needs of the people cry aloud for redress.  Will the advocates of &ldquo;Do nothing&rdquo; just pause and think of the terrible destitution and agony caused through unemployment?  Why should man's inhumanity to man make countless thousands mourn for food, <Col N="872" /> raiment and adequate shelter when the only thing we suffer from is a plethora of these things?  What is the impossibility of placing these things in the hands of those who require them?  The duty of Government is to do so, whether an outmoded system of finance says it cannot be done, and, because it says so, will make no endeavour.</P>
    <P>Full and adequate provision for the needy must be made.  If banks cannot do it, the State must.  The State to-day provides an army, navy and police for the adequate protection of the citizens.  Who proposes that we should place these services in the hands of private persons?  The State also provides a system of justice and roads, electricity, education, public health, etc.  What would we say if private monopoly half-provided these services? Yet, that is the position in relation to money.  Surely the time has arrived when the partial function of banks in this regard must be taken over by the State itself, and an adequate system devised so that every citizen, anxious to maintain himself or herself, shall be provided with an opportunity of so doing.</P>
    <P>In speaking of human wastage caused through unemployment, let me give some statistics which were taken of 50 families recently in Dublin.  The total weekly income of this group of 50 families, comprising 264 persons, was £39 18s. 2d., after making deductions for rent, insurance, fuel and light.  This amount, let us say, was spent on food. It amounts to 3/- per person per week. No wonder, then, there is destitution, malnutrition and scores of other ailments. I ask, are we prepared to continue this misery to maintain an archaic system of economics?  Are we prepared to shoulder the responsibility of adequately catering for these people rendered destitute through no fault of their own?  That is the problem. These thousands ask you for bread and you hand them a stone labelled &ldquo;Manchester economics.&rdquo;  Whether, therefore, our economics are &ldquo;unsound or mischievous&rdquo;, we are concerned with this mass misery and we propose, here and elsewhere, to call attention to it <Col N="873" /> until the demand for its elimination reaches a crescendo which shall not be denied.</P>
    <P>When Senator MacDermot had the floor, it is a pity he did not make more valuable use of his time by asking the Minister for information more germane to the motion before the House.  That would have been more logical and useful than sneering at the Labour Party and others whose social consciousness is offended by the mass and preventable misery we see around us.  If Senator MacDermot suffered less from prejudices, he might have done a useful service with his motion.  He might have asked the Minister many relevant questions rather than rambling away into the realms of Gaelic tribal forays.</P>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister admits that there is a campaign in regard to financial changes.  Now we should ask ourselves why a campaign arises if everything is normal.  Is it not just because things are not normal that there is this so-called campaign? The Minister, in his statement, would seem to imply that there was an intention on the part of some to root out the existing system and to supplant it by another.  We are not advocating a a change of that character.  The views expressed in the document to which reference has been made merely advocate a scheme of development credit to get into motion certain stagnant industrial and commercial operations. It is purely supplemental and not supplanting. Its heterodoxy lies solely in asking the State to provide itself with &ldquo;developmental credit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not quite alone in our advocacy of this demand.  The <i>Economist</i> speaking of &ldquo;a consistent plan of mobolising the financial resources of the community in its struggle for the community survival&rdquo; says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These considerations seem to point to something in the nature of long-term wages and means advances by the joint stock banks to the State with an average life of, say, 20 years....  There would be no justification whatever for the payment of so high a rate as 3 per cent. on created credit....  In the circumstances here envisaged, it would be <Col N="874" /> the community's credit that would be liquefied; and the community represented by the Exchequer would be entitled to require that the rate of interest should be no more than the cost of handling the funds&mdash;say ½ per cent. per annum.  The bank's legitimate profits would not be damaged by such a rate since these advances to the State would be a net addition to their normal volume of business.  Indeed, the resulting inflation would tend to increase their normal turnover.  These advances should not in fact rank as part of the ordinary business of the banks but as a special supernumerary service that they render to the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Senator when he was speaking.  He can take what he likes from my statement when I have finished.  The <i>Economist</i>, in asking the joint stock banks to make this provision to the State at ½ per cent as a special supernumerary service is not far removed from what Labour in its pamphlet advocates.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Senator MacDermot would consider the attitude of the <i>Economist</i> also, &ldquo;unsound and mischievous&rdquo;.  It at least indicates that there is a crying need to do something which the orthodox methods of the banks cannot do.  No wonder then that there is a campaign when people are crushed between the upper millstone of orthodox finance and the nether millstone of economic destitution.  It is obvious to-day that the paramount interests of the community demand some extra provision in our financial arrangements. Without being dogmatic it appears that there should be a volume of credit available at any time, and as the banks in their own interests cannot make this volume available to non-credit worthy people, the State is the sole authority that can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Economist</i> says that this may be done within the realms of the existing <Col N="875" /> system and at a minimum price. Others demur and say that this is now the function of the State.  It is no answer to say that this volume of credit is available to-day.  It may be, but it cannot emerge into activity having regard to the accepted methods of profit-seeking activities.  It can emerge under the control of the State and for useful social purposes.  I need not go into the minutiæ of how this volume of credit would emerge under a State &ldquo;developmental authority&rdquo;. That is merely machinery and I need hardly say that extreme caution and prudence would be exercised in its use. It is no answer to say that this means inflation&mdash;the bogey of the finance experts who say, &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;.  Doing nothing is incompetence, and that way lies disaster.  Resultant goods and services will correct the balance, and limited inflation need not be feared.</P>
    <P>The needs of a large portion of our people to-day necessitate some &ldquo;development credit&rdquo;, and with due care and caution we can get the finance chariot out of its present-day rut into which it has fallen, if the effort is made by the State&mdash;the sole authority that can now get the wheels of economic activity once more into motion. It will be urged that this theory brings us up against the &ldquo;sterling link&rdquo;, having regard to the statutory manner in which the volume of our present-day currency and credit is regulated. In his opening remarks Senator MacDermot, obviously, did not seem too happy about the stability of sterling in the future, so perhaps relating the possible position of sterling to the internal necessity for expanded credits in this country, the present time may be the most propitious for the discussion of these problems.  Neither is the Minister adamant, nor apparently, does he feel himself committed irrevocably to sterling for, while he definitely advocates staying bound thereto at present, the Minister goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government would only consider proposing an amendment of it if a change of circumstances were to <Col N="876" /> occur of such a nature as to render the preservation of the present parity between our currency and British clearly disadvantageous to Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our finance experts, if they will not do anything to relieve the financial distress of a large number of people in this country, will keep a watchful eye on sterling assets and consider repatriation of some of those directly under public control&mdash;if that is still possible, and not too great a sacrifice for the development of industry in this country before these assets seriously depreciate, which they may do as the result of the present international situation.  Already, the following gilt-edged industrial shares have fallen: £1,000 worth in September, 1938, would be worth in September, 1939, in the case of 2½ per cent. Consols, £850; J.P. Coats', £700; Imperial Chemicals, £900; Imperial Tobacco, £740; Uni.-Lever, £820.  This shows that our external investment position was not improving between September, 1938, and September, 1939. It would be interesting to know what its present position is like.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to embark on a discussion on the several points raised in the statement of the Minister.  The resolution is not the property of the Labour Party.  Perhaps Senator MacDermot, being the primarily interested party, might like to take up with the Minister the interesting subject of &ldquo;parity&rdquo; to which the Minister referred in detail.  If he does, he will find that not one of the British Commonwealth countries maintains parity with sterling.  Australia and New Zealand attempted to do so but abandoned it in 1931.  These countries send much more agricultural produce to the British market than this country does, and yet the dire consequences which the Minister says would flow and follow if this country abandons &ldquo;parity&rdquo; have neither flowed nor followed where other countries have not maintained it.</P>
    <P>However, it is not my purpose in intervening in this debate to discuss such issues at this juncture.  Senators have expressed themselves very satisfied <Col N="877" /> with the Ministerial statement.  If I were in a discursive mood and had plenty of time, there are many questions germane to the financial arrangements of this country that I would like to ask, not least of which would be why we do not get the British to repatriate their silver coinage, which creeps into this country, the same as they take back such coinage from other countries. Why should this country be selected for this exceptional treatment with its consequent financial loss to us?</P>
    <P>I regret that I have taken more time than I intended.  It is not easy to deal with such a subject adequately in a short statement.  The challenge which was hurled down to us last Wednesday was, in our opinion, quite unnecessary. We trust we have adequately discharged the obligation imposed on us.</P>

      <P>Senator MacDermot, in the course of his speech last week, in moving:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann would welcome a statement of policy by the Government regarding the Irish currency and its connection with sterling&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>waxed eloquent in dealing with what he described as</P>
      <P>&ldquo;this &lsquo;hot-gospelling&rsquo;, quasi-religious handling of an economic question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Professor O'Rahilly, my colleague the Lord Mayor of Cork, and what he described as a religious newspaper, <i>The Standard</i>, in turn came under the lash of his tongue in dealing with the motion he was submitting to the House.  He even went so far as to say that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The assumption of a superior moral status by those who are advocating expedients which I believe to be unsound, fills me, I must say, with indignation and even with disgust.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Realising how the learned Senator must have suffered as a result of all this nausea, I have determined, out of sheer sympathy, not to add to his torture in this respect.  In the course of the few remarks I have to make to the <Col N="878" /> House I will not make even one reference to the Papal Encyclicals, but rather will I depend entirely on the views of those whom he would, I am sure, regard as being completely orthodox.</P>
    <P>I will not even attempt to reply to what I consider his unfair references to that distinguished sociologist, my friend Professor O'Rahilly.  I will leave that to the Professor himself.  I imagine he will be able to defend himself with vigour and clarity, without any puny efforts on my part to assist him or come to his rescue.  Nor will I even go to the trouble of defending my colleague the Lord Mayor of Cork. The views held and expressed by both these gentlemen are views that are held and approved of by hundreds of thousands of our people.  They are closer to the hearts, and more nearly reflect the views of the people of this country than Senator MacDermot can ever hope to do.  And, so far as <i>The Standard</i> is concerned, I think it may be trusted to deal effectively with my colleague's remarks.  That journal, I am glad to learn, is growing in influence, prestige and circulation each week, and may safely be left to speak for, and to defend itself against the charge of using &ldquo;arguments that are unsound and mischievous and more directed to the emotions than to the head&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston, if I read his few remarks aright last week, expressed a little fear that we in this group might have been tempted to remain silent on this subject&mdash;a subject of such vital importance, and so vitally affecting the lives of those whom we have the duty and the honour to represent in this House.  I can assure him he need not have entertained any such fears in that respect.  Our position is a clear and simple one.  We take our stand on the fundamental fact that this country has all the material resources necessary to feed, to clothe and to house all our people, and to maintain them not only in a state of &ldquo;frugal comfort&rdquo;, but, also, in a condition of simple luxury.</P>

      <P>That is a fact that not all the eloquence of the professors in economics and the advocates of orthodoxy in finance can controvert, or will have the hardihood to deny.  All their gloomy prognostications and prophecies of the dire consequences that are likely to ensue if certain measures are taken to provide employment for that vast army of 120,000 potential producers, so that they can enjoy such a condition of life, do not impress us.</P>
      <P>Now, not being an economist or a financier, I have neither the desire nor the competence to indulge in a bout of mystifying jargon.  Experts can always floor an opponent by a copious discharge of vocabulary; the <i>status quo</i> never lacks learned defenders.  I would, however, remind my colleagues that this attitude of standing fast by the <i>status quo</i> is neither as impressive nor as convincing as it used to be. The world has grown somewhat sceptical of financial experts who have made such colossal blunders, and the people for whom we speak are convinced that a continuance of our present anomalous financial system will fail to solve our major social problems.  The ordinary man is incurably of the opinion that where there is a will there is generally a way, and that the experts' job is not to tell us what to do but to show us how to do what we want to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not discussing an abstract academic question of interest only to bankers and the well-off.  In this country we have great undeveloped resources and great potentialities of food-production.  On the other hand we have that 120,000 unemployed besides thousands of under-employed and under-nourished.  We have men able and willing to work and yet having no work to do; and at the time there is an enormous amount of constructive and productive work which needs doing and is not being done. The man in the street or on the land sees undrained, untilled, or half-tilled fields; yet he himself and others have insufficient food and clothing.  Learned economists try to persuade him that <Col N="880" /> the lack of something called money is responsible for poverty amid potential wealth.  And when he objects, he is called a monetary crank.</P>
    <P>The ordinary man is a realist; he knows that it is a question of physics plus organised human effort.  He refuses to believe that a man-made money-mechanism should be allowed to mock God's handiwork, and he believes that like other contrivances it must be made to subserve rather than dominate moral and social ends.  And no amount of technical terminology will shake him from this conviction.  I entirely agree and sympathise with the man-in-the-street in his conviction; though after hearing the Minister's speech last week I am very much afraid there is little hope of influencing the present Government. And when I say that, I cannot help recollecting that An Taoiseach himself has said on more than one occasion, I think, that if a solution for our social problems could not be found inside the system, then, he would have no hesitation in going outside the system to find one.  Even so recently as a few weeks ago the Minister for Supplies reiterated that statement.  In the course of a speech at a Dublin function he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The existence or otherwise of a large number of men unemployed through no fault of their own for long periods is the acid test of any system of government, commerce, or finance. If within the limits of the present system they could not cope with unemployment, then the system must be changed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister more than hinted on that occasion, too, that private financial institutions would not be permitted to stand in the way should they persist in an attitude of obstruction to the Government's plans, for he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An unduly conservative policy on the part of the banks might make the effects of the war on their economy much more serious than they need be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" />&ldquo;Banking policy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;was a vital factor in their national plans ... and must be subordinated to the Government's general plans for dealing with it.&rdquo;  Here, I submit, we have a profound difference of opinion on the part of the Ministry in their attitude towards this problem, and as to the methods that ought to be taken to remedy these social evils that so vitally affect the lives of our people, retard the prosperity of the country, and so seriously threaten even the stability of the State itself.  I suggest with all respect, Sir, that the situation demands a clear and unequivocal statement from the Ministry as a whole as to their immediate intentions.  Pusillanimity in this matter will be fatal.  To do nothing but merely maintain the <i>status quo</i> will, in my opinion, have the ultimate effect of driving these 120,000 potential producers to despair of the efficiency of Parliamentary methods to solve the problem of clothing, feeding, and housing themselves.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that a drastic reform will have to come, and I sincerely hope it will come by peaceful, orderly methods.  While appreciating the need for prudence and the advisability of gradualness, I also think that we have to consider the vital human needs of the propertyless.  I for one cannot acquiesce in the pessimistic conclusion that we should do nothing at all for fear of disturbing vested interests. The day may come, and come soon, when these same interests will be rudely disturbed by other forces.  Many conservatives may yet travel farther than the Labour Party, and, perhaps, fare worse!</P>
    <P>There is a curious delusion widespread among us that what is nowadays admittedly orthodox finance in all other countries would be rank heresy if applied here in Ireland. What I fail and have failed entirely to find is some real proof of our unique bad pre-eminence.  It cannot be our dependence on British trade, for that argument would apply much more strongly to debtor countries like New Zealand and Australia.  And, in this connection, perhaps I could not do better&mdash;even at the risk <Col N="882" /> of boring the members of the House for a few mniutes&mdash;than to indicate by quotations and by opinions how these countries regard this all-important matter.  On the 19th February, 1931, Sir Otto Niemeyer&mdash;whom nobody, I think, is likely to call a credit crank&mdash;issued a report, in which he advocated a central reserve bank for New Zealand.  Let me quote him. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order that the bank may effectively discharge its functions in regulating the credit conditions of the country, it should hold both the banking balances of the Government and the reserve balances of the trading banks.  Trading banks are bound to hold liquid reserves, and it is no hardship to them that these reserves should be concentrated in a reserve bank.  In fact it is usual that either by law or by custom they should be required to keep a certain percentage of their reserves with the reserve bank.  In the case of New Zealand, I would suggest that the requirement should be 7 per cent. of demand liabilities and 3 per cent. of time liabilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he says that internal need for payment in gold or sterling has ceased to exist for countries&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in which the central bank is responsible for the maintenance of the currency and must always be prepared to provide against proper securities legal tender for internal obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, this very conservative director of the Bank of England advised New Zealand to establish a central institution for regulating credit and providing money.  As is well known, this was carried out by a Conservative Government and has been elaborated by a Labour Government. Incidentally, I may remark that people like myself do not so much blame our existing trading banks but rather the Government for not providing a central institution to co-ordinate them and to do what no private bank of itself can do.  But, as I am not Sir Otto Niemeyer, I shall, perhaps, be called a credit crank for advocating that we <Col N="883" /> should do in Ireland what he advised should be done in New Zealand.  It is very puzzling!</P>
    <P>But, as suspicion may be aroused, owing to the fact that a strong Labour Government rules in New Zealand, I will turn to Australia.  Let me quote for you a sentence from the Budget speech which the Commonwealth Treasurer made in September, 1933:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever the United Kingdom may decide to do in this respect, it is important that we should retain our own right to fix our monetary unit at the point which is consistent with our own price level at the appropriate time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Douglas Copland is a well-known economist; he is professor of commerce in the University of Melbourne.  Let me give you a quotation from his book, <i>Australia in the World Crisis</i>, 1934, page 160:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The freedom of the Commonwealth Bank from some of the restrictions placed on central banks by recent legislation in other countries has been a valuable asset to Australia in the crisis.  The simple expedient of a controlled expansion of central bank credit for public spending has proved to be a more effective weapon for expanding credit and increasing spending than the more technical method of expansion through purchase of long-term securities; for no central bank has carried the latter method far enough to stimulate spending on a scale that would relieve the depression.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, of course, is merely a learned way to describe what has been called developmental credit for our own chronically-depressed country.  The difference between economics in Melbourne and in Dublin is very puzzling!</P>
    <P>Let me quote you some some further facts about Australia.  According to <i>The Economist</i> of 18th February, 1939, a Commonwealth loan of £72.6 million (Australian) was floated; and, as is usual in Australia, it was underwritten by the Commonwealth Bank, <Col N="884" /> which accordingly took up £6,000,000. To cite <i>The Economist:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commonwealth Bank took up the whole portion which remained unsubscribed, thus expanding central bank credit to this extent.  As the cash reserves of the trading banks had been falling steadily during the greater part of 1938, some expansion of bank credit was necessary, if restriction were to be avoided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This description is dignified, but the result of the operation was, in plain language, and to use Professor Copland's expression, the creation of &ldquo;a weapon for expanding credit and increasing spending&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Goodness knows, we want to increase spending here, to stimulate production by enlarging purchasing power.  But it is very puzzling to know why it should be right to do so in Australia and quite wrong to do so here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>So much for Australia.  Let me now move nearer home.  I propose to quote from an article called &ldquo;A Three Per Cent.  War&rdquo; published in that eminently respectable journal, <i>The Economist</i>, on 20th January, 1940.  The very title is interesting.  The war in question is, of course, the present conflict, involving enormous devastation and destruction.  But I, and the people we represent here are also interested in a war&mdash;a constructive war, a war against poverty and disease.  We would not much object to a three per cent. war against our bad housing conditions! This is how <i>The Economist</i> sums up its proposals, for the technical details of which I refer my learned colleagues to the article itself:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main outlines of a borrowing policy can be summarised in three propositions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The genuine savings of the people should be increased by every available means, including the severe restriction of all expenditure;</P>
    <P>(2)  Their genuine savings should be borrowed at low rates of interest;</P>
    <P>(3)  Any balance of the Government's requirements should be recognised <Col N="885" /> as being obtainable only by inflationary means and dealt with accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me make a few remarks on the first two points.  It is here advocated that genuine savings should be mobilised and made available to the State at low rates of interest.  This presupposes that the British Government can prevent foreign investments and can eliminate socially undesirable expenditure and imports; also that, through the Bank of England, it can bring down the rate of interest.  Now I think that we also should be engaged in a war, a very different war, a war against misery and the causes of just discontent.  Could we take any similar &mdash;even much milder&mdash;steps to carry on this war?  No; we could not.  For we have no central bank, no autonomous currency.  A man can export cattle&mdash; raised by the sweat and toil of Irishmen&mdash;and he can invest the proceeds in British War Loan.  That is, he can completely evade the primary reason for allowing exports at all, namely, the provision of socially needful imports.  He can invest his savings outside the country altogether.  There is no control and no means of control. Neither can our Government bring or keep down the rate of interest.  On the 25th November, 1939, <i>The Economist</i> insisted &ldquo;on a firm undertaking by the Government to force the rate of interest down with the utmost ruthlessness. The city may not like it; but the city should not be allowed to say that it is impossible.&rdquo;  Thus, in England, do they talk to financial vested interests, when there is a war on.  Lacking a national reserve bank, lacking an autonomous currency, lacking any control over foreign investments, we here are devoid of all equipment for pursuing a social crusade, a war of construction and development.</P>
    <P>Our banks here keep telling us that they are disinterested business undertakings, not concerned with such fancy items as social or national considerations.</P>

      <P>We lack any central institution for imposing on them social co-ordination and a unified national policy.  Not so in England.  <i>The Economist</i>, on 27th January, 1940, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The banks, acting with a cohesion which clearly indicates official prompting, have in recent months subjected their advances to a selective test and have terminated many facilities which were obviously out of tune with a war economy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And Mr. Reginald McKenna said at the recent general meeting of the Midland Bank: &ldquo;We feel bound to examine applications with first regard to national needs.&rdquo;  That would be rank heresy and mere faddism to the director of an Irish bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, indeed, very puzzling to observe the discrepancy between British economists and bankers and those in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, we see how New Zealand, on the advice of a director of the Bank of England, established a central institution for regulating its own credit and providing money; and how the Australian Commonwealth Treasurer regarded the retention of their own right to fix their monetary unit at the point consistent with their own price level at the appropriate time.  And, finally, we observe the essential outline of the plan put forward by a reputable British economic journal, of what it calls &ldquo;a consistent plan of mobilising the financial resources of the community in a struggle for the community's survival.&rdquo;  One rubs one's eyes in astonishment.  Was the plan denounced by the financiers and economists who read this journal? Not at all.  Was it derided as the concoction of some crackbrained amateurs?  Not a bit of it.  But when the Irish Labour Party puts forward similar ideas, expressed doubtless in less technical language, it is treated as ignorant and irresponsible by our financial pundits.  But it will be said: England is engaged in a war.  Precisely; and we say that Ireland too <Col N="887" /> should be engaged in a war or, if the phrase is preferred, a crusade against poverty and misery.  Great Britain is determined that the national savings should be available for the vital needs of the nation at a low rate of interest, say, 3 per cent.  And we say that our Government should have the same determination and should be equipped with the means of effecting it. Furthermore, it is proposed that the extra money required&mdash;martial credit so to speak&mdash;should be created at handling cost, say ½ per cent. per annum and we say that developmental credit should similarly be available in this country.</P>
    <P>In this country we have great resources capable of both long-term and short-term development for the satisfaction of basic human needs.  Side by side with this we have the enormous total of 29 out of every 74 adults over 14 years of age unoccupied or unemployed, equal to 39 per cent. of the adult population.  We have all the human and physical factors for a great social and economic advance.  According to the principles of these distinguished economists and financiers, all we need is proper monetary management, a credit expansion leading to greater output rather than to an increase in prices.  But our own learned men tell us that it would be dangerous folly for us even to equip ourselves with such powers much less exercise them. This is another contradiction which I find very puzzling.</P>
    <P>It used to be indignantly denied that our monetary system was under foreign control.  This extraordinary assertion is contradicted by the simple fact that our present currency is in every real sense identical with that of Great Britain, whose central bank manages for us as well as for them.  In any case we have recently had two of our Ministers publicly thanking the British authorities for their kindness and consideration in allowing us to manage our financial affairs.  In plain language, we have been caught out by the war. We took the advice of our pundits, and we now find ourselves completely entangled <Col N="888" /> in the British system.  But that is no reason why we should not even at this late hour take the necessary steps to effect our freedom.  We must not permit ourselves to be dragged up and down as the divergent interests of Britain dictate.  We are neither impressed nor intimidated by all the learned jargon of our economic pundits.  The dire plight of our 120,000 unemployed countrymen and countrywomen insistently calls for an adaptation of the monetary and credit policy of the nation so as to enable them to live a free, a full and a Christian life.</P>

      <P>I have listened very attentively to the speeches delivered by the Senators who advocate the retention of our present system of currency and credit, and I have also heard two very interesting speeches from the two Senators who advocate a drastic change.  I am over-impressed by the speeches which have been delivered, but I am rather disappointed that the Senators who advocate the retention of our present monetary system did not put forward some proposal by which the farmers could get more credit or working capital at the present time.</P>

I know very little about currency, but I do know something about credit and I am convinced, from my knowledge of the country, that something should be done to extend credit to farmers.  It is for the Government and for the banks to devise some means by which that can be done.  And it can be done without interfering with our monetary system.</P>

      <P>A scheme I proposed seven or eight months ago in the Seanad would meet the situation.  That <Col N="889" /> scheme was approved of by the best brains in the country, including Senator Professor Johnston, Deputy Dillon and members of practically all Parties.  It got a limited approval of the banks and it got the unanimous approval of this House in so far as recommending the scheme to be sent for consideration to the Agricultural Commission.  Still there was nothing done.  There was nothing revolutionary in the scheme.  It simply meant that the farmers would get an instrument from the Land Commission on the security of their land.</P>

      <P>I am discussing means of providing credit for farmers and this was one of the suggestions of providing credit for them.  If they could get that instrument they could go to the bank and borrow money at a reasonable rate of interest.  According to the Banking Commission Report the Government are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds every year in creating new farmers.  Would it not be more practical commonsense to try and put the existing farmers on their feet? In some cases it costs £1,124 to establish an individual new farmer and £900 of that amount is a free gift.  But still the existing farmers who have practical knowledge and experience of the working of land have now got neither credit nor capital owing to the economic war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will keep off that.  I agree with Senator <Col N="890" /> MacDermot that there is great danger that those fantastic schemes of currency and credit might get a considerable amount of support at the present time when the majority of our farmers are gasping for credit, when there is so much unemployment and unrest in the country.  We all know that you can get a considerable amount of support if you promise the people something for nothing.  It is human nature and this is not the only country in which that policy would succeed.  We have the example of an election not so very long ago in the State of Alberta when the Party who promised to put the Douglas Credit Scheme into operation got 100 per cent. of their candidates returned.  We had the example at home when the Fianna Fáil Party were elected in 1932 on the promises of derating, no annuities, reduction of taxes, full employment and good wages for all.  We can see how they succeeded and how those promises were fulfilled. The Party which Senator MacDermot refers to, can, I am sure, put up as plausible a case for the change of our monetary system as the Fianna Fáil Party did in 1932 and unless something is done to restore prosperity and give security to the producers of this country, the farming community, I am afraid that that Party will succeed in coming in and forming a Government in the course of a few short years. More unlikely things have happened. If that does happen the position in the country will be more disastrous even than that which Fianna Fáil created. As most of what I had to say, refers to farming and farming credits and as you, Sir, have ruled these matters out of order, I shall conclude by making an appeal to Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Professor Johnston and Senator MacDermot to try to avert this catastrophe.  The only way to do that is to get the Government to call a conference of representatives of the banks, representatives of the Government itself, and representatives of the farmers to devise some means to produce credit, a more extended form of credit, particularly for the farming community. If you do that you will save us from the disastrous situation which will otherwise possibly arise, judging <Col N="891" /> by the speeches made by the Senators of the Labour Party, who advocate a revision of our monetary system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week when this debate was started, I did not think that I would speak at all on this matter, but there were a few remarks made by Senator MacDermot and Senator Sir John Keane that rather annoyed me and I thought that if I got a chance of speaking I would say something in regard to them.  That, in turn, has led to a few other thoughts occurring to me which I think I might as well express.  In the first place, I would say that I think Senator Lynch was quite right that we should not have been let in for a lot of this debate.  The motion asked for a statement from the Minister in regard to the question of Irish currency and the link with sterling and instead of the Minister being allowed to get on with that statement, some other people butted in and treated us to very long statements.  Incidentally, the most important statement of all we heard here was the Minister's statement and, in my opinion, it did not get the attention in the public Press that it deserved.  The whole report on the matter, to my mind, was not at all satisfactory.  It certainly deserved more attention than it got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I should like to refer to the remarks to which I intend to reply in the first instance.  They have to do with what I consider uncalled for comments on the early Irish and on the Irish social system.  We were treated for some time to accounts of the raids and the plunderings that went on among the early Irish.  It is quite true that they raided and that they plundered and that they fought, but it is also quite true that other nations conducted themselves in the same way except perhaps that they were greater offenders in that regard than we happened to be.  We have to remember that even in these days of civilisation great raids have been made.  We had the great raids of the Black and Tans in Ireland.  We had great raids by other countries into India, Africa, Egypt, etc., and yet we did not hear <Col N="892" /> much condemnation of these people. Some of the people here referred to the fact that they had been studying the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i> and the <i>Annals of Loch Cé.</i>  It is to be presumed that, if these people have studied these manuscripts they are familiar with the Irish language.  If they are familiar with the Irish language, they will be familiar with the extraordinary knowledge and precise terminology that is to be found in these early manuscripts, a terminology which relates to sociology, political organisation and even to the economic organisation of the country as it then was. That whole political and sociological system has been referred to in the highest terms of praise by some of the greatest of thinkers and authorities. Some men who came over here from England to study our law paid a great tribute to the Irish system.  Have these critics of the early Irish system heard of Sir Henry Sumner Maine?  I would not refer to this matter were it not that these statements were made here in such a slighting fashion.  Such statements were entirely uncalled for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Senator to point out that it is those who support a change in the present system who say that it is not sufficiently Gaelic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Senator when he says that he does not know what the Gaelic economic system is.  In the past it was naturally, a very simple one.  It was not anything like the complex system we have to-day, so references to Gaelic economics and the solution of our present-day problems on such lines certainly mean very little to me. I should be glad if I could find anything in the Gaelic order that would help us out of our present difficulties. With regard to the whole problem, I should like to say in the beginning that I am in agreement with the statement made by the Minister.  I accept his statement and I think the policy he enunciated is the wisest for us at present.  Some of us who have made a life study of these problems are only now coming to realise how little we know about them and how careful we <Col N="893" /> should be in approaching them.  In discussing this matter, what I would rather have heard and what I would have appreciated very much, would be the presentation of some particular scheme that we might examine for what it is worth.  We had some lengthy speeches this evening and I was tremendously interested in them. But I really expected that the speeches would put forward something concrete.  It is all very well to tell us about the unfortunate position in which the poor find themselves but there is no use in telling us about that if no solution of their difficulties is put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the first points that occur to me in the order in which they are mentioned in the Minister's speech I should like firstly to deal with the question of the link with sterling. Frankly, I am in favour of it at the present time.  I do not see that there is anything else for us.  We are linked with sterling through force of circumstances. Other countries may cut away from sterling but only if circumstances permit them to do so.  It happens that you have got to buy where you sell and you sell where you buy.  That happens to be the position for us.  We sell practically everything we have to sell on the British market. I can well recall a period when I, like many others, thought that as soon as we got our freedom we would put the British in their place in regard to our trade and commerce.  A great deal has been attempted undoubtedly.  The previous Government sent its Ministers and its consuls to the four corners of the earth to see what they could do to open up other markets but they came back, as has been said, with one hand as long as the other.  The present Government has done its best also to find alternative markets but you are all familiar with the type of bargain that they have had to make. There is no market available to us at the moment but the British market.  I do not like to have to admit it but there is no use in pretending that we have any market but the British market for the time being.  So long as that is the position there is no advantage <Col N="894" /> to be gained by getting away from the link with sterling.  That market is a very important one, and, important as it is at the moment, it seems that it is going to become more important for us because it will absorb more and more of what we have to offer.  The result is that it is simply forcing the pace for us and making it still more worth our while to maintain the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of interference with the unit of currency, of appreciating it or depreciating it, whichever you will.  In this connection we must consider the question of the need for possible further borrowing. If you interfere with the currency unit and if it should happen, for one reason or another, that we want to borrow money in the future, it will very seriously interfere with the possibility of our getting that money for the purposes of government or for the purpose of maintaining neutrality, because, if more money is required in this way, it will be required in order that we may be able to maintain our neutrality.  If our unit is allowed to fluctuate up and down, it is going to have very grave consequences for the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the theories in general, I do not propose to go into them&mdash;for years past, I have examined I do not know how many schemes&mdash;but if we care to study the two volumes of the Report of the Banking Commission, we will find an extraordinary variety of schemes propounded, presented and discussed, for the solution of all our social and economic difficulties. In all fairness, I must say that I think these schemes got fair consideration by the Banking Commission.  The people who presented them got every opportunity to present their case.  So far as I can make out from these reports, if a witness felt that he was not in a position at the moment to go ahead with a discussion, he got an opportunity of retiring and considering it, and then coming forward again. There is not much point in going into the various schemes, but one of the persons who presented a Minority Report to the Banking Commission <Col N="895" /> ideally summarised the position&mdash;he himself wrote a Minority Report because, for some reason or other, he did not find himself able to sign the Majority Report&mdash;when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The advocates never get as far as analysing clearly what will happen eventually to this mass of artificial money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That summarises the position in regard to all these different schemes.</P>
    <P>Some people here think that we should have a separate currency unit for the home trade and another for the foreign trade.  There is no need to go into that.  Senator MacDermot dealt with it in his speech and his references to it can be found in the Official Reports.  I do not propose to go into it again.  All I want to say is that it just would not work.  Other nations have been free to do as they please in the past, and they are free to do as they please at the moment, and if that proposal to have a separate unit for the home trade and for the external trade would work, you can take it from me that these nations would have solved all their social and economic difficulties long ago and, as a matter of fact, there would be no evils confronting these nations at present.  Some people say, in effect: &ldquo;Let us break away from sterling and let us get some kind of a unit of our own.&rdquo;  That is the slogan we hear so often.  &ldquo;Let the Irish pound,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;find its normal level in accordance with the law of supply and demand.&rdquo;  That is the usual statement that one hears, but that scheme will not work either, for the simple reason that the moment you start interfering with the monetary unit, that very moment you start interfering with the law of supply and demand, and you are back where you started.</P>
    <P>This whole question of the fixing of the value of money and the amount of money depends on what we call legitimate and commercial and financial operations.  There is little use interfering with them.  There is an idea that these financiers and others are doing things by sleight-of-hand, <Col N="896" /> that they are able, as they say in the country, to build nests in our ears, but they just cannot.  There are as clever people in Ireland dealing with economics and sociology as are to be found in any country in the world, and, if these schemes would work, they would have discovered that fact and recommended them.  Incidentally, with regard to all this railing at the economists, it is an extraordinary thing that you find unanimity among Irish economists on this matter, and they are men who have rendered service to the nation and who are willing to render service and to make sacrifices.  They would not willingly deceive their people.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the possibility of getting away from sterling and linking with the dollar.  The only thing I can say about that is that I should like to draw a line under what the Minister said last week.  I was interested to hear him say that he had considered what would have happened had we gone over to the dollar after the break in sterling in September, 1931, and what would have been the position then.  I did the same thing. I considered the possibility of transferring, and I considered the value of securities.  I do not know how many I took&mdash;the Minister said he took 400, which was pretty wide and pretty safe. I did not take anything like that, but I came to the conclusion that if we had gone over to the dollar, we would have suffered a great deal more than we suffered by remaining on sterling. What is against our going over to the dollar at all is that we do not trade with the United States.  We just cannot go trading with Britain and then transfer our wealth from Britain to the United States.  In that connection, there is one thing which the Government might consider, that is, the possibility of getting our exiles to do something about our trade.  For instance, in, I think, 1938, I worked out a little calculation with regard to our trade with the United States, and if you examine that trade and compare it with the Irish-born members of the population of the United States, you will find that it works out at about 1/5 per head.  In other words, the <Col N="897" /> native Irish in the States do not buy even one dollar's worth of goods per head from this country in the year.  If they would buy one dollar or two dollars' worth from this country in the year, there would be a possibility of our becoming a little independent of Britain and of transferring and linking up with the dollar.  There might be some sense in that.</P>
    <P>There is the question of depreciating our currency in terms of sterling.  So far as I can gather, people are not at all keen about appreciating it, but they are anxious that we should depreciate it, and they think that that would bring about more virile trade, better trade conditions and more demand for our goods.  It might, just for the time being, but this much is pretty certain, that if we depreciate our £, we are going to pile up enormous difficulties for the industries we are trying to establish.  Depreciate the £ and you are simply adding to the agony of the people engaged in the development of industry here.  You are piling up trouble for them and increasing their costs.  As it is, there is no need to worry about a market for Irish produce. As a matter of fact, the position at the moment is that this country cannot supply the markets available.  We are not able to supply the market at home in many commodities, and we are certainly not able to supply the market across-Channel.  For years that has been the position.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the possibilities of the situation, I should like to say that a great deal of our monetary trouble has arisen because of the fact that the whole economic order of this country was tremendously interfered with by Britain in the past.  As a matter of fact, the British Statute Book is studded with Acts that have been passed by the Government, year after year, for the purpose of repressing our trade.  You might start with the Navigation Acts of Queen Elizabeth, and come along down through the Woollen Acts, the Linen Acts, the Glass Acts, Provision Trade Acts, and many other Acts that were passed, right down to the advent of the Act <Col N="898" /> of Union, the very clauses of which finally, killed our industries.  These Acts were the cause of our failure to accumulate funds or to accumulate capital and so be able to develop here and provide in full measure employment such as other small countries have been able to provide.</P>
    <P>In that connection, there has been some talk about Denmark having done so much in the way of providing work for her people, and also with regard to New Zealand.  Now, that has not been done because of a monetary policy, but simply because of the application of science to industry and because of the peculiar ability of these people and the extraordinary amount of energy they put into their work.  I might recall certain facts to you.  Let us take the period from the Act of Union or, say, from 1829 or 1830.  Let us consider our agricultural industry, which has always been our most important industry and is still our most important industry.  What was there to prevent an extraordinary expansion in that industry?  There was scope for that expansion.  Take butter.  We have been exporting for a number of years, only about 25,000 tons of butter to Great Britain per annum.  This small export is not so much due to a matter of money, as to other factors.  I have a few figures here that I should like to quote in order to show what has been happening with regard to our exports of butter to the British market as compared with the exports of other countries to that market.  The average exports of Irish butter for many years are about 25,000 tons.  The exports of butter from Denmark in 1910 were about 86,900 tons, her exports in 1925 were 130,150 tons, in 1929, 156,200 tons, and in 1931, 168,650 tons.</P>
    <P>Now, all over the time since 1830, I think nobody will deny, our agricultural industry got every available assistance in order to enable it to take advantage of the British market and to expand generally.  Money was poured out on technical education, on breeding schemes, and so on, to help our farmers to take advantage of the <Col N="899" /> British market for live stock, dairy produce, butter, eggs, and so on.  To what extent did we take advantage of all that?  Denmark is ever so much smaller than we are and is handicapped in other ways, and yet she has been able to take advantage of that market to the extent I have indicated. The same would apply to New Zealand. Senator Campbell referred to what has been done in New Zealand, but it is extraordinary how that country has been increasing its exports of various commodities to Great Britain, and that is what has been of such considerable help to New Zealand in getting away from the £ and being able to do things that we cannot very well do here.</P>
    <P>I shall give you a few more figures with regard to New Zealand.  In 1928, New Zealand was exporting to Britain &mdash;a market which was open to us all the time&mdash;1,158,234 cwts., and in 1930 that had increased to 1,553,725 cwts., and in 1937 it was 2,903,005 cwts.; there you have the complete evidence as to how these people took advantage of that market while we have failed to do so.  Of course, there have been obstacles here, historical, and the recent economic war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And the civil war before that.  Was not that an obstacle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but perhaps I could give another illustration as to the way in which New Zealand has been able to do the things she has done &mdash;and, of course, she has not done all the things that have been claimed for her.  The estimated yield per cow, in terms of butter fat production, will better illustrate the position.  In 1906-07 it was 124 lbs., in 1914-15 it was 160 lbs., 1921-22 it was 174 lbs., in 1925-26 it was 179 lbs., in 1928-29 it was 210 lbs. and 1936-37 it was 228 lbs.  That is an extraordinary increase in production, and it is the extraordinary expansion in production that has occurred in these countries that has enabled them to expand their currency and credit as they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, there is no limit, <Col N="900" /> so far as I can see, to the amount of currency that can be created in this country, except the extent to which we ourselves limit production.  The scope that exists for production in every branch of industry here is, relatively, unlimited, and if we were to increase production, then the money would increase.  There is no use in saying that it is because of a lack of credit that production is not being brought about, because the money has been made available, and a lot of it was free.  You cannot describe the Agricultural Grant as anything but practically a free grant to aid that particular industry.  The same applies to the halving of the annuities.  That, in its own way, is a free grant to aid the agricultural industry.  Then you have all the various other schemes that were made available.  The unfortunate fact, however, is that we have not been able to take advantage of them, and our producers do not seem to be able to rise to the occasion and increase production and so increase money or their standard of living.  What is really wanted, I think, is more hard work, and then the rest will follow.</P>
    <P>On this question of the banks, I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the banks have not a monopoly of that whole matter of money here.  The Government is willing to provide it in almost unlimited quantities for production, if it gets a fair opportunity and a fair return for doing so.  Apart from that, there are many other institutions, such as insurance companies, investment trusts, underwriters, and so on&mdash; you might say that they are linked up with the banks, but they are on the whole independent just the same. There is no monopoly here by the banks.  The Government is providing credits for the acquisition of new farms, improvement of existing farms, and for industries generally, and yet we are not satisfied.  The banks have been attacked also because it is claimed that they are not giving a fair crack of the whip in the matter of the extension of credits or in the matter of fair rates. Well, I suppose a great deal could be said as to whether the rate they are charging is fair or unfair, but it is worth while recalling the figures given in connection <Col N="901" /> with this matter of rates before the Banking Commission and these figures have never been challenged.  For instance, 24.5 per cent. of the banks' advances are made at rates under 3 per cent.; 10.8 per cent. of the advances are made at rates between 3 and 4 per cent., while 61.2 per cent. of the advances are made at rates between 4 and 5 per cent.  In other words, 96.5 per cent. of the advances made by the banks are at rates under 5 per cent. You may say the question is whether the rate should be 4 per cent. or 3 per cent., but there is no use in trying to deceive the public into believing that the bank owners are getting 5 per cent. or more, because they are not.  I do not like to be defending the banks&mdash;I am not defending the banks&mdash;but there is little use in deceiving ourselves&mdash;we have to face the facts.  The banks are not getting 5 per cent.  If a bank does get 5 per cent. on an advance, what becomes of the 5 per cent.?  It has got to pay for its services.  It has to pay its employees, to maintain its organisation and to pay interest on a considerable sum of money deposited with it.  You may say the rate of interest it pays is mighty small, but by the time it bears its expenses and then pays those who deposited the money with it and for the various services necessary to guard those deposits, it has not very much left.</P>

      <P>It is claimed that the bank pays 17 per cent. or 12 per cent. in dividends, and people tell you they saw it in the reports on the balance sheets.  Does anybody know any man who got 17 per cent. or 12 per cent. on his money from the bank?  I heard Senator Counihan say some time ago that, out of a bacon factory, I think it was in Castlebar, he got 20 per cent.  He is tremendously interested in the farmers.  Why does he not protest against that and do something about it?  It is unfortunate people like widows and orphans, as so many of the bank shareholders are, who have their money invested in the <Col N="902" /> banks, and when it is worked out you find that they get very little more than the rate paid by the State on its loans. They will not get more than 5 or 6 per cent.  It is not a matter of defending the banks but of placing the facts as they should be before the people and not deceiving them.  A question has been mentioned here this evening and it has been mentioned so often that I intend to refer to it.  It is this 120,000 unemployed.  I wish to goodness that the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I think he is responsible&mdash; or the Minister for Finance, would go and tell the people the facts.  There are not 120,000 people unemployed in this country nor anything like it.</P>

      <P>The only thing I can do in that connection is to suggest that you read the introductory notes to that particular section of the Statistical Abstract which deals with employment, unemployment and so on. The people who compile the figures have set forth the facts there.  If you think they are not right, that is all there is to it.  All I can do is to take the facts as I find them, coupled with my own observations throughout the country and I can assure you that like Ceatharnach Ní Dhomhnall I am pretty well on the move about this country and if there were 120,000 unemployed in it I assure you one would easily see them.  References have been made here to Portugal.  Some people seem to think that miracles have been wrought in Portugal and that such have been brought about by financial policy.  Portugal was a very backward country and in view of that, any man having anything like dictatorial powers could show pretty good results in it.  It will however be a pretty good while before Salazar will have brought the standard of living in Portugal up to the standard of living in this country.  When he does bring it up to the standard here we will be interested in seeing what he does then.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, but we are discussing this whole question of money and the possibility of money solving our difficulties. My claim is that it is not money that is the trouble.  Money is purely passive.</P>
      <P>With regard to this question of the poor, I may say we are all very interested in the poor but we are not all agreed as to how their difficulties should be solved.  I would like to ask Senators: to what extent are many of the poor really in need of food and clothing?  The Government some time ago decided that it would adopt a scheme which got a lot of abuse, the scheme called the free beef scheme. That was an excellent method of providing people who deserved it and really wanted it with good meat.  What, in fact, happened to that scheme?  It had to be abandoned; and why?  It was because the people took up the meat and, as it were, threw it back in the face of the Government; they said, in effect: &ldquo;We do not want your meat&mdash;what we want is money.&rdquo;  Let us consider what is happening to most of the money paid out in dole and relief.  How much of that is really being spent on meat and on food generally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not an attack on the poor; it is a matter of drawing attention to the difficulties which exist in connection with the problem. It is said that it is lack of money to buy food that is the cause of the trouble.  I am drawing the attention of Senators to this, since we are all anxious to find a solution of the difficulty. Consider what happens in some cases when a society or individuals give out blankets to the poor.  If one inquires in a week's time and asks where are the blankets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are where money was made available on them. So, too, in many cases when food was provided the people would not take it; they wanted money.  It might be said that the people objected to that method of providing relief, giving it out in the form of food; it might be said they would rather receive the money and buy their food wherever they wished.  There may be something in that, but I am not quite so sure that that is the position.  I would like to believe that it is, but it is hard to do so.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to review the whole of a big question such as this; I prefer to take a particular point or scheme and to discuss it.  Discussion, such as this, is very valuable, and I can assure Senators that I, like the rest, also feel rather worried in trying to find a solution.  It seems to me, however, that if we go on stirring up people's minds with the idea that money is the trouble, that the bankers are robbing them, that industrialists are robbing them, that everybody is robbing them, it may very well happen that people would be brought to such a stage of uneasiness that very serious trouble would result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the word was used, but I am referring to the type of propaganda that is being carried on.  It could happen&mdash;though I do not believe that it will happen in Ireland&mdash;that trouble would follow from it.  As I say, I do not believe it will happen in Ireland, as there are so many people who are capitalists, whether we like the term or not; the working farmer is a capitalist! The people with a few shillings in Savings Certificates are worried about their capital just as are many who invested theirs in banks or in England or elsewhere.  I do not believe we will have anything like a landslide here in favour of such new ideas.  The schemes <Col N="907" /> which we have been discussing for some time will not work.  People who have had special qualifications and who have examined them thoroughly are agreed that they will not work.  There is no use in upsetting the people and working them up to such a state that they may throw out the present system and bring in another without realising its consequences.  If such occurred, I am afraid it cannot be denied that conditions would be far worse than those existing at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in his speech last week, made a statement which seemed to me to be very satisfactory. He said that the Government were watching the position from day to day and that if they considered a change to be necessary they would make that change and would not hesitate about it.  That was a very reassuring statement on the Minister's part and one which, in my opinion, gives us further reason to deal calmly with the various problems which are facing us just now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O Buachalla said something which was terribly true, that one hesitates to enter into a discussion of this motion at all.  He told the Seanad that he has been studying this question for a great number of years and that the more he has studied it the less he seems to know about it. I suppose that ought to be enough to make anyone who knows very little about it, as I do, sheer off and at least keep as far from this discussion as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing, however, that Senator MacDermot put down this motion.  One might say that I am standing in the middle of the road as I am neither orthodox nor unorthodox. Still, I feel that a considerable amount of abuse has been showered from one side on the bankers and from the bankers' side on unorthodox financiers. I think we may as well recognise the fact that this whole question of money is perturbing the minds of the people to a very considerable degree.  It may be that they are in complete ignorance of all of the technique and, as Senator <Col N="908" /> Campbell has put it, that the jargon connected with it may be responsible for much of the talk and for what some people choose to describe as the &ldquo;wild talk&rdquo;.  But, make no mistake about it, while you may charge some people with initiating schemes and advocating policies which may be going to bring ruin and desolation on the country, on the other hand there are many people who are convinced that the <i>status quo</i> is not a situation which can continue safely to be accepted in this country. I agree, of course, with a great deal of what the Minister said in his speech.  I agree that if we get away from parity with the present £ and if we appreciate our £ the farmer here is not going to be satisfied.  When he gets back the price of the cow from England and finds fewer pounds in Irish money, it is not going to please him.  Yet, I would just point this out: from day to day&mdash;or, anyhow, from month to month&mdash;the value of the £ alters as far as the Irish farmer is concerned, and I can say here, irrespective of what Senator MacDermot may say in reply&mdash;that my £ would have bought more in the February fair than it will buy in the March fair.  The value of the £ and its purchasing capacity is, therefore, altering from month to month.</P>
    <P>I agree, on the other hand, that if you depreciate our pound, people who have savings stored up are going to be poorer.  There is this consideration in the minds of a good many people and they advance it to-day.  The position we are in and the position England is in at the moment is that we are tied down to sterling and, while the Minister says that the Government is watching the situation from day to day and that if the necessity arises they are going to take certain vital decisions, one must ask when would those vital decisions be taken and at what point would a depreciated pound determine our people that the time had come for them to get away from it.  If I have sterling assets which I would like to-day to realise and put the proceeds into American dollars in order to safeguard my savings for the future, I cannot do it.  The Government here will not permit me to transfer my <Col N="909" /> savings into dollar bonds.  You can transfer your money from an Irish bank to an English bank, but you cannot transfer that money into an American bank even though you are satisfied yourself that your money will be safer in an American bank.  I cannot do that to save my savings, while on the other hand, apparently, the Government are so concerned for the savings of the people that they deem it wise not to take any action which might depreciate the value of the pound.  That is a rather conflicting situation with which to be confronted.  Questions are being asked by a great many people.  A number of our citizens are perturbed as to whether or not the value of the English pound will even remain at approximately 13/- as against what it was worth some time ago.  They see a situation where Britain is being forced to sell her dollar securities to purchase necessary imports and war materials, a situation continuing where she must get out of a considerable amount of her gold and a situation where she is not able to balance her imports by her exports in conjunction with the sale of her securities or even of her gold.  Such a situation develops with increasing speed, and might very well happen in a prolonged war.  What is the value of the pound going to be in future? Thousands of people are asking that question in this country to-day, and it is awfully difficult to give an answer.</P>
    <P>There does seem to be something contradictory about Government policy which prevents these people from realising their securities to-day and putting them where they think they would be safest.  These are questions that are being asked and, I think, to some people anyhow it is not too comforting for the Minister merely to say that the Government are watching the situation, and when the time comes to make a change they will make a change. The people wonder, if they try to get away from the pound, what will the pound be worth at that particular date and how many dollars will the pound buy when they try to get out of it.  That is the sort of problem that we are set. It seems very difficult, looking at it as I have been trying to do, with very <Col N="910" /> little information and, I am sure, with very little capacity indeed.  One is always disturbed by the conflict between the trained economists like Senator O Buachalla and bankers like Senator Sir John Keane and Senator MacDermot.</P>

      <P>That is part of our trouble.  It seems to me that there is necessity for a development in this country which cannot take place without more money being made available. I am quite convinced about that. Whatever Senator O Buachalla or Senator Sir John Keane or anybody else may say, I am quite convinced that the land of this country is considerably undeveloped.  I could answer Senator O Buachalla with regard to the comparison he makes between New Zealand and our country by pointing out that they have had stable Governmental conditions in New Zealand for a very long time; they have had no struggle with a foreign power such as we have had; they have had no civil war or economic war or any of these other difficulties which have dissipated our energies and our <Col N="911" /> resources and taken away much from our industry and even from our own physical and mental capacity to tackle these problems.  I do not want to go into that now.</P>
      <P>In this country there are continuous appeals for more work.  I say this truthfully and with knowledge: there is no use talking to the agriculturists of this country about doing more work if they have not got the capital to enable them to do work that is there to do.  Senator O Buachalla points out what the banks have been doing and what the banks are prepared to do.  The experience of a great many people in this country is that it is really difficult to borrow money from banks.  I am not making that as a charge against the banks because I realise that the banks are entrusted with the savings of others.  They have got to be careful; they cannot take risks.  They have got to be sure.  The first thing the banks must do is to ask for such security to keep these savings so safe that they are doubly and trebly secured.  The next thing seems to be that they must demand a rate of interest or a payment for the service of the money which in the agricultural conditions in this country to-day and for a considerable number of years past is out of all proportion to the return which can be got for the money.  If you were thinking at all of the human beings who have to use that money or of their families or of the fact that the first charge that ought to be on that land is the support of the people who do the work, then you might somehow try to pay the interest which is demanded.  As I see it, money in this country to-day is asking more for its service than the other units that are employed in production can get for their services. That is the real problem.  That is the major problem in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is that situation that is driving people to talk about the Government taking action themselves and issuing money, issuing securities, that will enable people to go and work.  Talk like that is not to be heard in this country <Col N="912" /> alone.  You get bankers talking like that, and very distinguished bankers.  Perhaps I never understand the language of bankers and perhaps again Senator O Buachalla is right that the more you study this whole problem the less you know about it, but I notice that the people who talk about the banks issuing credit have a very good authority for such talk in the speech by the Right.  Hon. Reginald McKenna, who has been quoted already.  At the Midland Bank's annual meeting he said something like this: &ldquo;The reality behind all questions of war finance is the huge demand which warfare makes on the power of the nation to produce goods for immediate consumption.  The demand can be met to a large extent by the expansion of production to the uttermost.  Through the use of additional bank credit, not only can the recorded unemployed be absorbed but numbers of men and women not hitherto engaged in productive work can be drafted into industry.  Up to the stage of full employment there need be no inflation as the enlarged bank credit can be offset by greater output.&rdquo; I would not take on to interpret what that means and put any other interpretation upon it than the interpretation that would be put upon it by either Senator Campbell or Senator Lynch if they were here.  I did not hear Senator Lynch.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of problem that we seem to be faced with in this country. It is almost impossible to reconcile the situation which exists having regard to the accumulated savings of our people.  I do not agree with Senator O Buachalla that our people have not achieved something.  Despite the fact that we have had so much restrictive legislation against our race and nation in the past, the fact to-day is that at worst we have stored up somewhere about £250,000,000 in sterling, and I think £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 of that is the property of the Government in one form or another, such as money lodged in court or post office savings or something like that.  We have accomplished something, but what perturbs our people is that there is productive work which should be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> Who will argue to-day that if you put capital into the land and produce crops, you would not have goods which you could sell next harvest?  The truth about it is that neither the banks nor the Government are rising to the fundamental demands of the land to-day. I think I can speak on this subject even with more information than Senator O Buachalla.  There is no use in pointing out that we have not marched step by step with Denmark or New Zealand.  There are obvious reasons why we would not be able to do so.  Mind you, you cannot build up a prosperous agriculture in six months or 12 months.  You have frequently to drain the soil before you can till it. You have to put a great deal into it before you can take anything out of it. It takes a great many years to build up a good dairy herd.  These are the problems with which you are confronted in building up a prosperous agriculture.</P>
    <P>The position in this country for a number of years past has been that we have taken much more out of our industry than has been put back into it.  There is a demand for credit and it is not being supplied.  The problem of the unemployed is there, too.  My view is that we would have very few unemployed in this country outside the larger cities who could not be absorbed on productive work on the land if the capital were made available at a sufficiently low rate of interest to make it attractive.  I would do the job myself if it were given to me and if I could get the money sufficiently cheaply.  And I would save the money; it would not be squandered.  There would be goods produced against it that could be realised on the market in 12 months' time.  Mind you, when you are confronted with that position, it is not enough for the trained economist to just point out in a rather negative sort of way that there are all sorts of difficulties that cannot be surmounted, and to add in addition that the more such economists study the problem, the less they know about it and the more fearful they are of tackling it.  After all, this is only a small country.  We know it practically from end to end.  We know what is over the ground and <Col N="914" /> under the ground.  We know how many people we have, how many are able to work and the kind of work they are just able to do.  We have savings, and anyone who has respect for thrift, and who wants to see a community developed here, greater in numbers and influence, would be very unwise to advocate a policy that is going to mean that these people's savings will be watered down to such an extent, or so dissipated, that you are going to destroy the spirit of thrift for the future.  I do not think you are going to build up a virile race on conditions such as these.</P>
    <P>I believe the people who point out the dangers of extended credits, had better be wise in time because if some plan is not presented&mdash;and I suggest the onus is on them to present us with a plan that will get us out of the difficulties of this under-productive position which we occupy at the moment, a plan which will give us a chance of putting people working at the kind of work which these people can do in an industry which can employ them, and which can produce goods which can be sold&mdash;I have not the slightest doubt we shall have plans from the extremists.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla said that we require more money to maintain stable conditions, that we require more money to keep neutral.  I believe, myself, that we require money most of all to-day to maintain stable conditions. The maintenance of stability will safeguard our neutrality, and it seems to me that some of our trained economists might sit down side by side with these trained sociologists to try to evolve a plan of the character I have indicated. A few of them, whom I could name, are just as distinguished in their sphere as are our very distinguished economists and are very disturbed about conditions as they are.  They are unhappy about them, and they are just as courageous in pointing out the dangers for the future as was Senator O Buachalla in his very courageous speech this evening.  It is a rather big problem, and I do not think we are going to solve it by heaping coals of fire on the heads of the bankers whose <Col N="915" /> job is first of all to conserve the savings of the people, savings honestly accumulated in the past.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, you have these over-conservative people who would urge that nobody like myself should argue that there are dangers in the present situation, or should argue that unless they do something, other people will do something rather more drastic. I do not rise to propound a solution for this problem.  I confessed my inability to do it from the beginning, but I am none the less as disturbed about it as anybody on my right or on my left.  While at the outset, it was suggested that Senator MacDermot's motion was something in the nature of a question that might be put before a debating society, I believe, myself, that there is a very great necessity to devote more attention to this question&mdash;and I suggest that the attention should come, not from one side alone&mdash; that if the bankers are to keep the savings of the people, there is a way of making sure that these savings will be kept, and that the bankers will have to come cut and find a plan by which these savings can be made available for the development of the country at a price to the people who take the savings that will make it worth these people's while to utilise them. If some plan like that cannot be produced, I am quite convinced that other plans will be produced, that the risks and dangers which have been pointed out by Senator O Buachalla and Senator MacDermot himself will be brought appreciably nearer and that that development will not be to the advantage of the people as a whole.  While I know that Senator O Buachalla feels that our agriculture is undeveloped to a large extent, and undeveloped, as I get the impression from him, by reason of the fact that our farmers are not doing their job, that we have not made use of the means at our disposal to the extent which other countries have made use of these same means, I respectfully suggest that Senator O Buachalla has yet quite a good deal to learn about agricultural conditions and about what our farmers have done. I assure the Senator and others, however, <Col N="916" /> that there is not going to be real progress in this country until Irish agriculture can find all the means of production that are essential to it, and find them readily, and at such a price as will make it worth its while to take them.  These are not the conditions to-day, and if you are not going to ally these people with others very much more extreme, you will have to produce a plan that will make that possible and workable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that, more or less by a sort of tacit agreement, the particular subject of discussion laid down in the motion was, in fact, practically exhausted with the statement of the Minister on the last occasion, and that what has happened now is that the Seanad has moved on to a consideration of a good many of those semi-financial questions, which undoubtedly at present are attracting a good deal of attention, and which represent a good deal of disturbance in the public mind, and that what you have to-day, if I may use the expression, is a sort of free-for-all in relation to currency subjects and problems of that kind.  Listening here, as I have, as a student of this question, as one who is very anxious not merely to understand the question but to understand what people are really thinking about it, I find myself in the great difficulty that the same words are being used by different people, apparently with entirely different meanings.  I am perfectly sure that Senator Baxter in using &ldquo;money&rdquo; in the sense in which he has been using it uses it in an entirely different sense from that in which a great many others are using it.  He says in relation to agriculture that if he had enough money to do this, that and the other with it, he himself would be prepared to take the responsibility of making, with that money, a new Heaven and a new earth here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking now only in general.  I am simply trying to get <Col N="917" /> the atmosphere of the thing.  He says that if he had enough money he could do this.  If he had all the money in the world, he could not do anything. If he had all the money in the world, he could not alter the position in respect of an acre of land in this country, or in respect of the stocking of any farm.  That is only possible in relation to the things into which he could transfer back money.  Money, in that sense, cannot be manufactured. There is a sort of idea that you can manufacture purchasing power.  You cannot manufacture purchasing power. You can redistribute purchasing power; you can reorganise it; you can change the control of it; you can make it more or less efficient; but you cannot manufacture it.  Purchasing power is the possession in one person of something for which another person is prepared to exchange possession of goods or services, and that cannot be increased by any of the means by which it is now supposed it can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of honest confusion on this matter and I believe that 99 per cent. of the mistakes, confusions and controversies going on in relation to this matter at present, not merely here but all over the world, are entirely honest.  They represent the honest seekings of people for something better somehow.  The money which could be used for such purposes as Senator Baxter refers to, is either that command of goods, that capacity to acquire goods or services, which is in the possession of some people here which we could transfer from those who are not using it properly to those who might use it more properly, or that command of goods which is represented by the investment of £200,000,000 or £300,000,000 worth of goods value which we previously exported, and which did not return to this country, and which we call investments overseas.  If the State was in the position that it had control of that £200,000,000 or £300,000,000 worth of command of goods overseas which is possessed by individual people in this country, and were prepared to use their command up to the reality of ownership, in relation to that money, <Col N="918" /> to convert that command of goods overseas into actual goods, and were in a position to import them, and if they imported the kind of goods that Senator Baxter wanted, then what he wants to do could probably be done in relation to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The first thing, however, is that those goods do not belong to the State. The second thing is that, even if the goods did belong to the State, it is probable that the goods which Senator Baxter wanted to import into this country to use for his agricultural purposes would not be available.  I will take only one particular case, which I think would be in his mind, because I do not know how he would expend £200,000,000 or £300,000,000 worth of goods-command at present, but he would undoubtedly use some of that goods-command and transfer it into artificial manures&mdash;which are not, in fact, available for import now.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I had no intention of speaking to the matter and was speaking more out of courtesy in relation to what has been said already, and I should not like the fact that I am speaking to interfere in any way with the proceedings of the House. I agree with Senator O Buachalla in his remark that money, in the currency sense, or the sense in which the <Col N="919" /> word &ldquo;money&rdquo; is ordinarily used, has not anything like the significance that people imagine.  I am quite satisfied that it has some significance, and that if you had the optimum amount of currency at a particular time and if you had that degree of prophecy which would enable you to change that optimum amount in order to meet all the conditions&mdash;if there were the optimum control of it and all that, it would definitely have an influence, but nothing like a major influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is confusing people's minds to some extent, I think, is the apparent success which the control of money in some other countries is seeming to have over their conditions.  What I would suggest there is that it is not money which is doing it; it is the fact that money is being used and the control of the money is being used by a Government very largely to substitute for the machinery of government. I shall take one of the authoritarian countries like Germany or Italy, or such countries.  Germany is a very good example of a case where the whole of the money&mdash;not merely the currency, but the whole of the command of and the capacity to buy and control goods and services which is the reality represented by money&mdash;is, in relation to every individual citizen of the State, and as a totality, controlled by the Government.  Given that degree of control, it is not necessary to legislate.  The person who controls the whole distribution of and the rates of flow in the various channels of money, is able to say without any legislation whether agriculture shall be benefited at the expense of industry or whether a particular type of agriculture can be benefited at the expense of another, or how, within an industry itself, its activities are going to be controlled.  What happens in practice there is that a man may nominally own the factory which he has and the bank balance which he has in the bank, but when he goes to the bank to draw that money he is told that he can only draw it at a certain rate and that he can only draw it to buy goods of a particular character or to buy raw materials of a particular character.  If <Col N="920" /> he is engaged in making umbrellas and they think there are too many umbrellas, he is told that he can only use a certain amount of his money for buying the raw materials of umbrellas and that the only other use he can make of his money will be to buy the raw materials of some other manufacture which is more required by the State.</P>
    <P>By the same process of control of money, without any legislation, they are able to say whether or not particular industries will grow or fail, and they are able to decide that labour, which is at the present moment engaged in one industry, shall be transferred to another because it is only in that other industry that the credits or the use of money&mdash;his own money&mdash;will be allowed.  For that reason, a great deal of what is now apparently regarded as being due to currency control is not due to the currency in itself; it is due to the fact that there has been taken into the power and possession of a State organism that authority over the lives of the people of which the currency control is merely the expression.  I believe that, if you doubled or trebled the currency&mdash;and there is no difficulty whatever in so doing&mdash;the maximum amount of benefit you could get from that variation would be very small and the maximum amount of disturbance you could get from the wrong variation might be very considerable.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch took the case, which I think is perfectly right, that in fastening ourselves to the parity of sterling we were fastening ourselves to something which varied and which varied according to a law which was outside our control.  In America they speak of the &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; dollar.  We might just as well in this country speak of the &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; pound.  The variations are there, and the investigation which has recently been made, both by Senator O Buachalla and the Minister for Finance into the supposititious case of what would happen if we had been tied to the &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; dollar instead of the &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; pound, is probably the first investigation of that kind, at any rate that I know of, <Col N="921" /> that has been made in relation to that question in this country.  It would be a very interesting question to go back over a period of years and compare what would have happened if we had been fastened to one rather than the other of the &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; currencies.</P>
    <P>Now, before the Great War, as it was called, currencies varied to a very small amount.  Even a variation of a couple of cents in the value of the American dollar relative to the £ was regarded as remarkable; it was also seasonal and the circumstances of it could be predicted on the basis of the season, as to whether or not they were exporting cotton or something else.  After the war, however, for a certain period the whole basis in the relationship of exchanges, one to another, seemed to go entirely hay-wire, and during that time it ceased to be possible either to prophesy what was going to happen or to argue from what had happened as to the reason why it had happened. Broadly speaking, however&mdash;and I think it was fairly well illustrated in the period after the war&mdash;while all those things tend to vary, eventually they seem to find a stability of their own. Even if currencies in different countries have varied in that wild way, they settled down again to a value which is based upon goods.  And after a time you find that though the French franc is 240 to the £ instead of being 20, that if you go to France or Belgium you find your money is about as valuable as it previously was.  I am entirely with those who say, in so far as I understand the proposition, that, in so far as they cannot solve the riddle inside the system, they are prepared to go outside. By that I mean that I am prepared, and everyone who has any responsibility for it is prepared, to do anything which is necessary and to make any changes which are necessary which will in fact deliver the goods of a better organised human society but, saying that, does not mean that you are going outside the system for the sake of going outside the system or going to try something of which you do not know the meaning.</P>
    <P>I have read everything that has been <Col N="922" /> written, practically, on this subject&mdash; at any rate a perfectly representative specimen of everything written on the subject.  I have been trying all my life to find that magic solution which will enable these things to be done and, the more I read of these expedients, the less I understand them and the more convinced I am that the people themselves who are adumbrating them do not themselves understand them. As Senator O Buachalla summed it up perfectly in relation to all these additional and artificial credits which we are asked to create, no one seems to be able to tell us what is going to happen to them in the end.  You can trace them back to the first process of use but, after that, they seem to become entirely nebulous.  If there is any solution along those lines, everyone of us must be prepared to meet it, but until it is shown in some candid and consistent fashion how this new thing is actually going to work out, we have no right to move away from the existing system.</P>
    <P>There is one particular report in the Banking Commission Report to which a great deal of attention has been paid. It consists of three parts.  It was a minority report by one member who is a Deputy of the Dáil.  The first portion of it consisted of extracts from the Encyclicals.  The second portion consisted of a statement of what was desired to be done and the third portion consisted of what was intended to be an explanation of how it was to be done.  I take that as being a typical example of what occurred.  I read the whole of it about four times.  The first portion I neglected because, in my opinion, it was completely irrelevant to the subject.  It would be difficult to improve one word of the second portion &mdash;that which related to what was desired to be done.  But, time after time, I read that portion which was practical, which was to explain how it was to be done and I could make no meaning of it good, bad or indifferent. Now I have read, as I told you, a great many of the other cases and in the same way you start off very well and eventually it becomes words, words and more words, until, if it was <Col N="923" /> diluted with another word, there would be nothing but words.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch raised the point, merely exemplifying as he was perfectly entitled to do&mdash;the rubber nature of the £.  He said money invested in securities and so on at the beginning of the war would have had a certain value and now a very different value. As a matter of fact what has happened, so far as the British stock is concerned, is that both in relation to gilt-edged and to ordinary stocks they started on a fairly high level, dropped considerably and have recovered to a considerable extent in their value.  Take 4 per cent. Consols.  On 31st March, 1939, it was 104; on 29th September, 1939, it was 98, and is now 109.  The 3½ per cent.  War Loan on 31st March, 1939&mdash;I am giving only round figures&mdash; was 95.  In September it was 88½ and it is now 99.  The Financial News Indicator for 30 ordinary British stocks stood at 80.2 on 9th August and dropped continually until it reached 66.9 and it is now back again somewhere around 75.  I agree entirely that there is no relation whatever between the variations of the British £ and the necessities of this country, but there is no evidence at the present moment that there is any other rubber currency to which we might fasten ourselves definitely at the moment with better results.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter raised a point when he said that the greatest difficulty was what we should do in the matter.  We all recognise the difficulties, and the best thing that anyone can do is to watch and to see if anything can be done.  He complained that people were not permitted by the Government of this country to &ldquo;straddle&rdquo;&mdash;in other words to exchange British securities for dollar securities.  Well, they are perfectly entitled to sell the British securities&mdash;there is no difficulty about that, but it is not possible to grant facilities to invest the proceeds in America and other countries.  To do so would mean providing such persons with the necessary foreign exchange and that is the difficulty.  In the present circumstances it has been considered <Col N="924" /> advisable to ensure that foreign exchange must be used for essential imports only.  I think that is a regulation which everyone would be prepared to endorse.  It has already been necessary to restrict imports of certain luxuries because they use up foreign currency.  The continuance of essential imports is much more important for the welfare and interests of the general community than is the question of safeguarding the investments of individual security holders.  That is the whole object for which that particular thing has been done.</P>
    <P>Senator Buckley raised the question of the 120,000 unemployed.  I am not going into that to-night farther than to say that I agree with Senator Buckley.  Before such figures were presented in this particular way&mdash; before 1932&mdash;the total number of people on the unemployment register was roughly speaking about 28,000, including something like 22,000 who were entitled to draw unemployment insurance benefit and about 7,000 &ldquo;others&rdquo; and the figures are relatively the same now for those particular things.  I do not know what they are at the particular moment because there has been a certain inflation recently due to re-immigration but leaving this year out of it, there has been practically no change in those figures.  The addition of the other figures has been purely statistical. What has happened is that 66 per cent. of the total people who are on the unemployment register are not people who are in the ordinary way employed or unemployed people at all. They are mostly small farmers and their relatives.  They are people who have other means of subsistence and they predominantly exist in the western and the congested areas. Perhaps some Senators may be familiar with the maps showing the distribution of unemployment in this country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary but might I ask what the congested areas on the Western seaboard have got to do with the question of currency?  I might also through your good offices, Sir, <Col N="925" /> ask him if he would kindly explain exactly what relation the no-income tax campaign has with sterling currency. I can certainly see no relevance between the congested districts on the Western seaboard or in Connemara and the Gaeltacht and the question of currency.</P>

      <P>I believe I was being as courteous as I could to this House in dealing with the discussion which the Senator had not heard.  The vast majority of these people are on that Western seaboard and they have always been there.  They are poor people.  Our register of unemployed is not a register of unemployed in the ordinary sense; the register includes people largely unrepresented by unemployment insurance. The vast majority of it is represented by the agricultural population who have an insufficiency of land, an insufficiency of production value on which to live; and, during a certain period of the year, they are at present being helped by the justice and the generosity of those in the rest of the country who are better off.</P>

      <P>If it were possible to find a system which would solve this riddle, no convention and no prejudice of any kind in relation to existing things should stand in our way.  I do not believe that currency changes as such are going to solve it or even that they are going to be a considerable element in solving it, but if there is any system which can be worked out that will do so, no convention of any sort, kind or description will stand in the way of the adoption of such a system.  However, it is not right that people should seek to go outside a system merely for the sake of going outside it.  Those who desire that have the onus thrown upon them to show that, not merely the ideals and the purposes they have can be attained, but that there are exact methods by which those ideals and those purposes in this matter can be attained.</P>
