      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, at the end of Section 13, to add the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every officer and servant of a sanitary authority to whom this section applies shall be deemed to have entered into a contract under which he undertakes that he will not withhold his services in furtherance of a dispute until a period of not less than two months shall have elapsed after notice in writing of such dispute shall have been served on the sanitary authority of which he is an officer or servant.</P>
      <P>Upon receipt of a notice of a dispute the sanitary authority shall as soon as may be forward to the Minister a copy of such notice together with a statement setting out all the relevant facts with reference thereto and the Minister shall before the expiration of two months from the date of such notice advise the sanitary authority as to the steps which he considers should be taken in reference thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to add <Col N="1022" /> anything to what I said on the Committee Stage.  It was suggested by Senator Foran, I think, that the wording might be improved and, consequently, I have changed the wording. I gather that the Parliamentary Secretary's objection was solely that he thought the same principle or some similar principle, at any rate, should apply to practically all public services, and that he did not like it done in one case only.  My answer to that is that we have no power here as far as others are concerned: we have before us a Fire Brigades Bill which is to make specific provision for fire brigades all over the country.  As far as I can judge public opinion, it is that there is no case whatever for a lightning strike in the case of a fire brigade and that a period of delay is not only reasonable but one which should be accepted by all sections of the community, including labour, provided it was uniform and part of the conditions which the men accepted.  For that reason, I would like to urge the House to make some provision, and if the Government, as I hope, do decide to deal with this and other similar matters, it would be very easy to repeal this particular section so as to make it uniform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, a similar amendment was discussed on the Committee Stage, and, as Senator Douglas has reminded the House, I stated on that occasion that I considered that, if the principle were a desirable principle, it should apply equally to other essential public services, having in mind such services as water supply, public lighting, public health services, and food supplies. Notwithstanding what Senator Douglas has said, I still hold the view that if a far-reaching principle, perhaps a desirable principle, such as this, is to be incorporated in legislation it ought to have general application to the other equally important, or perhaps in some cases more important public services. <Col N="1023" /> I may say that the Government are examining the whole position in relation to the sudden dislocation of essential public services and other services, and if the Government decide as a matter of policy that legislation on the lines suggested by this amendment, or on other lines, is necessary or desirable, such legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas, but, pending a decision by the Government on that matter of policy, I cannot recommend the acceptance of the amendment before the House.</P>
      <P>Personally, laying aside the question of principle involved, I cannot see that this amendment would bring us very far.  The amendment would put a statutory obligation on the officers and servants of a sanitary authority to give two months' notice of their intention to withdraw their services if certain grievances were not redressed.  The sanitary authority would be under a statutory obligation to forward particulars of the matters in dispute to the Minister, and the Minister would be under a statutory obligation to advise the sanitary authority what it had to do.  I cannot see that that machinery is going to get us anywhere.  Presumably, the Minister, in the discharge of his ministerial obligation, would advise a sanitary authority in such circumstances without necessarily having a specific statutory obligation put upon him in relation to the matter, but suppose that either the sanitary authority, or the officers or servants of that sanitary authority, refused to accept his advice how much farther on are we as a result of the Minister being under a statutory obligation to tender such advice?  Anyhow, I cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment. As I say, the principle involved is being examined by the Government, and the result of that examination will probably be available in a reasonably short time.</P>

      <P>I think I should press this amendment.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had been in a position to <Col N="1024" /> give an assurance that the Government were prepared to deal with it, I would, of course, have withdrawn the amendment, but he can only say that if the Government do make up their mind at some future time to deal with the matter, then it will be dealt with.  I think this is a case, where a Bill comes before the Seanad, that the Seanad should have an opportunity of indicating its opinion.  I would not press it if the Dáil still point-blank refused, but I still think that we as a revising Chamber should not withdraw everything that seems to us to be of some good simply because it does not meet with the approval of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary in charge.</P>

      <P>This amendment certainly concerns the trade unions vitally.  It is not clear to us why Senator Douglas is so concerned with this matter.  He surely knows from his experience that the trade unions are responsible bodies and that, speaking for their members, they would not lightly withhold services in the particular service specially referred to here.  Trade unions, speaking for their members, have always deplored hasty or any kind of hurried action in matters of this character and always would deplore the taking of hasty action where essential services of this kind are concerned.  But it must be understood also that when we are dealing with trade unions and their members we are dealing with the vital liberties of the citizen.  Every citizen is within the law entitled to exercise <Col N="1025" /> himself and his rights, and it would be a dangerous thing to put serious limitations on such rights.  When we are dealing with trade unions we must take into consideration that we are dealing with a volume of public opinion which has been given a specialised status in law.  That had to be done, and it would be well for Senator Douglas and those who think on similar lines that they would have regard for that specialised position which has been accorded to the trade unions in our code of law.  In regard to the matter before the House in this amendment, trade unions have already in many capacities agreed to limitations of the character indicated. Those, however, are limitations which they have imposed on themselves in contract with their respective employers. In our opinion, having regard to that peculiar position occupied by the trade unions in modern society, it were well that they were left in that free position of dealing with their employers as they have dealt with them already, and not to impose statutory restrictions and limitations on them. They are quite capable of acting in a responsible manner, as they have acted already, and it were well that that position should not be statutorily disturbed.</P>
      <P>Already we have quite a considerable volume of Government machinery for dealing with disputes of various characters and various types.  That machinery might be developed.  We have conciliation machinery under the Department of Industry and Commerce; we have the Arbitration Act of 1919; and in various ways of a voluntary character we have machinery which is quite capable of dealing with disputes of all kinds, characters and descriptions, and we would suggest that there might be a development of that machinery rather than that there should be a statutory obligation imposed on the individual, and outside of his trade union, which, in our opinion, is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the matter which the amendment proposes to deal with.  We therefore think that this amendment should not be pressed, but that, rather, there should be a development of machinery already in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to a Fire Brigades Bill.  It has reference only to the procedure which will take place before fire brigade men exercise their right to strike.  The particular amendment here deals with only one class of public servant, and it does not withdraw from these public servants the right to strike.  The amendment itself does not contemplate compulsory arbitration or any limitation upon the right of a trade union to which these particular people might belong, except one limitation, and that limitation is that a period of two months must elapse before a strike actually takes place.  I think that, perhaps, Senator Lynch did not advert to that.  The Parliamentary Secretary's objection to the amendment is that it raises a question of general principle, and therefore should not be inserted in this Bill until the Government has had an opportunity of examining the whole matter and of bringing in a comprehensive measure. Now, I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the House that the question of fire brigades is a special matter in itself, that it deserves attention at once, and that no principle dear to the hearts of trade unionists is being interfered with by this amendment. I myself would not support this amendment, or any other amendment, or any motion, which purported to take away from the workers the right to strike&mdash;a right which they have, and to which they are entitled, and which has given them very considerable improvements. Whether the losses involved can be avoided is another question, but I for one would not be in favour of removing that right, and I am supporting this amendment because it does not remove that right but does meet, in a particular way, by imposing a delay of two months, the very urgent and peculiar case of fire brigades.  I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary also that, if the Government is examining the question generally and is going to bring in general legislation, and if, before that, any case involving a fire brigade should arise, this amendment would enable you to have a delay of two months, which might be very valuable.  With regard to the objection that the matter is one <Col N="1027" /> that should not be dealt with in a particular Bill or for a particular class of workers, and that it should be dealt with generally, I think the Parliamentary Secretary's own experience of legislation will at once demolish that particular argument.  No difficulty will arise, and if the Government are determined at any moment to bring in a general measure they would merely have to insert a sub-section somewhere repealing this particular section in the Fire Brigades Act of 1940, and that would be that.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I rather disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary, and with Senator Lynch.  I think this is a matter which is urgent, that this particular amendment should be tried, and that it would reflect the opinion of the Seanad, and the opinion of a great many citizens, and, I suggest, Sir, the opinion of the majority of our fire brigade men: that is to say, that before action would be taken, a delay of two months should ensue.  The amendment does not remove the right to strike, but it does fill a gap between our present situation, which has been proved to be a very difficult and objectionable one, and the time when the Parliamentary Secretary says the Government will introduce a comprehensive measure, with which measure, of course, we might not be at all in agreement.  Governments at all times have a habit of moving very slowly, and I very much doubt if we will see this measure within two months.  I, therefore, think that this amendment is very desirable, and is one which would fill in the period before the Government brings in the measure that has been referred to.  I think the amendment is one which does not infringe upon the right to strike, or upon the principles on which trade unions are built and have been operated.  I think the amendment should be adopted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I was not convinced by the remarks of either the Parliamentary Secretary or Senator Lynch.  As Senator Michael Hayes said, we are dealing with a Bill that is concerned with fire brigades. The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, <Col N="1028" /> then referred to a wide general programme, analogous to this matter, being considered by the Government. It is quite easy for it to happen, however, that the Government&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;might decide, in taking in the whole thing and every aspect of it, that they would not change the general principle.  It might easily happen that, whilst in nine cases out of ten a proposal such as is here would not be the best thing to do, it would be the best thing for a fire brigade.  In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary said that since it is only a matter of fire brigades that is concerned here, there might be classes of public services, such as water supply and so on, in a different position, and that what might be right in one case might be wrong in another case.  Well, I suggest that if the water supply of Dublin were cut off, some time would elapse before it would be a hardship.  For instance, we had the major part of the civic services of Dublin cut off for a considerable time a short while ago, and we did not suffer so very much as a result&mdash;in fact, some of us began to wonder why we were paying so much for these services.</P>
      <P>The only case analogous to that of a strike by a fire brigade, I think, would be that of a strike by the medical profession. You might have a man who was liable to die unless an operation were performed immediately, and if the doctors went on strike and refused to perform that operation, I think it would be criminal.  The same might be said with regard to the fire brigades. Now, Senator Lynch talks about the trade unions as responsible bodies, and I have no doubt they are, but there are degrees of responsible bodies.  We talk about a responsible Government.  That is a body which is created, and is directed towards the good of the people.  I am not so sure that the same description could be applied to trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator then spoke of the basic rights of the human person.  I entirely agree that one has a perfect right to refuse to give one's labour, but when one does give labour, one enters into a sort of contract.  If the labourer can throw down his tools at any moment, and if, at the same time, he is protected <Col N="1029" /> because his employer, the local governing body, cannot tell him to leave his work and stop his pay immediately&mdash; there are terms in the contract as to what notice will be given him&mdash;you might say that it is an infringement of the basic rights of the public body that they have to continue a man at work for a week or for a month after they have decided to get rid of him.  The Senator also spoke entirely in terms of trade unions.  We have had such things as lightning strikes, and I think I am not being unjust when I say that I have known such things as unauthorised strikes.  After all, trade unions only exist, and only have a right to exist, for the people who are members of them, and I maintain that those people, irrespective of what their trade union says, would have the right to strike and to refuse to work and, incidentally, to put up with whatever was coming to them.  The union only acts as a protection there.</P>
    <P>There have been unauthorised lightning strikes, that is to say, the men have not given notice and the trade union has not previously sanctioned the strike.  The union then comes in, and if the employer says: &ldquo;Those men are finished; we are not going to employ them again&rdquo;, I think that the probable line of the trade union would be not to say: &ldquo;We are a responsible body&rdquo;, but: &ldquo;We will now have a real authorised strike, unless these misguided men are taken back.&rdquo;  The trade union cannot give any guarantee. It has no more right to insist upon a man working than anybody else, and if a man decided not to work, a trade union has no power, statutory or otherwise, to force him to work.  All it can do is to withhold its support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A very serious sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, and a much more serious sanction than that proposed in the Bill and, if you like, a much more serious infringement of basic human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A member subscribes to that when he subscribes to the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1030" />
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and I presume that if this amendment were accepted, a man taking employment as a member of a fire brigade, knowing that he was entering into a contract whereby he would not withdraw his labour without giving two months' notice beforehand so that the matter could be considered, in the same way as his subscription to the trade union was an act of his own free will, and accepting these conditions which are not onerous or unjust, would be entering into a contract and accepting that limitation.  Is that limitation against his own personal rights or is it in the interest of the general public good?  To my mind, it is eminently in the interest of the general public good, because a man employed in a fire brigade has, by his lack of action, his refusal to operate at a given moment, the power to inflict immediately serious injury on the general community leading to loss of life or loss of property.  On the other hand, as I understand the proposal in the amendment, it is that a man being put in the position of having that awful power by negative action of creating serious injury to people will enter into a contract to give two months' notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter portion of my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember any alternative that vitiates what I am saying.  I cannot see that it is any hardship that a man must give this two months' notice which is in the terms of his contract.  On the other hand, even with the trade union, I think those men would be in a position&mdash;and I do not think that this proposal would take it away&mdash;in which they could say that they were not going to act.  This does not apply any legal penal sanction.  The fact that the trade union accepted these terms in the contract would merely mean that if a man acted in that arbitrary, unjust and most imprudent way, the trade union <Col N="1031" /> would recognise that he had brought whatever was coming to him on his own head and would not use their machinery to force a local body to take him back when he had proved himself incapable of keeping to the terms of his contract.  I would not support this proposal if I thought it gave the Government, a local body, or anybody else, the power to insist that a man should give what is intimately his own, his labour, whether he wanted to or not, but a man is acting most intimately as himself when he enters into a contract containing provisions, strictly in accord with justice and the public good, that he will give this notice, and when he accepts a position whereby the public will be dependent on him for the preservation of life and property. I cannot see that the Senator has made a case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>From what the Parliamentary Secretary said I am not clear as to whether he is in a position to give a definite pledge that the Government are introducing legislation in the early future to deal with industrial disputes.  If he is prepared to say that definitely, and if he also says that the Government are in sympathy with the principle of this amendment, I should be inclined to accede to his request and to support him in the suggestion that the matter be left over until the general measure is brought in, but if he is not able to give us either of those assurances, I shall, on the contrary, feel inclined to support Senator Douglas's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not conveyed the impression to the House that the Government would, without doubt, introduce legislation along the lines of this amendment dealing with this particular service and other public services. I stated quite definitely that the Government were examining this <Col N="1032" /> position and that if they decided on the principle, and on extending that principle to the other essential public services, and possibly other services, the necessary legislation would be placed before the Oireachtas.  I want to be quite clear that I am not giving any undertaking whatever that the Government will introduce such legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding regarding the attitude of the trade union and labour movement to the amendment, I want to say that the essence of the amendment is embodied in agreements between large employers and large trade unions in the country.  It is an undertaking entered into by the trade unions, but what is likely to create opposition, hostility and misrepresentation throughout the country is the fact that this is to be imposed by the Government on what is regarded as the working class.  That is the only difference between us.  Senator Lynch mentioned the machinery which the Government have at their disposal for the development and enlargement of the agreements which I have mentioned.  If the conciliation machinery which the Government have available were exploited to a much greater extent, I believe there would be no need for the embodying in legislation of an amendment of this character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is calculated to do the greatest possible amount of harm.  It will not do away with lightning strikes in essential services, and a greater effort on the part of the Government to make its own conciliation machinery more acceptable would, in our opinion, be the proper line to take.  I think <Col N="1033" /> Senator Lynch dealt with that matter very extensively.  Already some of the most powerful trade unions, together with some of the largest employers in the country, have agreements which provide for two months' notice at least before there is any stoppage of work. Of course, that does not interfere with what Senator Fitzgerald deplores, and what we all deplore, that is, the right of the individual to have a lightning strike if he feels that it is going to serve his purpose.  It cannot be denied to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  Compulsory arbitration has failed and failed lamentably in Australia and it will fail here.  The other method of putting it into operation will never be tried here. At any rate, what are essential services? Once you start getting into that question there is no end to it.  I agree that fire brigades should be removed from the possibility of lightning strikes.  That can be provided for if the members of the fire brigades are members of trade unions.  The trade unions will not encourage the members of a fire brigade to cease work on short notice.  That is generally conceded by the trade unions.  It would be deplorable to have in the fire brigade men who would withhold their services on the occasion of a conflagration or in case of a big accident.  Nobody would stand behind action of that kind. We believe that the Minister for Local Government could impose on local authorities the responsibility for seeing that some arrangement such as is visualised in this amendment is embodied in the regulations governing the employment of members of a fire brigade without having any specific <Col N="1034" /> legislation for it.  That is briefly our attitude in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been in the main two types of criticism on this amendment.  The Parliamentary Secretary thinks that it does not go very far, and Senator Lynch and Senator Foran think that it goes too far.  That kind of position is almost inevitable if you try to put forward what seems to be a middle course.  The only criticism I have received from outside the House, since a similar amendment was put down before, was that it was ridiculous because it did not provide that the fire brigade could not go on strike in any circumstances whatever.  I stated on the last amendment that I was opposed to the provision of any such clause in this or any other Bill, at any rate until every other conceivable method had been tried of obtaining a proper public service.  I should like, first of all, to deal with the point raised by Senator Lynch and Senator Foran.  I do not want to go into the general question of trade unions, because that will probably arise on another motion of a more general character which will come up for discussion at next meeting.  As I have already expressed my views on that motion, and as I shall have another opportunity of speaking on it later, I shall not take up the time of the House in dealing with that question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that this is a Bill which is making statutory provisions for fire brigades.  Section 13 of the Bill deals with the conditions under which members of a fire brigade are to be appointed.  On the Committee Stage I brought in an amendment the effect of which was to provide that sanitary authorities should, in making appointments, insist on certain conditions. The conditions were, in effect, the same conditions as you have in this amendment.  Senator Foran thought that the wording was not as clear as he would like.  As a result, I had a talk with a prominent member of the Labour Party&mdash;I am not referring to anybody in this House&mdash;and it was on the suggestion of that prominent member of the Labour Party that I changed the wording to provide that every servant should be deemed to <Col N="1035" /> have entered into a contract.  That was not my wording and was not my way of putting it.  I am, therefore, very much interested to see that Senator Lynch has cast doubt upon it, because, as I say, that was the wording I adopted on the suggestion of a prominent member of his Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>At the moment, I am simply stating where I got the idea from.  I am not at all in favour of unanimity inside any Party, and I am not criticising Senator Lynch for a moment.  I hate to see it.  I never calculated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely asked, for the information of the House, what legal significance would be taken from the wording: &ldquo;shall be deemed&rdquo;.  I have seen that phrase used in cases where legislation was not under consideration, but what legal significance has it in this particular amendment?  It has given me considerable thought, and the Senator would perhaps relieve my anxiety by explaining what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Senator where it came from, and I shall now tell him what I think it means.  Sometimes it is a mistake to be over anxious to try to reach a measure of agreement, because you find yourself obliged to adopt a form of wording which is not necessarily your own.  It is not at all an uncommon thing to provide that a person shall be deemed to have certain obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original provision I endeavoured to provide that in appointing a member of the fire brigade the sanitary authority should insist, as a condition of his contract, that he would not withhold service without notice and that the notice should not be of any shorter period than two months.  It is a perfectly common and reasonable thing to provide for two or three months notice in the case of contracts. These contracts are made between individual workers and employers and <Col N="1036" /> sometimes they are made collectively between groups of employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>In this case we are dealing with what is a public authority, and we are providing that this public authority shall be deemed to have made that contract with any person it employs.  That is a statutory provision, and the objection of Senator Lynch to it is, to me, extremely interesting.  It has been the practice of Labour members again and again in this House to seek to provide in certain enactments that certain authorities shall pay trade union wages.  That is going outside the ordinary bargain that a trade union, in the ordinary way, would make with any particular public body.  Other provisions are made&mdash;and I think quite properly made&mdash;when you are dealing with public bodies.  It has not been a general practice, and I agree with my Labour friends in hoping that it will not be the practice in this country, for the State to intervene in an ordinary private enterprise and to impose over and above everybody concerned certain specific conditions, and to provide that if these conditions are broken those guilty of the breach shall go into an internment camp.  I am not in favour of anything so drastic as that, as I think my Labour friends know, but where you are dealing with public bodies, it is perfectly reasonable to make provisions such as are outlined here.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the Parliamentary Secretary says that it does not get us very far.  I have more sympathy with that point of view than with the point of view of Senator Lynch.  It may be said that the notice should not be less than three months, but I am not dealing with that at the moment.  I cannot see that there can be any points of view about this amendment except three.  One is that you remain as you are at present, that is, that the individual member of the fire brigade can, whether his union likes it or not, go on strike without notice.</P>
    <P>Another is, whether the man likes it or not, his union can themselves order him to go on a lightning strike.  The third alternative is that you place such workers in a class by themselves and <Col N="1037" /> remove all the provisions of the Trades Union Acts and virtually make it impossible for them to strike at all, but there is a half-way house.  The half-way house I suggest is a period of two months&mdash;I would not object to three&mdash; but the point I am making is that I cannot see how you are going to get any further towards getting a longer time except by going the whole way. I hope it will never be necessary to go the whole way, but I think there is a very strong public opinion that there are certain services in which, in so far as they are public services, the lightning strike is not a proper method to adopt to deal with grievances.  If they are public services, it is quite reasonable <Col N="1038" /> to make statutory provision for them.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to divide on this amendment because, as Senator MacDermot has said, we have no undertaking that there will be an alternative put forward on behalf of the Government.  If there is such an alternative, there is no difficulty in repealing this provision, and in view of what is happening in this country I am convinced we would be neglecting our duty if we did not take steps to deal with the matter when a Bill regarding fire brigades is before the House.</P>

We had some discussion on the matter before, and he was unable to give an idea of the cost.  A certain obligation is being imposed on local bodies, and he must know, or the Department must know, all about the matter and the number of bodies likely to be affected, and he should be able to give some estimate as to the cost.</P>

      <P>Such investigations as I have made as to the probable expenditure under the Bill when it becomes an Act may not completely satisfy Senator Hayes.  It was stated before, when we <Col N="1039" /> were discussing this particular problem, that it is utterly impossible to estimate accurately in advance&mdash;or to estimate, even with approximate accuracy &mdash;the expenditure under such a Bill as this.  The expenditure will be governed, firstly, by such important factors as the extent to which fire fighting services have already been provided by a sanitary authority, and secondly, by the extent to which a sanitary authority is prepared to establish and maintain a fire fighting service, and the amount of money they are prepared to spend on it.  It is true that we are aware of the fire fighting services which have been established already, but we cannot anticipate with any degree of accuracy how far sanitary authorities will act up to their responsibilities in the matter of operating this Bill.</P>
      <P>In so far as we have information in relation to areas where fire fighting services are maintained, the figures which I have before me may perhaps, satisfy Senator Hayes and ease his mind&mdash;if not put it completely at ease.  In Cork County Borough, the cost of the fire fighting services maintained there is about 2½d. in the £; in South Cork, in the rural part, the cost is 1/20th of a penny in the £; in Dublin City it is 5¼d.; in Dun Laoghaire it is somewhat more than in Dublin, but under the new conditions a contribution will be obtained from the rural area.  The cost in Dun Laoghaire is 7½d. in the £ at the present time.  In South Dublin the contribution to Dun Laoghaire would amount to about 2d. in the £.  Taking a fairly large urban area, such as Dundalk, the cost is about 3d. in the £. Taking into consideration the areas in which an adequate fire fighting service is already established and being maintained, I think it would be safe to assume that the average cost would be in the neighbourhood of 3d. in the £, and that the total would amount to about £150,000.</P>

He did not answer the question for the purpose of satisfying my mind. <Col N="1040" /> He has a duty to the public, and so have we all.  I asked the question for the purpose of informing the House&mdash; and, through the House, the public&mdash; of what the cost would be.  It took a great deal of trouble to bring him to the point of making the estimate; he gives it rather grudgingly and seems to be rather vexed that there should be anybody in the Seanad with the temerity to say: &ldquo;Here you have a Bill; do you know what it is going to cost?&rdquo;  It is not for a personal reason that I want to know, though I am paying rates; it is merely in the fulfilment of a public duty.  The conclusion he comes to is that the cost would be about 3d. in the £ upon the rates for this particular service, and I am glad he did, even reluctantly and even at the last moment, give us some information.</P>

      <P>This Bill is on similar lines to a Bill passed in 1932.  Certain county councils put up schemes to the Department last year by which they proposed to facilitate applicants, who were unable from their own resources to provide money at that time, to make arrangements with merchants in the various counties. These schemes were submitted to the Department and were approved of. This year similar schemes were put up by a greater number of councils. Twenty-three counties have put up schemes this year.  Last year schemes were received from only nine counties. The schemes have been availed of to a limited extent.  I think something like 6,000 applicants have been supplied, but I think a greater number will be supplied this year.  Counties have put <Col N="1041" /> up different kinds of schemes.  In one county, for example, the arrangement is made that the applicant goes to the merchant and the merchant secures him.  In that way there is no loss to the council.  If the councils find that they have any benefit we have no objection. So long as there is no loss, we do not object, but it requires legislative sanction to give facilities of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious to everybody that this is a Bill to authorise and validate the provision and sale of seeds and manures&mdash;in other words, to legalise what the county councils have done.  This Bill is absolutely useless as far as the ordinary farmer is concerned.  That has been clearly shown in the amount that was applied for last year under the same head.  According to the Minister's statement, I think, only 6,000 applied in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, which shows that it is useless as far as the ordinary farmer is concerned.  I support the measure, as I believe that in some cases, particularly in a few of the western and southern counties, it will be of some use to small farmers.  I support it because I believe that anything advanced in that way to the farmers will be paid back to the county councils but, as far as the ordinary farmer is concerned, it is absolutely useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of propaganda about the shortage of seeds and manures.  I think that there will be no shortage of seeds and manures this year and that there was none last year. The merchants cried &ldquo;Wolf.&rdquo;  They went to the Department of Agriculture and represented that there would be a terrible shortage of Spring seed wheat and oats.  The Department of Agriculture instructed some of those merchants to go off to Norway to buy seed wheat. They bought seed wheat which would not be termed wheat at all by the ordinary farmer, stuff called Diamantes. They brought back thousands of tons of it.  Very little of it was used.  Of course, before they bought it they had a guarantee from the Department of Agriculture.  It remained in the hands of the merchants and was handed over eventually to the millers to be made <Col N="1042" /> into flour at an enormous loss to the Department and to the country.  The same thing was happening this year, but I do not know if there was a guarantee. There was the cry again that there would be a shortage of Spring seed wheat and oats.  Enormous prices were being charged&mdash;£3 and £3 5s.&mdash;for Spring wheat.  Last Thursday I saw representatives of those merchants hawking their wheat and oats in the cattle market and inducing farmers to buy it for cattle food.  I want to bring the matter before the notice of the Minister.  I do not think it is quite right that under the present circumstances perfectly good wheat&mdash;as good as anything sold last year for milling purposes; the majority of it is the best English milled wheat&mdash; should be sold for animal food.  I have seen it offered in several places at 30/- a barrel.  The only objection to it is that it has been a little stained to show that it was imported wheat and could not be sent to the millers, but that stain is a vegetable dye which would not in any way interfere with it for milling purposes.</P>
    <P>The same thing would apply, I suppose, with reference to fertilisers. There are fertilisers in the country, more fertilisers than the farmers have money to pay for.  As the majority of the extra tillage this year will be done in the rich grazing lands of Leinster, the farmer's concern will be not how to force his crop but how to keep it back, for if we have a wet season he will not be able to reap the crop.  But, with all the propaganda that, if the war continues long enough, there might be great danger of a shortage of these stuffs, I believe that when the real danger comes nobody will pay any heed to the cry of the merchants.</P>
    <P>There are some points which I would like to raise in this House if the Minister for Agriculture were present, but I do not think it would be quite fair to put those questions to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. There is one thing he can do for the farmers, and that is to try and give them derating of agricultural land. He can use his influence in the Government and his influence with the <Col N="1043" /> Minister for Finance to provide more credit or working capital for farmers. Denmark fed England in peace time. Now, when the war is on, she will have to feed Germany, and, with Denmark out of the way, I think there is great prospect in this country for increasing production of butter and bacon and making it pay.  The drawback is want of working capital.  The Minister can do something in that respect, and it would be very much more appreciated than his Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle of this Bill is altogether bad. This is bringing county councils into trade.  At present their duties are fairly clearly defined in that they are the body responsible for local administration, but I think I am right in saying that this is the first incursion into business that can be perfectly well done through the ordinary channels of trade.  The seed merchants are there to deal with individuals.  All the machinery is there for the setting-up of co-operative societies.  We have not got, and perhaps we should have&mdash; there is nothing to prevent it&mdash;small credit societies on a co-operative basis. Instead of that, here you come along using the county councils as hucksters, and using the whole of their machinery to do this business of peddling out seeds and manures to certain small individuals who, perhaps, cannot get credit on easy terms.  It is all due to this altogether ridiculous, squeamish sentimentality that, because a person has not got money and cannot raise cash at the moment, the local authority should come along and spoon-feed him. The principle strikes at the root of all self-reliance and virility in the people as a whole, and if there is one thing worse than another in this country it is all this slobbering over debtors and defaulters.  You see it <i>in excelsis</i> in the case of the Land Acts, where the more a person is a defaulter the better it is for him and the more relief is given to him, and where the honest person who has made every effort gets no assistance, while the person who makes no effort and makes a poor mouth can get all kinds of Government <Col N="1044" /> organisations coming to his assistance.  It is the principle behind all that kind of thing which is really doing harm and undermining the self-reliance of the people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This, of course, may be only one example of it, but the principle is generally in that direction and is a thoroughly bad one, and following the line of least resistance which, I am afraid, those in high places are only glad to do instead of making people self-reliant and self-respecting.  What I should like to ask the Minister is, where is this kind of thing going to stop?  Why are seeds and manures more important than a number of other articles?  Why not apply the same principle to boots?  A man cannot very well work his land without a pair of boots.  The same would apply to implements.  Why are we not also starting, and what reason should there be for not starting, to have the county council or local authority supply clothes or even food on credit, since you are doing it in the case of seeds and manures?  A man cannot go and work if he is starved and hungry.  Why not, therefore, bring in the local machinery to supply him with food?</P>
      <P>The whole thing is thoroughly unsound. It may be said by the Minister that this is only a small thing.  That answer, however, if it were to be made, reminds me of the plea of the lady who was in unfortunate moral circumstances, and who pleaded in extenuation that, really, the unwanted infant was rather small.  That, I think, is the only defence that the Minister can have for this.  The principle of the thing however, is utterly wrong, and I think that the only justification the Minister could attempt to make for it is that it is small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing we see is in connection with Section 3, to the effect that, not only is the county council to be used, but that you are going to apply the machinery of collection as applied to the rates under the Small Dwellings Act; that is, that the landlord, or over-landlord&mdash;it is not necessarily the landlord at all, but the primary lessor&mdash;is going to be made the debt collector.  I may be wrong, and I am <Col N="1045" /> sure the Minister will correct me immediately if I am wrong, but I understand that this debt is going to be collected like the rates under the Small Dwellings Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>It excludes him? Well, I thought that, under clause (b) it was collected through the same machinery as the rates are collected under the Small Dwellings Act.  However, since the Minister tells me that I have read it wrongly, I accept that, and that the landlord is not responsible for the collection.  To that extent, therefore, the measure cannot be criticised, but I still claim that the major question in the thing is thoroughly unsound, that it is putting the county councils and local authorities into the position of retailers of certain selected articles, and that, if that is to be done, there is no earthly logical reason why that principle should not be extended, and the local authority should not indulge in any form of trade.  The principle is thoroughly bad, and for that reason I oppose the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often find myself in opposition to the remarks of Senator Sir John Keane, but on this occasion I find myself approaching the problem from a somewhat different point of view.  I may say, to begin with, that I welcome this Bill on the whole, because it does a little&mdash; although, I fear, only a very little &mdash;to help to increase agricultural production in a time of great national and international emergency.  It is quite true that it would be better that money for the purchase of agricultural requisites should be obtained either from the private capital resources of farmers, or from the credit which they themselves dispose of.  We are faced, however, with a situation in which, for one reason or another, many farmers, small and large, are not possessed of adequate private capital, and are not possessed of means of borrowing from <Col N="1046" /> any of the recognised institutions for lending money.  Consequently, if these people, who are actually in the occupation of land, are to play a part in increasing the production of food that is so necessary at this time, something must be done to give them access to the necessary credit in the absence of privately-owned capital; and, inasmuch as this Bill appears to me to do at least a little to provide that necessary foundation of credit that is at present lacking, and inasmuch as the Bill will tend to increase, in however small a measure, the amount of agricultural production, I personally welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>It would be better, in a more ideal condition of society, that there should be credit societies of farmers, mutually to guarantee each other's credit, so that they could collectively approach banks and obtain money from legitimate sources.  We are not dealing with that problem at the moment, however. We are dealing with a situation in which, because suitable machinery does not exist for a vitally necessary purpose, other machinery, however unsuitable from a general point of view, must be extemporised and applied to the solution of that urgent problem. Although I sympathise with much that Senator Sir John Keane said about the unsuitability of the machinery, I am prepared to accept the principle that such machinery should be used in that way. I fear, however, that this Bill will not do as much as the situation really requires for the promotion of agricultural production.  The times require that there should be a vast increase of agricultural production of every kind in the country.  The fact is that the possibilities of substantial increases are, I think, greater in the case of larger farmers than in the case of the smaller farmers, and therefore public policy should be directed to removing all obstacles of capital, credit, or finance, which in any way restrict the efforts of farmers, and especially of large farmers, to increase that necessary amount of production under present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Government then should give attention especially to the <Col N="1047" /> part played by the larger farmers&mdash; and when I speak of larger farmers I mean the 50-acre man or the man with a bigger acreage.  The Government should give attention to the part these farmers must play if that necessary increase of production is to be secured. Therefore this Bill, which seems to be aimed especially at the problems of the smaller farmers, seems to me to be quite inadequate, and I would ask the Government to consider in all seriousness what the State is going to do about the necessary provision of credit and capital for the extension of the productive activities of the larger farmers, and if there are obstacles from the side of the banks as well as from the side of the State, I should like to know what the banks are going to do in order to facilitate such necessary increase of production, because we are now living in times so extraordinary that the ordinary canons which govern our actions in normal times must go by the board, and the only point of view that we can consider in connection with all these problems is whether or not it will bring about as rapidly and extensively as possible the minimum increase in our available agricultural output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised to hear of any opposition to this Bill.  We have had a good deal of agitation in the country for credit and most of the agitation came from the Opposition to the Government.  I think this Bill a good Bill and a good way of providing that credit.  I do not know what the theory of it is, but, with regard to the practice of it, the Sugar Company operate a scheme very similar to this, which has worked out excellently.  It has brought very many people into production who could not otherwise have got into production, and if this Bill is as successful as that scheme, it will be very successful. Senator Sir John Keane expressed the view that it is bad in every shape and form, but, if it is, it will die a natural death.  I think the Senator is connected with one of the big banking institutions in this country, and it is my opinion that the banking institutions of the country are not doing their job. <Col N="1048" /> If they were there would be no need for this Bill, and Senator Sir John Keane would be doing a good day's work if he could bring his people down to brass-tacks and get them in touch with the common people, the people who are creating production.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan referred to a couple of matters which were rather wide of the mark.  He referred to the Swedish wheat called Diamante, which has been introduced into this country, in rather deprecating terms. That wheat is good and very suitable to the country, and the bulk of the farmers would be very amazed if they heard Senator Counihan's opinions about it.</P>

      <P>It is being grown, and Red Marvel, which is more or less indigenous to the country, has been turned down completely and its place taken by Diamante.  There is a surplus of wheat of all kinds in the country this year, and perhaps that is what Senator Counihan refers to, but it is better to have a surplus than a shortage.  The Senator also referred to fertilisers and said that there were more in the country than the people could pay for.  I think I represent a fair number of farmers in this House, and I say we have had representations from many people that we should urge on the Government the bringing in and subsidising of superphosphates. I cannot understand Senator Counihan's viewpoint that it is only the farmers of Leinster who use artificial manures.  I believe that there are more artificial manures used in County Cork than in the whole of Leinster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

There are not, and it is <Col N="1049" /> just as well that the Government should know it, and that the sooner provision is made for some extra superphosphates in the country the better it will be for production.  I welcome the Bill. I think it is a good Bill and that it will supply a very great want.</P>

      <P>This discussion has become rather more interesting than we anticipated at the outset, but I cannot understand what Senator Counihan means when he refers to &ldquo;the ordinary farmer&rdquo;.  What is an ordinary farmer?  I have always thought the people who availed of the provisions with regard to the purchase of seeds and manures ordinary farmers. They are small farmers, and they are the people who are most in need of help.  This Bill simply provides a means of giving them the credit of which Senator Counihan speaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not object to the Bill.  I said I supported it, but I said that it would be of no use except to a very limited number of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what puzzles me.  I find it hard to define an ordinary farmer because the farmers whom I know and who have availed of these provisions can be considered as ordinary farmers.  I was rather interested in Senator Sir John Keane's remark about killing initiative in the people by giving them doles of this nature, and I am inclined to agree that it would be a bad thing to accustom the people to living on the Government and depending on the Government for everything, but we must realise that there are certain people who must be helped.  Even in the best conditions that could prevail in the agricultural industry, some of the smaller men would always find it hard to get credit and would find it difficult to get that credit through the ordinary channels&mdash; for instance, the banks.  In the past the retailers of these goods were the people who gave that credit, but many of the retailers, as a result of the operations of the various co-operative societies in the country, are no longer in a position to give that credit.  The business of the vast majority of the merchants who did give credit of that <Col N="1050" /> nature in the past has gone.  That business has been taken over by the various co-operative societies, and the result is that these small farmers who, in the past, got credit in the way of which I speak, now must get it through the State.</P>
      <P>It would be a good idea if credit societies could be formed in the country and I think it would be the business of the co-operative societies throughout the country to form such societies.  In countries in Europe, such societies have done very good work, and efforts have been made from time to time in this country to form societies on the same basis.  They have never succeeded, but now that there are powerful co-operative societies, composed entirely of farmers, throughout the country, I think they would be the people to provide such facilities.  I do not see how it can be met otherwise. If the small farmers can no longer obtain credit in the way in which they got it in the old days, the State must step in and provide it for them.  I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that it is dangerous to encourage the people to believe that they can always fall back on the State.  It would be much better if, by some means, the people could be encouraged to exercise their own initiative and do all they could to help themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The State in the case of every country, to some extent, helps to kill such initiative because it has to. When hard times prevail and people have to be helped, as, for instance, the people in our western counties have to be helped, that to a great extent kills initiative.  It would be a very desirable thing if there was no necessity at all for State aid, but, unfortunately, we cannot get away from the fact that it is necessary and this Bill provides it.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not intended to be a comprehensive measure and it is not intended to be such as to provide the facilities which some Senators seem to have in mind, that is, credit facilities for farmers.  If such provision were to be made, I would not be dealing with this Bill.  It would <Col N="1051" /> be the job of the Minister for Agriculture and I am not going to be drawn away on a side-path into a discussion on agriculture.  I do not understand Senator Sir John Keane's references, and I certainly do not see the relevancy of talking about self-reliance and virility and associating that with the Land Acts.  It was self-reliance and virility which were responsible for securing the Land Acts.  The Senator seems to think that this is a modern tendency and that we were trying to start a system of doles, but if he knew anything of the history of public bodies or of Acts of Parliament enacted in the past, he would know that as far back as 1881, an Act similar to this Bill was passed by the British Parliament and that these provisions were operated in the last 60 years by the old boards of guardians.  There is no use in coming in and talking here when you do not know what you are talking about.</P>

      <P>I sat on boards of guardians too and they never operated them.  I sat on one in Lismore with Senator Goulding and I do not remember them.  However, the fact that they were there does not necessarily mean that they were right.  I do not think the Minister should castigate me severely and cast aside what I conceive to be a sound principle even though it may have been violated in the past by the British Government.  I am not a stubborn adherent of British practice <Col N="1052" /> in all things.  If it is bad, I am quite prepared to say that we should not follow it, as we are now.</P>
      <P>The Minister told me that it has been the practice hitherto, but I want the House to realise that we are now entering into direct obligations with citizens, who are not rated occupiers.  I think I am right in saying that the ordinary relation between a county council and a citizen is that a citizen becomes a rated occupier, and, as a rated occupier, pays his rates.  The whole machinery for distraint and for securing the rates is involved in that.  We are now entering into dealing with non-rated occupiers, and the county authority is put into this position of a supplier of goods to all and sundry.  I may be told that it is not a new principle, but I think it is a dangerous principle and it is unsound administration. You are turning your rate collectors into officers for the collection of what, in practice, corresponds to shop-debts. In that consists my chief objection to this measure.  There may have been certain slight departures of this character in the past, but if this practice has prevailed on the wide scale the Minister suggests, what is the need for all this elaborate machinery?  Where was the statutory power before to embark on this class of business?  I hope the Minister will enlighten me on this point.  He says I am really attacking an old established practice.  I now ask him where is the statutory authority for this old-established practice. There is no reference to it in any other Act.  This is not an amending Bill and it repeals no Act that I can see.  I still say that, in spite of the Minister's castigation, this does in essence involve a new principle, and I maintain that until I have been convinced to the contrary by argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senators feel, on the whole, that Senator Johnston and myself performed a service, rather than the contrary, by introducing this motion.  We had a very interesting statement from the Minister for Finance, and some very interesting speeches from other persons.  There was a notable absence of what was contemptuously referred to by either Senator Lynch or Senator Campbell, or both of them, as economic jargon.  I stated at the outset that I had no claim to be an economic expert, steeped in the doctrines of the Manchester or any other school, as Senator Lynch or Senator Campbell alleged I was.  I do not think I said anything that even the most uneducated outsider would have difficulty in understanding.  I believe that that holds good of the bulk of what was said in the course of the debate. It was not conducted in terms of economic jargon.  In any case, if there <Col N="1054" /> was economic jargon, I rather fancy it might be found in the speeches of the Labour Senators rather than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I freely confess that this motion was intended almost as much to draw a statement from the Labour Party as to draw a statement from the Minister. There has been, as I pointed out in my opening speech, a great deal of campaigning going on by the Labour Party and certain allies of theirs, a campaign full of heated denunciation of persons and institutions in this country.  Whether or not the proposals of the Labour Party are as moderate or as modest as they say they are, what is quite certain is that the propaganda by which those proposals were supported was not modest and moderate propaganda.  It was in effect, whatever it was in intention, a revolutionary propaganda&mdash;as Senator O Buachalla pointed out, a propaganda that tried to make the people believe that they were being put to all sorts of unnecessary hardships because of the selfishness or stupidity, or both, of a number of people in high places controlling the financial machine and acting purely in their own interests or, what is worse still, in the interests of John Bull.  That sort of talk has been supplemented by extracts from Encyclicals, used in such a way as to seek to convict everybody who disagrees with the Labour ideas as being downright rebels to the authority of the Vatican, and bad Christians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it was time, high time, that that kind of thing should be put to the test of being brought here into one of the Chambers of the Legislature for discussion, and I was hoping to draw a statement from the Labour Party, as well as a statement from the Minister.  They were strangely coy about giving us that statement.  For a time, I thought we were not going to get one, and when, eventually, we did, it was introduced by a complaint on the part of Senator Lynch of my having the audacity to quote from a &ldquo;private document&rdquo; of the Labour Party.  That is really very odd.  What is this private document of the Labour Party?  It is a pamphlet called &ldquo;Planning for the Crisis,&rdquo; and it can be bought at Eason's, and, I dare say, <Col N="1055" /> elsewhere, for the sum of one penny, and after you have read it yourself, you are urged by a note at the end to get another dozen copies and to distribute them to your neighbours and friends.  It seems to me a little strange, therefore, to allude to it as a private document, or to complain about my having referred to it. The only grievance there can be in it is that I was giving to Senators free and for nothing what they might otherwise have to pay a penny for, a grievance that does not seem to be very substantial.</P>
    <P>We had, on account of that campaign, every right to expect a statement from the Labour representatives, and all the more so as we have in our midst two of the most authoritative spokesmen Labour could have.  Senator Campbell was a member of the Banking Commission, and for two years or more, while that Commission was sitting, he was familiarising himself with every aspect of this country's economic life; and Senator Lynch was the chosen spokesman of the Labour Party to give evidence before that Commission.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we are fortunate to have in our midst two men who have seen so much of this question, <Col N="1056" /> and have been so directly concerned in it as Senators Campbell and Lynch. Now, I think that they have distorted their outlook by making two very big assumptions, both of which I believe to be unsound.</P>
      <P>One of these assumptions is, and it is stated in this pamphlet of the Labour Party, that an adjustment of the monetary system is the natural method for going about the business of providing full-time employment for the adult population, regulating the price level and raising the standard of living of the mass of the people.  It is assumed, without any vestige of proof, without any attempt at proof, by Labour apologists, that some sort of tinkering with the monetary system is the natural way to go about that tremendous task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We never said &ldquo;tinkering.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; is a word of prejudice, I admit, on my part.  Manipulation of the monetary system, dealing, handling, doing something with the monetary system, is the way to cure unemployment and to raise the standard of living.  I say it is not, and I say it has never been found so in any country, and wherever it has ever been attempted the ending has been failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Even by raising the bank rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither reducing nor raising the bank rate has anything like the effect of curing unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be tinkering, for instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be.  I am not suggesting that the bank rate should never be reduced or raised, but I do say that the natural way to go about making a country prosperous and making it happy and adding to the sum total of its wealth is not by manipulating the monetary machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second big assumption they make, and they have made no attempt to prove it, is the one stated by Senator Campbell, to the effect that the <Col N="1057" /> material resources of this country are sufficient to maintain all its present population and, so far as one can judge, any future population, no matter to what size it may grow, in a condition of simple luxury.  Now what right has he to make any such assumption?  I am afraid there never has been a time in this country when all the population were prosperous and content, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the population never been bigger than to-day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a state of simple luxury.  How far we can go towards attaining that I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We had 8,000,000 of a population once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the way to go about it is not by monetary manipulation.  Senator Lynch keeps on making interruptions about the size of the population.  I must say that I do not know what he deduces from it. If he could point to a time when there were 8,000,000 of a happy and prosperous population here it might be helpful, but the time when there was a population of 8,000,000 here was the time of our greatest misery, a misery infinitely transcending anything this country has to-day.  Therefore, I feel myself justified in saying that the Labour spokesmen have made the mistake of starting by two tremendous assumptions which they have not attempted to justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poverty is very far, unfortunately, from being a new thing.  Senator Lynch summons us to a crusade against poverty and that is very far from being a new idea.  I am sure none of us need to have the trumpets sounded for us to call us to take part in a crusade against poverty, if we can see clearly a way of doing so advantageously.  All through our history we have been a poor country&mdash;the poverty of Ireland has been almost proverbial throughout the world.  It was attributed, of course, to British misrule&mdash;in part, it was due to British misrule&mdash;certainly it was in part due to successive upheavals against the British connection. <Col N="1058" /> There was very great poverty in this country before the British came; there was great poverty during the time that we formed part of the British Empire and, according to Senator Lynch, there is even greater poverty to-day than ever before.  I do not agree with that; I think it is a gross exaggeration, though I admit there is very great poverty in this country.  One of the first things I said when I came into public life here about eight years ago was that all Irish politics should really be a crusade against two things&mdash; poverty and Partition, that they were the two evils that really mattered. That was an obvious sort of thing to say and I claim no credit for any original idea.  Those were the two great evils: in the past eight years I have seen very little done to cure either.  I have seen some efforts to cure poverty, but no real effort&mdash;no effort at all that I could call an effort &mdash;to cure Partition.  On the contrary, things have been done that tended to perpetuate Partition.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any Party in this House or in the other House or throughout the country which really needs the exhortations of Senator Lynch and Senator Campbell to turn their minds to the subject of poverty.  We are all conscious of it and longing to cure it.  Nobody has any right to put himself up on a superior moral elevation and accuse another of being concerned only with selfish money interests&mdash;as Senator Lynch was good enough to say about me on the last occasion.  I claim it is an outrage for any Senator to try to adopt that superior moral status in regard to poverty, as we are all concerned regarding it.  If it is a crime to be in favour of conserving such wealth as we have got, I am guilty of that; if it is a crime to wish to prevent the people who have savings from losing those savings by bad financial policy or by a monetary policy which reduces their value or destroys them altogether, I am guilty; if that is being a supporter of selfish money interests. I am afraid I am.  In no other sense, however, can I admit that anything of the kind is true.  What are the actual proposals that the Labour <Col N="1059" /> Party have to offer us?  The main features are, firstly, that there is to be an abandonment of the Irish currency's present fixed relation with sterling, and, secondly, that there is to be a Development Commission set up which is to operate by means of developmental credit.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan has said that the banks in this country are not doing their duty.  That was fairly fully discussed at earlier stages of this debate. I disagree with him: I think that it was not really denied by the Labour Party in this House nor seriously denied by any witnesses before the Banking Commission, that credit has always been available in this country for credit-worthy persons and objects from the banks at a lower price than in most countries of the world.  It also has been admitted that our banks have kept the savings of the people safe.  If the banks have performed those two functions so successfully and without a single bank failure in the last fifty years, I think that those who accuse our banks of being inefficient or unequal to the task to be expected of them, are very blind to our blessings. We have some economic blessings and the excellence of our banking system is one of them.</P>
    <P>At the time the Banking Commission was sitting, so far as I could gather, the wish of Labour was that all the existing banking institutions should be abolished and that their place should be taken by a Government Central Bank.  The main object of that was that the operations of this Government Central Bank should be dictated by the Legislature&mdash;whether, in a commercial sense, loans were sound or not, those loans should be made, if the Legislature wanted them to be made; in other words, credit should be given for non-credit-worthy objects and persons, if it was considered to be in the public interest.  Labour appears to have made a change in its outlook.  It is prepared to leave the existing banking institutions alone and let them carry on on commercial principles; and the savings of the people of this country are not, apparently, to be conscripted <Col N="1060" /> and risked in loans that may be unsound and dictated by political considerations rather than by the ordinary considerations of people in commerce.  Instead of taking over the banks, we are to set up an institution side by side with the banks which is to issue the credit to the non-credit-worthy persons and for the non-credit-worthy objects for which the banks cannot be expected to use the savings of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into details in regard to the objections to these plans, as that has been done so very thoroughly already.  Senator O Buachalla made a most effective speech on the subject, but, apart from what he said and apart from what the Minister said about breaking the link with sterling, there is the Banking Commission Report.  There is not a single thing that has been said here which has not been also submitted for consideration to the Banking Commission and considered very fully and fairly by them.  For the convenience of Senators who might wish to consult the Banking Commission Report, without reading an unnecessarily large amount of it, I would like to refer them, on the subject of the link with sterling, to paragraphs 209 and 210; and on the subject of developmental credit and the attempt to spend ourselves into prosperity by making a large outlay on objects that are not immediately profitable and productive, I refer them to paragraph 287 of the report.

      <P>The Senator can conduct a little investigation on his own account.  I am not qualified to tell him.  Speaking generally, the Minister has set forward the practical inconveniences that would result from throwing aside the link with sterling.  I myself said something about the effect of setting on foot all those public works by means of developmental credit, the effect it would have in increasing prices, increasing imports, increasing the cost of living and necessarily producing inflationary effects because there would not be a corresponding immediate production of saleable goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must not suppose that until now the finance of this country has been directed according to the ideas of what Senator Lynch and Senator Campbell so often alluded to as the Manchester School, that there has been no assistance by the State to any form of economic activity.  That is the very opposite of the truth.  We have development commissions in existence already only they are not called by that name.  The Department of Agriculture is, to a large extent, a development commission.  The Department of Lands is a development commission.  The Department of Local Government, with all it is doing for housing, is a development commission.  And there are others&mdash;the Department of Public Works, the old Congested Districts Board in the days when Senator Madden says that the initiative was being crushed out of the Irish people. There have been all these agencies already, which are in effect development commissions, and I approve of them.  At any rate, I approve of a great deal of what they have done and are doing.  But they are spending money that has been raised by honest-to-God taxation or else has been borrowed out of honest-to-God savings. They are not manufacturing money. They are not inflating.  It is really no good the Labour spokesmen pretending that what they want does not mean inflation because, if it did not, they would not be pressing for the breaking of the link with sterling and, moreover, they would <Col N="1062" /> not have quoted the authorities which, in fact, they did quote in the course of their speeches.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go back to Mr. Gladstone, beyond saying that the notion of his being quoted in support of a scheme of currency inflation and developmental credit is about as comical as anything could be to anybody with a historical sense. Nor will I go into the quotations from Mr. Lloyd George and others that were used.  They are not really relevant.  As regards Australia and New Zealand, which were cited for our imitation, I will only say that I believe that the separation of the Australian pound from sterling, the difference which arose in the value between the two, was not a matter of policy so much as the necessary effect of unfortunate financial errors in Australian politics, and that if they could afterwards have undone it, they would have undone it.  In fact, when an Australian representative was over here about two years ago&mdash;I think Butler was his name&mdash;he attended a lunch of the Parliamentary Association, and he admitted to us&mdash;with how much accuracy, of course, I do not know, or how far it still applies&mdash;that Australia was going back as fast as it could, and had gone back to a great extent, to complete financial orthodoxy.  As regards New Zealand, we all know that New Zealand became a bit unorthodox. The result was that last year one of her Government representatives had to come over to England with his hat in his hand and was having great difficulty in arranging for the renewal of loans. It may be that New Zealand was only saved from a major economic crash by the coming of the European war.</P>
    <P>So I do not think these examples count for very much.  But the one I do want to go into a little bit more is the remarkable use which Senator Lynch made&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;of an article in <i>The Economist,</i> which, he declared, was written in support of just the kind of proposals that he was pressing upon us.  It is significant that the title of that article is: &ldquo;The Technique of Inflation.&rdquo;  By the way, in case Senator Lynch should have forgotten it, I would like to mention that when <Col N="1063" /> he was giving evidence before the Banking Commission, he stated that he was absolutely opposed to any movement towards inflation, because, &ldquo;as we see it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;inflation would have a devaluing effect upon money and wages, and, consequently, upon our standard of living.&rdquo;  Therefore, he has changed his mind.  Of course, it is quite legitimate for him to change his mind, but I think it worth while to take note of that.  He has quoted <i>The Economist</i> as an authority in support of the proposals that he recommended to us, but he omitted to tell us that the article began like this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the outbreak of war there has been an impressive unanimity of testimony that inflation must and will be avoided.  This sentiment has been heard from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, from politicians of all Parties and from independent authorities.  This unanimity is all to the good.  It is true that it is possible to see some advantages in a strictly limited rise of prices.  But that way lies the primrose path. Inflation, if it comes, will come so imperceptibly, so independently of any decision of authority, that it can be relied upon to take an ell for every theoretical inch conceded to it. The danger is that we shall get a sizable inflation while protesting that we want none; if we say we should like a little, we shall get an infinite amount.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, then, this article is frankly concerned with the technique by which inflation could be brought about, it is only because the right to do so has been earned by the drastic nature of the suggestions for avoiding inflation that have been outlined in preceding articles.  Two weeks ago, it may be recalled, the suggestion was made that the incidence of income-tax might be increased to the equivalent of a standard rate of 10/- in the £, with still steeper increases on certain incomes, and, for the smaller incomes, either a wages tax or a universal excise.  Last week it was proposed that the volume of the public's savings should be forcibly doubled by the deliberate restriction of all forms of unnecessary expenditure. <Col N="1064" /> None of these suggestions have been put forward with any illusions about their extremely drastic, and necessarily unpopular, character.  But it is only graduates from the hard school of accepting the necessity for impositions of this nature who can be allowed to admit the possibility of any inflation at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, in <i>The Economist's</i> view, before there should be any question of embarking on these inflationary plans, we should have gone the length of raising income-tax to 10/- in the £; we should have imposed a tax on wages for the small man and we should have introduced a strict system of rationing in order to cut down expenditure, and it is only when all these expedients have been exhausted that it is prepared to make suggestions as to what might be done in the way of inflation.  The article ends up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The order of ideas very vaguely and tentatively suggested in this article is not merely unprecedented and unorthodox, but it carries some psychological danger.  Inflation must not be made to appear easier than it is.  Yet the recognition of inflation, if it cannot be avoided, is well founded in logic, and action of the general nature outlined here would be the means of saving the community very large sums of public money.  But precedent and orthodoxy cannot be defied with impunity. We come back at the end of the argument, to the point from which we started.  The soundness of our wartime financial policy will be measured by the extent to which the necessity for these devices is avoided.  We must first carry taxation and the rationing of expenditure to the utmost limits that are humanly supportable.  Only when these efforts have been carried as far as they can be will it be right to consider the technique of inflation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is the attitude of people who are engaged in a desperate war for existence, and I think that, when Senator Campbell has equated us with the British and said that if the British are engaged in a war with the Germans <Col N="1065" /> so are we here engaged in a war with poverty, he has forgotten that the way to win the war with the Germans may not be the way to win the war with poverty.  In order to win the war with the Germans you may have quite deliberately to impoverish yourself and to impoverish posterity.  The object of these suggestions in <i>The Economist</i> is to show what might be done in the way of mobilising all the resources that possibly could be mobilised&mdash;the financial resources&mdash;to beat Germany, but it never for a moment pretends that the mobilising and use of these resources is not going to result in impoverishment.  Of course it is, but the British prefer to impoverish themselves rather than to be conquered, whereas, if we are fighting against poverty, it is a contradiction in terms to say that we must impoverish the country in order to conquer the poverty of the country.  Consequently, the analogy between the war against Germany and the war against poverty is a profoundly misleading analogy.</P>
    <P>The Labour spokesmen also quoted the Minister for Supplies as a prophet favourable to their ideas, quoting a recent speech in which he spoke about the extent of unemployment and the necessity for doing very drastic and perhaps revolutionary things to cure unemployment; but are they so sure that what he had in mind was a readjustment of the monetary system?  I do not think he had that in mind. Reading his speech, I would have said that if he had anything definite in mind it was a suggestion that we might have to abandon democracy, and I invite Labour Senators to reread Mr. Lemass's speech to see whether that is not a more natural meaning to put on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>That would require some imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Senator read the speech and then repeat that that would require imagination.  The Minister made a definite reference to democracy; and it is conceivable that you cannot get rid of unemployment altogether unless you actually order your unemployed man to do this or that work, at this or that wage, and <Col N="1066" /> in this or that place.  I hope it is not true, but it is conceivable, and, so far as I know, no other complete solution of unemployment has been found, and it is for every one of us to consider whether the remedy is not worse than the disease.</P>
      <P>During the past eight years, since this Government came into office, we have been very far indeed from adhering to these doctrines of the Manchester School about which we hear so much.  Senator Cummins says they were brought in for our destruction at the time of the Act of Union, for the purpose of enslaving this country and ensuring that we should be only a pastoral community. So far as I am aware, the Manchester School did not come into existence at all for a quarter of a century or more after the passing of the Act of Union.  In any case, whether or not it was the policy of the British to force pastoralism on us, I do suggest that their monetary system was quite irrelevant to it.  They may have taken other measures; I do not propose to take time going into that.  But there was nothing in the English monetary system or currency that turned this country into a pastoral country, and it is quite absurd to suggest that there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Curiously enough, the first big success of the Manchester School was, I suppose, the abolition of the Corn Laws in, I think, 1846, and that occurred at a time when Ireland had reached really a greater depth of economic misery than it had ever seen. The politicians who were associated with the Manchester School, like Cobden and Bright, were very far indeed from being regarded as the champions of selfish monied interests.  On the contrary, they were regarded as the champions of the workingman, attacking selfish monied interests which were supporting tariffs and other restrictions that were supposed to be reducing the standard of living for the poor.  So that all this curious abuse of the Manchester School and of the people who are too much concerned with monied interests, and of the pro-English minds who have fastened pastoralism on this country and who did it somehow by means of the monetary <Col N="1067" /> system and are keeping it so by that means, creates a problem of psychology as to how Labour Senators have got themselves into such a muddled state of mind.  The practice of imposing tariffs began before this Government came into office, and the practice of having generous social services began before this country ceased to form part of the United Kingdom. Within our own recollection we have only to take our minds back to the time when old age pensions were started to realise how far it is from being true that even the British were imposing upon us the doctrines of the Manchester School and how far it is from being true that even the British legislature showed a complete lack of sympathy with the poverty and suffering of the small man.</P>
    <P>It is indeed not so much the actual proposals of the Labour Party to which I object&mdash;although I do object to them and think them unsound&mdash;it is not so much the actual proposals, however, that make me indignant, as the propaganda by which these proposals are supported, propaganda that, I believe, has been doing a great deal of harm and will continue to do a great deal of harm unless they cease to be so absolutely reckless of the effects they are producing and, as it seems to me, so reckless of the truth, as they are at present.</P>
    <P>It is quite untrue to say that anybody advocates a policy of &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;.  We all want to do everything that can be done to increase the wealth of this country.  I personally believe that any pennies that we can scrape together, over and above what we are spending already, should be spent on the development of agriculture, and that that would be more advantageous than spending it on afforestation, which cannot show results for 30 years or so.</P>
    <P>I introduced a motion years ago in the Dáil urging the Government to establish demonstration farms throughout the country&mdash;an unpopular proposal, particularly at that time, because the economic war was in progress, and the Government did not quite see how they could make the farms pay, if they <Col N="1068" /> did establish them.  But the proposal has been made by others, and it was mentioned here the other day by Senator Sir John Keane.  I should like to mention it again.  In that way, if you have money to spend, I think it would be well spent, because I believe with all my heart that the prospects of raising the standard of living and reducing unemployment in this country depend on making our agriculture more efficient, on getting more modern methods, more skill, more energy and more enthusiasm into it.</P>
    <P>It is because all this talk of miracles which could be brought about by some monetary manipulation distracts people from the things that really can do good that I think it is so harmful.  For one reason or another, the people of this country have too long had their minds distracted from the question of efficiency. It has been inevitable for political reasons.  There has nearly always been some political opponent to go for, and to take property from&mdash; perhaps quite rightly, but nevertheless to take it from him.  It was the landlords in the old days; it was the ranchers afterwards, and it was the British Government in respect of the Land Annuities, and so forth.  It may be that the case was perfectly sound and just&mdash;I am not entering into that&mdash;in all this, but the necessary psychological result upon the individual farmer has been that he is less inclined to think of what could be achieved by greater efficiency than he is to think of getting his rights as against some other member of our community; and if we are to do any good at all, we have to get out of the habit of making villains of some particular class in the community, whether bankers, Senators or economists, as too many people are inclined to do.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla said very candidly that he had come to his present economic views only after distress and travail of spirit and that he came to them reluctantly, because, in the old days of Sinn Féin propaganda, Sinn Féin economics went along with Sinn Féin politics, and it was perhaps not very easy to discard the former and retain one's faith in the <Col N="1069" /> latter.  I remember, some years ago, saying in the Dáil, in the presence of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, that I had difficulty in believing that Sinn Féin economists had arrived at their views by hard work and sitting up at night with towels around their heads studying books of economics, and that I could not help thinking that they had adopted their economics because they fitted in with their politics.  The Minister replied that the very reverse was the case. &ldquo;We formed our economic views about this country first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and our political views were the necessary result.&rdquo;  If so, one wonders what the mental state of the Minister is at the moment, because the days are past when he believed in the possibility of building up here what he called a storm-proof, self-sufficient system of economics.  He sees realities now as well even as does the present Minister for Finance who, only a few years ago, so few years ago, was telling us that, in the economic war, we had whipped John Bull and that we could look forward to whipping him again in any other economic war on a future occasion.  I wonder how that fits in with the maintenance of so many of our public and private investments in British securities, with the maintenance of the link with sterling, and how we could seriously set about the economic destruction of any country in which we had such an enormous stake as, in fact, we have.  I do not say these things in order to be unpleasant, but because they pass through my mind and seem to me to have a certain relevance to the discussion.</P>
    <P>I was going to conclude at that point, but I see that Senator O Buachalla has just arrived, and I am therefore tempted to make one additional remark arising out of something he said.  He complained that I had spoken in a frivolous manner&mdash;perhaps, he even thought, in an offensive manner&mdash;about the Gaelic economic order.  I did not drag the Gaelic economic order into this debate.</P>
    <P>It was the complaint of Senator Lynch that the economic system under which we are living at present is non-Gaelic, and not only was the complaint <Col N="1070" /> made here by Senator Lynch, but it has been made hundreds of times down the country, and it is suggested that we ought to do revolutionary things in order to get back to the Gaelic economic order.  I merely pointed out the obvious fact that any evidence we have as to Gaelic economic order is discouraging, and it is not surprising that that should be so, because the same applies to the economic order of neighbouring countries in the same epoch. There is really nothing to learn as to what our present course should be by studying Gaelic economics.  It is not my desire to make any unnecessary sneers that would hurt anybody's feelings, or do any mischief to anybody's ideals.  I think the people who are really responsible for causing sneers, when there are sneers, are the people who make ludicrous claims of that sort for the Gaelic world, that we can get enlightenment as to our economic problems from going back to Gaelic ideas of economics.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the effect upon Partition of the severance of our currency from sterling.  I think that is an important point, and I congratulate him upon having taken Partition into consideration in any one of our domestic problems, because, so far as I can recollect, it is the first time it has happened since this Government came into office.  There have been many times when I, and others, have implored them to consider the effects on Partition of things they were proposing to do, but we had no success.  Here, for once, the question of Partition has been raised by the Minister, and, though one might perhaps suspect that he might not have raised it if he had not been strongly against severing the link with sterling, anyway he has set a precedent which I hope may be followed when any measure comes up for consideration that might affect the possibility of unifying Ireland.</P>
