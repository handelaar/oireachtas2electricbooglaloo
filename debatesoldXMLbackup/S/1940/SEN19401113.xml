      <P>I regret to have to come before the Seanad again with reference to this matter.  Through a mistake on my own part, I had not adverted to the fact that the scheme, as presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, envisaged that it should come into operation on the 31st October, 1940. Although the Dáil had the matter under consideration, it adjourned until the 6th November without, in fact, <Col N="2367" /> having passed the appropriate resolution. I was under the impression that the resolution was passed by the Dáil when I was last before the Seanad, and I now wish to ask the Seanad to be good enough to let me have the new scheme, which is exactly the same as the one which was before the House on the former occasion except that the date has had to be altered from the 31st October to the 30th November, so that the motion would be passed by both Houses before the date set down for its coming into operation.</P>

    <Title>Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal programme of housing and other public works has been maintained at a fair level during the past year, but in prevailing conditions the Government has deemed it necessary to secure wider powers for the carrying out of public works as may from time to time be deemed necessary for the relief of unemployment.  The purpose of this Bill is therefore to remove as far as possible all difficulties which might prevent or delay the inception and carrying out of projects of permanent utility.  Local authorities are aware of most of the needs of their localities, but before embarking on any large schemes of public works, it is essential that detailed surveys should as far as possible be made of their districts with a view to a selection of the most suitable to be carried out in the future.  Several of the larger urban authorities have had planning surveys already made by experts and in these areas there will be a choice of works which can be carried out, if necessary, in advance of the making of planning schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> The planning surveys so far carried out would indicate that it is desirable to have extended powers for construction of road works which would be partly within a city and partly within the adjoining county.  There is at present no legal way under which the making of a road which would serve both of these areas could be assigned to the body primarily interested.  Such a power is considered desirable, apart from any need that may arise for undertaking essential works for the relief of unemployment.  A local authority with extensive road and traffic interests should possess powers in relation to the reconstruction of main traffic arteries which constitute the approaches to its administrative area.</P>
    <P>In Cork, Limerick and Waterford, as well as in Dublin, and, in fact, in other populous areas, there are many problems of circumscribed boundaries which might be rendered capable of easier solution if the local authority which is more directly concerned had extended powers for the carrying out of works outside their areas.  This Bill will confer such powers.  I trust it will also encourage the making of planning surveys. When there is a comprehensive survey made of an area, the future choice of works of public utility and amenity value would be greatly facilitated.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will simplify the procedure for the acquisition of land necessary for the execution of public works which are undertaken for the purpose of providing employment. Sub-section (1) of Section 2 provides for the certification of works which are being undertaken wholly or partly for that purpose in a particular area, while sub-section (2) of the section will enable the Minister to act on his own initiative and after consultation with the local authority or local authorities concerned to certify that a particular work of public utility should be undertaken by the local authority designated by him for the purpose of providing employment.  In this connection I am to refer to the provisions of Section 4 of the Bill regarding the transfer of powers in relation to the construction and maintenance of roads from the <Col N="2369" /> local authority in whose area a certified work is situate to a local authority designated as the executing authority.  There will also be consultation between the Minister and the local authorities concerned before any such transfer is authorised.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 4 are necessary where the road work is situate partly in one administrative area and partly in another such area, and it is desirable that the entire work should be carried out by the same local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that it shall be the duty of the executing authority to undertake and complete a work which is certified to be undertaken for the relief of unemployment with all reasonable speed.  Sub-section (2) of that section provides a remedy in case of any wilful default.  The powers taken are similar to those provided for in Section 72 (2) (b) of the Local Government Act, 1925, under which a local authority may be dissolved without holding a local inquiry if it neglects to comply with any lawful order, direction, or regulation of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill regulates the making of contributions by a local authority to the cost of a certified work which would facilitate the development of the area of the local authority and render less costly the performance of its functions.  If there is no agreement between the authority executing the work and the benefiting authority, the Minister may by order determine the amount of the contribution. Sub-section (3) of that section is intended to cover costs other than the costs of construction, such as the annual charges for the maintenance of the certified work.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is concerned with borrowing for certified works.  It will enable a local authority which has exercised borrowing powers by the creation and issue of stock, and such stock is due for redemption within a period not exceeding five years, to enter into agreements with the holders of the stock to exchange their holdings for an amount of new stock equal in nominal value but not necessarily bearing <Col N="2370" /> the same rate of interest.  The basis of exchange is one for arrangement between the local authority and the holders of such stock.  The Urban Stock (Amendment) Regulations, 1928, regulate the borrowing from redemption funds on certain conditions, the main condition being that the amount withdrawn would be repaid to the redemption fund within the unexpired portion of the period fixed for the redemption of the stock.  But the powers conferred by these regulations would not meet the case of an exchange of stock in the manner proposed in the Bill, or authorise the application of moneys in the Redemption Fund for the financing of certified works.  The section in the Bill will validate an exchange of stock which the Corporation of Dublin have at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill will have a limited effect.  It is intended to meet the conditions at present existing in portion of the County Borough of Dublin adjoining the County Health District of Dublin and the Urban District of Howth.  A new sewerage system for portion of these districts is necessary. Instead of setting up a joint board by provisional order to be confirmed by the Oireachtas, the Minister, in pursuance of the section, can make an order forming an united district, and then the provisions of the Public Health Acts will apply.  The formation of a joint board to manage the united district will be postponed, and there will be conferred on the corporation as executing authority all the powers of the joint board in relation to the execution of works necessary for the drainage of the entire area, and for the apportionment of expenses as between the city and the present Urban District of Howth which will ultimately form part of the County Borough of Dublin.  When that takes place the arrangements for the creation of an united district will cease.  It may be mentioned that the drainage of this area will facilitate also the drainage of the Baldoyle and Portmarnock district of the County Health District of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 8 to 15 introduce a new, <Col N="2371" /> simple and speedy manner of acquiring land by vesting order, without conveyance, for the registration of title thereto, and the payment of compensation for the land so acquired.  The local authority will be able to take possession of the land with the minimum of delay, and every person to whom compensation is payable will receive interest on the amount of compensation during the period between vesting the land in the local authority and the fixing of compensation by arbitration, save where a local authority makes an unconditional written offer of compensation which is not accepted, and the compensation fixed at arbitration is not greater than the offer.  In such a case it is proposed that the interest on the compensation should not be payable during any period after the date of the offer.</P>
    <P>It is expected that under this Bill local authorities will carry out projects which are likely to be provided for in future planning schemes.  If these projects are allowed to wait until planning schemes are in force the persons who would benefit from their execution would become liable under the planning schemes for the payment of betterment to the local authority. It seems only reasonable that this liability should not cease because of the necessity of carrying out these projects in advance of planning schemes. Section 16 of the Bill accordingly provides for the collection of betterment from owners of property which has increased in value by the execution of such works.</P>
    <P>There are certain modifications of the Public Health Act, 1878, proposed in Section 19.  They mainly consist of shortening the time for giving public notices in relation to the carrying out of certain public health works.  The reduction is from three months to one month, which is considered reasonable in emergency conditions.  The other sections of the Bill do not require any comment, as they are common to most Bills regulating the procedure governing the acquisition of land for public purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Bill was introduced by the Minister for Local Government indicates its nature. It is an Unemployment Relief Bill, and aims at the relief of unemployment by small works done by local bodies in different parts of the country.  Therefore, it would not contemplate any national effort to solve a problem which was once thought by the Minister and his colleagues to be quite easy of solution in this country.  Taking it for what it is, an effort to improve the machinery for the relief of unemployment by means of relief works under local bodies, it is a step forward, and I think it ought to be passed, particularly as a result of certain amendments made in the Dáil, which make the doing of that kind of work smoother and easier.  It is, perhaps, at this stage, correct to say that unemployment is something which was not being solved, and which was not in process of solution before the war.  It is something which the war will make more difficult to solve as it goes on, and its possible threat to the State from the economic angle, as things develop, is now greater than the threat to the State, even in the military sense.  Public works are not a solution of the unemployment problem, because they cannot continue indefinitely, and I think that even the most enthusiastic advocate of tariffs is convinced now, after seven or eight years' experiment, that tariffs are not a remedy either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill there is a burden&mdash; though not a very great burden, comparatively, upon local bodies.  It purports to spend nearly £1,000,000 in all, I think it was stated, of which nearly £900,000 will be spent by the Government and the rest by local bodies.  It is right to say that for the solution of this problem in this particular manner, and in other ways, very considerable burdens have already been imposed. The ratepayer and the taxpayer, about whom there is considerable talk, are, in effect, the same person.  A member of a local body objects to a burden being placed upon local bodies and says that that money should come out of the Central Fund but, in effect, the contributions to the Central Fund and to the funds of local authorities are <Col N="2373" /> made by identically the same persons&mdash; those in gainful employment through out the country.</P>
    <P>Our national debt has been doubled in the last seven or eight years, taxation has been increased by about 50 per cent., and I think local rates have been increased by very nearly the same amount.  The person who paid £1 in rates eight or nine years ago pays 30/- now, and the person who paid £1 in taxes at that time also pays about 30/- now.  Great as that burden might be, one would not object if it found a solution or even showed the way to a solution of the problem as it stands, but that is not so.  From my own experience of individuals with whom I am very well acquainted, the rotational system of work is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the worker and unsatisfactory from the nature and amount of the work done, and it may prove unsatisfactory from another angle also&mdash;it may reduce output generally from normal wages.</P>
    <P>To understand what happens to a person who loses a job in this country, I would like to give an example from my own immediate circle.  I knew a man who lost his job in 1936, through his own fault: he did not commit any criminal act, but did lose his job through his own fault.  He was idle for three and a half years before he was enabled to join the Army under the recent recruiting scheme.  A man who is idle for three and a half years with three or four children has to live on, firstly, unemployment insurance benefit, and then on unemployment assistance, and has a very hard time, indeed.  It is quite open to say that his physical condition is worse than that of a person condemned to penal servitude for a criminal offence, and it is far worse than that of a person condemned to imprisonment in Arbour Hill, where the conditions are better than those enjoyed by the unemployed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the problem is a very real one and it will grow.  While this Bill does improve certain machinery already in operation, it does not contemplate any solution.  I do not propose to offer a solution&mdash;I have not got one.  It is open to us to say, on this <Col N="2374" /> Bill at this stage, that the matter is so grave that it merits as much attention as has been given and as is being given to defence in the military sense. In fact, the threat from this particular thing is, perhaps, greater.  There is hardly any use at all in our surviving as a State or as a national community if we cannot, by our pooled wisdom or otherwise, find some solution for a matter of this kind.  It is growing more serious and present circumstances are bound to make it worse.  It may very well be that everybody&mdash;employers of labour and leaders of labour&mdash;will have to get rid of preconceived ideas in the matter.  I know Senator Foran feels that everybody ought to change, while his ideas are so fixed and correct that they cannot be changed; but it has been said that a great many trade union leaders are more concerned with those actually working than with those seeking jobs.</P>
    <P>We have confined ourselves very much to road work and that may be work with very great labour content. In driving long distances in this country, particularly in mid-week, I find that we have magnificent roads and very little traffic on them.  When you drive down beyond Naas, you find very little traffic on the roads at all, and one wonders whether there is not another and more profitable work that could be done than that of road work.  It has been suggested quite properly that, if the Minister and local bodies are confined to financing road work in places where unemployment is greatest, that may result in a considerable amount of waste, which would not be a good solution. If there are places where work is necessary and where there is no unemployment, then unemployed in other places might, under proper conditions, be drafted there.  However, the Bill is one which does improve the machinery existing.  It is proposed to do something, though only in a small way, to remedy the evil conditions which exist, and it is on that account that I welcome it and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a comment or two, perhaps I could answer a point raised by Senator Hayes, who has said that there are magnificent roads and <Col N="2375" /> very little traffic on them.  He meant to say that we are making magnificent roads where there is not much traffic. I am inclined to say that we do not make the roads where the traffic is. There is complaint amongst the farmers who live in the more remote regions that we are spending a great deal of money on main and trunk roads, where Senator Hayes and people like him and the Minister can travel in cars, but where farmers with horses and carts cannot travel; and we are spending very little money on the other roads where horses and carts and donkeys and carts travel, and where there is much more evidence of life than there is on the trunk roads.  I know that people in the towns and cities cannot see things from that angle, but that is the fact.</P>
      <P>I feel that if this Bill were going to fit into some national plan for the attempted solution of unemployment, one could be enthusiastic about it, but I do not think it is fitting into any plan: it is just a small effort, a sort of patchwork Bill, for the relief of unemployment here and there.  It is a temporary measure which is not going to give work of a reproductive nature. If men work and can manage to live&mdash; and it is essential that men get work in order to live&mdash;and if they are prepared to do the work when they get it, we may pass on to a condition when we may find a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a protest or two about certain things contained in the Bill.  I refuse to accept that the obligation is on local authorities to find a solution or bear the cost of the relief of unemployment.  I think that is neither just nor fair, and that unemployment is not going to be solved in that way.  In Section 3, sub-section (2), the Minister is taking power to dissolve local authorities who refuse to carry out their duties in regard to this Bill, or who, in the opinion of the Minister, have failed to carry out those duties.  I put it to the Minister: why will a local authority refuse?  I must say that, as things are at present, I am not prepared to believe that any local <Col N="2376" /> authority will refuse, just out of cussedness, to do anything in regard to this measure.  On the whole, local authorities have gone beyond the limits in regard to what they have done or are prepared to do in making their contribution for the relief of unemployment. In my view, if local authorities are not prepared to implement this Bill, or make their contribution, it will be for the very good reason that the local people feel they cannot find the money, and that it is unfair to ask those paying rates in rural districts to be saddled with further expense for the relief of unemployment.  That is why local authorities may refuse, and, in that case, it is unfair of the Minister to ask for powers to dissolve a local authority because in its judgment it refuses to put a further financial burden on people who are already carrying more than they are able to bear.  The Minister should not insist on such powers in that section.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 6, sub-section (2), where moneys borrowed by the local authorities for the purpose of carrying out certified work shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of such local authority, I fail to understand why the Minister wishes to do that. After all, any work that any local authority has to do, and any expenditure which it incurs, is a charge on the income of all the people within the area in which the local authority functions.  Now, although power is being taken in this Bill to provide that the amount which a local authority may borrow for this purpose shall not be added to the sum total of its indebtedness for the purpose of borrowing, the fact remains that the local people will have to bear the cost of the money which is borrowed.  Therefore, it seems to me that what the Minister is really doing is this: he is pretending, and only pretending, to lighten the debt on the local authority, because, in fact, the debt is there and will be charged on the incomes of the local people.  I think myself that it would be much better to have the full debt written down against the local authority since they are being called upon to make provision to meet it. They have not only to repay the money <Col N="2377" /> borrowed, but also pay for the service of that money.  It has to be remembered that, when you go on borrowing, you do so in the belief that the productive capacity of the people in a particular area will enable them to shoulder the burden placed on them, and to repay the debt incurred.  In my view all our local authorities through the country to-day are being called upon to carry greater burdens and liabilities with regard to all sorts of schemes than they are able to carry, having regard to their present incomes.  In these circumstances, I think it is unjust to expect any further contribution from them towards the relief of unemployment. I think, if the present policy is going to be pursued, that instead of relieving unemployment you may very well add to the numbers of unemployed in a particular area.  You may do that by placing such a heavy burden of debt on employers, and indeed on all the people in the area, that they will not be able to carry it.  I say that it would be much better to write down the debt against them.  Let it be put on the debit side of their account, and let them not be put in the position of feeling that, if they borrow additional sums for some specific purpose, they do not owe £1,000 or £10,000 or whatever the sum may be, while in fact they do owe it, and as well will have to pay for the service of the debt.</P>
    <P>In view of the burdens which local authorities have to carry at the moment, and in view also of the present income of farmers and the difficulties they have to face, I do not think they should be asked to make any further contribution towards the solution of unemployment. I recognise that the total amount which is going to be asked for is small, but in principle I do not think it is their obligation or responsibility to solve this problem.  If they are willing, or if they believe they are able to make some further contribution, I think they will do it, but, on the other hand, if they feel that they are not able to do it, then I do not think the local authorities which come to that decision should be dissolved by the Minister's order.  I think it is financially unsound to adopt any such policy.  I think myself that, if the local authorities <Col N="2378" /> have to spend money, it should be debited against them for the purposes of borrowing.  They should know the debt is there.  Those who have had to borrow know that you can do so up to a limit, but there is a limit beyond which you cannot, with safety, go.  I think it is true to say that practically all our local authorities must have reached that point to-day.  If the local authorities are obliged to carry burdens and liabilities which they are unable to meet&mdash;to borrow additional moneys and pay for the service of them&mdash;and if the people are to be taxed to meet all that, then, in my opinion, a policy of that kind is going to retard production which in itself is essential for employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that there is unemployment in this country. Personally, I would not blame any Government for the fact that there is a certain amount of unemployment. Some ordinary change, brought about by the passage of time in the complicated machine of our national society, will, I agree, create a situation in which certain sections of the community will find themselves unemployed. Under the most perfect form of government, due to some change of that kind, you will be bound to have some unemployment from time to time. One of the possible ways of meeting a situation of that kind would be the construction of works of public utility. I think it is degrading to human dignity to ask a man to employ that which is most intimately himself: his intelligence and his will, to labour for something that is of no use.  A man should not be asked to dig holes for the purpose of filling them up again.  A man fulfils his human dignity when he applies himself to something which will be useful to himself or which, because it will be useful to somebody else, he will be able to sell and get other things useful for himself&mdash;in other words, apply himself to something that will be useful for the general community. I dislike the Title of this Bill.  It uses the words &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;.  It says that the object is to make</P>

    <P>&ldquo;provision for the execution by local authorities of works of public utility <Col N="2379" /> for the purpose of providing employment for unemployed persons and to provide for matters incidental thereto&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, granted there is unemployment and granted that we all agree that there should be something done about it, if there is something useful for the community which can be made as between one activity and another, I think we would be justified in saying: &ldquo;This will be more beneficial to those who are unemployed and we will choose it rather than something else,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;We will do this work now which otherwise we might not do for some months to come.&rdquo;  But the implication in the Title to the Bill, as I read it, is this: that the words &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; are just dragged in when the real proposition in the Bill is to have a sort of excuse for giving money to men, of putting them on work of no public utility.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;work of public utility&rdquo; are defined in the Bill.  My definition of public utility would be this: to create something which is going to be useful to the public generally.  The definition we get in the Bill is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A work which is within the powers of any local authority or any two or more authorities acting jointly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The work of digging holes in the ground or of tearing up pieces of paper is within the powers of a local authority, but that does not mean to say that the work is going to be useful to the community as a whole.  It seems, therefore, to me that the definition of the words &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; in the Bill is fundamentally wrong, because it simply means an excuse for giving money to put people doing something which is going to be of no use to anybody.  When we come to Section 2 we also find the words &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;.  Presumably, the works undertaken under that section are likely to be of public utility, and the considerations that will enter into the decision to undertake them in this particular time and place rather than in another time and place will be this: <Col N="2380" /> that they will enable people who are otherwise doing nothing to do work of real utility for which it will be justifiable to pay them But, as I read Section 1, it means that the first purpose of the work done is the utility of the thing created, and the secondary consideration that it will have a certain effect on unemployed people.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 says that in that case the Minister may certify for the work, the fact of course being that the real purpose of that work is exclusively to give an excuse for paying men for doing something without any relation whatever to its utility.</P>
    <P>When I come to Section 2, I find another thing to which I object.  If anybody ever takes the trouble to remember anything I have said, he may remember that on various occasions I have pointed out here that local governing bodies are actually the spenders of money in the collection of which they have no responsibility whatsoever.  The central Government collects an enormous amount of taxation and hands a very large amount of that over to the local governing bodies. I rather dislike that practice because if local governing bodies are going to exist and to enjoy certain powers, those powers should be defined.  If they are spending money raised partly by themselves and partly by the Government, that gives an excuse to the Government to interfere with their work, takes away the real exercise of their powers and usurps those powers, for which there is justification when the money being spent is largely provided by the Government.  As I read the second section&mdash;I am subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;it means that, whereas the local governing body has to make itself very unpopular by imposing levies upon the people and taking their money from them, the Government turns round and says: &ldquo;You having collected the money, we are going to decide on what it is to be spent.&rdquo;  That is the obverse of what I protested against on other occasions. I objected to the Government collecting money and local governing bodies deciding how it should be spent.  I object more strongly to local governing bodies collecting money and the <Col N="2381" /> Government, in absolute usurpation, coming along and telling them that this work must be done and not the other work.</P>
    <P>Section 6 seems to be a perfectly silly section in a way.  For this sort of work, the power of local governing bodies to borrow may, under this section, be extended beyond the present limit.  From the way the section is worded, it seems to say that the local governing body can keep on governing, and pretend to itself that it does not owe the money. I have felt for a long time that this business of State borrowing and local government borrowing is a very dangerous system.  I admit that practically every country in the world is consuming and destroying annually more than it is creating, due to the fact that there is a belligerent crisis.  It is unfortunate that since this State came into existence we have never had a non-crisis condition.  We had a sort of crisis arising out of the civil war.  We had dozens of incidental crises.  We had the emergency of the economic war, and now we have the emergency of general warlike conditions in Europe.  War is an abnormal thing, and, under abnormal conditions, you do abnormal things. It is reasonable, to some extent, that when a long condition of peace is broken by a condition of war, you should spend more than you are actually producing; but we are doing that all the time, not only nationally, but local-governmentally.  I think that, instead of extending the powers of local governing bodies to borrow money, these powers should be more restricted. When they borrow, they are pledging the future; the fruits of our labour are not sufficient to pay for what we want done during our own lifetime.</P>
    <P>This national and local government borrowing means that, having inherited the good and the evil of the past, we accept that as a gift from the past; we spend the fruits of that past labour and of our own labour, and then we want to sit down and spend the fruits of the labour of those people who are possibly not yet born.  That is going to have a disastrous effect.  We may console ourselves by saying that posterity will have to face up to that <Col N="2382" /> and that we shall be relieved of the trouble.  But it seems to me unjust that we should go on borrowing money to meet our own immediate, instant difficulties&mdash;not to create things that will survive through a hundred years. People of a later date will have to pay not only their own ordinary running expenses, but they will have to pay for the things we have consumed.  That is a very dangerous position.  What we are doing here is extending the powers of local governing bodies to borrow money to meet the immediate emergency or crisis, but an emergency or crisis seems to be almost endemic with us&mdash;a normal condition.</P>
    <P>I know it is always easy to close your eyes to what is going to happen to-morrow and, in times of emergency, one is justified in doing that.  But what was our position for years before war was declared?  We were increasing the amount of our national debt.  Each local governing body was increasing the amount of its debt.  What happened in connection with the spending of that money?  I have heard it stated, time and again, that portion of the money was spent in building hospitals in the country and I have heard of specific cases where the new hospital is able to provide only for the same number of patients as was provided for by the old hospital.  A vast sum of money is spent on building a new hospital which will only serve the same purpose and the same number of cases as the old hospital did.  That has one effect&mdash;the cost of maintenance and the cost of running the new hospital is much higher than it was in the case of the old hospital, but I do not want to make that point.  My information regarding specific cases may be quite wrong, but very often the things on which we spend our money will not relieve the future ratepayers.  We merely give them an additional burden.</P>
    <P>Take the case of roads.  Everybody loves to think we have magnificent roads.  They love to hear tourists come along and tell us how splendid our roads are and what a pleasure it is to motor over them.  I think that we have, per area or per population, more road length than any country <Col N="2383" /> comparable with ours.  We have roads all over the place.  I am always interested in making voyages of discovery and, in County Dublin, there are hundreds of roads which I am promising to traverse so as to see where they lead or what purpose they serve.  For the condition of our country&mdash;area, population and so forth&mdash;we have far more than the average mileage of road. You cannot go growing wheat on these roads, so that they are not productive, but their maintenance is a recurrent burden.  The spending of money on roads is largely overdone.  One of the effects of our good roads has been to make everybody think that he ought to have a motor car.  We have far too many motor cars in the country.  I always explain to people that, as I am not a commercial traveller, I do not belong to the motor-owning class. Everybody assumes that a motor car is an ordinary necessity.  Many millions of pounds were sunk in the creation of railways in the 19th century.  Lines were laid down and all that capital was invested and the railways could still function productively if they were used sufficiently.</P>
    <P>What did we do?  We taxed the people to an enormous extent and built an enormous mileage of roads which were only a delusion to the people and which persuaded them to go careering around the country at 60 miles an hour in the latest models of motor cars.  I may be exaggerating, but I mention that to illustrate my point.  We poured out that capital, taken from the people's pockets, and the capital which was poured out and the lines which we laid down ceased to be productive, and nobody to-day in the railway business is very happy, except in relation to whatever ease they may get as a result of the war. The people paid more taxes for roads and they spent more money on motor cars in order to waste more time in going from nowhere to nowhere, with the result that the accumulated value of our railways is completely gone.  I give that as illustrating the general tendency of what is happening to-day.</P>
    <P>I quite recognise that there is unemployment, <Col N="2384" /> and I think the Government is to blame, by its action, for the degree and extent of that unemployment problem, but, independent of that, I think that, even if we were the Government, there would be some unemployment. I recognise that when a man is unemployed, the State should do something for him and a good thing to do would be to employ his labour and to put him working hard in the creation of something which would be of general utility to the community, both now and hereafter.  All that has, I think, gone, but the implication of the definition and of various points in this Bill is this completely fallacious doctrine: We want to give the people work.  We do not want to give the people work; we want them to enjoy what comes from the fruits of work, and you do not enjoy any fruits from digging holes in the ground and filling them up again, from tearing up pieces of paper, or from doing the 101 useless things which would easily come within the definition of a work of public utility in the Bill.</P>
    <P>What I want, firstly, is, that the local governing body shall be responsible for the spending of the money it collects and shall make decisions in respect of it, that the Government shall decide on the spending of the money it collects, and not that one should do the job of the other or usurp the right of the other.  Secondly, I should like the whole preoccupation of this Bill to be that the work which is going to assist in relieving these unemployed will eminently be directed to the creation of works which will serve the people hereafter.  Whether it is due to the drafting of the Bill or whether it is due to the fact that the Minister has only one idea in mind&mdash;that a lot of people are clamouring to work because they want to enjoy what would normally be the fruits of work&mdash;his only idea is to give them something to occupy them and to let it be of the nature of relief work because the idea of relief works in this country has always been that it shall be of such a nature that the vast bulk of the money is spent in payment for labour and the lowest possible amount spent on materials.  That is quite right once you accept this doctrine  <Col N="2385" /> of relief works.  I think that relief should be an element in the work here proposed, but the idea of the utility of the works to be done is not sufficiently brought out and there is revealed the idea in the Government's mind: Put them digging roads from nowhere to nowhere; put them doing anything at all, whether or not it is of any use to anybody and pay them an economic wage for it.</P>
    <P>That is my objection to the Bill.  I do not propose to vote against it because we must recognise that there is this appalling problem for which the Government is not entirely responsible and that there was, before the war came, this problem of unemployment which, in conditions of war, is not going to diminish but rather to increase.  The demoralising physical hardships of the people in doing nothing is something to which we must advert and on which we must be prepared to spend money, but I do feel, and I have always felt, that to put a man directing his mind and physical energies to doing something when his mind internally affirms that all he is doing is of no use to himself or to anybody else is degrading to labour.  If men are going to work, let them be able to say to themselves: &ldquo;Though I am toiling in severe weather, the fruits of my labour are going to serve me, my family, my neighbours and, possibly, even the generation that comes after us.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's statement, one would get the impression that this was a somewhat innocent measure&mdash;largely a machinery measure&mdash;in order to enable work to be legally carried out in the areas of two adjacent local authorities, but I regard the principles involved in it as going much further.  Admittedly, unemployment is a serious matter and, incidentally, I may remark that the growth of our unemployment is rather a sorry comment on our much vaunted self-sufficiency.  I do not propose to pursue that line, but I think that if we had not adopted this rigid doctrine of economic and political self-sufficiency, our unemployment problem would be less serious, but the problem exists and we have to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2386" /> I do not suppose the Minister would say that this Bill represents the only way the Government has for dealing with unemployment.  It is only a partial method, but it strikes me that a dangerous and wrong principle involved is the Minister's power to dictate to the local authorities what works they shall do.  That strikes at the whole principle of local autonomy. In the early days of local government, the local bodies were supposed to be the nurseries for the training of people in the responsibilities of local administration. They were largely left unfettered, but since then the encroachments of the central authority have continued increasing, and the whole idea of a local authority being a training ground for higher political duties has completely gone.  They appear now to be nothing but creatures to be dictated to by the central authority.  In those early days on local authorities, we had a certain amount of power and patronage, and it was quite interesting to see how that patronage was exercised. You knew that there was an appointment to be made, and you got a large meeting, and, undoubtedly, there were cases of appointments which were not quite as good as they might have been, but that was inevitable in any system of training.</P>
    <P>That is all done away with, and these local authorities are now mere creatures under the dictation of the central authority; but we are going very much further when, apparently without any financial contribution whatever&mdash;so far as one can judge from the Bill&mdash;the Minister has power to say: &ldquo;You shall carry out any work I decree.&rdquo;  Has the Minister the power to go outside the services usually germane to local authorities?  Has he power, if he thought fit, to make them put up a recreation hall, a theatre, a cinema or opera house, or are his powers purely confined to roads, sewers, water, and all the works germane to local authorities?</P>
    <P>There is one question which I should like to ask the Minister.  To what extent does he seek to obtain the consent of the local authority to those works which he is going to hoist upon them? <Col N="2387" /> I do think it is very necessary indeed that the local authority, if it is going to preserve its self-respect and its sense of responsibility, should be consulted, and only in the last resort should it be ordered to carry out works of which it does not approve.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the necessity of carrying out those joint works under adjacent authorities, works which are necessary for the good of both.  You cannot, in any planning, separate the county of Dublin from the city, but in that connection I would ask the Minister what has happened to the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal, and when are those recommendations going to be put into force?  That is the logical and proper method of dealing with the difficulty in that part of the country where the problem is most acute.  To my mind, that would appear to be the correct and logical way of solving the difficulty in regard to work in those adjacent areas.  My objection to the Bill is that it undermines and takes away from the local authorities their sense of responsibility.  Under the Bill there is power to dissolve any local authorities which do not accept the Minister's dictates.  That creates antagonism between the central Government and the local authority.  Looking at the thing in broad perspective, I feel we have now reached the stage when it would be better if the whole of this local government machinery were recast, and if the local services were done altogether as part of the national scheme.  It would be much more logical; there would be much less friction; and I think we would not get those squabbles which are all too frequent in the proceedings of local bodies.  I am quite serious about that. We are getting right away from the doctrine that the local authority is a responsible entity, which made mistakes and through the mistakes had received education.  Look at that deplorable statement in the Press yesterday&mdash;perhaps it is outside the ambit of this Bill&mdash;about the Cork Street Hospital.</P>

      <P>I am merely illustrating the stage we have reached in conflict between local authorities and the central Government.  I am seriously suggesting that the time has come when the central Government should take over those services altogether.  There is only a small area involved&mdash;I believe the whole thing is not much bigger than the two Ridings of Yorkshire&mdash;and there should not be those encroachments on the powers of the local authority.  We are going to be told nothing whatever in this Bill about the financing of those works, and what contribution the local authorities are going to get.  I think it would be far better, and certainly more efficient from the point of view of machinery and despatch, if the central authority took over all those local services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not profess to give us a solution of the unemployment problem, but it is useful in so far as it will help to alleviate this terrible evil to some extent.  The main object of the Bill is not to carry out particular works in any area but really to endeavour to afford some employment to the unemployed men in those localities.  What is the best way in which this could be done?  Any work which would entail the maximum labour cost with the minimum material cost would be the ideal, and I take it that any local authority will do all that it possibly can to find out what work of that kind can be done in its locality. I do not quite agree with Senator Sir John Keane about the interfere of the Department with local bodies.  It is sometimes very necessary that the Department should interfere with the local bodies, because very often the members of local bodies are keenly interested only in their own particular portions of the constituency.  I think Senator Sir John Keane will agree with me when I say that at meetings of local bodies every member is endeavouring to get as much work as he possibly can carried out in his own particular district, irrespective of the cost. When you have a body of men anxious to carry out those schemes in their own particular areas there is always a danger that work will be carried out <Col N="2389" /> which will not be conducive to the general well being of the community as a whole.  It is very necessary to have some central authority to keep a check on wasteful expenditure, and to that extent the interference of the Department serves a very useful purpose.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Baxter who spoke about our main roads and our expenditure on them.  To a great extent I agree with Senator Baxter. I am a motorist myself, but I can see the grievances of the rural dwellers who very often have very imperfect roads leading to their homesteads. When arguing the question out with the local authorities the officials very often say: &ldquo;Well, the farmer enjoys the benefit of the main road.  When he is going into the neighbouring town he uses the main road, so he gets the value of the expenditure&rdquo; but they quite forget that that main road is very often destructive to the farmer. The greater number of the main roads which we are providing all over the country are absolutely unsuitable for horse traffic.  They are all right for the motorist, but the moment the farmer's animal comes off the water-bound macadam on to the tarred road he very often falls and breaks a leg, so that the farmer is paying for an amenity which is destructive to himself. We spend a lot of money on roads, but I wonder could we find any other schemes which would give us what we want?  We want as much labour cost as possible with the minimum cost in material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All over the country there are isolated villages and hamlets, very often centred around a school.  All of us who come from the rural areas are familiar with them, and in many of them there is absolutely no water supply whatever. The school children run very grave risks in those places.  In the summer months when they want a drink of water they have to run the risk of drinking water which is absolutely dangerous.  I think water schemes could be provided in many of those places at a very low cost.  Such schemes would be ideal because the greater part of the expenditure would be labour cost.  Very often, the water <Col N="2390" /> could be obtained quite close to the hamlet or school.  There would be no necessity, for instance, to provide an expensive reservoir.  By tapping a well at some distance from the school a very good supply could be easily obtained.  The cost of the piping would not be considerable, and the labour cost would be the principal portion of the expenditure.  I think such schemes as that should be encouraged, and I am sure there would be no difficulty in getting the Department and the local authorities to agree in regard to them. Senator Fitzgerald also spoke about roads, and referred to the fact that they are used by tourists who come to the country and who praise our roads. I would like Senator Fitzgerald to give us a solution of the problem he has put to us.  Where does one start and where does one finish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to the rotational system of work.  That system is not in favour with the men down the country, as far as I know.  I can understand the underlying idea which is to spread the work as much as possible and prevent the workers from getting rusty, so to speak, but it is unfair in this way that there is a time lag between the time the man ceases work and the time he picks up his unemployment benefit and that time lag is very unfair.  There is a period during which the man is left without any unemployment benefit after his wages have ceased and unless some way could be found for bridging that gap it will remain rather unfair to the men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, local bodies, I take it, could not touch afforestation schemes. Afforestation is another scheme that would provide the maximum of labour costs.  The man who digs a hole in connection with afforestation is not digging it uselessly and the digging of such a hole and the filling of it again would be of great national benefit if applied to afforestation.  Of course, I can see the difficulties.  We have an efficient body at the moment looking after afforestation, but it is quite <Col N="2391" /> possible that smaller schemes could be undertaken by the local authorities in conjunction with the forestry branch of the Department of Lands, and it would be a very useful way of providing employment.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Sir John Keane about the policy of self-sufficiency. I think no man in Ireland is unaware of the fact that but for self-sufficiency we would be in a parlous condition to-day.  The policy of self-sufficiency has justified itself.  We would be short, and very short, of some essential foods in this country to-day but for the policy of self-sufficiency, and I think on any ground the policy has been justified.</P>
    <P>With reference to the financing of this Bill, I have nothing to say.  I do not think any other solution could have been found because the local bodies, obviously, could not bear the cost of all the expenses and, on the other hand, it would be unfair to ask the State to carry the whole burden.  Somebody pointed out that the individual ratepayer is a taxpayer as well, and whether the cost comes through the local rates or through the Central Fund it is the same man bears the burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, if I had the good fortune or otherwise to be the Minister for Local Government, I would have termed this Bill the Unemployment Improvement Works Bill.  Relief, for one reason or other, due to our past history, leaves a nasty taste in the mouth amongst the people in the country.  To come to the point at issue, I do not see how anybody could have any objection to this Bill. I thought it would be received unanimously, because the one thing we have heard most about for a number of years in connection with relief is about doles.  The question was asked, why are not the people made to do something for the money they are receiving? Why do not the men work for the money?  It would even satisfy most of the people if&mdash;as Senator Fitzgerald suggested&mdash;they dug holes and filled them up again; but they did nothing <Col N="2392" /> at all.  This is a very reasonable effort, I think, to remedy that very undesirable situation, because under these relief works&mdash;improvement works, I would like to call them&mdash;useful work can be done, and thus, instead of that money being given for relief, the men will now do something for the money they are receiving.  It is not at all necessary, as Senator Fitzgerald says, that they should do something useless, such as digging holes and filling them up again.  There is a whole lot of very useful work to be done in the country. For instance, there are various bogs where there is plenty of turbary, and they are inaccessible by reason of the very bad roads into them.  At the moment I am not quite sure what class of work the Government have in mind, but I do suggest that it would be very useful work to make roads into bogs that are inaccessible at the present time.  There are also many good bogs that cannot be used because of the amount of water in them.  If those bogs could be drained, where that is necessary, and roads made into them, where roads are necessary, I think it would be very useful work for the country as a whole.  There are many other such local works that would serve a useful purpose for many years.  I think this Bill, while giving necessary employment, can certainly do great work for the country.</P>
      <P>Some play was made that the expression &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; might mean anything, that it might mean tearing up papers or anything.  To the ordinary lay mind, &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; means public usefulness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a very ordinary man I can draw my own conclusion as to what it means, and I think Senator Fitzgerald should be much more apt than I am in that way.  His experience is much greater for interpreting the meaning of what may be in any Bill. However, we will let that go by the board.  I accept &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; as meaning public usefulness, and I think <Col N="2393" /> everybody who reads this section in an ordinary way will take the same meaning out of it.  I am sure much useful work can be done under this Bill.  I believe that in the backward areas, what are called the boggy or mountainy areas, any amount of work can be done which will be of good service to the poor people living in those areas.</P>
      <P>I notice reference has been made&mdash; with some amount of contempt almost &mdash;to the great services that have been given to motorists as apart from other sections of the community.  I believe &mdash;and I know a little about it&mdash;that the motorists in this country are the most highly-taxed section of the whole community, quite apart from being ordinary taxpayers and ratepayers as many of them are.  Furthermore, they use these vehicles only for their business purposes, to keep on the business of the country.  There are very few people driving around in motor cars now just for the pleasure of the thing. I do not know a motorist who has his motor car merely for the purpose of touring around the roads.  All motor cars are used now for business purposes. As I said, while motorists are ordinary taxpayers and ordinary ratepayers, they are very heavily taxed as well.  I would say that the duty on petrol is about 33 or 40 per cent. of the price and there is also a big road tax.  It is not really the ratepayer or taxpayer who is making roads for the motorists.  The motorists are making the roads and paying for them themselves, and I think the general public should recognise that.  They are a very heavily taxed section of the community, and I think it is not right for anybody to suggest, by innuendo or otherwise, that the ordinary poor people are making roads for motorists to go touring around the country.  That is ridiculous.  They are paying for all that service themselves and paying very dearly too.  To come back to the Bill: it has my entire approval and I think it will have the entire approval of almost everybody in the country.</P>

It would have been a great pleasure to me to be there <Col N="2394" /> to welcome the Minister and to congratulate him and his Department on the stupendous progress and work that has been achieved in the last six or seven years and the years preceding them.  I was amazed to hear the speech of Senator Fitzgerald.  I wonder has he lost touch with the rural parts, or has he any conception of the conditions under which the rural community, particularly the poorer people, the working classes, have to exist?  I want to make a protest, as one of the mere creatures indicated in the speech of Senator Sir John Keane.  I happen to be one of the mere creatures associated with public bodies; I am a member of a board of health.</P>
      <P>Anyone hearing some of the speeches made here to-day&mdash;retrograde speeches, to my mind&mdash;would come to the conclusion that certain Senators seem to have lost all touch and sympathy with the duties and the responsibilities of public bodies.  Our primary duty is to administer affairs equitably and to see, in the course of our administration, that due and proper regard is given to the capacity of the general ratepayer, while at the same time making essential provision for God's poor.  I will ask Senators to throw their minds back a quarter of a century and recollect the legacy that we were left by a great and beneficent Empire, a legacy of ruin, devastation, filthy hovels, foul, disease-breeding places in which the noble children of our race had to exist.  At that time there were large, important towns without a water supply or a proper sewerage system.  The whole thing was the very antithesis of decency, progress, democracy and Christian ideals. Who can deny that that was the condition of things then?</P>

    <P>In the town from which I come I remember that there was an outbreak of fever, largely due to the existing conditions and the want of proper services. We had not many ambulances at that time and we were obliged to use other modes of conveyance to take away those affected with the disease, many of them bread-winners.  It cost the ratepayers something in the region of £4,000 or £5,000.  Senator Fitzgerald has referred to the need of <Col N="2395" /> works beneficial to the country.  What grander work can you do than has been done since the advent of our native Parliament?  In later years remarkable work has been done in clearing away the dirty, disease-breeding hovels.  We have not dealt with all of them yet, but great progress is being made in their removal.</P>
    <P>We were complimented by the Minister for the great work that has been done in our county.  While we fully appreciated the hardships under which the farmers are labouring, we realised at the same time that we had certain duties and responsibilities and we felt that we had a major duty in regard to the poor.  In carrying out that duty it was our chief object to make the burden as light as possible on the general ratepayer.  I was in a certain place last evening, as a member of an organisation whose duty it was to make a report on existing conditions. I saw a father, a mother and 11 little ones.  They had scarcely room to stand in the kitchen.  The rain was pouring down; it was coming through the perforated, galvanised roof.  That is the type of thing we sometimes have to face.  With the help and co-operation of the Government, and because of the magnanimity of public bodies, such things are rapidly disappearing.  No greater work could be undertaken, and no finer appeal can be made to the ratepayers and the taxpayers than to ask them to help in the improvement of such conditions.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald tells us that no work can be more beneficial to the community than the building of bright and cheerful homes and the removal of filthy, antediluvian hovels.  The ratepayers appreciate the services that are being given to them; they appreciate the present system of administration, and no charge should be levelled against the Government, against the present Minister or his predecessors, in respect of the assistance and encouragement that they have given with the object of changing the appalling conditions that have existed in this country in the hope of making this land of ours bright, cheerful, hygienic, <Col N="2396" /> progressive and constructive.  That has been the aim of the Minister and of the staff in the Department of Local Government.  They have been very helpful to us in doing all we have done.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid us a unique and well-deserved compliment when he said that ours was the first county in Ireland to act up to its responsibilities and to discharge its duties efficiently and well.  We have built about 1,400 houses in rural areas and given each the requisite area of land, within the last year.  We were assisted by a Government grant and the remainder was made up from the rates and from borrowing.  We have spent something like £160,000 in order to give suitable water and sewerage services and provide roads for the accommodation of the people.  That is great work and it should be encouraged.  I should like to point out that the Local Government Department have often restricted our efforts when we were looking for money, and we think that they move too slowly.  I do not really blame them, because their responsibility is colossal.  They have to examine everything minutely in order to see that there will be no unpleasant repercussions. But they have been somewhat slow and they have often retarded our efforts, and we felt that they might have been a little more expeditious.  I will, however, pay a compliment to the Minister.  I had not an opportunity of being in Limerick when he visited there.  I must congratulate him upon all he has done, and I trust that while he is in office he will continue his excellent work, and that the staff in his Department will continue along the same path.  I say &ldquo;Good Luck&rdquo; to him and may God spare public bodies, because they are the local parliaments that are doing great and progressive work.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us this evening, I take it from the Long Title, is primarily a Bill to deal with unemployment.  We do not propose to oppose the Bill but we intend to criticise it severely from the point of view that it will make very little indentation on unemployment as such in this country.  The works, for the execution of which the Bill imposes an obligation on local authorities, have been applauded here this evening and the Minister has been congratulated on his efforts to start these works which unquestionably will provide some employment. If the purpose of the Bill, however, is to deal effectively with unemployment it will hopelessly fail to do that.  I do not intend to spend any great length of time in dealing with this measure.  I approve of what it does and what it purports to do but if it is thought by anybody in this House that this Bill will help in providing employment for unemployed persons to an extent which will have any effect on the whole problem of unemployment, then the future will show that we shall be disillusioned in that hope and desire.  One important Deputy from Dublin City speaking in connection with the Bill said that it would not solve the unemployment problem we have here in the City of Dublin and while we could approve of the works which the local authorities will be obliged to carry out under this Bill we shall have to take far broader, far wider and far greater measures for the solution of the problem of unemployment. <Col N="2399" /> Previous speakers this evening, especially Senator Hayes, have criticised this Bill from the same standpoint but admitted that they had not a solution for unemployment.  Nearly every speaker, here and elsewhere, who stands up to address himself to this problem says there is no solution for the unemployment problem.  Are we to admit that we have reached a stage in human society where this problem baffles solution?  In our opinion there is a solution for this problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes also said that some of the institutions of the State might be menaced in certain directions, that they were possibly menaced considerably more by the fact that no solution for this chronic problem had been evolved.  The Minister for Supplies, speaking elsewhere some time ago, said that the problem of unemployment was important and that the test of this Government's success or failure was whether it could deal with the unemployment problem.  Neither the Minister for Supplies, nor, I am sure, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health this evening, will suggest that the Bill before us is going to provide a solution for unemployment, although in the Long Title the Bill is described as a measure to provide a solution or, at least, relief for unemployment.  Unemployment, like the poor, we have always with us. Public works, which are indicated in this Bill as the means of providing a remedy, have been tried in every civilised country in the world to aid in abating unemployment.  They have failed and they will continue to fail, because in themselves they provide no solution for this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How, then, are we to approach it? The sole orthodox methods applied up to the present have been through rating or through taxation.  We are told that the local community is rated as highly as it possibly can be, and that taxation is equally as high as it can be.  Therefore, we have reached the limit in these two methods of providing relief for unemployment.  How then are we to seek more taxation and <Col N="2400" /> more rating for further relief without, as we are told by our economists, taking out of circulation such moneys as are necessary to carry on industry. In other words, as this problem becomes greater it calls for greater aid and assistance, calls for greater resources from the State, and, consequently, makes the problem in itself still more difficult and still more incapable of solution.</P>
    <P>Money can be forthcoming for various other purposes.  I have only to refer to the problem of unemployment in the neighbouring country.  We have all read of the &ldquo;black areas&rdquo;, the colossal destitution that took place in England after the last war and up to the outbreak of the present war. We know that these areas were left in a state of abominable destitution by the British Government.  Little or no effort was made to relieve unemployment in these &ldquo;black areas&rdquo;, which were indeed a black patch on the conscience of the British Government. But you will notice that immediately war breaks out astronomical figures in money can be provided for the purpose of destruction, whereas no money whatsoever can be provided to relieve destitution caused by unemployment. That comparison indicates that the resources of the community are capable of relieving this distress; but these resources are not being tackled in the right and proper spirit to relieve the misery which this problem entails for the people generally.  The Bills which we have had here from time to time were mere patch-work.  As a Dublin Deputy said, they did not even touch the fringe of the problem, and we are only humbugging ourselves if we think that we are relieving the distress in the country.</P>
    <P>We have made suggestions to the Government from time to time with regard to this problem.  While we have been told on occasions that the Government are prepared to depart from orthodox methods to relieve unemployment distress, we find that no effort has been made, orthodox or unorthodox, fundamentally to deal with this problem from the point of view of <Col N="2401" /> removing it from our midst.  We are carrying on these palliatives from year to year while the sore is festering and growing worse and, like a canker, eating into the very vitals of the nation. If we are satisfied with that state of affairs, there is nothing more to be said.  But, if we realise that it is a canker eating into the very heart and soul of the nation, then something more than the miserable effort here should be made to deal with this matter.  We are told that it cannot be done.  But there are ways and means by which it can be done.  You have quite a considerable quantity of unemployed labour in this country and, unfortunately, a big percentage of that labour has become unemployable. Then there is the problem of the youths leaving school who have never entered into employment.  You have only to inquire from the police authorities to see to what extent juvenile crime has developed as a result of our inability to provide employment for these young people.  There are various social evils growing up in this country as a result of our incapacity to deal with the unemployed youths who are coming of age every year.</P>
    <P>We are told that this is a question very largely of finance; that if we had sufficient finance we would be able to provide adequate relief.  We are not interested in adequate relief as a solution&mdash;I mean, of course, monetary relief.  From the point of view of the unemployed themselves and from the point of view of the nation, we would far prefer to see these people enter into employment of some kind. Senator Fitzgerald said they should be employed at creating useful goods. The reason they are unemployed is because they are not required to produce useful goods in accordance with accepted economic laws to-day.  Then we arrive at this position: that in accordance with these economic laws this volume of unemployed people is thrown off from the volume of employed every year.  We admit our incapacity to provide for them adequately either through taxation or rating or through a combination of them, as provided for in this Bill.  We have to look at their misery staring us in the face <Col N="2402" /> day in and day out and admit our incapacity. In a lucid moment, Senator Hayes said that we would have to do something for these people even if we had to go outside the orthodox methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The lucidity will probably become permanent later.  The inchoate thought in the Senator's mind is becoming a very general thought in the minds of great numbers of people who are giving serious thought to this problem.  The methods that have been employed in our ordinary economic lives have broken down elsewhere, and they are in a rather shaky condition in most countries in the world to-day.  The whole question of economics, of finance, is being examined in the light of the extraordinary events occurring in Europe and throughout the world generally, and I would suggest to the Minister and his Government that they might also examine very carefully into this problem and as to whether we may not get away from the guiding strings of so-called orthodox finance and bring together whatever idle land is available&mdash;or make a proper use of the land, even if it is not idle&mdash;to bring into a proper relationship that factor of land and of labour through the financial channels and allow these people to create goods for their self-subsistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke of the production of goods, but I do not know whether he had in mind the use of those goods for self-subsistence or whether he was still thinking of producing goods to find a market.  The finding of a market depends upon the <Col N="2403" /> capacity of people to buy these goods, and unemployment is at present amongst us because people are unable to buy goods, and one depression is bringing the other depression along in its train and we seem to be sinking down instead of rising.  A solution can be provided along these lines, provided the Government is prepared to strike out boldly and provide a solution, and if a solution is not provided along these lines it seems to me that the unemployed will continue to be ground between the upper millstone of economic anarchy and the nether millstone of financial archaism.  We are drifting downwards all the time and no serious effort is being made to get up.  We cannot get up by the methods which thrust us down, and therefore we will have to think out some new method, and the sooner it is approached the better, no matter what conservative people in finance and economics think about the solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, in his address this evening, regretted our self-sufficiency policy, and of course, so far as this Bill is concerned, I think the only thing we can do with these people who are always regretting our self-sufficiency policy is to leave them regretting it.  I see nothing to object to in this Bill, but there are a few matters to which I should like to draw attention.  The first is in connection with the acquisition of land for the carrying out of certified relief works.  Under Section 8 a local authority may acquire land for certain purposes, either by agreement or compulsorily, and afterwards, if they do not require that land, they may sell or let it.  Sub-section (3) of that section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A local authority which has acquired any land... may, with the consent of the Minister, sell or let, by public auction or private treaty, in suitable lots and subject to appropriate conditions, any land so acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that, if I might say so, is going a bit far because, after all, if land is acquired from a person in order <Col N="2404" /> to carry out a specified work&mdash;and I assume it would be acquired at a proper price&mdash;then, if afterwards the land is not used for the purpose for which it was originally acquired, I think the original owner should be given the opportunity to re-acquire the land at the price given by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is in connection with the powers of co-ordination of public authorities in carrying out particular works.  While that is very useful, there are just one or two points that I should like the Minister to make clear.  Take the case of an urban authority formulating a scheme in an area under the control of the county council.  If the county council of that particular county did not give consent to the carrying out of the scheme, would the county council run the risk of dissolution provided for in the Bill?  The thing that arises in that connection is the question of the authority for putting up a scheme. We often see local authorities putting forward a scheme which may not be the very best or the most suitable at the particular time it is put forward, and I think there should be some notice given to the public that it was the intention of the local authority concerned to carry out this work, before the work is actually undertaken, because very often in the past certain schemes, which were not really schemes of public utility, were carried out, while there were other schemes of definite public utility which could have been carried out.</P>
    <P>Now, down the country at the present time there is an outcry about the reduction by the Department of the Road Grant.  For instance, in County Galway, this year's grant has been reduced by £11,000.  Would the Minister inform us whether the money retained from the local Road Grant this year will be put into relief works of other types?  If that were so, it would be all right.  Another matter is the rotation scheme, where men get two or three days' work in the week&mdash; three days, I think, is the usual.  That may be very suitable in rural areas, but in the towns and cities it does not <Col N="2405" /> work out so well, and I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to see that, in cases of relief works carried out in urban areas, at least, the people employed should get a full week's work at a time.  Of course, in that connection there is another question, and that is the question of pay. I think that some time in the near future we will have to consider in this country what has been done already in other countries; that is that we will have to make a family allowance.  At the present time, a man receives almost as much if he is on the dole as he would receive by working.  When he is receiving the dole, or unemployment assistance, he gets, as it were, a family allowance, but the day he turns into work he just gets the ordinary day's wages that another unemployed person gets, who might not have a similar family to keep.  That is a thing that should receive the attention of the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane said that the Minister did not state what the contribution from the Government would be, and asked the Minister to give it.  Anybody who is familiar with those schemes knows what the contribution of the Government is.  They know that the greatest proportion&mdash; practically two-thirds of the money in all cases&mdash;is contributed by the Government.  I think we all know that.  There has been great controversy here this evening also about what works should be undertaken and as to what were works of public utility.  I think we all agree that waterworks, sewerage and housing are important works to be carried out in all our towns.  I know of a number of towns at the moment where the unemployed in each urban district could be put to work immediately if whoever has the money&mdash;I am not going to enter into that&mdash;were to go ahead with the different schemes.  In most towns I think it will be found that there are sewerage, waterworks and housing schemes to be carried out, and they could be undertaken immediately.  In connection with housing, I would also say that a good deal of this money could be spent in acquiring and developing sites for the erection of <Col N="2406" /> houses.  That would afterwards have a two-fold effect: first, the effect of getting on with the work, and, secondly, it would probably involve a slight reduction in the rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane convinced me of one thing: he convinced me that he is not a member of a county council.  He said that public bodies now have ceased to be training grounds for people seeking higher political or statutory duties.  If Senator Sir John Keane knew anything about the county councils he would know that eight out of ten county councillors are potential Senators or Deputies, and, therefore, they do not seem to be what he desires them to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, possibly not.  I am not very much worried about compulsion or the compulsory powers of the Minister in urging public bodies to carry out certain works.  Anybody who has been connected with public life for any lengthy period will know that it is very necessary sometimes to exercise a certain amount of compulsion on public bodies in order to make them carry out works that are essential and useful from the point of view of the public and the people employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister, quite possibly, could find an opportunity for exercising a little compulsion nearer home. Schemes are sometimes delayed, not so much because of laxity on the part of public bodies, but because of delays in the Department.  Who is going to put the urge on there?  I know of many schemes that have been held up in that way.  I know valuable works that could have been carried through if some of the sections in the Department exercised that expedition which this Bill seems to say is necessary.  In some sections in the Department they seem to think that they cannot sanction or agree to anything in less than six months.  I put that as the very minimum. While it is desirable and necessary that some compulsion should be put on public bodies I think the Minister <Col N="2407" /> should take a look around the Custom House to see if he could not find some means of expediting the work of some of the sections of the Department. I wish to say definitely that I have no fault to find with the majority of the sections of the Local Government Department.  So far as that Department is concerned, one gets courtesy and expedition from various sections, but when dealing with public bodies, some sections certainly could do a good deal more to give greater expedition with regard to public schemes.  That is a type of legislation which the Minister might consider, even if we accept this Bill as a sop in that direction, if his Department is in earnest.</P>
    <P>Take the position with regard to compulsory acquisition orders to secure land for the erection of labourers' cottages. The Minister knows as well as I do the various formalities that have to be gone through when it is proposed to erect 20, 50 or 100 cottages.  Surely the Minister might devote some attention in that direction.  I can find no indication in the Bill that it would be possible to acquire land for the erection of houses quicker than has been the case in the past.  Does the Minister suggest that this Bill will do that? Is not that a direction towards which the Minister might direct the energies of his Department?  There are no reasonable grounds for delay in connection with compulsory acquisition orders or where valuations have to be made in connection with cottage schemes. The Minister might devote attention to such legislation to see if it could be improved.  The Minister for Finance took very drastic powers regarding the Road Fund recently.  I am wondering if we are to have a repetition of that decision in respect to other things.  I was glad to hear the remarks of Senator Hawkins about that matter and I am anxious to see what will be done.  If we are to have sweeping powers given, will there be a repetition of that decision in other directions?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Hawkins in hoping that we will not have this &ldquo;cat <Col N="2408" /> and mouse&rdquo; legislation, as it has been euphemistically called, in relation to the rotation schemes.  I agree with the Senator that that kind of employment does not suit any area and is not going to make for good work.  If a man gets only two or three days instead of a week's work, he cannot put his best into the work, and the change over is not beneficial to the work that is done. In works under this Bill I hope the Minister will not insist on the rotation scheme.  There is no good in the Minister saying, as was said in the other House, that these schemes were not introduced by his Department.  It is Government policy.  I hope the Minister will be the first to break away from it, by seeing that in works started under this Bill the rotational scheme will not be introduced.  My main objection to the Bill is that it will be the cause of interminable disputes and friction between the Department and the local authorities.  There will be discussions, correspondence, and also disputes unless the Minister takes steps to obviate delay.  There will be delay.</P>
    <P>That brings one to this point, that if anything is to be done about the unemployment problem, one must vest responsibility in somebody having a national outlook and having national resources at his disposal.  I suggest that even with the best intentions on the part of the Minister to help to relieve unemployment, he will be up against scores of public bodies who will dispute his authority, and the value of this scheme and that scheme, and that there will be interminable disputes, all of them leading to delay.  This Bill does not provide a solution of unemployment or attempt to do so.  It is a miserable contribution, but even so, there are various points that the Minister might consider dealing with, notably in connection with the acquisition of land for the erection of houses. He should indicate what he is going to do with the funds he will acquire for other purposes before taking the very wide powers he will have for dealing with local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">

      <P>The problem of dealing with unemployment has aroused fierce controversies in every country, and it <Col N="2409" /> has baffled the wits of all modern legislators. It is very easy for anyone to get up and to tell someone who is in a position of great responsibility that this Bill makes no effort to find a solution of unemployment.  After all, in a sense of fair play, I think nobody is justified in charging the powers that be with not having made a serious effort to deal with it, when those who criticise are not in a position to suggest a solution as a contribution to accompany their criticism.  Accordingly, we must assume that the rather superior type of criticism levelled at the Department of Local Government is not justified.  Several methods of solving unemployment are known to us.  Would Senators be satisfied that German methods should be given effect to here?  We were told that in that country millions of the unemployed were put to work within a few months. I have not an intimate knowledge of the methods that were availed of, but they seem to have secured results. Does anyone want such methods here? Millions of men were also put to work under another method in America, but America is a very wealthy country and could draw on its resources by raising large loans or money in various ways in order to deal with unemployment. Is that possible here?</P>

      <P>It has been dealt with there in an effort to find a solution, but in this country we have not the fabulous means that America has.  We must remember that it is only within the last 20 years we got self-government, and that we secured it at a time when values were tumbling, during the years 1922 and 1923, and then we had the years 1928 and 1929.  We came into self-government at a time when everything was dependent on economics.  If this country had had self-government 20 or 30 years before that, when there was a certain amount of buoyancy in all markets and no unemployment in any country, this country would have been able to build up sufficient reserves which would have tided us over the rainy days of the past few <Col N="2410" /> years.  But we had not that government, and that is the root cause of the trouble.  That is why we are not in a position to face the unemployment question to-day.  Any effort that we make now to provide money for schemes of employment will have to be made out of taxation.  We must realise that and be honest about it.  We have seen the efforts of the Government over the last five or six years in, for example, the policy of self-sufficiency. Whatever criticism may be levelled against it, it has at least provided work for 70,000 or 80,000 workers, in new works, making technicians of them.  If we continue that policy to its logical conclusion, it would probably put another 80,000 into work, but criticism and propaganda and Party politics have prevented a continuation being made in constructive work.</P>

      <P>We might be in a much stronger position in regard to our international difficulties and be able to look forward with more confidence if that policy had been continued.  No other policy has succeeded in putting 80,000 into work.  There is now need for a scheme of the same nature.  Take the new construction corps, for example.  If 80,000 people could be employed in that corps, it would be a solution for unemployment.  I do not say that it would be economical&mdash;it may cost a lot of money, but at least it could be done.  The self-sufficiency policy would be preferable, but in the construction corps there would be some prospect of stability for the future and honest efforts in that direction should not meet with criticism.  Under rotational schemes, people could be given a turn of work and of pay to tide them over the present situation and the difficulties that exist.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was first introduced in the Dáil it created a good deal of criticism which was really not deserved.  By the time that it left the Dáil, Deputies understood the position and it had the practically unanimous backing of the House.  The <Col N="2411" /> misunderstanding at first in the other House arose, I think, through Deputies thinking that this was an attempt by the Government to hand this problem over to the local bodies, the Government itself having failed to solve it.  It was on these lines that criticism was made and there was talk about dictation and so on.  So far as the discussion in this House to-day is concerned, I can make no complaint on that score.  There is still some little criticism of the power in this Bill to abolish local bodies, on the ground that they are trying to do their best.  Nothing is asked in this Bill but an amplification and a clarification of the powers given in Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1925, where a body which did not comply with the directions of the Local Government Department could be abolished without an inquiry.  If there are fears as to the operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act, they are not well founded.  So far as the local bodies are concerned they will submit schemes to the Local Government Department and that Department, through the Board of Works will, if long-term borrowing is necessary, make the money available in the same way as has been done for public works over the past few years.</P>
      <P>What is being aimed at is that local bodies will plan ahead.  I am sure every Senator here is aware that, from time to time, relief works have been going on in places and in ways that are not to the best advantage of the local bodies or of the community as a whole. By planning ahead the work commenced by a local authority in one year can be continued the next year, whether it be an amenity about a town or a public park or development along a river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time I took up consideration of a measure such as this was when we were faced here in Dublin with increasing unemployment and trying to get some sort of planning of work that would give the greatest labour content.  We were aware that the planning experts in Dublin had certain schemes in hands for some time, <Col N="2412" /> amongst which was the scheme for the two Circular Roads&mdash;one of them from Bird Avenue, I think, round by Rathfarnham to Crumlin, and the other on the north side somewhat similar.  These were works which would have given a great deal of employment but, if we had to take up a scheme like that and had to go a roundabout way in acquiring land, as the position was previously, and hold inquiries, it would be probably another year before we could touch the scheme at all.  That is where the provisions in this Bill apply.  I am afraid that Senator Hawkins has not read the Bill carefully, since he said that it would take as long now as before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the method is not quick enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would read Section 12, he will see how quickly it can be done.  Section 12, sub-section (1), in the last two lines it says that after the vesting order has been made the local authority may enter on and take possession of such land on a date not earlier than fourteen days after the making of the order.  It was mentioned by Senator Hawkins and by some other Senator that that seems to be somewhat drastic, and that if you do not want a certain portion of land you should give it back to the former owner.  If a local authority acquires a portion of land like that, they give a betterment value to adjoining land, and, therefore, I think it is only fair that the local authority which, after all, is a trustee of the ratepayers, should get any increased price or value for any surplus land it may have acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is not suggested that this measure will provide a cure for unemployment.  It can, at any rate, be said that it will enable local authorities to plan and get schemes of work going without being hampered or held up by cumbersome procedure.  In that way it will be of considerable assistance.  Senator Baxter spoke of works of public utility.  I think that the definition in the Bill of <Col N="2413" /> works of public utility is as wide as it possibly could be.  Any work that a local authority has it within its power to carry out at present, such as housing, waterworks and sewerage schemes, the improvement of roads, the development of parks, and so on, it can do under this Bill.  Therefore, I think the definition is sufficiently wide.  When listening to Senator Fitzgerald, it occurred to me that what was running through his mind was works of public futility.  If a local authority is to be the administering body in these matters, you cannot give it functions that it has not already.  It was urged, for example, that a local authority should be allowed to expend money on the improvement of harbours and piers.  But we already have in existence harbour commissioners to deal with these things.  Therefore, the improvement of harbours would not be a proper function for an urban or a county council. However, I felt that in that connection there might be some amendment made in the Bill, and hence it is permissible, in the case of piers or harbours that are under the control of a local authority, such as an urban or a county council, for the local authority to carry out improvement works on them.</P>
    <P>I must say that I am pleased with the reception which the Bill has got in the Seanad.  Any criticism of it that has been made here has been fair and reasonable.  The only thing that I take exception to is, that I had suggested in any way that it was going to solve the unemployment problem. Quite definitely we know that it will not.  It was never suggested that it would.  I certainly never suggested that the Bill was an attempt to hand over to local authorities the task of finding a solution for unemployment. What the Bill will do is this: it will make it easier for local authorities to carry out schemes of improvement in their various districts, and will enable them to do work that will be of permanent and lasting benefit.</P>

      <P>These quota orders propose to regulate the importation of cotton piece goods of various descriptions, as set out in the respective quota orders.  Quota Order No. 39 covers bed sheetings over 45 inches wide, bed tickens, mattress cloths, dungaree cloths over four ounces in weight per square yard, plain shirtings and pyjama cloths which are over four ounces in weight per square yard. The materials must contain more than 60 per cent., by weight, of cotton, and must not exceed ten ounces in weight per square yard.  Quota Order No. 40 relates only to terry towelling.  It <Col N="2416" /> covers all descriptions of terry towelling, again with the proviso that the towelling must contain more than 60 per cent. of cotton, and not exceed ten ounces in weight per square yard. Quota Order No. 41 relates to shirting and pyjama cloths over four ounces in weight per square yard which have a pattern woven in colour, but does not refer to plain shirting cloths or cloths with printed patterns.  As in the case of the other two orders, the cloths must contain at least 60 per cent. cotton and must not exceed ten ounces in weight per square yard.  Quota Order No. 42, the fourth of these orders, is the most comprehensive.  It refers to every type of cotton and union woven piece goods which are not already covered by the three preceding orders. Again, with the proviso that such materials shall not exceed ten ounces in weight and must contain not less than 60 per cent. of cotton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of these orders is to be found in the trade agreement made with the United Kingdom in 1938, which contained a provision that certain tariffs and duties might be referred, at the direct instance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but at the original instance of the United Kingdom manufacturers, to the Prices Commission.  When a reference of this kind was made in respect of cotton piece goods, it was intimated to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was possible an agreement might be arrived at between our home manufacturers and the British manufacturers which would obviate the need for putting the matter to the Prices Commission.  This anticipation was well founded and an agreement was reached to which these quota orders propose to give effect. The orders do, in effect, reserve to our manufacturers practically the whole of the market of 9,000,000 square yards which they can supply from their resources.  The balance of the market is virtually reserved to the British manufacturers on an understanding, which has been given effect to under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, that the duties hitherto enforced under these orders would be so reduced, so far as the United Kingdom <Col N="2417" /> manufacturers were concerned, as to afford a substantial preference to United Kingdom manufacturers in our home market.  In deciding to give effect to the agreement, the Government was largely moved by the consideration that our home manufacturers were almost wholly dependent, after the outbreak of the war, upon British sources for the supply of raw materials.  As a result of the agreement, we have reason to believe that they will be assured of a sufficient supply of such materials to enable them to meet all the demands the home market is likely to make upon them.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to raise a general debate on this question because I feel that, on it, I have been completely defeated.  One's whole position is one of bewilderment at the multiplicity of orders and the only thing one can do is retire gracefully from the combat and leave the field, undisputed, in the hands of the officials and technicians.  One has made one's protest at the whole of this policy and there is not much more to be said.  I should like to know from the Minister, however, whether, in making these orders, serious regard is had for the interests of the consumer.  I quite agree that serious regard is had for the interest of the infant industries. We hear a great deal about the numbers put into employment.  Senator McEllin mentioned that on the last Bill which we discussed.  Does the Minister realise the reactions of these orders on the consumer, the difficulty of getting the goods in many cases, the quality of the goods he can get and the prices he has to pay?  I know that this opens a very wide field and I am very reluctant to start a debate on this whole question.  As the Government have now got more experience in this matter of tariff regulation, I should like to know whether the interest of the consumer is having anxious consideration. The cost of living is going up and we have a large number of people living on very small incomes. There is a duty to them, as well as to industry and labour, to see that these small incomes will purchase as much as possible.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret to me, and, I am sure, to the House, that Senator Douglas is not here at the moment to express his appreciation of the Minister's remarks, seeing that he, probably, has a monopoly amongst our members of the technical knowledge in this matter.  I think that, perhaps, the last speaker is under some misapprehension as to the general nature of the policy of which this particular order is an example, and I should like an assurance from the Minister that in fact&mdash;as I believe to be the case&mdash;this change in quota orders is an example of a greater liberalising of our general import policy.  Am I right in thinking that, under this proposed change, we shall import a larger quantity of certain types of British goods than before, and that they will come in at a lower tariff than before?  That, I believe, is the case, and therefore, from Senator Sir John Keane's point of view, this change should be welcomed.  Am I right in the suspicion or belief that this proposition is an example&mdash;and a very desirable example&mdash;of the principle of friendly co-operation with Britain?  I think it is, and I think the fact that it is should be emphasised.  Further, I suggest that, in this whole matter of the acquisition of raw material for the maintenance of our own important industrial developments, the British appear to have been rather decent to us, especially now that they have a monopoly of the sources of supply on which the very existence of our national industries depends.  If that is so, I think it should go forth from this House that they have been rather decent to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if any quota order or series of quota orders was the result of as much care and as much close investigation as these particular orders.  In order that the problem with which they deal should be understood, it must be remembered that they do not stand alone, that on the same date and as part and parcel of the same scheme, there was a downward change in tariffs affecting most of the goods that were then tariffed. Strictly, that matter does not arise on the motion before us but it constitutes <Col N="2419" /> an extremely important part of the problem which was dealt with.  To visualise the position properly, one has to go back to the trade agreement made between Great Britain and this country.  Quite a number of detailed agreements were embodied in that large agreement, a certain number of tariffs were reduced, certain changes were made and a considerable number of specific preferences were agreed to. A considerable number of commodities enjoying various measures of protection were not specifically dealt with but provision was made by which the British Government&mdash;no doubt, at the instance of interested parties on the other side&mdash;could apply for revision of the tariffs, subject to certain general principles.  In the case of cotton textiles, as I understand, an application was made or an intimation was given that an application was about to be made.  I think the message was sent but was not actually referred to the Prices Commission.  However, that is a detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that, suggestion was made &mdash;I do not know exactly where from&mdash; that it might be a good idea if the textile interests on both sides were to get together and see if they could not evolve proposals which would be to their mutual interest.  That idea, I believe, had the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the the time, and certainly his blessing was conveyed through his officials.  The first meeting took place in Government Buildings, but whether you regard it as a proper part of his blessing or not, he made it very clear that while he would favourably consider any joint proposals that might be put before him, he could not in any way undertake in advance to agree and, in particular, that he could assure us that if he saw anything which would result in any increase of price to the Irish public, we might take it quite definitely that he would not agree.  So far as I am concerned, I quite accepted, and I feel that we may take it that the conference accepted, that point of view.  But whether it did accept it or not, I can say, because I <Col N="2420" /> acted as chairman of the joint conference, that that was borne in mind all the time.</P>
    <P>During these discussions the conference had the assistance of officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and of the British trade representative in Dublin.  Whenever asked for it, they gave assistance in many ways.  But, of course, the officials were not responsible for the proposals which were eventually submitted to the Minister.  The joint proposals were submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, in July, 1939, and were accepted by him, subject to the proviso that if he found, in actual working, that they resulted in any direct increase in price, he would feel free to take steps to discontinue them. His approval was indicated somewhere about July, 1939.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has referred to the question of increased price.  Could he say whether there were also any safeguards in the matter of quality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the whole question, but I may say offhand that I cannot conceive of the question of quality arising, unless Senator Sir John Keane means that you could reduce the quality and leave the price the same, and call that no increase in price.  I would call that an increase in price without any question whatever, and I do not see how you could honestly do otherwise.  Perhaps I ought to point out that on this occasion we are not dealing with a monopoly or a body of people amongst whom there is not keen competition.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the general approval of the Minister was given, the details had to be worked out.  That took considerable time and was done, of course, by officials of the two Departments concerned, who submitted them for criticism to the two parties to see whether, in their opinion, there was anything which in any way changed the spirit of the agreement.  This agreement was based on the principles set out in the <Col N="2421" /> agreement between this country and Great Britain.  It was accepted that reasonable and adequate protection should be given to Irish manufacturers to cover cotton textiles for the manufacture of which the Irish factories were suitable and where they could supply good quality goods to the Irish public.  It was agreed generally, following again the lines of the general British agreement, that where the goods were not made here, or where the quantities were so small that they could not be made on an economic basis here, they should be bought from Great Britain and that that should be secured by means of a substantial preference.</P>
    <P>In the working out of these principles, I think I may say that every kind of cotton textile article came up for review.  It took somewhere about six months.  They were eventually divided, roughly, into three classes of articles and, finally, into the four quota orders which we have here.  The three main divisions were, firstly, those articles in respect of which there was capacity in the mills here to make the whole, or almost the whole, of the demand in this country; secondly, those articles in respect of which there was a substantial capacity in the country to produce the demand but not sufficient to produce the whole normal demand; and thirdly, those goods which were not manufactured here, or manufactured only to a relatively small degree.  So far as cotton goods are concerned, the last category was much the largest and the vast majority of these goods have never been subjected to any protective tariff.</P>
    <P>I do not want to tire the Seanad by going into a lot of small details, but, generally speaking, I may say that a large part of the cotton consumption here consists of printed goods which are made up for all kinds of ladies' wear, overalls, shirtings and goods which have some kind of a pattern printed thereon.  They have always been free of duty, and when you add to these the goods under four ounces which, with a couple of small exceptions, have been, and still are, free of duty, you get probably 70 per cent. of the total consumption of cotton goods.  I am not sure of the accuracy of my <Col N="2422" /> figure of 70 per cent., but it is at least far above 50 per cent. of the consumption. Under these quota orders, these bulk goods, where they were previously free of duty, remain free of duty, if they come from Great Britain; and they are subject to a preference by means of a quota, namely, Quota Order No. 42; and, by means of that quota, only a small proportion of the goods which are licensed can be imported from countries other than Great Britain.  That is the method by which the preference, which was part and parcel of the general trade agreement between this country and Great Britain, operates in relation to cotton goods.</P>
    <P>The figure fixed as stated by the Minister&mdash;I think it is 9,000,000 square yards for the quarter&mdash;was an estimate of the total consumption of these goods, with a certain percentage added so as to ensure that there would be no possible danger of anybody being refused a licence.  Furthermore, it is understood that if by any chance there proved to be an error the Minister would be asked immediately to increase the quota, and I have no doubt he would do so, in order to ensure that Quota No. 42 was not in any way used as a prohibitive quota for the purpose of preventing imports.  I want to emphasise that, because of certain criticisms which have been made, and which were due to a misunderstanding of the position.</P>
    <P>As to the three other quotas, Nos. 39, 40 and 41, the goods included in No. 39, with a certain number of quite minor exceptions, are goods in regard to which it was agreed&mdash;I may say that the British representatives asked for and obtained permission fully to examine all the factories here, to see what their capacity was and what kind of work they could do; they were even invited to criticise them freely&mdash; that there was a full capacity both as to quantity and as to quality.  You may take it that, with certain quite minor exceptions which more or less accidentally found themselves inside Quota No. 39, we have here a capacity to provide more than the total normal requirements of the country.  I need not at the moment go into the details in regard to these goods, although <Col N="2423" /> I have the quota orders here. The Minister, no doubt, will give the information, and I am presuming that those who are interested are familiar with them.  Quota Orders Nos. 40 and 41 deal with what I call the second class of goods to which I referred.  They are goods where there is a capacity for a substantial production here, but not enough, at present at any rate, to provide the full normal consumption of the country.  When the original agreement was made with Great Britain, the duty on practically all tariffed articles was 40 per cent.  Under this agreement that has been reduced to 20 per cent. in the case of the goods which are under more or less restrictive quotas, that is Nos. 39, 40 and 41.  In the case of the goods that are still tariffed, and that come under the wide general quota which is not restrictive, they were reduced from 40 per cent. to 30 per cent.  I am most desirous that those who are interested in this question, in considering the merits or otherwise of the quotas, should realise that in this case it was found possible by mutual agreement to have a substantial reduction in tariffs over a considerable number of goods.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters that bear closely on this, and to which, if I be allowed, I should like to refer because of criticisms made outside.  I should like to remind the Seanad that this industry is not just one of the new small industries, in regard to which we hear, I think, unjustifiably sneering remarks at times.  Some of the goods made have been made in this country only during the last six or seven years, but the industry as a whole is one that goes back a very considerable time.  It is in no sense small.  The total number of persons employed in the factories is over 3,000, and the wages paid are in the neighbourhood of £300,000 a year, which is by no means negligible.  We are dealing, therefore, with an industry in which a very considerable number of persons are interested, although I can assure you that it happens to be one of the industries in which nobody gets big dividends.  It never has been a highly profit-making industry in this country, or in fact, I think, for years anywhere else; certainly not in Manchester. <Col N="2424" /> In this industry there is no monopoly.  There might be some trifling exceptions, but as far as I know in regard to the goods covered by the three quota orders which are restrictive in no case do those quota orders protect one firm only.  In each case there is competition within the quota order.  In the case of No. 39 all the goods are competitive.  In the case of No. 40 there are only two firms but they compete; in the case of No. 41 there are several; so that the idea which has got abroad that there is anything in the nature of a ring&mdash;I will deal with that in a moment, but I think it is more difficult on an effective quota system to work a ring than under an abnormally high tariff&mdash;is an erroneous one.  In this case I happen at the moment to be chairman of the association of which all the firms are members, and I should like to take this opportunity of stating in public that I am not aware of any agreement as to price between any of the firms.  A proposal which did come from one quarter some time ago that there might be price agreements was completely rejected, and as far as the bulk of the trade here is concerned there is quite keen competition in the country.  The industry is quite large enough to stand that competition.  I think it is particularly important that that should be understood.</P>
    <P>When the war broke out, this agreement which had been made by representatives of British and Irish cotton textile interests had not been ratified by the Government.  It had been accepted in principle, but had not been carried out.  I was approached by one of the leading representatives from Manchester who had taken part in the discussions.  He wrote to me and asked whether I thought the war would make any difference in the situation.  I replied that I had not got the slightest idea; but said that it might be just as well if we were to suggest to our Governments that they should do nothing for the time being.  Might I say, that except in so far as the question of supplies affected the issue, these quotas, taken as a whole with the tariff reductions, did not specially benefit the Irish mills. But for the question of yarns, which I <Col N="2425" /> am going to deal with, the Irish mills would have preferred to have remained without quotas and with the higher tariffs as they had before; but they had to meet the situation following the British agreement.  They met it as a result of long discussions, and reached a compromise which they believed was a fair one, but which, because of the reasons I am now going to describe, has actually worked out to our benefit, though not necessarily from the point of view of profit.</P>
    <P>A short time after the war broke out, it became pretty clear that there might be considerable scarcity of cotton yarns, particularly of certain types of cotton yarns, and it was also clear that Britain&mdash;Lancashire&mdash;had a virtual monopoly of those cotton yarns as far as we were concerned.  It then seemed probable; after the invasion of Belgium it became certain; and our mills realised then that they had made an agreement providing for certain quotas, and if by any chance our friends on the other side chose to withhold yarns from us, or to tighten up the supply drastically, we would be in a position where we would have substantially reduced tariffs and the quotas would be useless because we would not have supplies of raw material to keep our workers going.  That formed an acute problem for the industry.</P>
    <P>Our delegates went to Manchester and, I agree entirely with Senator Johnston, we were met there in a very fair spirit.  We put our cards definitely on the table and said we would not like to ask our Government to ratify this agreement, even though we admitted it was an agreement, if we were going to be left in that vague position with regard to yarns.  As a result, the matter was taken up with the British authorities and the Board of Trade and it was agreed that it would not be fair if we were not put in as good a position as Manchester firms with regard to the supply of yarns.  The result is&mdash;of course, no one can possibly tell what the future has for us or for anyone else &mdash;we have been able to keep going and have been able to maintain our supplies to the Irish market and, as far <Col N="2426" /> as I can see at the moment&mdash;of course, I am speaking now for the industry as a whole, not for any one firm&mdash;I am quite satisfied the industry as a whole will be able to supply the bulk of what is necessary as far as the goods which come under these three restrictive quotas are concerned.  That position is one of very considerable importance, and it has actually turned out that, by a measure of compromise and perhaps giving up a little bit from the point of view of possible profits from tariffs&mdash; though they are always very doubtful&mdash; the industry by this agreement was able to secure a position which has worked out definitely to its benefit.</P>
    <P>One other thing.  It has been suggested in this House and elsewhere that quotas, no matter for what reason, lend themselves to rings and monopolies and plans for fleecing the public. My experience, which is not a considerable one, is that the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce continuously have their eyes open as far as these matters are concerned.  If complaints come in from consumers they are investigated, and if consumers find that under the quotas they cannot get their goods, pressure is very soon brought to bear on the Irish manufacturer to give a very good reason why. It is not sufficient to say why, but you have got to show that it is not so. Otherwise you are told almost immediately that the quota will have to be enlarged because the Government cannot possibly allow people to do without their requisite supplies.  My reason for mentioning that is to show that under the quota system the Government has an absolute and perfect weapon to prevent anything of the nature of price rings, or rings to prevent the public from getting adequate supply, because they will not pay the price.  They simply can open the quota, and it can be done with a stroke of the pen, and done more readily, I think, than you can change a tariff.  Therefore, I personally believe that anyone who will look into the matter will realise that unless the Government and their officials suddenly went asleep&mdash;and I see no reason to think that that would happen&mdash;it would be practically impossible to get away with anything in <Col N="2427" /> the nature of a ring such as has been suggested in other places.  But in this particular industry I can say definitely there is no ring and there is no agreement whatever with regard to price.  I believe that this is an instance of the use of a reduced tariff with judicious and moderate use of quotas, by which it is possible to work trade agreements of mutual benefit, and at the same time to reduce prices.  I say I think it is likely to reduce prices partly because the tariffs are down, but more because the underlying basis of this agreement was to give adequate quota protection to the articles where large quantities could be made here and to leave to the other side goods where there could only be a small quantity.  That meant that the mills here, provided there is adequate trade, will be kept much busier on a smaller number of goods with the resultant cheapening in output. Anyone who knows anything about the textile trade will know that there is nothing that adds to the cost of production as much as continuous changing of articles, continuous changing of looms, having 300 or 400 looms this week and perhaps only half the quantity the next week, whereas continuous bulk trade will lead, and in certain articles has already led, to a cheapening of price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the scheme for encouraging the improvement of farms (season 1940-41) should be extended to rated occupiers of agricultural land, irrespective of poor law valuation, owned by persons who earn their living solely or mainly by farming.</P>
      <P>As a good many of the industrial members of the Seanad may not be thoroughly conversant with the order referred to in the motion, I propose to read it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Scheme of grants for encouraging the improvement of farms, season 1940-41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2428" />&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture is prepared to make grants for farm improvement works subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The scheme shall apply to all holdings having a poor law valuation on the agricultural land not exceeding £200 and owned by persons who earn their living solely or mainly by farming.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  Grants will be payable to rated occupiers for approved improvement works such as (a) field drainage, including improvement and cleaning of watercourses; (b) reclamation, including (i) drainage where necessary and (ii) removal of bushes, scrub, rocks and stones; (c) construction or improvement of fences; (d) improvement of farmyards (excluding buildings), and (e) improvement of farm roadways.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  Subject to the limitations mentioned hereafter and to the conditions of the scheme being fulfilled grants shall be equivalent to 50 per cent. of the approved estimated cost of the labour required for improvement works carried out in the season. The approved estimated shall not exceed twice the poor law valuation on the agricultural land, and if an applicant desires to proceed with work requiring a labour cost above that limit the additional labour cost must be borne wholly by himself.  In the case of small holdings, however, where the poor law valuation on the agricultural land does not exceed £10, improvement works entailing an estimated labour value of not more than £20 may be approved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This scheme, I think, has the approval of all parties.  It is a constructive, common-sense proposal, and if the Minister will accept my amendment it will be a great boon to all farmers. It will help to relieve unemployment amongst agricultural labourers, and it will greatly increase the productivity of the land.  I would like to ask the Minister why he limits the scheme to farms of less than £200 valuation?  The prosperity of agriculture does not depend on any one section of the farming community.  The farmer of high valuation in Leinster is essential to the prosperity of the small farmer in <Col N="2429" /> Connaught and the dairy farmer in Munster.  Prosperity of the big farmer means prosperity for every section of the agricultural community, including more employment.  For that reason I protest against the limitation which is proposed in this scheme, and I say it is invidious to discriminate between farmers, and that any scheme for the relief of agriculture should include all sections of farmers, and should include the agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>There are many schemes at present in existence for the relief of small farmers or farmers of low valuation. At the present time those farmers are practically derated.  They can obtain grants for buildings.  In many cases&mdash; of course, it does not come under the provisions&mdash;they can obtain employment on the roads for themselves and their families at good wages.  There are county council schemes under which they can have their children paid for at secondary schools and universities. A good many of those things are paid for directly by the farmers, and the majority of them by the larger farmers who are excluded from the provisions of even those schemes.  The big farmers did not complain of those schemes.  In fact, they supported and approved them.  I believe that a few years ago a big percentage of the farmers, whose case I am now advocating, would reject with scorn the proposals which I am now trying to get the Minister to accept.  But times have changed.  These big farmers, because of circumstances to which I am not going to allude, but which Senators can easily realise, are financially in a very bad way.  The farmers who were the elite of our country are now, in many cases, reduced almost to the position of mendicants.</P>
    <P>According to statistics, there are 374,000 rated occupiers of land in this country, and 269,000 are returned as farmers.  I suppose that means people whose principal means of livelihood is farming.  Of the 269,000, 217,000 are returned as giving no employment, and there are only 52,000 farmers returned as paying employed labour.  The number of farmers which this scheme will <Col N="2430" /> exclude is less than 3,000.  I say that those 3,000 farmers are the people who give most employment, and if the Minister includes them in the scheme it will mean work for perhaps 10,000 agricultural labourers in the slack times.  I may point out that 126,400 agricultural labourers, or a good many of them, will be disemployed, particularly this winter, when there will be very little stall-feeding and very little work.  To give employment to that number of persons would be of great assistance to the country and, to a certain extent, it will mean a saving of money.  At any rate, it will be no loss because of the amount which would have to be given to them if they were on the dole or receiving money in some other form.  For that reason I strongly urge the Minister to accept my proposals.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government and many others make a great fuss about the bounties, subsidies and grants paid to the farmers, but if those people were honest they would include in their statements something to the effect that the farmers are themselves paying the biggest portion of the bounties, subsidies and grants.  But bounties, subsidies and grants will not make agriculture prosperous.  All that type of thing is only tinkering with the job. What is wanted more than anything else is working capital or credit, so as to enable farmers to increase production. There is no use in asking a farmer to improve his grass land if he has no money to buy stock to graze it. I saw in the Press recently two interesting statements from distinguished professors of economics.  I would like, with the permission of the House, to quote extracts from those statements.</P>

      <P>Professor George O'Brien said: &ldquo;The intensification of production of all agricultural products is imperatively necessary if Irish farming is to prosper.&rdquo;  Senator Johnston, in an article in the same paper, said: &ldquo;It is a notorious fact that while thousands of farmers are creditors of the banks, thousands of others could make productive use of <Col N="2431" /> additional working capital if their credit was such that they could obtain it from any source whatever.  The use of such additional working capital would not only increase the output per person occupied in agriculture, but increase its capacity to add to the number of persons so occupied.&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;Inability to stock the land means loss to the nation as well as to the farmers concerned.&rdquo;  Those statements from two such important people are well worthy, I think, of the consideration of the Minister and the House.</P>
      <P>I saw another interesting thing in the same paper.  It was an advertisement from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It certainly shows that the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation know the necessity for capital amongst the farmers.  Here is what the advertisement says: &ldquo;Good farming needs capital.  The farmer who tries to live on his land without using sufficient working capital gets the worst results.  Both he and his land become steadily poorer.  The good farmer knows that money wisely used gives an abundant return.  A long-term loan with a fixed interest rate and regular half-yearly payments is the ideal form of credit for the man who is both enterprising and thrifty.  Such a farmer can plan ahead with confidence.  With his land in good heart, with good stock, seeds and machinery, he will prosper in bad times as well as good.  If you are interested in improving your farming, but are short of the necessary capital, write to:&mdash;The Agricultural Credit Corporation, Ltd., 11 Kildare Street, Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement is a perfectly correct statement of facts, but the majority of the farmers look on that advertisement more or less as a joke.  They know perfectly well, and so do members of the House, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are hedged around with restrictions and they are in such a way that they can advance only very small sums of money.  If you write to the Agricultural Credit Corporation the first thing you are asked for will be the deeds of your farm.  The deeds of the farm are usually held by the <Col N="2432" /> joint stock banks, so there is nothing doing.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation know perfectly well that they cannot advance any money to farmers. The joint stock banks stick to the deeds.  They will give no money themselves and they will not release the deeds to enable the farmers to get money elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about chattel mortgages, but I think the Agricultural Credit Corporation would not be very anxious about them.  They might give some loans for heifers and that sort of thing.  The main point is that the farmers cannot, as Senator Johnston pointed out, obtain credit from any source.  The farmer is left high and dry.  He is becoming poorer and his land is getting steadily poorer, just as is indicated in the advertisement I read.  Senator Sir John Keane will possibly tell us that the banks are dealing with floating loans to those farmers who are very short of credit, that they are dealing with them according to plan and they have their own way of doing it.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Senator Keane that they are doing nothing for the decent honest farmer who wants to meet his liabilities.  They will certainly meet the farmer whose deeds they have, and who is a debtor to the bank, or who has a Fianna Fáil club, the Farmers' Union, or some other organisation behind him.  They will deal reasonably only with the man who will tell them to go to hell if they do not take his terms.  There is no question about that.  People have come to me from all parts of the country and that is their complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decent farmer who is embarrassed through no fault of his own, but as a result of Government policy, and who is now in the position that he cannot work his land, find stock or capital from any source whatever, is held up.  There has been quite a lot of talk in the Seanad, in the Dáil and in the Press about credit for farmers and the necessity of releasing frozen <Col N="2433" /> loans, but nothing has been done.  Is it not time that something was done to stop all this talk?  I suggest to the Minister that he might set up a commission, even a Parliamentary commission, composed of people like Senator Professor Johnston, Senator O'Dwyer, a few Deputies from the Dáil, like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Childers, and a few banking representatives, such as Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Quirke, to represent the moneyed element.  The Minister could also appoint his secretary, Mr. Twomey, to take part in the conference. I am perfectly certain that, if that were done, in the course of a week or two the commission would report to the Minister and an agreed scheme would be submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation will see to that.  I do not want to take up the time of the House unduly, but I would appeal to the Minister to consider my motion. The people whose claims I am advocating are small in number; they number less than 3,000.  If, however, he considers that to meet the motion in full would involve too great an expenditure, I would appeal to him to put these people on the same basis as those whose farms are under the £200 valuation and give them the amount to which they would be entitled, if their valuations were under £200.  I hope he will accede to that request, at all events.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion proposed by Senator Counihan. It is inexplicable to me why the Minister did not embrace the whole agricultural community in this scheme. The number of farmers with valuations of £200 and over is very few, but the great majority of farmers in that category are in very straitened circumstances. They also have suffered most severely as a result of the economic war.  I am perfectly sure there is not a Senator who is not aware of the fact that a number of those for whom we solicit consideration time and again by the Land Commission come under that category.  These people have to meet commitments to public bodies, and they have always given much employment, though perhaps not so much in later years as formerly.  I have several cases in mind, but particularly the case of a man whose valuation is well over £200.  He gives employment to about 30 men.  He came to my house last night and said that if he could avail of this grant he would be prepared to expend £1,000 in giving employment. It would enable him to give very considerable employment in the drainage of land which, in present circumstances, he is unable to undertake.  His rates are in the region of £300, and he pays both his moieties together in order to help the local public bodies. That man is precluded from carrying out some very necessary reclamation and drainage work, because no assistance is given to him under this scheme. Yesterday morning seven farmers came to me.  I had been telling them that I would get some forms and make some inquiries when in Dublin in connection with these schemes.  I arranged with them to fill the forms, one of which is in the hands of Senator Counihan. These men are going to carry out a drainage scheme in a bog land area which they own in common.  That scheme will release a very large quantity of water from bogs which otherwise would not be drained.  The water, when released, will flow on to the lands of a man who has 250 acres of land in the immediate vicinity but in the lower reaches.  The owner of that land is precluded by the terms of this scheme from taking any advantage of it whereas definite facilities are given <Col N="2435" /> to the seven or eight smaller farmers whose flood waters will flow in over his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is unfair and inequitable that men who are meeting their public commitments but whose valuation happens to be over the £200 limit and who in the main give much more employment than the smaller farmers, who rely principally on the members of their own family to provide necessary labour, should be excluded from this scheme.  The man who came to me last night is prepared, as I have stated, to spend £1,000 and to employ about 80 men on drainage work if he is allowed to avail of the advantages of the scheme.  I would appeal to the Minister that this particular section of the agricultural community, who are giving greater employment than can be provided in the smaller farms, should be taken within the ambit of the scheme.  While we welcome any of these schemes, I say with all respect that it is tinkering with the whole question to exclude any section from the advantages of them.  There is no doubt that the agricultural community are in straitened circumstances, and I speak as one with a very close and intimate knowledge of the agricultural community in my county.  To give you an idea of the conditions this year, the Limerick County Council made it a part of the duties of the warble fly inspectors to make an exact return of all the cattle on every farm. We know that the inspectors have to examine every beast to see that it is not affected by the warble fly.  The council insisted that they should take an inventory of every four-footed beast on every farm, which meant that when the returns were compiled we had exactly the number and the kind of beasts in the county.  Compared with the previous year, in my county, an agricultural and dairy county, there has been a reduction of 42,000 cattle. What is the explanation of that?  You can be thinking what the explanation is while I give you some more statistics. In a certain creamery not far from where Senator O'Dwyer lives, one of the most important in one of the richest dairy counties, there was a reduction of 225,000 gallons of milk <Col N="2436" /> in 1939 as compared with 1938.  Again, you will ask yourself the question, why?  In another creamery quite close to me there have been 3,000 fewer gallons of milk per day than in the year before.  Naturally, you will say that that is perhaps due to the vagaries of the weather, to the excessive heat and to the fact that there was less grass. That may have played some part in it, but in this particular creamery district the effect was not felt until September. In the same creamery in 1940, as against 1939, there were 141,000 fewer gallons of milk.  What is the reason of that?  You have 42,000 fewer cattle, you have a reduction in the gallons of milk supplied, a reduction of 225,000 gallons in the case of one creamery, while the overhead expenses continue the same and must be borne by the smaller quantity of milk received. All that reacts on the farmer.</P>
    <P>I stated in this House about 12 months ago, and I reiterate it now, that if you travel from Clondalkin to Ballydehob, you will find many farmers&mdash;and this is the cause of all this&mdash;with 15 or 18 cows, five or six of which are &ldquo;duds,&rdquo; strippers in other words.  We have the disease of abortion in cattle, which I am sure the Department is seriously taking in hands.  I can give half-a-dozen instances of farmers in my district who have 15 or 16 cows of which five or six would be &ldquo;duds.&rdquo;  They are ashamed to send them to the Roscrea factory because they are not able to buy other cattle, and they would have to admit to neighbours that they are completely broken.  The result is that they keep the 15 or 18 cows which are not equal to ten cows.  That is the explanation.</P>
    <P>As Senator Counihan has indicated, one of the things that must be grappled with is the question of a national land loan.  I have been talking to quite a number of creamery managers.  They say: &ldquo;The present Government have retained the land annuities, but they have forgotten all about the promises they made.&rdquo;  I remember that at that time some of their leaders pointed out that they would retain the land annuities and give derating, and that they would accommodate the agricultural community.  Now, I understand <Col N="2437" /> that part of the annuities which is retained in the Central Fund is devoted to central administration, a good thing in itself.  But a number of farmers say that a portion of that one-and-a-half millions should be lent to the farmers at an easy interest through the creameries, with the creameries acting as intermediaries for the collection of it and as guarantors for the repayment of the money.  Undoubtedly, something will have to be done.  If you read the statistical returns given a week or ten days ago with regard to the payment of rates in the Twenty-Six Counties this year as compared with last year you will find that there has been no improvement.  We have great difficulty this year in forcing our collectors to try to get in the first moiety of the rates. At the present moment only about five or six of our collectors have closed their collection of the first moiety.  I want to try to represent the position as it appears to us, as if I were sitting in the county council down the country. Something really must be done.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture, speaking in the Dáil, admitted that the farmers were badly off, but he said they had been badly off for the last 20 years.</P>

      <P>I think it was on the 3rd February, 1927.  Speaking then, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;That agriculture is our chief industry is not questioned; <Col N="2438" /> that it represents two or three times as much of the national wealth as all other industries combined everyone knows.  It ought not to be difficult to realise then that when agriculture is depressed the whole standard of living of the community is pulled down with it.  If you succeed in finding a remedy, in rescuing the farmer, you rescue, not the farmer alone but the whole country.&rdquo;&ldquo;The evils,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we are suffering from are the result of human action.  There is nothing of the hand of God in them.  The farmer's welfare&rdquo;&mdash;I am giving it <i>ex parte</i>&mdash;&ldquo;is the nation's welfare, and the nation's welfare is the farmer's.&rdquo;  We are told, departmentally, that of the total population of this country, returned as at work, more than half are engaged in agriculture and altogether more than two-thirds of the entire population are dependent on that industry and on its success.  Now, not in my lifetime was the purchasing power of the farmer as low as it is to-day, and there is one thing that I notice, after my 30 years being associated with them and being a fairly large farmer myself: it is the first time that I have noticed, the last 12 months or two years, that they are losing heart.  That is a bad thing. They are losing heart.  They see no hope.  Every politician and every Senator and every Deputy&mdash;we are all proclaiming from the house-tops what we will do to relieve the economic condition of the agricultural community, but very little is being done.  That is a lamentable state of affairs, and if the Government had pursued a sensible, rational policy, that condition of things&mdash;and I say it with all respect&mdash; would not have transpired.</P>
      <P>We can get millions for everything&mdash; millions to feed the white elephants of Mr. MacEntee's industries, millions to buy guns, and millions to buy everything, but the very smallest sums are provided to keep alive the basic industry of the country, upon the prosperity of which, the Taoiseach says, the whole stability and economics of this State must rely.  I am safe, I think, in suggesting that not a fraction of the time and trouble and expense of ransacking Europe and America for arms, as the Taoiseach boasted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the economics of this country collapse through the ruin of agriculture, I do not see what need we have to worry about defending ourselves against foreign aggression, because the farmer will have very little left to defend.  I do not want to delay <Col N="2440" /> the time of the House, but I make this appeal to the Minister, and I say that we welcome any assistance and help, even of an <i>ex parte</i> kind, that is coming to the agricultural community.  I say that it is obviously unfair, inequitable and unjust that that section of the people, who are extremely few in numbers but who are a section of the people who give very considerable employment and continuing employment, should not be given whatever advantages are to be had from this legislation.  They are of that section of the people, the bulk of whom, on every occasion when we appealed to them for public funds, because their commitments were heavy and the exactions of county councils on them were very large, responded and paid up cheques to meet the situation and help us to carry on public institutions.  Now, when a little opportunity comes along that accommodates 99.9 per cent. of the agricultural community, the one section of that community who are using their land with the maximum results are excluded from its advantages.  I say that if they have the advantage, like other farmers, of the agricultural grants they should equally have the advantage of this.  I have cited a specific case, and I have written, documentary authority to speak here now, of a certain gentleman in my county, who would drain about 60 acres of land, if he got the advantage of this scheme, and would employ about 80 men, whereas, without it, he fails to see why he should do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>While not agreeing with many of the arguments advanced by the previous speakers, I think there is a good deal to recommend this motion to the consideration of the Minister.  The principal argument I see in its favour is that the grant, if it were given in the case of the larger farmers, would be wholly employed in the payment of labour, which might not be so in the case of the smaller farmers. It might not be generally known that in parts of the country there is a very large population of agricultural labourers, and that there is great unemployment amongst this class.  Their employment on the land is only at certain intervals during the year, and <Col N="2441" /> their principal means of existence is the work they get on the roads or on relief grants or from the dole.  Anything that would bring about an increase in employment for this class of people would be very desirable.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would make any great difference if this thing were extended to cover all valuations, because, as the mover of the motion has suggested, the amount of the grant, even in the case of the larger farms, might be limited to the grant that would be given for the £200 valuation; so that would not account for much of the money, but it would undoubtedly bring about a great increase in employment. I should like, therefore, to appeal to the Minister to see if it would be possible to accept the principle of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to enter into this discussion at all, but I could not keep on accepting bouquets from Senator Counihan without expressing my thanks.  I have been accused of all kinds of things, both here and outside the House, for a good number of years, but for the first time I have been accused of being one of the people with a terrible lot of money.  However, perhaps that is all to the good.  I think Senator Counihan and other speakers have completely missed the point of this particular legislation.  One after another they have worked themselves into a frenzy because certain things were not done&mdash;pointing out that, if they were done, it would create an enormous amount of employment.  My reading of it is that the primary object of the legislation is to improve the land.  After that would come the question of employment.  We are all definitely interested in this question of employment and we should like to see everything being done that could be done to ensure that a greater number of people would be employed on the land.  To begin with, however, I do not know what the position is with regard to applications for this particular money, but there is an end to it, and it is quite possible that the money would not go round.  If there were only a limited amount of money to be distributed for this particular purpose I think it is quite natural that an <Col N="2442" /> attempt should be made to do the greatest amount of good to the greatest amount of people.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan speaks about the difficulties of obtaining credit.  I do not want to get into a discussion on that matter at all, but I would like to say that any amount of loans are being made by the Credit Corporation, by other bodies, and by numerous banks, on chattel mortgage and that sort of security.  I believe there is plenty of room for an extension of that business by the banks and by other similar concerns. Senator Counihan made a great case, from his point of view, for this particular type of grants in order to help farmers.  After making that plea he got to the stage of saying that Government grants would not make farmers prosperous.  I do not like to hear a speaker contradicting himself within the space of a few minutes in that way.  The point is that the intention of the Department of Agriculture and of the Government was to improve land.</P>
      <P>If that was the intention, surely the help should go where farms are poorest.  Some two-thirds of the people here are living on one-third of the land, having holdings with a poor law valuation of over £100.  The poor law valuation of these holdings is two and a half times greater than the valuation of holdings under £20.  That shows that the land on smaller holdings is in most need of improvement.  I cannot agree that any reasonable argument was put up for including holdings over £200 valuation as against the smaller holdings.  If there is sufficient money to go round, I am in favour of extending the scheme, but if not, and if the small farmers refuse to accept the grants to improve their land and give employment, then I see nothing against doing so.  Until that has been proved, then I say the policy laid down originally was the sanest policy from the point of view of farming conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Madden, I am sorry to say, became quite excited, but he was also wide of the question.  He spoke about the energy that was put into the purchase of arms, and said it was a shame that the same energy was not put into the purchase of artificial manures.  I am quite sure Senator Madden would <Col N="2443" /> not seriously object to the purchasing of arms, nor would any farmers, seeing that these arms were purchased to protect the people, and if farmers are not the principal people in this country I do not know what I am talking about.  The purchase of arms was absolutely justified, and I doubt if Senator Madden, or anyone else, would have the courage to stand on a public platform and say that such a policy was not justified.  It is the only hope we have at present, and we thank God that such energy and enthusiasm were put into that work.  It is because that was done we are in a position which otherwise might have been different.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of manures, I ask Senator Madden if he could tell me the name of one farmer who could not get phosphates last year.  I do not know one.  I go all over the country, and come into contact with many farmers, and I do not know one farmer who failed to get phosphates.  Senator Madden referred to the employment given on one big farm near where he lives.  I am quite prepared to accept the Senator's statement, but surely he will not suggest that that instance is typical of the country as a whole, or that more employment is given on big farms than on small ones.  If the Senator looks at the statistics&mdash;and he seems to be pretty well armed in that respect&mdash;he will find that the employment given on small farms, those under £100 poor law valuation, would be several times greater than on holdings over £200 poor law valuation.  Senator Counihan gave some figures which on examination would really make my case.  In my opinion it is not altogether a question of the employment given, but of the number of people being supported on a certain type of farm. I believe the smaller farms support more people, more cattle, more pigs, and more hens than the bigger holdings.</P>
    <P>The reasonable thing to do in any legislation of this kind is to try to bring about a situation whereby the greatest number of people will benefit.  I believe that many things could be done, and I am quite prepared to join in a reasonable argument or in reasonable <Col N="2444" /> criticism of the Minister for Agriculture. I put forward various things from time to time, but the Minister turned them down, just as he turned down Senator Counihan's proposal.  It is only right to point out that in a debate of this kind the principal thing that might affect agriculture here under present circumstances is completely overlooked.  What is really affecting agriculture here to-day is that it has been over mechanised and over commercialised. If we allow agriculture to become the slave of the machine there is going to be a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>We had many references to protection. I am very much in favour of protection for industries, and for everything else, but I believe we should start at the base, if we are going to make it a success, by having protection for farmers and security for farming before anything else.  What I am getting at is the tendency of allowing farming to become a question of machinery.  If so, we might as well import our wheat or baked bread as to allow farmers to be dependent on outside sources of supply for tractors, parts of tractors, or for fuel for tractors.  We have plenty of horses and men in the country, but if the present situation is allowed to continue we will get to the stage when ploughmen will not be available, as they will be gone like the thatcher to New York and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I believe that a good deal could be done along such lines, and I am surprised that Senator Counihan did not suggest a scheme to provide useful farm horses.  Something could be done in that way by the Department, by the purchase of brood mares of a special type, and I suggest that they should be bought with chattel mortgages as security, so that they could not be sold afterwards.  There is no danger that they could be sold at present, but a time might come when they would be sold.  In that way we would have here a stock of horses produced for use within the country.  You would have these horses available for transport in case of a shortage of petrol and the forage for keeping these horses going in towns and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with Senator Quirke at the moment, and hope to deal with the motion later.  He quite rightly said that the primary object of this Government scheme is not specifically to give employment, but that employment is only a means to an end which is enriching the land from a productive point of view.  There he was quite right.  He then goes on to say that, therefore, the money should be spent on the poorer land&mdash; as though it were proved.  Obviously, if the purpose is to increase the productive quality of the land, then the money should be spent preferably and primarily in a way that will, for the same value of money, give a greater increase in production of land.  I think the Senator would have been quite right if he followed on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution is perfectly clear.  The Government has proposed a scheme for giving money to farmers.  I always objected to the whole population being mulcted to put money into the pockets of one section of the community, but there could be good reason for that. If the object of the Government scheme is to pauperise farmers, why do they choose farmers of one valuation and exclude others?  If the Government is saying we must hand money over out of the public purse to farmers, that to me is just the same as drawing the dole or getting outdoor relief; but there can be another reason, and I think that is that the Government recognise that, while that land belongs to the farmers and while the fruits of that land belong to the farmer to dispose of beneficially for himself and his family, his labour and energy on that land to make it <Col N="2447" /> productive are of primary importance in their application to the interests of farmers in general.</P>
    <P>The Government proposed this scheme because it is calculated to improve the position of the people as a whole.  It is a vital part of our whole national economy.  Therefore, although under the scheme the Government is giving money to the private owners of land to be spent on improving that land, while the owners of that land will still own the land afterwards with the improved quality that will inhere in it after spending the money, that is justifiable and the money is not being given as a dole to poor people who cannot live without assistance drawn from the public purse.  It is given because the money will be spent and the fruits of that spending will extend to the whole community and be for the national good.  That is the ground of the argument. Accepting Senator Quirke on that point, why should one section of farmers be excluded?  It is not, as he says, a question of labour.  That is not the primary point.  It is for the national good, for the whole economic position of this country, to make the whole of the land more productive.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke says that a very large amount of the land belongs to the larger owners.  I am not going to argue that point, as I have not got the figures and, therefore, could not discuss it, but if that is so, the Government is taxing us town dwellers on the grounds that money is going to be spent to make this vital and overwhelming national industry more productive for the material enrichment of this country, and the Government is now arbitrarily selecting the smaller section and excluding the larger section.  You cannot distinguish between the smaller farmers and the big farmers in this country, unless you are going to say that this is really a cover to save the faces of the smaller farmers who want a dole but do not want that to be known.  I do not think that is the Government's scheme.</P>
    <P>If there is a man who owns X acres and pays on a rateable valuation of over £100 a year, and the production of <Col N="2448" /> that land can be extended by draining a certain portion of it, what does the Government do?  As far as I know it, the scheme is&mdash;I do not pretend to have my details too correct&mdash;that the Government will pay half the cost of the initial labour for improving the quality of the land.  It will do the same in regard to the small farmer who, with his sons, may do the whole labour.  In the case of the bigger land unit, presumably, labour will have to be employed.  I agree with Senator Quirke that the purpose of this is not primarily to give employment, but to increase the production of our whole nation.  But this scheme is not a dole to poor wretched farmers who cannot keep body and soul together without assistance.  They are not beholden to the State in receiving it, as that money is given to them to be used in a certain way, in which they will benefit, but in which the whole country will benefit also.  Therefore, it seems to be an arbitrary proposal of the Government to exclude certain people.  If the Government is giving half the cost of the labour to the small farmer, on the ground that it is money well spent in the national interest, then they should do it in the case of the large farmer also.  The money will be well spent. Not so long ago the Minister told us the way to get rich quickly was to kill calves, but I do not want to go over the seamy past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a theory in this country that the world was suffering from over-production.  It was really suffering from over-consumption and from insufficient and ill-regulated production. The best economic proposal for this country is one which will increase real production, that is to say, <Col N="2449" /> increase the human value of production&mdash;deducting what I might call the cost of production from the value of the produced article.  It seems to me that the Government would have been very well advised to proceed with the scheme on that basis.  A lot of land here is poorly productive and, with drainage or in some other way, it could be made more productive and that would increase the capital asset of the land.  Under this scheme, as far as I remember it, the owner has to pay for or provide half the labour for this capital expenditure on improving the land, and the Government pays the other half.  It seems to me that, if you justify the scheme at all on the grounds that Senator Quirke quite rightly put forward&mdash;the improvement of the production quality of the whole land of the country&mdash;then what is good for the small farmer is equally good for the large farmer.  I think that Senator Counihan has made a very sound proposal.  I agree that the Government, for one reason or another, might be able to put up an argument against it.  They may have other ends in mind than the end that Senator Quirke, I think, has in mind.  I have not worked out what the cost of carrying out what is proposed by Senator Counihan would amount to, but if the money is available then, as I said earlier to-day, to spend money on a purpose which is going to increase the annual wealth of the country hereafter is, I think, worth while.  What I always object to is the spending of capital money and of borrowing on the future, not to improve conditions as a whole for the future, but merely to spend the money now and possibly leave a greater burden on the people afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke has already made some of the statements that I had proposed to make against the motion.  I want to say on my own behalf that I was amazed at some of the statements made by Senator Counihan in proposing the motion.  To my mind, he did not put forward one single argument in favour of his proposal.  He talked at random about doles and bonuses and of gifts to other people as <Col N="2450" /> well as to farmers.  The amazing thing about his statement was this: that he referred to the farmers on whose behalf he said he was speaking, men with holdings of over £200 valuation, as mendicants.  I wonder would they feel complimented if they heard Senator Counihan referring to them as mendicants? That was the fashion in which he did refer to them.  Of those who spoke before Senator Quirke, the only Senator who put up a reasonable argument was Senator O'Dwyer.  He said it was probable that a greater number would be employed on the larger farms than on the smaller holdings, but, as Senator Quirke pointed out, it is not so much the actual number of labourers brought into employment as the actual number of people maintained on the land that matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear one argument from Senator Counihan in favour of extending this grant.  It is well to point out that it is not a free grant.  It is not money for nothing.  Therefore, if the people on whose behalf Senator Counihan said he was speaking are mendicants, how can they spend any of this money?  According to him, they have not the money to spend, and on a holding with a £200 valuation there could be an expenditure of twice the valuation&mdash;£400.  If those people are not in a position to raise money, or even if they were in a position to raise it, Senator Counihan did not tell us how it could be spent.  If the Senator had any argument to put forward in support of his motion, I presume he could say that some of the farms in the County Meath that he had in mind could grow wheat, or that the land there could be tilled.  But what is the actual fact?  This year some of the farmers there, with high valuations, had to be prosecuted for failing to till their land.  I presume a high valuation has been put on their land because it is good land.  The Senator could have suggested some method of improving these £200 valuation holdings, but he did not give any reason as to how this money could be expended on these holdings.  The seconder of the motion did refer to one individual and said he would spend some money.  He made a rather fantastic statement about some <Col N="2451" /> of the smaller farmers being able to drain their few fields, and said this would result in the flooding of the fields of the large farmer further down.  He said the latter could spend a lot of money on draining his farm with its large valuation.  I think that was a fairly decent argument.</P>
    <P>It was the first, at any rate, that was put up in support of the motion. Senator Counihan, as I have said, put up no argument.  He spoke of inequality of treatment, but I would remind him that in other walks of life there is also inequality of treatment. There is inequality of treatment in the payment of income tax, and also in the matter of scholarships in the case of people earning money in the cities. The Senator, when speaking, objected to the fact that the children of people with low valuations are eligible for county council scholarships.</P>

      <P>The Senator pointed out that there were discrepancies because such things were happening, but there are discrepancies in all walks of life and privileges for people with small incomes and holdings of low valuation. I think we must all take it that that is so.  I suggest that should not be used as an argument in favour of people with holdings of £200 valuation whom the Senator has described as mendicants.  I think those people would resent such a statement from their spokesman.  The Senator mentioned that about 3,000 farmers will be excluded from the benefit of this scheme, and said that if they were not it would mean direct employment for 10,000 labourers a year: otherwise that each would employ three.  I think that if they tilled their land they could do more than that.  How would farmers in the County Meath, who are simply feeding and grazing bullocks, spend this grant to improve their holdings?  No portion of this money can be utilised for the purchase of cattle or the top dressing of land.  It is reserved for the drainage of land and the clearance of dykes. The Senator did not put forward any <Col N="2452" /> concrete argument in favour of the extension. His seconder spoke of Limerick &ldquo;whys.&rdquo;  With regard to our friend's &ldquo;whys,&rdquo; I will repeat what I said to Senator O'Dwyer some time ago: that I regard the Limerick farmer as one of the laziest men in Ireland.  I said to him that I was travelling up through County Limerick in October, and saw the one crop that they save there &mdash;meadow hay&mdash;still out in the fields until half the tramp cocks were rotting. If that is the kind of farming that is carried out in the County Limerick, then I think that it should not be called farming at all.  The Senator and his friends should go down to West Cork and see how farming is done there.  The farmers there have their hay in at the end of June practically.  They do not wait until October to bring it in.</P>

It would be said in the newspapers that this hay, which belonged to the unfortunate farmers, was being taken down the rivers in the floods.</P>

      <P>I am speaking my own mind.  I repeat that neither the Senator nor the mover of the motion put forward any reason as to why this facility should be extended to these holders of £200 valuations.  This scheme does not provide a dole.  It does not mean that the farmer is going to get something for nothing.  The <Col N="2453" /> recipient will have to expend twice as much as he receives by way of grant. He may probably get half back from the Government.  If the owners of these holdings of £200 valuation are mendicants, as Senator Counihan says they are, well, they cannot get any money to spend.  In conclusion, I want to say that I think the case that has been made has been put forward in a very poor manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike some of my colleagues, I desire to address a few remarks to the motion before the House: that the Government should be invited to extend, without limitation on valuations, the concession which they have made to farmers of not less than £200 valuation.  Now, we are altogether in favour of the use of public funds as a means of subsidising labour which will increase the productivity of the land.  The only question is whether that subsidy should be extended to the people with £200 valuations and more, or whether they should be excluded.  In point of actual numbers, the people concerned are only some 3,000, but the principle that is involved is far more important than the actual numbers in question.  Those people, although they are a mere minority, have presumably equal civil rights under the Constitution with the rest of us.  They are taxpayers and ratepayers, and as such will contribute to the fund out of which this subsidy will be paid.  Yet, simply because they happen to be the holders of farms with a £200 valuation or more, they are being excluded from the advantages to be derived from the expenditure of that money.  A further object of the whole policy is to increase the employment of labour on useful work.  Those people, with farms of £200 valuation and upwards, are already important employers of labour, and would be likely to extend their employment of labour for this and other useful purposes if they were allowed to profit by the subsidy which the Government are rightly extending to other sections of the agricultural community.  I cannot understand on what principle of public policy the grant of this subsidy is limited to farmers of £200 valuation and less.  I think that that limitation <Col N="2454" /> is indefensible and inexplicable unless it is part of a general policy of prejudice against large farming as such.  I have myself recently become a small farmer.  I am the owner of 20 acres and, to that extent, I should be advocating the cause of small farmers and should be going to the Land Commission demanding a share of my neighbour's land.  Instead of that, I still find myself prepared to maintain the principle that there is room for large farms as well as small farms and that the intensively-cultivated, well-managed and adequately-capitalised farm of 500 acres is a national asset and one which deserves the encouragement of Government policy.  In fact, I should go so far as to say that there are not enough 200-acre and 500-acre farms of that kind and that we could do with far fewer inefficiently-run 20-acre farms and farms of lesser size.  It is, or ought to be, a well-known fact that there are only 50,000 owners of farms who employ any wage-earning labour whatever, and the number of wage-earning agricultural labourers is only about 120,000&mdash;an average of not more than two persons per farm.  It is quite certain that the higher the valuation of the holding the greater the probability that that holding will be an employer of wage-earning labour because we all know that holdings of £40 valuation and under are likely to be more than adequately provided with family labour and are not likely to employ wage-earning labour.  Therefore, if you want to subsidise the employment of wage-earning labour and make additions to the number of persons so employed, your policy should be to assist the large farmer rather than the small farmer because, the larger the farmer, the more disposed he is, and the more necessary he finds it, to give employment to wage-paid labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of employment which is given on the larger farm is socially, perhaps, more advantageous as well as economically more efficient than the kind of employment given by many small farms.  I have in mind a farm of 200 acres on which 20 workers are employed. When you have a farm so extensively exploited as that farm is, you have an opportunity of employing different grades and qualities of labour <Col N="2455" />&mdash;female labour as well as male labour &mdash;whereas, if you have only the possibility of employing one wage-paid labourer, that wage-paid labourer must be a man and he must be, to some extent, a man of all work.  It would be desirable for the welfare of rural society that employment for female as well as male labour should extend, and large farms employing six, eight, ten or more workers are much more likely to be able to find employment for female, as well as male, labour than smaller farms which employ only one or two wage-paid labourers.  There is a dearth of feminine wage-paid employment in the rural areas and, as a consequence, the country is being denuded of women folk who are moving into the towns.  The population of these districts is, accordingly, decreasing and there are other social disadvantages. The large farm on which a large amount of labour of different grades is employed is one which we ought to go out of our way to encourage rather than go out of our way to discourage.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to introduce what might look like a sectarian argument into this matter.  I do not believe that the Government are actuated by sectarian motives in making this discrimination. At the same time, as a representative of the religious minority, it is my duty to point out that this discrimination against farmers of £200 valuation and upwards, as such, is, in effect, though not in intention, a discrimination against non-Catholic farmers.  When I use the term &ldquo;non-Catholic,&rdquo; I am following the language of the official statistics but, at the same time, I wish to say, on behalf of the form of Christian denomination to which I myself belong, that every denomination claiming to be Christian must also claim to be Catholic in some sense or other and, consequently, Protestants will not admit a monopoly of the term &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; to any section of the Christian Church.  Strictly speaking, we should speak of &ldquo;Roman Catholics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Protestant Catholics&rdquo; but, if I were to speak about &ldquo;Protestant Catholics,&rdquo; I would almost certainly be misunderstood&mdash;at all events, in the Northern part of the country.</P>

      <P>I had the curiosity to look up the statistics contained in the Census of 1936&mdash;column 3, Part I., page 140, where it gives &ldquo;non-Catholic farmers as a percentage of the total farmers in each category&rdquo; of the different sizes of holding.  The categories are set out as: one to five acres, five to ten acres, ten to 15 acres, and so on up to 200 acres and over.  It is interesting, from the historical point of view, to observe the steady increase in the percentage of farms owned by non-Catholics as you go from the smaller size of holding up to the higher size of holding. Taking the sizes in ascending order, on the holdings of one to five acres 1.9 per cent. of the holders are non-Catholics; five to ten acres, 2.9 per cent.; ten to 15 acres, 3.4 per cent.; 15 to 30 acres, 4.9 per cent.; 30 to 50 acres, 6.9 per cent.; 50 to 100 acres, 9.6 per cent.; 100 to 200 acres, 14.7 per cent.; over 200 acres, 26.7 per cent. In other words, whereas the proportion of non-Catholic farmers is 6.9 per cent. of the 370,000 odd holders, of the owners of 200 acres or over, 26.1 per cent. are non-Catholics.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with the historical explanation. I am concerned only with the fact, and the fact is that in the category of farmers with which I am dealing, numbering about 3,000, probably 700 are my co-religionists.  Though I do not think you were influenced by any sectarian motive in making this discrimination, other people are capable of attributing your action to causes which are not true.  I draw the attention of the Government to this matter because I think that the Government, so far <Col N="2457" /> from having any desire for sectarian discrimination, will probably, by the mere fact of my mentioning that their action could be interpreted in that way, be induced to go out of their way to remedy it.  In my experience of Government Departments, I have found that they have been fair, and more than fair, to the Protestant minority. That is all I wish to contribute to the debate, and I should be delighted to know that the Government would reconsider their attitude and extend to all categories of farmers the valuable concession they have made to farmers of under £200 valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>My name is down to second this motion, and I should like to justify my action in appending my name to it in a few words.  I have heard so much from the other side of the House that whatever light can be thrown on the subject should be welcomed. Candidly speaking as an agriculturist, I feel that the fact that the Government find it necessary to give loans now, after 20 years of native administration, is a disgrace to the elected representatives of the people of Ireland.  We own a very fertile soil which has, in the past, supported more millions than it now supports, and the one outstanding reason for the need for loans now is the incompetence of the administration elected to rule Ireland. If a competent administration were elected, it would be found that the fertile soil could give a livelihood sufficient at least for any people who will be on it in the next 50 years, but the truth is that to be a successful agriculturist means that there is no place for <Col N="2459" /> your views in the administration of the land.  Prejudice is spread by every racketeer who can, and the successful agriculturist is everywhere outvoted and outbalanced.  The Government prevents, curbs, thwarts and limits the natural ambition of any Irish father of a family to see that there is left behind him greater means whereby his family may live a Christian life in the business to which he has devoted his life and the existence of a scheme limiting any farmer is bound to warrant anybody in refraining from putting more capital at the disposal of his family in the future.</P>
      <P>It is a rather academic point whether this scheme comes down to the £100, £400, £1,000, or the £50 valuation.  In its practical shape, it will not alter the situation very much.  The reason I am anxious to see that limitation removed is in order that it may not be held up to me as the idea at the back of the minds of the Government that it is an immoral thing to own land over a valuation of any set figure.  It is within the province of our administration to see to it that whatever land is held, owned or occupied is efficiently worked in the best interests of the nation.  There should be no bar or impediment in the way of anyone who is desirous of putting his whole life's resources into whatever he believes to be best in the interests of his family. It should be within the province and power of the Government to see to it that no man stops the march of the nation, economically, politically or otherwise, but economically first.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that I have put my name to this motion&mdash;so that anyone will be free to own 1,000 acres if he is making the best use of it; if he is not, take it off him.  The Government, by lending itself in any way to the idea of withholding financial support from me or anyone else who may desire to produce more, to give more employment or to make the farm better, is going on completely wrong lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather struck by some of the things which have been said here. Mechanised farming is considered undesirable. In the old days our various <Col N="2460" /> towns bought 60,000 or 70,000 barrels of oats around the country, and Senators perhaps would have come up here riding a horse, doing away with the trains and doing away with the motor cars.  If you did away with petrol to-day, that might still happen.  Senator Quirke and myself have kept it up, and will keep it up, please God.  As regards horses, I was surprised in regard to the scheme for the breeding of horses, farm horses in particular; it is bad enough in the case of racehorses. I was down in Kildare recently, and a friend said to me: &ldquo;My horse has died.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I have several; none of them has died, unfortunately.&rdquo;  I do think that Senator Quirke is right.  If the Government Party were to do away with all petrol and all imports of petrol, I would subscribe £50 to their organisation straight away, and I would do away with the mechanism which I for one find very useful.  I have as extensive a farm as my means will allow, and strange to relate, I find that the more machinery I bring on to the farm, the more employment it pays me to give.</P>

I repeat that the more machinery that comes on to the farm, the more employment you can give.  I do think there are too many theoretical racketeers getting up and telling us all kinds of stories.  The aids which have been given to agriculture over a lengthy period are of no more avail than if you put a bag over a broken pane of glass in a window to keep out the draught.  The big broad question has been left untouched.  We have a commission which is going to work on the &ldquo;Cathleen Mavourneen system&rdquo;&mdash; it may be for years and it may be for ever.</P>

      <P>Thanks be to God.  In my young days Irish was not as <Col N="2461" /> fashionable as it is now, but I think some people have stated in Irish that the farmers are poor because they do not work hard enough, or because they do not know how to work.  I say that the farmers are poor because there are too many racketeers in control everywhere. There are too many people who get up and talk Irish, in order to get jobs for their families, but if you are an extensive farmer you will not be allowed to live.  There are no more &ldquo;bowsies&rdquo; amongst the farmers than there are amongst any other class. They have not passed as many examinations as other classes, and hence they are equipped for their work.  Every day in the week we hear of some new aid to agriculture, but there is no main aid.  The big issue is left untouched. The big problems are left unsolved. That should not be the position of affairs if you want agriculture to thrive and prosper.  Some people may have got 200 or 300 acres from Cromwell or Tom the Devil or someone else, but a lot of them have got it through the hard work they were doing while others who have learned to get an easy job under this Government or under the late Government or under the British Government shirked living on the land, shirked devoting their resources or their energies and ideas to it.  Is it not the object of the ten-acre farmer to become a 50-acre farmer, and if he has 50 acres is it not his object to go still further ahead?  Is it not amongst people like those that the greatest and most successful farmers are to be found?  Limerick has been mentioned here.  Perhaps if the farmers of Limerick were as well paid as the inspectors in the Dublin Cattle Market on Thursday morning, their work would be just as efficiently done.</P>

I am sorry to find it necessary to-day, 20 years after two political Parties have tried <Col N="2462" /> their hand, to support a motion for loans to farmers.  I really think that the Minister should seek advice from different advisers now; that he should free the land of Ireland from the taxes that are on it, and see to it that the people who own the land of Ireland are devoting their resources to it.</P>

      <P>There is just one point which I should like to make; I do not want to go into detail in regard to this motion.  I understand that what is involved here is not a loan but a grant to improve farms over £200 valuation. A farm of £200 valuation in the west of Ireland is rather a big thing.  When we hear of a farm of £200 valuation we begin to wonder when that holding is going to be taken over for division.  It is in relation to that matter that I wish to address one question to the Minister.  If the Government proposes to accede to the request contained in this Motion, and give a grant to farmers of over £200 valuation, I think that an exception should be made in the case of holdings which, but for the war, would have been taken over for division, or that some arrangement should be made that if a grant is given to a farmer and later his farm is taken over for distribution among the congests the amount of the grant should be taken into consideration.  Otherwise the Government will be buying back land that it has helped to improve by the grant and would eventually be paying on the double.  That is just the point.</P>

      <P>I thought we were going to deal with a very simple proposition in this debate. I came along prepared for a very short and sharp debate, if you like, but it developed into rather a long discourse on many things.  Senator Counihan started off by saying that if this help had been offered to farmers some years ago they would have rejected it with scorn.  I think he starts on a bad note.  I have known the farmers for at least 40 years, and I never knew them to reject anything that was offered to them, and I do not think anybody else did either.  I do <Col N="2463" /> not care whether they were big or small farmers, if they were ever offered help &mdash;genuine help and help to which they were entitled&mdash;I do not think they rejected it with scorn.  I suppose they are not going to reject it now because, as some of the speakers said here, it was not to be regarded as charity; it was given in a genuine attempt to improve the land and, therefore, the farmers were entitled to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true what Senator Counihan says that farmers are paying the greater part of all these subsidies and grants.  I am not quite sure of the figure.  I do not know whether they are paying the greater part, but I do know they are paying their share and, being a large part of the community, they are paying quite a lot of all these grants, subsidies and so on.  That is what, I must say, makes me very reluctant at times to go into those grants or subsidies and so on.  As a matter of fact, I think I have stated both here and in the Dáil and in public on many occasions that if, for instance, derating was granted the small farmer would actually pay more than he would gain by it.  I am surprised that Senator Counihan would not try to bring that fact home to his own party, because it is true that, in that particular instance anyway, the small farmer would lose rather than gain.  Senator Counihan, Senator Madden and other Senators said that what the farmer really wants is capital, and I think that they all said that what they wanted was that capital by way of loan.  Supposing you had a banker listening to this debate; supposing you had a banker who listened to Senator Counihan's speech and Senator Madden's speech, I think he would be mad if he gave a loan to any farmer in this country.  Is it not quite obvious that what is preventing bankers from giving loans to farmers in this country is the sort of speech that Senator Counihan and Senator Madden make?  How could you expect any man with money &mdash;Senator Quirke or anybody else&mdash;to give a loan to a farmer if he believed one single word of what Senator Counihan or Senator Madden said? According to them, the farmer is in <Col N="2464" /> such a hopeless state that he could not pay anything or never will be able to pay anything.  I think that sort of talk is going to do a lot of harm.  I admit that Senator Madden, Senator Counihan and Senator McGee may hope to do some harm to the Government by that sort of talk, but if, incidentally, they are going to do harm to the country as well, I think they should not do it.  It is all right to hit the Government, but not if it is going to do harm to the country, too.  They should be careful in making speeches like that, directed against the Government, that they are not doing the country harm at the same time.  The implication of Senator Counihan's speech&mdash;and also of Senator Madden's speech&mdash;is that if they had the capital by way of loan they could make farming pay.  I presume the Senators are honest enough to advocate loans being given to farmers knowing that the farmers will pay those loans back. Otherwise they would not be loans.  I may take it for granted that when Senator Counihan talks like that he means that if a farmer gets a loan at the present time he will pay it back?</P>

      <P>That means that any farmer who does not want a loan is all right.  The big majority of farmers in this country, it is proved by figures, have money in the bank.  Some farmers want money, I admit.  Many farmers do not want a loan.  They are able to carry on.  Are we to infer from what Senator Counihan says that he believes that the big majority of farmers are all right, that they can carry on and live well because they have no grant to pay back?  If we have got that far, we have got something, at any rate, out of Senator Counihan.  Senator Counihan, I think, did not make very much point about the £200 limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Madden went on to speak about other matters.  He said there was a reduction of 42,000 cattle in the County of Limerick, that figures were produced by the warble fly inspectors which showed this.  I am not sure if the warble fly inspectors gave the figures both in 1939 and 1940.  It is <Col N="2465" /> possible they were comparing figures returned by the warble fly inspectors&mdash; which, according to Senator Madden, are correct because they went to every farm, which is a very good way of getting figures&mdash;with figures that were returned by the Civic Guards in 1939. I have always thought about those figures&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Madden would agree with me or not&mdash;that they are not altogether accurate.  I remember when I was young on many occasions being the only person at home when the policeman at that time called to get the figures and they were not very particular about details.  But what is held is that they are just as accurate one year as another, and for comparison they are all right.  Probably there is an error in them.  They are probably largely exaggerated.  People are inclined to say they have a few cattle more than they have, a few sheep more, a few pigs more and so on all round, but that exaggeration evidently runs through the figures every year. When the warble fly inspector goes in he will not get an exaggerated figure because he has to see the number of cattle to be treated and, naturally, the farmer will not say he has more than he really has because the inspector will have to see them.  Therefore he gets true figures.  I do not know if the number has gone down or could be proved to have gone down.</P>
    <P>With regard to this reduction of milk in creameries, I have met representatives of the creamery industry.  I know the production this year is less than last year.  They have told me that in their opinion there are two causes: firstly, less cows, and secondly, less yield from each cow on account of the dry season.  That is probably true. I had a deputation lately from the suppliers of milk to the City of Dublin, who wanted a better price for their milk.  I asked them on what basis they were looking for a better price.  They said they were getting from 25 to 33? per cent. less from the cows this year than last year.  That is evidently the truth.  I think they were not exaggerating, to any great extent any way. They were getting less yield this year than last year.  Is it not quite likely <Col N="2466" /> that the suppliers to creameries were getting a lower yield also?  Therefore, the greater part of this reduction at any rate is due to the dry season, over which the Government had no control.</P>
    <P>I said in the Dáil that the farmers are badly off, but not any worse than they were for the last 40 years&mdash; because I remember farmers for that length&mdash;except perhaps during the last war when they were well off for a certain period.  The statement that farmers are badly off or well off is purely comparative.  We would all like to see them better off.  Senator O'Dwyer supported the motion, because he said it would give more employment on the larger farms than on the smaller farms.  That may be true with regard to hired employment, but supposing there is work to be done on a drain, obviously the amount of employment would be the same, with this exception, that on the small farm it is more likely to be done by the members of the farmer's family.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke has drawn the attention of the Seanad to this point, that it was more in the nature of a farm improvement scheme than a labour creating scheme.  It was brought forward by my Department primarily as a farm improvement scheme, but probably it got the support of other Ministers because at the same time it would create a certain amount of employment. You really have the two elements in it.  We must regard it in the first instance as a farm improvement scheme and, incidentally, it gives employment.  Senator Quirke is also right in this, that there is a limit to the amount of money that we can spend on this scheme in this financial year. We may be able to afford more next year, but there is a certain limit this year.  If there is to be a preference given, and I am afraid there must be, because the applications coming in are numerous, I cannot think at the present moment of any fairer preference than the size of the holding.  I have not thought a lot about that matter yet, because it was only in the last few days that I learned of the many applications.  We may have to turn some down for want of money in <Col N="2467" /> this financial year.  I have not thought of any alternative system of preference and, for the moment, the size of the holding seems to be the fairest.</P>
    <P>The number of people maintained on the smaller holdings is higher, per 100 acres, than on the larger holdings and, if we get a permanent improvement on the smaller holdings through this farm improvement scheme, it will confer a greater benefit than in the case of the larger holdings.  I am making a distinction between the number of people maintained and the number employed on the different farms.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald made a remark which, at the time, I felt I would like to comment upon, but on second thoughts I see there is no use in doing so.  It had reference to the slaughtering of calves and the economic war.  I have explained that matter over and over again.  The only thing I do admire about Senator Fitzgerald is his courage and cheek to talk about the economic war at all, or any of his associates, for that matter, because I think they should be ashamed of their part at that particular time.  It should be remembered that in all these schemes there is always a certain privilege for the smaller man as against the bigger man, and we are not departing from the general principle in this particular scheme.  As was pointed out, in the case of university scholarships there is a limited valuation.  In our scheme for an agricultural grant, which amounts to partial derating, the first £20 gets a greater benefit than the remainder of the holding, which means that the smaller holding gets a much greater benefit than the bigger holding.  That applies in a great many cases, and I do not see that we are departing from the principle running through all these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnston said he approved of the scheme but not of the particular limit of £200 poor law valuation. The Senator made a plea for the larger farm.  He said he thought <Col N="2468" /> the country would benefit by more well-managed large farms and could do without badly managed 20-acre farms. That might be true if you are looking at it from the purely economic point of view.  Equally a speaker could say that the country would be better off without the large badly-managed farms and could do with more of the smaller well-managed farms.  What we really want is this, that we should take the land from the bad farmers and give it to good farmers, if we could manage that.  That is what the Land Commission is trying to do.</P>

      <P>They are doing their best to bring about that result.  Senator Johnston also made this point, that on a big farm employing 20 men you can employ a greater variety of men; in other words, he does not want all men who can plough and look after stock, like the smaller farmer.  I suppose that is true.  He also said that the larger farmer would employ more female labour than the smaller farmer.  That is not true, in my opinion.</P>

When that rule was made the thought did not occur to me or to any member of my Department that we were in any way making a difference between the religions.  As a matter of fact, I can tell Senator Johnston&mdash;and if he likes to verify it he can, but I am sure he will not bother&mdash;that the principal official who put this recommendation to me is a non-Catholic.  I am sure it did not strike him that he was in any way doing an injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Senator McGee.  He said I knew something about his farm.  I was down there, and on that occasion Senator McGee told me that he was taking land from the farmers all around, was giving them £5 an acre for it, and was making a profit out of it.  If he can take land from other farmers at £5 an acre and make a profit, how can he talk in the way he does about the farmers?  How can he talk the way he does about the impossibility of any farmer making farming pay?  He does not claim that he is a super farmer, or that he is better than other people, but he does claim that it was impossible for farmers to make their farms pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGee said that the fact that any farmer was looking for a loan at present was a disgrace to a native <Col N="2470" /> Government after 20 years.  I do not know.  I started life as a doctor and looked for a loan, and I never said it was a disgrace to any native Government that I should have to look for a loan.  There are shopkeepers looking for loans; there are members of every single class in this country looking for loans, and perhaps getting them, but it has never struck any shopkeeper, professor or civil servant, I am sure, that it is a disgrace to a native Government that he should have to look for a loan.  These people always thought that they were very lucky when they got these loans.  Denmark is often held up to us as a model we should follow &mdash;I hope we shall not follow them now &mdash;or that we should have followed in the past.  The latest figures I saw&mdash; it is some years ago I admit&mdash;showed that the Danish farmers owed almost one hundred million pounds to banks, so that in that very well-managed country the farmers thought it good business to owe much more than we do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Might it not be good business for us, too, if we owed more money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I think myself, but that would not follow from Senator McGee's argument, in which he said it was a disgrace that they owed so much.  We had the usual complaint about too many inspectors.  I have, I must say, on many occasions, discussed this matter with officers in my Department.  I have tried to see if we could lessen the number of inspectors by perhaps combining certain duties that are at present administered by different classes of inspectors so that one inspector might do the work of two.  It is very difficult to do it, but if any Senator here thinks that he can make a good suggestion with regard to reducing the number of inspectors we have, I am quite prepared to consider it.  I am afraid that people have got into the habit of merely saying that there are too many inspectors without looking at the matter from the constructive side or without making any suggestion as to what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion of Senator Hawkins that the Land Commission should take into consideration <Col N="2471" /> the amount of any grant given to the owner of the land when acquiring it, I do not think that could be done.  If a man gets a grant under this scheme and improves his land, we shall have to admit that the value of the land has been improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the man would probably have spent some of his own money also in that improvement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would.  As to the scheme itself, when it came up to me for consideration, I must say that I was inclined to fix the limit somewhat lower because I knew we had only a certain amount of money to spend this year, namely, a quarter of a million. I thought that the applications would be rather numerous and that we would probably spend that quarter of a million without very much trouble if we invited applications only from those under £100 valuation.  I did eventually agree to the proposition put up by the officers of the Department to fix the limit at £200 valuation.  We had to make some limit because we know there are certain individuals in this country who own a great amount of land&mdash;in fact, too much land, more land than is necessary to enable one person to make a livelihood.  That is the point we have to keep in mind.  It is not so much that the person with a valuation of over £200 can spend £1,000 or that he would spend £1,000 if he got it.  We had to look at it from the point of view of the fact that we had a certain amount of money and we had to see how far it would go.  We know that there are individuals in this country, whatever the other side of the House may think, with 30 or 50 acres of land each who are working their farms well and who are fairly comfortable.  They might be made somewhat more comfortable if they had the money to improve a few acres of their farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too costly at the present time for such people to reclaim an acre or two because it costs more to reclaim land than would be represented by its market value.  We thought that if we could help these people who are living <Col N="2472" /> on these smaller holdings and working them well, to reclaim a few more acres we would make them more comfortable and more independent.  There must be some limit, some <i>optimum</i>, if you like, to the size of a farm, and I do not say that it should be £200 poor law valuation. I think it should be something lower and that, if we give some help to the farmer who has not more land than is sufficient to make a decent living out of agriculture, we have gone far enough.  If any man has more than is sufficient to make a decent living, I think he should not expect a State grant.</P>
    <P>I am not wedded to the figure of £200 at all, but I say that for this particular year we probably will not reach it because, as far as I can see at present, we are going to have more applications than we can deal with.  We shall have to give preference to some of the applicants.  It might be unfair to say that we shall give a preference to those who require the smallest amount of money.  It might be unfair also to say that we shall give every man £20 or £30, because that might have the effect of destroying a scheme which a farmer wanted to carry out. It may be in the end necessary to give a preference based on poor law valuation; I am not sure, but if we take the poor law valuation as the basis on which we shall deal with applications, I am afraid we are not going to reach any figure higher than £100 valuation and it may be less.  I think for this year, anyway, having regard to the fact that we have only £250,000 to spend, the motion is really a matter of academic interest.  I do not think it would be practical politics to extend the scheme beyond the £200 valuation. If, on the other hand, I had found before coming here that the number of applications would not probably absorb the amount of money we had in hands, I would not have had any hesitation in saying to the Seanad that I was quite prepared to reconsider the whole matter because I thought that we would have enough money to deal with every applicant.  That is the position. As I say, I am not wedded to this particular figure but, in practice, for this year we probably shall not even reach <Col N="2473" /> the £200 poor law valuation.  As far as I am concerned, I shall try to get more money next year for this scheme.  If we get more money next year we should be able to set a new limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not concede even the request I made to include everybody in the scheme, no matter for what amount.  If we could say that we would give everybody the proportion of this grant to which they would be entitled if the valuation did not exceed £200, there would not be any unfair discrimination and there could be some justification for that policy.  The Minister, however, seems to be adamant on that point.  I wish to deny one statement which the Minister made.  He said that the statements of the mover of the motion and the supporters of it, seemed to be directed towards injuring the Government rather than helping the farmers.  In my speech on the motion, I did not even refer to the economic war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I did not want to raise a discussion on a controversial subject.  I could have told the Minister a few facts about the position of the farmers.  I could have pointed out, if I wanted, that in 1931 before the Minister took up office, the export value of our cattle was £14,000,000 and that in 1936 it was reduced to £5,000,000.  I could go on and repeat a litany of these things, showing why the farmers are in their present condition.  I did not want, as I say, to raise the question of the economic war or any controversial subject which might injure the Government. After taking all these precautions it is rather hard to be accused of making a statement which was meant to injure the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further by referring to statements made by several Senators, which I think were very foolish, and not at all to the point.  I ask the Minister, in consultation with his officials, to consider the question of cutting out this business of discriminating between farmers.  Whatever he is going to give, I ask him to consider the farmer with the big valuation. <Col N="2474" /> For the sake of increasing production that is as essential as giving it to the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider another point.  At the present time we have a great opportunity for increasing production.  Good prices are being received at present, and I think will continue to be received.  I do not want to prophesy, but if we are to judge from what happened after the last war, we are going to get good prices for all the agricultural produce we can produce for some years after the war.  It is up to the Minister, as the responsible head of the Department which represents the industry, to consider the whole question and see whether something cannot be done to put us in a position to take advantage of these markets and prices for a number of years to come.  I do not intend to put the motion to a division. I am sure the motion would be carried, but I do not want to embarrass the Government.</P>

      <P>There is a point there, and I wonder if Senators realise it. Supposing it was something we were giving by way of grant which we could cut by 20 per cent., it would be all right.  But, if a farmer puts up a scheme to cost £50, we cannot cut that, because he could not go on with the scheme at all.  You cannot do half the drainage this year; you must complete the drain when you are at it.  I cannot see how that could be done.</P>

      <P>That while recognising that the possession of compulsory powers in relation to tillage is essential to the Government in the present emergency, Seanad Eireann is of opinion that guaranteed minimum prices should accompany the exercise of these powers.</P>
      <P>In consideration for those people who have not been able to have their tea, and I hope the Minister is not one of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is rather discomforting. I have not much sympathy with the others, because they have had their opportunity.  The motion raises the question of the Compulsory Tillage Order and also the question of accompanying this Order with guaranteed minimum prices.  I might say that when this question was debated last October, what I might say to-night was said by me then.  As far as possible, I will not repeat the arguments I used on that occasion, but I will say that every argument I made then has been justified by the course of events.  Perhaps I ought to say that I put this <Col N="2476" /> motion down with a certain amount of hesitancy, but I am one of those who feel that if our democratic institutions are to continue to function and to have the breath of life they ought to be utilised for the purpose of discussion and as a vehicle for conveying to the Ministry what is in the minds of the people down the country.  There is a censorship and there is, apparently, a political truce.  In all the circumstances one must do one's best to recognise the good behaviour of our betters.  But it is not so easy to get all the people down the country to conform to that policy, particularly if people feel that they have a grievance that they want redressed.  I therefore put down this motion because I feel that, from the point of view of farming to-day and in the future, justice is not being done.</P>
      <P>I am not arguing, nor did I argue 12 months ago, that the Ministry should not have compulsory powers with regard to tillage.  I feel that, when you are facing a situation in which the Government may have to call men out, so to speak, to give their lives in defence of the country and the liberties of the people, to compel a man to till his field and to produce food for those people when they are fighting&mdash;if that should come upon us&mdash;is not the greatest sacrifice that a man may be called upon to make.  May I add this: that the uncertainty under which tillage operations are being carried on has created a situation for a great many people, created so many problems for them which they are unable to overcome, that, perhaps, for some of them it would be just as easy to leave this life altogether.  Some of us know that there are times when your difficulties are so immense and so terrifying that perhaps even death would be preferable. When we are looking, perhaps, to a rather disturbed and somewhat obscured future, I think we must try to shape our policy and make our plans after such a fashion as will give the maximum stability and encouragement to our people to continue their work, particularly their toil in the fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a rather confused situation at the moment, and we are not quite clear what the law is and what the Minister's powers are, because certain <Col N="2477" /> legal difficulties have been raised.  I am asking that when the Minister comes to operate those powers again, as I presume he must, he will go so far as saying to the farmer when he commands him to till, that when the farmer produces his crop in its final form he will guarantee him a minimum price for the crop which he produces. If we were living in normal times and normal trading operations were possible and Government interference of the kind which we are experiencing in every country to-day was much less in evidence, I do not know that I would be pressing this point of view on the Minister.  But, when the Minister takes the responsibility of sending his inspector to any farmer, and giving a command, which must be obeyed under a heavy penalty, that a certain area of his land must be tilled, I think it is only justice to ask of the Minister that he will ensure that when a man produces a crop it will be possible for that man to sell his produce at a figure that will at least pay him for the cost of production.</P>
    <P>May I say here that the Minister's policy, like the policy of his predecessor, has been a policy, not to produce in this country food for the people of this country alone: our whole plan has been to use our land and work it, taking cognisance of the fact that a huge industrial population lives just across the water from us, and that a considerable quantity of our food was to be marketed there?  That was the policy of the Minister's predecessor, and clearly, it is his policy to-day. Otherwise, as things are, were we only concerned about producing enough food for our own people, all of us could come into the Province of Leinster&mdash;we could take our people from the hills of Donegal and Kerry and from the plains of Connemara, and even from Ulster, and there would be enough land in Leinster to give us beet for our sugar, wheat for our flour, and all the other cereals and root crops necessary for our own consumption and to feed animals for our own use.  Now, none of us are going to advocate the desertion of either the bogs and plains of Connaught or the hills of Donegal, <Col N="2478" /> but that point must be taken cognisance of by the Minister when he is actually compelling the farmers of this country&mdash;and I am not opposing him &mdash;to produce much more food than is requisite for our own needs here.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do with it? Our farmers, when they produce it, are going to market some of it in the country, and a very considerable quantity of it out of the country.  In other words, the produce of our fields is going to be exchanged for other goods in another country which we cannot produce for ourselves.  So that our farmers are actually being used to get produce from their land which we can exchange for coal, steel, tea, and things like that which we require, and which the land of this country cannot give us.  When you are facing a situation like that I think the Minister must make up his mind that agriculture in this country can no longer be the shuttlecock of either political or economic theories that do it a great injustice.</P>
    <P>We have to-day, I believe, considerable quantities of grain which, at the moment, cannot be marketed.  There are some people who believe that some of this grain ought to be exported out of the country, and that a market is beyond our doors for these cereals which, apparently, we are not able to consume at the moment.  The Minister has certain information, I am sure, which I have not got.  Perhaps, if I had enough time and had a staff at my disposal, I could get the information and make the necessary calculations, but the Minister, with the information he has, should be able to make calculations to see how far the products of our own fields this year will make adequate provision to supply the needs of our stock requirements under circumstances when we may not be able to have the imports which we were accustomed to use in the past.  He may be able to tell us that, with all the oats, barley and root crops that we have in the country, we may not have enough to carry our own stock through the winter, spring and summer, until another harvest comes.  I should like to hear the Minister's information on that point, because I think it is of vital <Col N="2479" /> importance to us to-day.  No one knows for certain, no one can prophesy what amount of grain we may be able to import into the country during the winter, spring and summer, until the coming harvest.  Clearly, if we are going to keep our live-stock population I think the Minister is quite right to ensure, in so far as he can, that if we have food for them here we will not send food away only to find our own live stock either having to be killed off, or go hungry for this food later on.</P>
    <P>What I want to urge on the Minister is this.  We have reached a stage now with regard to our agricultural policy and with regard to the farming position when we must give our farmers some protection and some security&mdash;security which they have not to-day and which they have not been given in the past. I cannot understand the equity of the Minister's command, which I must obey, that I must go into my fields and produce a crop which, when I put it on the market, the market will not receive and for which the market will not give me cash.  On the other hand, all the charges and demands on me are fixed charges.  My rent is a fixed charge, my rates are a fixed charge, and my labour costs are fixed and the Minister fixes them when he indicates the amount of land that I will have to till. The prices of fertilisers, of machines&mdash; all these charges are fixed, but the one thing that is not fixed is the price that I am to receive for the produce of the labour I have put into the work of extracting a crop from the fields.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister himself would argue that that is equitable.  I would prefer if the Minister would frankly admit that it is not a fair position for our Ministers to occupy.  I think I put it forward before, and I repeat it now, that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce went in to an industrialist in the city here or in one of our towns in the country and commanded him to produce a certain commodity, where all his charges were fixed, and when the commodity was produced it had to go upon the market and take the chance of the market, whether the price was high or low, and <Col N="2480" /> regardless of the consequences to the industrialist, there would be an uproar from all the industrialists in the country and they would be down on the Minister's head.  I wonder how long the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be able to pursue a policy like that?</P>
    <P>The farmer in this country has been accustomed always to a great deal of rough treatment, and he has always accepted it.  My view is that he is in a rather disturbed frame of mind at the moment.  The future is uncertain, and I believe that the obligation is on the Government and on us all to get the maximum production out of the land and to see that we will have crops, so to speak, for the humans and for all the beasts we have got.  I should like to see our land so used and an agricultural policy enunciated by the Minister that would ensure the increased fertility of our soil and its being so worked that we could increase the number of people who could live on it and the number of live stock as well. But as things are, and I feel that the Minister realises it, the insecurity which the farmer has been experiencing has been very depressing for him. My view is that we should have a guaranteed minimum price.  I know, of course, that people will say: How is that going to be done?  They will say that perhaps you can guarantee prices with regard to commodities that are consumed in the country, but what about the commodities that are being exported?  I confess that I have advanced the argument myself that it is not a justifiable policy for us to subsidise exports that are going to be used in Britain, whereby the Briton is going to get cheap food, but I have re-examined that point of view and my opinion is that England either wants food from us or she does not.  She has purchased considerable quantities of food from us in the past.  In my judgment, she got good value for her money, and she bought our goods, not for love of us, but because she got as good value as she could get anywhere else in the world.</P>
    <P>If there were real statesmanship in England, particularly now when there is so much talk of the war spreading <Col N="2481" /> further afield and with the submarine menace growing more threatening every day, one would imagine that the 12,000,000 arable acres here would be a tremendous asset from their point of view in supplying them with the needs of the people in England.  In circumstances like these, and realising that our agricultural policy has always been managed out of consideration for the fact that a considerable quantity of our products was being sold in England, that policy has either to continue or to be altered.  If Britain is not going to buy from us in the future, as she has bought in the past, the sooner we know that the better, and let all of us try to readjust our point of view to that situation and let all of us recognise that that has to be faced and adjust our production accordingly.</P>
    <P>Someone referred to the killing of calves, when we were faced with a situation in which we would have to reduce the number of our live stock as other methods of export were not available. It would be the same with pigs and other commodities.  If we could not export them profitably we might, conceivably, have to adopt a policy of self-sufficiency that none of us would like, but if forced upon us we would have to face up to it.  We had to make heroic efforts here before.  There was no alternative then, and we had just to tighten our belts.  The Minister referred to Denmark, Holland and other countries which had to yield up their live stock and the produce of their fields, at any rate, for the time being.  It is not my view that England does not want food.  My view is that we should know whether England wants it or not, and whether she wants the maximum quantity that we could produce, but we should know what price we were going to get for it.  It is only fair that we should know that, whether it is for dairying, pig production, fat cattle, poultry or eggs.  It is not justifiable that we should be compelled by Government policy to get into that type of production without any security or market when it comes along.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been through the pig markets during the past few weeks and who have been in conversation with people there and know what <Col N="2482" /> they are going through, realise that the markets could not absorb the pigs offered for sale.  We can appreciate what effect a situation like that has on production.  The Minister in his own constituency expressed the view that we might have to reduce production. That is a point of view I regretted he had to give expression to, and I was prepared to question the wisdom of it. He may have reasons for having said that that were not obvious to others.  It is not a policy I would like to embark upon unless compelled to do so.  A stage has been reached here when the obligation is on the Minister for Agriculture and on the Government to give farmers a fair deal.  I am convinced that the only way to do that is to see how far the agricultural policy they have to pursue has to be regulated in accordance with the demands for our food in Britain.</P>
    <P>There are many things we want to know.  We want to know whether England is prepared to take all the pigs, poultry or eggs we can produce.  Apparently there is no problem concerning fat cattle.  Coming to apply the present position to conditions here, and examining the effect upon farming life, I think we would be satisfied if we could go on with the job of production, as then we would have solved the greater portion of our problem.  There is nothing so discouraging as the constant ups and downs farmers have been experiencing, being able to sell to-day and having no market the next day. I realise that in a time of emergency we have to take the rough with the smooth.  I feel that the Minister will say: &ldquo;Let us get these guarantees from Britain.  What about the question of prices?  Are we to be put in the position of having to subsidise exports to Britain?&rdquo;  Let us examine that.  If farmers here are exporting commodities to Great Britain, either cattle, bacon pigs, dairy produce or poultry, we have to take the prices given there. As has been the case now and again, these may not be paying prices for the individual farmer.  If, in the Minister's judgement, farmers must continue in production, my view is that the only just method by which you can keep up that production is by ensuring that individual <Col N="2483" /> farmers will not be sacrificed in their efforts to produce for export. That is the position farmers occupy to-day. There is a surplus which has to be exported.  Farmers have to take the risk.  But that surplus production is there, to a certain extent, because of legislation which the Minister has imposed.</P>
    <P>My view is that Government policy with regard to farmers in future should be steady, should be well considered, and not changed over-night.  I believe we should have guaranteed prices for the finished products that we have on the land.  I know that people will ask: &ldquo;How are you going to guarantee prices for barley, oats, potatoes and other commodities?&rdquo;  I do not think that would be the way to do it.  It would be much more effective to give guaranteed prices for the finished products that were fed on these crops. The man who digs ore has to be paid, and to a certain extent a man's field that grows grain is producing raw material for the man who turns out the finished goods for the breakfast table. That is what we want to specialise in. In my opinion we should guarantee the price of beef.  We should subsidise the price of fat cattle here, and we should also guarantee prices for bacon pigs, over a period as long as 12 months.</P>
    <P>The experience of many farmers at fairs is nothing short of tragic.  For some six weeks men who had pigs to sell lost on their production.  One day a man would lose, and the next day, when his neighbour went to the market, because a change was made, he made a profit.  Nothing is more discouraging to farmers than such an experience.  That should be avoided. There is no justification for such ups and downs in prices.  If we are compelled to produce goods the onus is on the Minister to see that farmers get a fair chance.  If Senator Quirke had produce for sale to-day and lost money, and if I had similar produce out to-morrow and made a profit, such a happening should be avoided.  We should have a guaranteed price for dairy produce so as to keep our dairy people in production.  I heard the Minister's remarks on the situation as <Col N="2484" /> it affects dairy products.  I believe that we will be short of dairy products in this country before next summer.</P>
    <P>Certain reasons have been given by the Minister, which are the main reasons, but it is also a factor that has to be taken into account that in dairying&mdash;despite the Minister's efforts, and he has done quite a lot and is always appreciative of the difficulties of dairying&mdash;the dairy farmer does not feel that he can carry on his industry by getting 5½d. or, at the most, 6d. a gallon for milk to produce butter for people here or across the water.  Dairy farming has steadily declined.  Our supply of milk dropped very considerably last year from two causes.  Now, to-day, you have a situation when it is far better and more profitable for dairy farmers to cash their cows, that are day after day being exported, than to keep them for production at home.  I suppose people may say they ought to be prevented from exporting their good dairy cows and destroying or breaking up their herds.  That sort of thing will be said by the individual who is poorly informed or who lives in a town and believes that the farmers' work should go on, no matter what happens, while he is producing rather cheap and very good food for him.  There is still some liberty left to the farmers and, to the extent that they have that liberty, they are using it sometimes not too wisely but as far as I can see the probabilities are that we are going to have a very considerable reduction in butter production next year.  If we go on like that, we will reach a stage when our total productivity will have fallen to a point when agriculture becomes increasingly difficult.</P>
    <P>When I talk about subsidising the production of beef may I point this out to the Minister?  It has been urged by Senator Counihan and others in the past.  The production of beef in this country is very essential from the point of view of sustaining and maintaining the fertility of our soil.  As far as we can judge from what the Minister for Supplies said some nights ago, we are going to be rather short of fertilisers this year.  The Minister knows, as others do, that the big <Col N="2485" /> mature cattle which we keep here at home to finish into beef are in a sense producers of the phosphatic manure which we require now and cannot import. To the extent to which we can encourage our people to fatten their stock here at home and utilise the grain, which some of them want to export and impoverish their own farms in so doing, we are going to do a great deal, not only to maintain our soil's fertility, but actually to increase it.  I believe that money spent like that will be very well spent, indeed.  It would use up quantities of grain which are not being used.  It would keep at home cattle that are going to England to be fattened.  Some of our people think that it is good to let the cattle go and to send the grain after them to be fed to them there and to let England, generally, benefit.  But it is unwise.  I think a negative policy on the part of the Minister does not meet the case, and would urge him to grant a subsidy for fat cattle in this country this winter.  That would be the best spent money that the Government would pass out.</P>
    <P>With regard to pigs, I am quite convinced from my own experience that the ups and downs we have experienced over a number of years are something that must be avoided in the future, if we are going to increase our pig production.  We ought to increase it and, at the same time, we should be able to reduce our costs of production by good farming methods to a point that would make it possible for consumers of bacon to get it at a lower price and to meet foreign competition in a way in which we have not been able to meet it in the past.  One essential is to keep farmers in production&mdash; in summer, winter, autumn and spring.</P>
    <P>With regard to dairy products, I am convinced that we could absorb a considerable quantity of the grain that to-day is not being fed to stock, if dairying were a better paying proposition. Quite a number of farmers have grain which they want to cash and which they could utilise to better advantage on their farms.  There are problems with regard to that&mdash;problems of credit and of liabilities that are crushing them owing to immediate <Col N="2486" /> demands which they are unable to meet.  These are impossible demands, as the cost of producing a crop this year&mdash;with wages and all the rest of it, seed in spring, and manures&mdash;is considerably more than it was the previous year.  All these demands are crushing our farmers to-day and, with the insecurity they have been experiencing, are discouraging factors from the point of view of getting an increased area under tillage in the future.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has recently been dealing with poultry and eggs.  It is pertinent to say here that, in considering the price of poultry produce in the country and the scarcity for home consumption, you have to go back several years, when people were unable to get a higher price than 8d. a dozen for eggs.  Presumably, now eggs cannot be got for 3/- a dozen, or perhaps even more.  That is the cumulative effect of an unsound attitude to our farming problems over a period of years.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience that I am not arguing a case before someone who is unsympathetic or who does not understand.  I am quite cognisant of the fact that the Minister is fully aware of the situation, but I am convinced that all farmers in the country should be at one in this matter.  We ought to have stability and security in so far as our State and Government can assure it. If we obey the demands of the Government and produce crops we ought to be guaranteed that, when these crops have been produced, they will be marketed at a price that will do more than cover the cost of production.  Above all, there must be a market for them.  I ought not be compelled to use my land in a way contrary to my own judgment. If I cease to keep store cattle and obey the Minister by ploughing my fields and producing other crops, then I should be guaranteed a market for them at a price that will pay.  The present position of our farmers is a very disturbing factor in our life in the country.  I believe that all farmers ought to be of one mind, and there ought to be an appreciation on the part of the community as a whole that agriculture being the biggest thing we <Col N="2487" /> have got, unless you can give stability to it and encouragement to the people engaged in it&mdash;not only to stay in it but to increase their efforts and exercise their intelligence and initiative&mdash;and give them the other means necessary to greater and more efficient production, the life of this State and its security, its stability and its strength in the future are all being threatened.</P>
    <P>Finally, I say that the Minister, in so far as he is responsible for imposing this policy on the country, which farmers generally feel they cannot reject, has a further responsibility, namely, to ensure that, if he compels us, farmers, to do certain things in the interest of the nation, the nation will be just to us, and not put us in the position of being the one section which must obey all commands, all behests and requirements of the Government, as representing the people, but is left <Col N="2488" /> as a Cinderella to take whatever chances there are out of the market. That is not a situation which is good for us, and if we are expected to do our duty to the full, the Minister should this year, accompanying the Compulsory Tillage Order, tell our farmers that he is going to guarantee to them a minimum price which is going to do something more than merely cover the cost of production.</P>
