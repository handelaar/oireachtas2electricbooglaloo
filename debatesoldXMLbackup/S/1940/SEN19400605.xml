      <P>In page 3, Section 4, sub-section (1), line 1, before the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;conveniently&rdquo;; and in line 2, before the word &ldquo;under&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;either simultaneously or successively,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The change that is proposed there is to introduce the words &ldquo;conveniently&rdquo; and &ldquo;either simultaneously or successively&rdquo; lest by any chance we might have some difficulty in doing it all forthwith.  It gives a little more latitude than there was in the original wording.</P>

      <P>These amendments are to meet the criticism that was made by Senator Tierney on the last occasion about the name.  As I pointed out on that occasion, there is a difference of opinion amongst experts as to whether the article should be before the first noun or whether it should be before the noun in the genitive case.  I have read a good deal of the various opinions that have been expressed on both sides.  The same question arose, I think, in connection with &ldquo;An tAire Oideachais&rdquo; and so on.  We asked particularly the people who were likely to be senior professors of the school and although their view is not the same as the view that was held, I think, by the translation staff in connection with the other question that arose, I do not think any harm has been done.  I must say that from the study of the examples that were given to me I have not been able independently to say which is the better form.  I do not profess to have any more knowledge of it than a person who would use ordinary commonsense and logic.  From the examples, I would not like to say that I was certain that there is more argument in favour of this form than the other.  The objection to it, of course, is the going back on the practice which has been already initiated in connection with Departments, etc.  There is such an amount of dispute in regard to the two forms that I do not think there is any harm in having the two of them put there for use.  I do not think there would be any particular point in giving examples and giving you the arguments on both sides.  I am accepting this form simply because I asked the opinion of those who are likely to be senior professors and they are in favour of this form.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 8, sub-section (1), after the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in line 33, to add the words &ldquo;: Provided always that no such Senior Professor shall be removed in contravention of the terms on which he holds his office.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is really to try to meet a matter that was raised by Senator Douglas on the last occasion and to make it clear that a contract could be made and that there could not be violation of that contract, or at least, that it was possible to make a contract and that you would not be prevented from making a contract by the terms of the Act itself.  This makes it clear that his removal should not be in contravention of the terms on which he accepted office, the terms of the contract.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My sole object in putting these amendments down was to strengthen the position of the Government in being able to get the man they wanted.  I had no other object at all. It is difficult to take the amendments one by one because they relate to each other.  They do not seem to me to quite meet the point.  I am not going to press it if the Government are perfectly satisfied, but it seems to me that this particular amendment, to be effective, should read: &ldquo;provided always that no such senior professor shall be removed in contravention of the terms on which he was appointed.&rdquo;  I cannot argue this point without taking it in conjunction with the following amendment because they are really part and parcel of the same point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in a further Government amendment that the tenure of office and other duties can be determined by the Government, but it goes on to say: &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;.  I do not want to appear to be making a small point but it is a point that might be made by some lawyer who was advising a professor who was likely to be appointed that it is provided that the terms of appointment can be changed by the Government from time to time.  If you merely say &ldquo;the terms on which he holds his office&rdquo; it would, in my opinion, be legally possible&mdash;I am not suggesting that this Government would do it&mdash;to alter the terms and he would not then be protected because the terms on which he could be removed would have been altered from time to time.  I <Col N="1728" /> believe it would be entirely got over by inserting &ldquo;the terms on which he was appointed&rdquo;.  That would give complete latitude to the Government, and even if there was a general reduction in Civil Service or professors' salaries they could provide that he would be liable to the reduction, but, so far as his removal is concerned, the position with regard to it could not be changed. If, however, he failed in certain respects, he could be removed, but not otherwise.  I am not pressing the matter, but I am trying to get it made as clear as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that that view might be taken.  I should like to have the wording as perfect as possible without spending an undue amount of time on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to postpone this amendment and deal with the others, so that the matter of whether the words I suggest could be inserted could be considered?</P>

      <P>No matter how impressive an argument may be at the moment, there is always the danger of finding that some other parts are put out of joint by the sudden acceptance of an amendment.  I should like to finish the Bill to-day, and perhaps we could have an interval, or go ahead with other business, and then finish it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of procedure, the Taoiseach is impressed by the point which Senator Douglas makes.  I think it is a sound point, although it is scarcely possible to contemplate a Minister for Finance altering terms suddenly from time to time, or altering a contract he had made.  There is, however, a point to be considered.  The Bill is going back to the Dáil with these amendments, and if the amendment is accepted now, and then, having accepted it, if the Taoiseach finds that his own form of words is preferable, he can change back to that form in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a question of a couple of minutes.  Alternatively, <Col N="1731" /> the Taoiseach can keep this form of words and change it in the Dáil.  The amendment is one which offers scope in the Dáil for a change either way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not be afraid of it as it is.  I think the chances are that it is all right, but I should not like to think, if some difficulty arose afterwards, that we could have made it right here and did not do so.  It will take very little time for me to find out about it, and possibly the Seanad could continue with other business in the meantime.</P>

It is not that I see a danger of the Government doing what I have envisaged, but that a professor might possibly come from another country, go to a lawyer and be told: &ldquo;This cannot be a permanent contract under the Act.&rdquo;  That is my fear, because I know from experience that there are difficulties.</P>

All I can say is that if any abuses of that sort appear to arise&mdash;abuses, not from the point of view of order and so on but from the point of view of using the Estimate for an attack on individuals, or something of the sort&mdash; we shall have to hurry up with the scheme, which probably will be the ultimate scheme when this school is going and everybody knows how it is working, by which an annual sum will be made available, possibly out of the Central Fund and so removed from discussion.</P>
