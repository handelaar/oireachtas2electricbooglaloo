      <P>In connection with the order of business for to-day, I have to acquaint the House that I have been informed that the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, who will be attending in the Seanad on behalf of the Government on item No. 5&mdash;the motion in the name of Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;will be unable, owing to another pressing engagement, to be present until after 6 o'clock.  In the circumstances, and as items Nos. 3 and 4 may not fully occupy the time until 6 p.m., it has been suggested that if these Bills are concluded before 6 p.m. we should adjourn, on their conclusion, and resume at 7 p.m., when the Minister will be able to be in attendance.  If that suggestion meets with the approval of the House, perhaps we can proceed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) (Amendment) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to withdraw the offices of nurse and midwife from the offices to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies.  The Act of 1926 established the Local Appointments Commission which has the duty of selecting and recommending candidates for appointment to certain posts under local authorities.  These posts are in three groups, the first of which comprises all chief executive officers, the second, all professional and technical officers except teachers, and the third any other position to which the Act is applied by the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nurses and midwives were regarded as coming within the second group and consequently appointments to vacancies have, from the passing of the Act, been made in accordance with its provisions. The commission since it was set up has made upwards of 1,700 recommendations of candidates for posts of nurses and midwives.  Last year there were 138 such recommendations or approximately three-fifths of all the recommendations made by the commissioners in that year.  Some difficulty has been experienced in recent years in securing candidates for posts in connection with hospitals for infectious diseases.  The greater demand at present for nurses will not render the position any easier. It will facilitate local authorities in obtaining candidates if they are able to offer immediate employment in permanent posts.  The Department has been advised that in training centres <Col N="1783" /> for fever nursing it would be easier to recruit the permanent nursing staff from nurses with general medical and surgical training who complete their fever training in the centre than by reference to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The higher nursing posts such as hospital matron for which special qualifications are necessary can still be brought within the Act by declaration of the Minister.  It should be open to the Minister to review such declarations from time to time and if necessary revoke them.  Section 4 of the Bill will give him the necessary power.</P>
    <P>There are two other minor matters dealt with in the Bill.  Section 5 of the Act of 1926 fixed six months as the maximum period for which a person temporarily holding a post to which the Act applies could retain office.  It occasionally happens for one reason or another that a permanent appointment cannot be made within that period. Sometimes there is delay in applying to the commissioners or difficulty in getting a suitable candidate, and in such cases temporary appointments have to be continued.  Apart from the provision in Section 5 of the Act of 1926 the Minister has sufficient power to ensure that the filling of permanent posts is not prolonged unduly, and it is not anticipated that in practice the amendment proposed in Section 5 of this Bill will lead to the undue retention of temporary officers.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill gives two months instead of one month within which the certificate of expenses must be given by the commissioners.  The staff of the Civil Service Commission is also partly engaged on the work of the Local Appointments Commissioners and expenses and receipts have to be apportioned between the two bodies. It is proposed to bring the Bill into operation as soon after its passing as the commissioners are able to dispose of existing statutory requests.  Under Section 2 the Minister will appoint a day for the purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that if this Bill becomes law, and if it is afterwards found desirable to reinstate the <Col N="1784" /> provision under which nurses and midwives have to be selected and recommended by the Local Appointments Commission, a new Act will be required and that there is no power under Section 4 of this Bill to carry out such reinstatement.  I tried to follow the Parliamentary Secretary as to the exact effect of Section 4.  I know he referred to the fact that certain posts can still be brought within the Act of 1926, but I did not quite follow his explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get my mind clarified as to whether all these appointments will now be made by the county manager or whether they will be reserved appointments for the county councils.  It seems that the object of the Bill really is to relieve the Local Appointments Commissioners of this work.  We are told that they dealt with 1,700 applications during all these years and with 128 last year&mdash;a very big number, comparatively speaking, when the number of appointments to other posts is considered.  It seems that this work took up the greater part of the time of the Local Appointments Commissioners and now the work has to be thrown back on the local authorities. That does not seem to be a satisfactory procedure.  Perhaps the work may be done with greater expedition but, at other times, we find the argument put forward that work of this kind is better done by a centralised system than locally.  It seems to me that this is a reversal of policy and it seems strange to be told, at this time of the day, that things can be done more efficiently by this method than by the centralised system because the number of applicants is so large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like the clause which prolongs the period beyond six months during which a person holding a temporary appointment can retain office. I think that six months should be quite sufficient.  The history of local Government and of local authorities has often shown that men are temporarily appointed to certain posts, retain these posts for years and are practically forgotten until in later years they apply for a pension when <Col N="1785" /> they are about to retire.  The Parliamentary Secretary assures us that cannot occur but still the six months' period is to be extended.  I do not like to say anything to cast doubt on his assurance but personally I do not think that the six months' period should be extended except perhaps in a case where steps have been taken, say five months after the man was temporarily appointed, to make a permanent appointment and a permanent appointment has not been quite completed at the end of the six months. In extenuating circumstances of that kind, it might be justifiable to grant a further extension but I do not think it is advisable baldly to extend the period as is proposed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the effect of the Bill as regards nurses is to remove the nomination from the Local Appointments Commissioners and put the appointment into the hands of the county managers?  Is it the county managers or the local board who will have the actual appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <P>Senator Douglas raised a point about the possibility of reinstating, by Ministerial Order, the office of nurse or midwife amongst the posts to which the 1926 Act will apply.  That cannot be done if this Bill is passed. New legislation would be required to bring the position of nurse or midwife back amongst the offices to which the 1926 Act will apply.  So far as matrons or nurses holding higher posts and requiring special qualifications are concerned, it will be within the Minister's power, by declaration, to bring such posts within the 1926 Act. Ordinary nurses and midwives will be excluded by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that because of a provision in the 1926 Act?  I was under the impression that by a declaration almost any post could be brought under the 1926 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1786" />
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but this Bill definitely excludes the post of nurse and it cannot be restored by order following the passage of the Bill. Senator O'Donovan appears to think that the whole basis of this Bill is to obviate the inconvenience that these nursing appointments gave to the Appointments Commissioners.  That is not entirely so.  Members of local authorities who are present will know that there has been a continual dislocation of local services owing to the frequent changes of nurses, mainly due, I suppose, to marriage, which in itself is a very desirable thing, and partly due to tiring of the surroundings or to a desire to change to another area.  We have had in our Department repeated complaints from local authorities on the grounds of dislocation in their services resulting from such frequent changes of nurses.  Apart from that, there has been a difficulty, notably here in Dublin, in securing nurses for fever hospitals.  As a rule, nurses take a general training first and then they go to a fever hospital for special fever training.  The fever hospital boards find it difficult sometimes to get nurses to enter on these courses of training unless they are in a position to guarantee them employment at the end of their fever training.  So long as the office of nurse remains an office to which the Act of 1926 applies, the board cannot give any such guarantee inasmuch as it is a matter outside their province to determine.</P>
      <P>On the question of the six months' limit for temporary appointments, raised by Senator O'Donovan, it may be true that in exceptional circumstances temporary appointments have been continued for a period of more than six months, but it is very doubtful if such a practice is strictly within the law.  At any rate, members of local authorities know that it is impossible to have a permanent appointment made within the six months' limit in certain circumstances.  There is ample provision to prevent, or safeguard against, abuses, under Section 6 of the Act of 1926.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6, of the Act of 1926, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a local authority does <Col N="1787" /> not, within three months after an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant or (in the case of a new office) is created, either request the commissioners to recommend to them a person for appointment to such office or make an appointment (other than a temporary appointment) to such office under and in accordance with a provision of this Act dispensing with such request, the Minister may on behalf of such local authority request the commissioners to recommend to such local authority a person for appointment to such office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At any rate, the Minister has the necessary power to prevent any abuse.  As to how stringently that power will be exercised, I presume that, generally speaking, if there is no adequate reason for postponing an appointment, the Minister will come in and say, in effect: &ldquo;If you do not ask for a recommendation from the commissioners, I shall have to do so myself.&rdquo;  If there is any adequate reason why the appointment should be postponed, I am sure that the Minister will be reasonable, but at any rate he has the power to prevent abuses in that connection. I think, Sir, that I have dealt with the various points that have been raised by Senators.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (Bye-Election) Bill, 1940&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This <Col N="1788" /> Bill contains legislative provisions for filling a casual vacancy in Seanad Eireann which has been caused by the death, resignation or disqualification of a member who had been elected to the Seanad under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, or at a bye-election under this Act.</P>
      <P>Article 18 of the Constitution requires that casual vacancies shall be filled in the manner provided by law. The Constitution fixes a maximum of eleven and a minimum of five members to be elected from any one panel at a general election.  The Act of 1937 fixed the number to be elected from each panel&mdash;five from the cultural and educational panel, eleven from the agricultural panel, eleven from the labour panel, nine from the industrial and commercial panel, and seven from the administrative panel.  It appears proper to maintain the constitution of the Seanad as between the different panels, by providing in this Bill that a candidate at a bye-election shall have the qualifications required at a general election in respect of the panel from which was elected the member whose death, disqualification or resignation was the cause of the vacancy.</P>
      <P>In the Act of 1937 each panel is divided into two sections&mdash;the nominating bodies sub-panel, and the Dáil sub-panel, and candidates on the former sub-panel are nominated by the bodies registered for the time being on the register of nominating bodies which is revised every year; candidates on the latter sub-panel are nominated by members of Dáil Eireann.  The same qualifications are required for each sub-panel of a panel.  This sub-division of panels is continued in this Bill, so that a vacancy will be filled, as a nominating bodies vacancy, if the member was originally nominated by a nominating body, and as a Dáil vacancy if the member was nominated by members of Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of filling casual vacancies provided in this Bill approximates to the method at a general election as closely as is possible in the particular circumstances. At a general election each nominating body must make the prescribed number of nominations; for example, there are <Col N="1789" /> eight nominating bodies registered for the agricultural panel and at a general election each of these bodies must nominate two candidates&mdash;or 16 in all&mdash;of whom five will be elected. It is not proposed to require each nominating body to nominate two candidates for election to fill one casual vacancy.  It is proposed to retain in a modified form this function of nominating bodies to nominate suitable and qualified persons from whom panel members are to be chosen. It is considered that this function of nominating could best be exercised by providing for a common meeting of the nominating bodies registered in respect of a panel.  This meeting will be attended by three persons nominated by each nominating body, and a register will be established and maintained of the persons so appointed.</P>
    <P>Whenever a vacancy occurs by reason of the death, disqualification or resignation of a member elected from a nominating bodies sub-panel, notice will be given, on direction of the Seanad, to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who will issue, within 180 days, an order fixing dates.  Each member of the particular standing committee will receive due notice of the time and place appointed for the holding of a meeting of the standing committee.  If the meeting agree on three candidates, subject to the ruling on nominations, one of those candidates will be selected by the Taoiseach.  If at the meeting more than three names are nominated a poll will be taken at an adjourned meeting.  Where more than three candidates are nominated, each member may vote for one, two or three candidates. Each candidate must have the qualification of knowledge and practical experience of the interests and services to which the panel relates.  At the conclusion of the counting the returning officer will set out the names of the candidates arranged according to the number of votes they each received at the poll.</P>
    <P>The nominations will be examined at a sitting for the ruling on nominations which will be attended by the President of the High Court as Judicial Assessor. <Col N="1790" /> If, after this ruling on qualifications, three candidates stand nominated, a list of their names, in alphabetical order, and qualifications, will be sent to the Taoiseach, who will select therefrom one person to fill the vacancy. If less than three persons stand nominated, the proceedings must commence afresh.</P>
    <P>Where the vacancy is to be filled as a Dáil sub-panel vacancy, a candidate must be nominated by a member of the Dáil and eight other members must assent to the nomination.  Each nomination will be examined at a sitting to be held for that purpose.  If there is only one nomination standing after the ruling, the returning officer will declare the person nominated to be elected.  If there is more than one, the members of Dáil Eireann will vote by post.  For the purpose of the voting, the rules in the principal Act will apply as at a general election.</P>
    <P>For the filling of casual vacancies, it is not proposed to constitute, or revive, the special electorate constituted for the purpose of voting at a general election.  There will be a separate election to fill each casual vacancy that arises.  To fill more than one casual vacancy at a bye-election would involve the formulation of complicated rules&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Complicated rules!  Does the Minister suggest that there could be anything more complicated than what is contained in this Bill?  I do not think it would be possible to get anything more complicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and a simple direct procedure is preferable.  Should Dáil Eireann be dissolved, the proceedings to fill a casual vacancy will automatically cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Talk about complicated rules!  I find it very hard, Sir, to talk about this Bill.  It reminds me of one of those Heath Robinson cartoons, where you have all kinds of contraptions, such as ropes, pulleys, ladders, and so on, for the purpose of doing a very simple thing.  It baffles me how anybody&mdash;even the most hardened civil servant&mdash;could have come to this <Col N="1791" /> most extravagant conclusion.  I think, however, that I know the reason for it. The purpose of the Bill is to fill casual vacancies in the Seanad.  When they were passing the original Act, the original Act was, if I might be permitted to say so, in the nature of a fraud, and so is this Bill.  The original Act purported to produce a vocational Seanad.  I think it will be admitted that there is no body in the world that is less a vocational body than we are here.  I think there can be no doubt about that.  The difficulty that arises is that all this elaborate machinery is for the purpose of perpetuating that fraudulent appearance, giving nominating bodies the idea that they have some influence upon the type of person who can come into this House; but, in fact, of course, the decisions are made on an entirely different basis. There are two types of vacancy provided for in this Bill.  It is a large Bill, containing 27 sections and 14 pages, which is inexcusable in the present state of scarcity of paper and scarcity of time which Ministers and others might be devoting to solving more difficult problems.  A vacancy occurring on a nominating body sub-panel is dealt with under Section 2 of the Bill. It takes ten sections and six pages and, when all the machinery has been put into motion, in the end of all that, the Taoiseach himself, that is to say, the Prime Minister and the head of the majority Party in the Dáil, nominates the person to fill the vacancy. Why should not he do it directly?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to put down an amendment to that effect. Senator O'Donovan does not understand me yet.  That is the difference between Senator O'Donovan and myself&mdash;I cannot make him understand me.  Why does not he do it directly? A vacancy in the Dáil sub-panel is handed over to the Dáil to fill.  The result is that if a vacancy occurs in this House by the death, resignation or disqualification of a particular member <Col N="1792" /> of this House, no matter what his political views, the majority Party in the Dáil have then handed over to them the filling of that casual vacancy.  It is really the same thing as handing it over to the head of the majority Party in the Dáil for the time being.  It is worse, in a way, because the head of the majority Party is very often a person of some responsibility but the majority Party working by itself does dreadful things.  In other words, the Bill perpetuates what is in the Principal Act and it makes worse the power of the political Party in the Dáil over this House.  The whole sum and substance, the whole purpose of the Principal Act, was to give the appearance of putting up a vocational Seanad but to have the result that this House would correspond exactly to the majority in the Dáil for the time being. That, of course, has worked out perfectly as far as this particular Seanad is concerned and will work out similarly in the future.  This Bill continues that machinery and continues what I call the fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible for me to understand why a much simpler Bill was not introduced, a Bill of five or six sections, which would provide that in the event of a vacancy arising from the death, disqualification or resignation of a Senator the Taoiseach shall appoint a suitable person to fill the vacancy.  You could add to that section that in selecting the person to fill the vacancy the Taoiseach shall have regard to the standing, qualifications and other circumstances of the former occupant of the seat.  That would surely produce at least as good a result as all this elaborate machinery and would probably produce a better result.  I make Senator O'Donovan a present of it, that even the present Taoiseach would probably produce a better result. Looking at the matter generally, from the point of view of this House now and in future, with succeeding and different Governments, it would seem to me to be a much more intelligent procedure. It would eliminate the Seanad Returning Officer, the President of the High Court, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk of the Dáil and heaven knows <Col N="1793" /> how many other high functionaries.  It would eliminate all this paper, documents and files.  It would be a simple process.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion for filling a vacancy would be that the Seanad itself would fill it.  Nothing is ever quite as good or quite as bad as those who framed it intended it to be.  I do not think that this House is quite as bad as it was originally intended to be.  In fact, I think it is a bit better. It is almost a miracle.  After 60 people have met as members of this House for a year, less or more, after they have come to know one another, I think they could fill a casual vacancy in the Seanad more reasonably and more efficiently than this extravagant &ldquo;Heath Robinson&rdquo; machinery.  I, therefore, intend to propose, by way of amendment, on the Committee Stage that after Section 5 a new section should be inserted, wiping out all the machinery and giving power to the Taoiseach to nominate a person to fill a casual vacancy, providing that he shall take into consideration the qualifications, standing and other circumstances of the former holder of that particular seat.  I think that would give simpler and more effective machinery and, above all, would be a more honest and straightforward procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just as much opposed to this Bill as Senator Hayes. I do not propose to vote against the Second Stage because I think an effort should be made to simplify and amend it.  It was described to me just before I came in here as a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  I find it almost impossible to believe that the present Minister for Local Government thought this all out himself and conceived it in his own mind.  He has always seemed to me to be a man who would go a much more direct way about getting a thing done.  I am not prepared to give him credit for all the complicated machinery included here. I am not without hope that it may be possible, if this thing is freely examined and discussed, that this House which, after all, is very much concerned, may be able to put in by <Col N="1794" /> a measure of agreement a far simpler method.  I am not without hope that the Minister may be pleased if that can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Examination of this Bill in detail would require a rather long speech and a great deal of criticism could be made. I do not propose to inflict that long speech on the Seanad, but I would like to consider what it is that we want to achieve when there is a vacancy.  It seems to me that the filling of a casual vacancy is not intended to have any political significance.  Where you have a bye-election for the Dáil, and where you may possibly have any effect on the Government as a result of it, it may be of considerable political importance, but in a revising chamber such as this Seanad there is no need for and no advantage to be gained by having a political vote.  First of all, we require a man or woman who is suitable, who will carefully examine legislation that comes here, who has enough knowledge to move amendments and to make suggestions, who has a reasonable measure of independence and, at the same time, who is, speaking in very general terms, of a similar outlook politically and otherwise, to the person who originally held the seat.  It is not possible to achieve that with absolute certainty but it is possible, by means of complicated machinery, to make it practically certain that you will not achieve it.  I honestly think that that would be the result of the machinery provided in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to do is to have a discussion about the merits or demerits of the last Seanad.  Some of us here were members and others were not but, for a period of its existence, it had power to co-opt.  As a general rule, the members accepted the principle, that if a suitable person were put forward by those with whom the deceased or resigned Senator usually associated, he would be accepted.  They did not change the class of person to be appointed.  I think it did occur only once&mdash;I am speaking entirely from memory&mdash;but generally speaking there was no attempt to take any unfair advantage of the existence of a vacancy.  If my understanding of the <Col N="1795" /> temper of this House is correct&mdash;and I have no reason whatever to think it will become worse; I think it will become better&mdash;I think there is a good deal of good feeling and understanding.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am perfectly satisfied that if a person from those who usually sit on the opposite side of the House from myself were to have to resign there would be no opposition from this side of the House to co-opting a person of a similar political point of view.  I further think that that would be reciprocated.  When you come to smaller groups, such as the Labour Party, in the last Seanad it was always accepted that where a vacancy occurred amongst labour Senators it would be filled by a nominee of the Labour Party, provided he was a suitable person and even that provision was not pressed too far. There might be exception taken to certain individuals but not in any case to the fact that he should be a nominee of the Labour Party.  I, therefore, think that you could not get any worse results by having co-option by the Seanad itself.  Even if it did not work out as I suggest, with the Seanad constructed, as it must inevitably be, under the present electoral law, you could not get any worse results than those which will be got from this Bill, because it is so arranged that there is as near as possible a certainly that there will be a majority in the House corresponding to the majority in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If that is so and if the head of the particular Party which happened to be in office chose to exercise his powers in that direction, under this Bill, in the case of nominating bodies, it would be exercised by the head of the Party, and, in the case of other vacancies, by the Dáil which would have exactly the same majority.  Therefore, I suggest to those who fear that under a co-option system there might not be the fairness we require, that there would be a very fair chance of getting it, and that, if it did happen, the result would not be any worse than what you will get from this elaborate machinery.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think I would prefer <Col N="1796" /> co-option, but I would certainly much prefer the suggestion made by Senator Hayes to the provisions in the Bill.  The person who may for the time being fill the position of head of the Government may be actuated entirely by Party considerations, and, if he is, it is almost certain that the committee set up under Part II of the Bill will provide him with a chance, in the three names, of exercising his Party preference; but I am almost certain that the Taoiseach for the time being, particularly if there is the same kind of feeling as there has been for some time in this House&mdash;and I refer not only to the recent emergency&mdash;will recognise that it is desirable to select a person similar to some extent, at any rate, in his general outlook, knowledge and experience to the Senator who has had to leave, or who has died.  I would prefer that system to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill as it stands, it is, as was explained by the Minister, divided into two sections according to the two sub-panels, the nominating body sub-panel and the Dáil sub-panel.  In the case of the Dáil, it simply provides for a majority vote, and you are far more likely to get a good selection by the Taoiseach than by a majority vote of the Dáil.  I cannot see why, even if you must have this machinery, you could not have the same principle for Dáil vacancies as for nominating body vacancies.  But when you come to examine the provisions in regard to nominating bodies, you find that a committee is set up.  There is no likelihood at all that that committee, which consists of three members of each of a large number of nominating bodies for a particular panel, is likely to choose a person of similar outlook to that of the Senator who has resigned, or who has died.  You are not referring it back to the same nominating body who nominated the Senator, but you are providing an elaborate committee.</P>
    <P>Whoever designed this Bill must have spent considerable time thinking out every conceivable snag that might arise and they provided for the possibility that you will never get a Senator elected at all under that scheme, because, if this committee does <Col N="1797" /> not succeed in nominating three persons, under the Bill, it would be quite wrong to allow the Taoiseach to choose from two, or one, and, therefore, you must have a vacancy all over again.  I do not know whether there is any limit to the number of vacancies that may be re-created under that system.  It seems to me to be the position that if the nominating bodies committee provided here fails to procure three names, the sending of another message from the Seanad and the creation of another vacancy is intended to inspire it so that it can find three.  I do not think it very likely that it would not find three of some kind or another, and, no matter how unsuitable these three are, the Taoiseach has the responsibility of choosing from these three.</P>
    <P>I am pretty well certain there is that possibility of a farce, but if you leave it to the Taoiseach himself, he would get plenty of suggestions, and he would have no difficulty in finding a number of names because suggestions would certainly be made from persons who were in general political or other sympathy with the retired or deceased Senator.  He would be in a position to choose someone acceptable and would be responsible.  I think it would be a most unsatisfactory position to put the Taoiseach in to have to choose between three names sent forward more or less publicly by this body.  It is not very clear whether they are to be disclosed or not, but a body of that size is not going to be secret unless there is some sort of secrecy pledge, and I am not suggesting that should be done.  It seems to me that the more I look at the Bill the more there is to be said for a simplified system, and although I am not going to vote against the Second Reading, because I think it might be possible to amend it, I would sooner leave the thing as it is and not to bother about filling vacancies at all than to set up all this machinery.</P>

      <P>While agreeing that the Bill is very complicated and that the previous Act is still more complicated, I do not think any Senator has a right to call any Act passed by the <Col N="1798" /> Oireachtas, because it was not passed by this Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes also said that nomination by the Taoiseach would be far preferable to this complicated Bill.  Even the present Taoiseach's selections would probably be better, he said.  What I regard as sinister in that remark is the use of the expression &ldquo;even the present Taoiseach's selections&rdquo;.  I think the experience of the House is that no member could object to the nominations or appointments made by the present Taoiseach, and I do not see why he should say that even the present Taoiseach's nominations would be more acceptable.</P>

I simply intended to say that the present Taoiseach, who, as is known, is a political opponent of mine, would make more suitable nominations, in my judgment, than you will get from this elaborate machinery.  There was nothing sinister in the use of the word &ldquo;even&rdquo;.  I was alluding to the present Taoiseach who is obviously not a political friend of mine.</P>

Even with all he has said, I would be careful where I would put the &ldquo;even&rdquo;.  Senator Hayes will admit that the fraud which was passed by the Dáil and perpetrated on the country, did produce a miracle in this House after all.  It produced a Seanad which, sitting here now, is not apparently to his mind any better than what he had anticipated.  If I might make a personal explanation&mdash;I think the Senator cannot object to the majority of this House having political opinions in favour of the Government that is in existence to-day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to put that interpretation, at any rate, on what the Senator said.  I think the expression &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; was entirely out of order.  I think that the members which the electoral college or the country sent to the Seanad would not <Col N="1800" /> be anything better if the 60 members, or the proportion nominated by the nominating bodies, were sent entirely on professional or other recommendations and were not to have political opinions.  Now, I think it is a bad thing not to have political opinions. Each individual is entitled to have his own political opinions and when we come in here we are entitled to hold them, and if Senator Hayes would like to listen instead of talking, I would tell him that I would not be in this Seanad&mdash;whether it would be an asset or otherwise&mdash;but for the fact that there were vocational nominations.  I think I have already stated that on another occasion in the Seanad although, perhaps, the House might be better off.  Complicated as it was and everyone agrees that it is desperately complicated, the Act ensured that everybody was not elected purely on a political nomination.  To come to the question of co-option as against the system adopted in this Bill, that may be a way out of it.  Senator Douglas has said already that it was adopted in the old Seanad but I think, in fact, that the previous Seanad was elected in somewhat a similar way to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that this is the second Seanad elected under the system prescribed in the present legislation. All these clauses that I have read do seem very complicated and I think that Senator Douglas is correct in saying that the draftsman seemed to be trying to prevent any loophole whatsoever.  I hope that if it does become law that all the loopholes will have been provided against.  There is a vacancy in the Seanad at present in the cultural and educational panel.  I do not think that there is any machinery for the selection of a substitute, in any professional body scarcely, to nominate a man to fill a vacancy of that kind.  There are, I think, 16 nominating bodies on that vocational panel.  Therefore, why should the one vocational body that happened to get their man elected to the Seanad be allowed to fill the vacancy when all the nominating <Col N="1801" /> bodies had nominees on the panel at the previous election?  Whether there would be three, or two or one representative from each vocational body on that panel, I think that everybody should have a voice in nominating whatever number it is decided to send forward to the Taoiseach.  The Bill specifies three and I think that will mean 48 persons will have to meet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better deal with the subject of fraud to begin with.  I would like to bring in some homely analogy to make it clear to Senator O'Donovan's mind, although I am aware that it might have the effect only of intensifying the fog.  To explain this homely analogy&mdash;there may be a jam made of vegetable marrow, a few grains of wood and some colouring matter, and it could quite truthfully be described, perhaps, as possessing great dietetic qualities.  If you buy it as such, it might be splendid, but if there is a label put on the pot with the inscription: &ldquo;Raspberry jam, containing nothing but pure fruit,&rdquo; then that is a fraud.  Senator Hayes, I understand, applied the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; on the ground that when this body was being set up there was an attempt made to represent it as a vocational body.  It is no more a vocational body than the vegetable marrow, coloured red, is raspberry jam, and the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; applies in both cases.  To come to the question of complications, it seems to me that they were introduced in the original Bill.  The word &ldquo;vocationalism&rdquo; was going around the country and everybody thought that it was going to solve innumerable ills, but nobody, I suggest, knew how they were going to go about it.  I thought that as there was a commission sitting at the moment it might have the effect of clarifying minds in general about it.  The idea that got abroad was, that instead of having an ordinary Parliament consisting of a Dáil and Seanad, there should be vocational councils.  As I understand the vocational idea, it is that the Government and Legislature should have withdrawn from it completely this elaborate control of, if you like, the economic life of the country, which is not the Government's business.  Therefore, when you have society organised vocationally, you have a council representing those various vocational bodies, which looks after their affairs, and it does so because the Government should not be doing so.  What was done in the case of this body&mdash;which is a second and revising House &mdash; was that certain bodies arbitrarily decided upon were given the <Col N="1803" /> power to nominate.  That was all it amounted to: it really amounted to nothing.  If this body had been a truly vocational body it should not have the functions which it now has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Senator say &ldquo;arbitrarily decided upon&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I say &ldquo;arbitrarily decided upon&rdquo; as it cannot be otherwise until every productive man is properly organised into appropriate vocational bodies.  If it is not done in that way, the decision in regard to the bodies which are to have the nominating powers is necessarily arbitrary. Then there was all the elaborate business of trying to give a &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; label to this body.  If this were a vocational body, we should not be dealing with ordinary legislation, we should not be part of the Government. That is not the job of a vocational council.  In a vocational council every productive activity in the country is represented, the members of it are chosen in relation to that productive activity and that only; whereas the members of a Government institution are chosen in relation to the common good, and the common good does not consist entirely in economic production. It does seem to me that the whole complicated business came from this futile attempt to put a &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; label upon this body.  I strongly object to that.  If this were a vocational body, it should not be dealing with Defence Bills, and so on.  A man who is a good carpenter and who makes his living by it is a man who would be suitable for the organising of carpentry in this country, but it does not follow in the slightest degree that he is necessarily appropriate to deal with matters regarding the common good of the country, or that he has the gift of governing with prudence.</P>

      <P>And I am afraid that the Senator's native element is befogment. With all its faults, the first Seanad was a remarkably good one. If you compare anything with the abstract perfection, it will show its faults.  As a human institution, the first Seanad of this State was extraordinarily good, and I do not expect to see any better body set up here.  Half of that body was nominated and the other half was elected by the Dáil. The Senator has spoken as if we object to the majority of this House being part of one political Party.  We do not object at all.  I am being quite frank about it when I say I was very pleased with the proposal in the original legislation that the Taoiseach should have nomination power with regard to certain members of the Seanad, but the way that power was fulfilled was extraordinarily disappointing.  When he had the power to nominate, he could have looked around the whole country and could have chosen&mdash;if the subjects would accept his nomination&mdash;men who, in his own judgment and knowledge, and according to the information obtained through the resources at his command, appeared to be the most eminently suitable.  In relation to that power, I think his nominations were extraordinarily disappointing, and I have no hesitation in saying that.  I do not say that they were necessarily the worst in the Seanad but, in view of the possible perfection that could have been obtained by that method, it was disappointing, though they are not at all too bad and no method is going to procure absolute perfection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why what?  I could be quite flattering to some of the Senators, but my own personal integrity will not allow me to tell any nominated member that no better man could have been chosen for the position.  This House has nothing to do with vocationalism. If it had, it should not be dealing with ordinary legislation.  I hope that I will see power taken away from the Government to butt in in the ordinary lives of the people.  Most of <Col N="1805" /> the ordinary Bills which have been brought in should not have been brought in at all.  This is what happens.  The Dáil passes Bills through their five stages and then they come here for consideration.  To put it in the shortest possible way, we have certain powers of delaying them and, if we have any bright suggestions, they can be put down and sent back to the Dáil for their assent.</P>
      <P>What has come very well from Senator Hayes would not have the same significance if it were coming from the other side.  We will assume that the Party in power in this country is supported because the policy of that Party has been governed by very great wisdom and prudence and we ask nothing better for the country.  On the other hand, the fact that Senator Hayes is not a supporter of that Party indicates that he has grave doubts in his mind as to the policy which is best for the country. He says that, though the Party which operates its policy here has been consistently disappointing, he is prepared to accept nominations even from the head of that Party.  I cannot see why there should be all these elaborate provisions.  The humbug of this vocational method is now so abundantly clear to anybody with any power to think that we should try to get away from it.  Here in this minor matter of filling vacancies, all we needed was simply nomination.  The Taoiseach could nominate when a vacancy occurs and certain forces operate.  When a member of this side of the House goes out of the Seanad, if the Taoiseach consistently nominates a notorious partisan of his own Party, that will be clear to the country; and, if his own integrity of mind does not urge him&mdash; or anybody subsequently in that position&mdash;to take other considerations into account, the feeling of public criticism will compel him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in two parts: the Dáil nominates one part and there is an elaborate procedure for the other part. I could understand the Minister bringing in a Bill if he felt that there might be strong criticism of any suggestion that power to fill these vacancies <Col N="1806" /> should be taken over by the head of the majority Party in the Dáil.  On this side of the House we do not expect perfection, and the proposal comes much better from this side of the House than it would come from the other side.  We are prepared to have a much more simple method of nomination, as the whole matter is not very serious, and the future of the country is not going to depend on whether a particular vacancy is filled by A rather than by B.  If the present system is going to be permanent, it is particularly desirable that the method of filling vacancies should be simplified.  The Minister might have better suggestions to put forward than those made by this side of the House for nomination by the Taoiseach.</P>

I can only feel that some rather junior civil servant was given an essay in drafting, that he proceeded to see how complicated he could make the thing, and to what extent he could follow in miniature and adopt in miniature the Bill that prescribes for the constitution of this House.  Really, in these days when there is so much serious work to be done, it seems a terrible waste of time that we should have all this elaboration to keep in step with something which was exceedingly imperfect from the start and which never fulfilled in any way the function which it was intended to fulfil.  Also, why waste this money because a certain amount of money will undoubtedly have to be <Col N="1807" /> spent on this system?  Cannot the Minister recognise reality and say that if the House presses him, he will withdraw the Bill, do away with all this elaboration and leave it to the Taoiseach to nominate the candidate. Really, I think that when the country realises what is going on, there will be a great revulsion against this system. Complicated as bureaucracy is, this Bill is bureaucracy run absolutely mad.  I hope the House will unite in pressing a common sense view on the Government.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill and put before us some few simple clauses, as suggested by Senator Douglas, which would meet the situation.  I do not know that the Taoiseach would be very anxious to take the nominations on himself but he might leave the nominations to the House.  Senators on this side of the House are in the minority. The present vacancy belongs to the minority, but we are satisfied to trust the other side, who are always in the majority, to do the right thing.  I think it would be much more common-sense to adopt that procedure than the procedure laid down in this Bill.</P>

      <P>While I am prepared to admit that this is a rather long Bill, I am certainly not prepared to admit that it is complicated.  If you take it in conjunction with the other Act, which has already been passed into law, it follows very much on the same lines.  In Bills of this sort, draftsmen have to provide for all eventualities and for all sorts of loop-holes.  I should always personally prefer if I could come in here with a one-section Bill, where it was possible to do so, but as I say the draftsmen have to provide for all eventualities and it is impossible to do so adequately in a short Bill.</P>

      <P>I know that but I am not prepared to get away from the <Col N="1808" /> vocational idea.  The vocational idea was embodied in the previous Act. The last elections were based on the vocational idea and this Bill is intended to give further effect to that idea.  You have these nominating sub-panels.  You have a register provided and every year certain bodies are put on the register by the returning officer.  The returning officer has a list of these registered bodies.  These registered bodies nominate the people to go on this nominating committee and all these people meet together.  When these bodies meet to select their names you will get the names of three persons who will genuinely represent the vocational interest for which that panel stands.  I do not agree that people who belong to vocational organisations cannot exercise the same good judgment as people who may look at a matter purely from a political standpoint.</P>

      <P>It is in its early stages I agree, but this is an attempt at any rate to see how far we can get the vocational idea into operation. Perhaps if we were further away from certain events in this country it might work out more easily.  I hope we are getting away from them for all time. If you could get the vocational idea working in the country it would be a great asset for this Seanad.  When a casual vacancy occurs, it is not the political outlook of the candidate that will be the determining factor.  It lies with the returning officer to say that the three persons whose names will be submitted to him are men of practical experience in a certain walk of life, that they are men who have been associated with a particular panel and that from that point of view they are persons suitable to fill the particular vacancy.  The returning officer must be satisfied that persons whose names are to be submitted to a vote before these <Col N="1809" /> nominating bodies have the qualifications and experience that entitle them to represent that group.</P>

      <P>I think it has got a fair chance.  I think that this is a very good Seanad.  At any rate, when those three names are submitted to the Taoiseach, they will be three names that will have been selected by those <Col N="1810" /> nominating bodies meeting together, and it is then for the Taoiseach to select one of them.  I think it is a very reasonable way to go about such a matter.  Let us say that the Labour groups meet together and select three names.  I think it can be taken for granted that one of these three names will be selected.  The same would apply to the educational or cultural groups, and so on, and even if you did not get agreement, I do not think there would be very much difficulty in getting three names from any of these groups, and these three names will represent the ideals and aspirations of that particular panel or group.  As to the suggestion raised by some Senators, to the effect that the Taoiseach should directly nominate, in the case of such vacancies, I do not think that would be feasible, because it would mean going away entirely from the vocational ideal.  It has been suggested that the Bill is a complicated Bill.  It is not a complicated Bill: it is a long Bill&mdash;that is all&mdash;and it is a long Bill only because it is necessary to provide against the various eventualities that may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann calls upon the Government to prepare, foster and put in operation, in co-operation with voluntary institutions on a scale commensurate with the magnitude and urgency of the problem, a scheme for the reception, placing and after care of as many war refugees as our resources permit and, where necessary, to obtain legislative and financial powers to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> In rising to propose to the House the motion that stands in my name I would like at the outset to say how difficult it is at the present time to maintain any true sense of perspective or fixity of purpose because things are changing so rapidly.  When I put down this motion a little over a fortnight ago the Germans had only just recently invaded and over-run Holland and Belgium and the refugee problem appeared to be one of very pressing urgency.  I maintain, of course, that it still is, but since then the actual drama of war has moved so rapidly that one is inclined to lose sight of those considerations when faced with the dominating factor of armed aggression. The Germans have now invaded and over-run a large portion of France, and even our own country is threatened by invasion.  I frankly admit that physical and military security is a paramount consideration and must dominate all others, but I do claim that this should not blind us to our duty as Christians to succour the destitute and the suffering in this distraught world.  This is the object of my motion.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to recognise that there is a special duty cast upon this country in this matter.  We are, possibly, the most distant country in Europe from the area of active hostilities. So far, we have been spared the horrors of war.  There is a special strain placed upon our neighbours across the Channel with whom, whether we like it or not, we must be closely bound in this matter.  There is a special duty on us to relieve them of the difficulties involved in the task of caring for the large numbers of refugees to whom they have had to give accommodation. We also enjoy, in many respects, surplus food.  None of us is anxious about actual privations in that respect, and we have also, by reason of past history, obligations to France, who, in the dark days of this country's struggle, helped us in our fight against religious intolerance.  But, apart from these more pressing claims, we have our higher duty as Christians to do all we can, even at personal inconvenience or personal sacrifice, to befriend those who have been driven from their <Col N="1813" /> homes and who are seeking an asylum anywhere they can find it.  The suffering of these people, without homes and without country, is one of the most pitiable tragedies of this dreadful war.</P>
    <P>I have seen in the Press certain objections to a motion of this kind.  It is urged that there is no pressing problem and, because it is not front page news at the moment, it is assumed that other countries, and England especially, have been able to meet the need.  Personally, I doubt the sincerity of that argument.  I feel that it is rather an excuse for evading the very obvious Christian duty which rests upon us.  If those who argue in that way were sincere, they would rather say: &ldquo;We accept the spirit, but we doubt the need.  We are fully prepared to ask the Government to examine it in all its bearings, and, if there is any demand, to do what we consider is their obvious duty in the matter.&rdquo;  If that were the attitude of that class of objectors, I should be perfectly satisfied, but I am afraid it is not.</P>
    <P>Then, we have the other argument, that charity begins at home.  That is a very convenient form of argument, but, I suggest, utterly cynical, especially in the present context.  I am afraid that argument comes from a sort of sour and selfish isolation which is at the bottom not only of many of our troubles but the troubles of the whole world to-day&mdash;an attitude utterly ungenerous which suggests that we can live apart from the war, when we can see around us every day in the economic sphere its calamitous effects. That argument does not hold in the world of politics, when the forces of nationalism and totalitarianism have brought us to the terrible straits we are in to-day.  I should say that it is a dereliction of our plain duty as Christians to remain indifferent to the sufferings of others and to think that, by drawing down the blinds around us, we can escape the troubles that have come upon the world.</P>
    <P>I pass for a moment to the machinery which I have outlined in the motion.  I feel that it is necessary for the State to take the lead.  There is, I hope and believe, a large volume of well-disposed opinion in this matter, but it is impossible for isolated voluntary <Col N="1814" /> organisations to do anything effective or anything commensurate with the magnitude of the problem.  I do not want&mdash;far from it&mdash;a special State Department to be set up to handle this matter as a Government organisation, or in any bureaucratic spirit.  I want the Government to act more or less as a convening or coordinating agency to set in motion the many voluntary institutions which, I am sure, if wisely and sympathetically directed, would be only too anxious to help.  I feel that, if the problem is going to be tackled seriously, there must be some legislation.  I think there should be power to get a census of available accommodation.  I also feel that there may be some slight measure of financial assistance necessary and, in this matter, high as expenditure is, I feel that we should not grudge it.  We are spending money on many schemes which are far less urgent than that outlined in the motion.</P>
    <P>I ask the House not to have regard to the exact wording of the motion, and not to criticise or condemn it on those grounds.  I am not concerned as to method of approach.  I do feel that the Government should give the lead, but it is the spirit of the motion that I ask the House to accept.  I ask the House to realise the duty which seems to rest upon us at present in this matter and to recognise that the country now has a glorious opportunity. One of the tragedies of public life in this country is the difficulty of getting a common platform about anything. When any movement is started, everybody seems to find reasons why he or she should not join it.  They are very often personal, sometimes political and sometimes religious, but here, I suggest, is a cause in which everybody should be able to co-operate, irrespective of political affiliations, religious views or personalities.  I feel that if we achieve that alone, it will be an outstanding victory for the country.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that in the past I have often been critical of schemes of a visionary character, and, only lately, I doubted the wisdom of spending money at present on a measure which we passed recently, the Institute for Advanced Studies Bill, but, in this matter, I feel no such limitations.  I think our hearts should rule our heads, <Col N="1815" /> and that we should be impelled by the feelings with which all of us, if we have any spark of humanity in us, must view the terrible tragedies going on in the world to-day and should welcome the opportunity to rise to a noble destiny, and, by bearing the burden of others, to fulfil the law of Christ.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I really came here prepared just to listen to what Senators had to say on the motion.  There is no doubt that every person who views the tragedy of vast numbers of refugees being driven from their homes by war has had his heart touched by their sufferings.  I think that, as individuals, we would all be prepared to do all that we could.  Now, this question of war refugees is not one of pure personal humanitarianism. There are quite a number of snags in it that the Government would have to overcome before they could embark on a big reception of refugees, such as that proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.  First of all, we have our own particular difficulties.  I am not at all saying that we should not share our crust with somebody in greater need, but, as I have said, we have our own difficulties here, particularly the difficulty of organising and of putting ourselves in a state of defence.  The question of refugees is a very big one to have thrown in upon the Government, which is already overburdened with problems of all sorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, suppose that we were the richest country in the world and that we had available all the stores and equipment necessary to handle refugees on a large scale, and had the necessary personnel ready trained, we still have to realise that some method would have to be devised for examining the credentials of refugees coming in here: to make sure that, in fact, they were refugees and nothing else. I simply mention some of these problems to indicate to Senators that the proposition put up by Senator Sir John <Col N="1816" /> Keane would not be a simple one to carry out.  The Government, however, are examining the position, and I shall report to them anything that Senators may care to say about this.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane spoke of convening voluntary organisations for the purpose of dealing with this problem. The voluntary organisations that are capable of dealing with it are not, unfortunately, very widespread throughout the country.  The Red Cross Organisation, if properly organised, could handle this matter of refugees coming here from abroad, or refugees coming from one part to another of our own country.  We hope to see the Red Cross organised in every community centre throughout the country.  If we had in every village and town a number of Red Cross workers who were prepared to give their time to this type of work, then the Government could receive refugees and, after having examined their credentials, pass them along in a short time; but, in my opinion, the principal thing at the moment is to get the Red Cross Organisation established and its workers trained throughout the country.  I should be very glad indeed if Senators would help in their own localities to get the Red Cross Organisation put on such a basis.</P>
    <P>We have facing us, too, the possibility of refugees coming from one part to another of our own country.  If anything like that did occur a good organisation, under proper management, would reduce hardships to a minimum. It is for that reason, principally, that I should like to see the Red Cross Organisation firmly established and its workers trained.  If the Government decide to accept a number of refugees from abroad, we can, under normal circumstances, examine them carefully from a health point of view and handle them efficiently; but if it were a case of dealing with refugees from our own country we would want to take very rapid steps, and in that situation a careful examination would not be possible. As I said when I got up to speak, I came along here prepared to listen.  I had hoped that Senators would speak before I was called upon, so that I would then be in a position to deal with any points they might make.  I want to assure Senator Sir John Keane that, as far as humanitarianism <Col N="1817" /> is concerned, the individual members of the Government are as deeply touched by the sufferings of refugees as he could possibly be.  We may not all agree as to our attitude on many questions, but I think we can agree on that particular one.  If there are any other Senators who wish to speak on this problem I shall, as I have already indicated, report their views to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggested that we should consider his motion in the spirit in which it was moved rather than in the letter.  In my opinion that is the proper way for the House to view it.  I was particularly anxious that th Minister should make some such statement as he has made, because it seemed to me that if the Government had made up their minds that, owing to the circumstances here, no matter how sympathetic they might be, it was not practicable to do anything at the moment, it would be highly undesirable for us to be making speeches urging them to do something when, possibly, we had not the necessary data before us.  I think that at the present time most responsible people are extremely unwilling to deal with matters, about which there may be the greatest possible difficulty, when they do not know what the exact position is.  I would like personally to see the Government inviting the Irish Red Cross to consider what steps can be taken in providing certain areas for the reception of refugees, particularly women and children. That organisation might submit a scheme to the Government with the question as to whether they are in a position to finance it or to give an estimate as to whatever finance would be necessary.  It would take some time to complete that scheme for the country. The question of suitable areas for the setting up of camps and so on and availing of houses already in existence would all have to be considered.  It might be that we might find the preparation of such a scheme of value to ourselves at a later stage.  This could be done now and in that way the time would be found opportune for wise assistance to be given to persons of various nationalities who have found themselves without homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of us have felt that if we <Col N="1818" /> have been fortunate enough to escape the ravages of war, we should feel ashamed if we did not do something in this direction.  While I am fully aware of the difficulties indicated by the Minister, the difficulties connected with knowing who are the right people to be admitted and knowing also what persons were to be rejected&mdash;and that is a very important factor in the whole circumstances&mdash;it would be a very good thing if the Irish Red Cross in their own organisation could devise a scheme towards this end.  I do not know whether they are doing it.  Perhaps their plans might be welcomed by the Government, and they well might be. I think the attitude taken by the Minister is a very reasonable one and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech reminds me that more than a year ago, and before the outbreak of the present war, a number of refugees were actually taken in here through the instrumentality of a committee in touch with the Government, a committee which, I might say, was met very sympathetically by the Government.  It is, I think, only right to say that in this situation even before the war, a considerable number of grave difficulties arose about these refugees.  These difficulties arose more particularly in spite of all the care taken on the question of the point made by the Minister&mdash; the matter of credentials.  Now, manifestly, when we are going to do the thing on a bigger scale, and to take in refugees from another country than England, we would have more difficulties still to meet.  For that reason there does not appear to be any alternative to having this matter carried through by an organisation such as the Red Cross, which has immediate and constant contacts with Government and Government machinery.  I think Senator Sir John Keane would agree that that is the best way in which this thing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No reference has been made at all to the position of people who are not exactly refugees, but who are called by that new term, &ldquo;evacuees&rdquo;.  In that connection it might be possible to give accommodation to women and children coming from England.  There the question of credentials could be got over very largely by the fact that there <Col N="1819" /> would be no language difficulty, and that the British Government would be so close.  In that way, and because of that, the difficulties of the case would be much more easily got over.  I think the case for taking in refugees could be improved also if the Government were satisfied on the matter of aliens.  I do not know whether the Minister for Defence could give an adequate reply to that now.  But if we were satisfied that there were no undesirable aliens already in the country, the solution would be easier.</P>
    <P>One gets the idea that there has been a very big influx into this country from England.  That was particularly so before the recent regulations were made.  I am referring to persons who could not be described as aliens and who have come here to avoid military service.  That is a type of refugee against whom I find considerable feeling.  Those people are different from the others who fly from the actual presence of war and those coming from the imminent danger of war in various areas abroad. For these we should be able to do something. It would be in accordance with our national traditions and our Christianity that we should do something on behalf of these people, particularly with regard to the people from the neighbouring island.  I do know with regard to the refugees, that already even before the outbreak of the war, a certain number were present here.  The Government were sympathetic and helpful, but the difficulties of dealing with those refugees were great.  I must say that I have considerable sympathy with the Governmental point of view in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's reply, generally speaking, very satisfactory. With regard to the pre-war refugees, Senator Hayes has referred to the difficulties.  There are difficulties there now at the present moment that did not apply to the pre-war refugees. The pre-war refugees were people living in a country that had been theirs for years but the present régime in that country does not permit their living there any longer.  Consequently when they came away one had to assume with any available data there was, that they would never be able to return to <Col N="1820" /> their own land.  In the case of war refugees, people who have come from towns and countries utterly devastated by the war, one must necessarily assume that when the war is over they will be able to go back again to their own country.  With regard to pre-war refugees, the Government agreed to their temporary abode here.  The Government assumed that they would not be able to go back to their own country but that perhaps they would be able to go to some other country, to some more recently discovered part of the world.  That assumption had its own difficulties because of the emigration laws of those countries.  At the present time you have refugees in vast numbers, counting now in millions, and when Senator Sir John Keane put down his motion the situation was different from what it is now.  Up to that time we assumed that though there was war in the country from which those people came, we at least in this country were going to continue in a state of peace.  But inviting people here now when we have no guarantee that what they have experienced in their own country may not be our experience here does seem to me to add to the difficulties of a grave problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane in saying that this idea that one so often hears spoken here in this country that any assistance we can give should only be given to our own people, and that we owe no duty of charity to people outside our own country is an utterly cynical and ungenerous sentiment.  I agree with Senator Sir John Keane in what he says about that.  I agree with the Minister that if any arrangement is made by the Government they will require to watch and scrutinise very closely the credentials of the people coming in.  I agree with the Minister, too, in saying that if there are any arrangements to be made, the best method is not for the Government to make them but rather that some voluntary organisation should take the responsibility of looking after the people while here.  The Government's function should be to make such arrangements with regard to the law as it concerns the admission of aliens, so that regulations made under that law would be so arranged as to permit their entry <Col N="1821" /> into the country.  The Government could also say that allowing people, out of the Government's good heart, to come in here did not mean that they were taking any risk or opening up to our own people a new source of attack.  I do not know what funds are available to the Red Cross, or the type of organisation they have.  I do not think we can ask more from the Government than a statement that if the organisation of the Red Cross is ready to take on the care of these people while here, the Government will relax any regulations respecting these people or their coming here, if the Government are satisfied that the cases are <i>bona fide</i> cases.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that our duty to people of other countries is more than the duty of other countries to us. During the last war there were Belgian refugees and people from the destroyed areas in France who found accommodation here.  When the war ended, and the matter of refugees became acute, the League of Nations had to have machinery to evacuate numbers of people from one country to another.  They had to provide machinery to evacuate back to Greece Greeks from Asia Minor.  That has been a very serious problem in many countries since the last war took place. Now we have got a number of countries completely overrun and devastated from the air and by every type of weapon, and are we to sit down now and say: &ldquo;We are to look after ourselves and nobody else&rdquo;?  Are we to take that line?  If we, as Senator Sir John Keane says, are to be ruled by our head rather than our heart we are particularly ungrateful.  If we take that line I think we are particularly ungrateful.</P>
    <P>I happened, during the number of years that this country was struggling against England, to be possibly the main channel of communication or association with the people of other countries, and I know that what success we had in the struggle came eminently from the fact that people who had never seen Ireland were ready to come forward and help us by word and deed.  I think that we are chiefly indebted for the freedom we have to the fact that the people of other countries had hearts to sympathise with <Col N="1822" /> us in our struggle.  Consequently, I feel that the good name of our country is involved, and that the people of other countries have a right&mdash;realising, of course, the limited extent of our resources, and the natural difficulties associated with our position&mdash;to think that the Irish people will have sympathy with them in their troubles, even though that might be expected from other countries.  At the same time, I had some association with the pre-war refugee position, and I know that there are very considerable difficulties. I agree that, in inviting refugees to come here, I cannot say now that they would be safer here than in England.  England is a belligerent country, but she has enormous forces to protect her own territory.  It might be some relief to my mind if I felt that we had the power to resist invasion as well as England has.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I think what the Minister has said is very fair.  I hope he will put the case to the Government.  It is a matter that does require Governmental examination. It requires some machinery for seeing that only the right people are admitted.  The Government are right in saying that a voluntary organisation should be in charge of people if they come.  I hope that the greatest possible help will be given.  When the Minister names the most appropriate body, namely, the Red Cross organisation, I think that if the Red Cross were to take over this matter, the Government should give official patronage and official countenance to a further appeal to the Irish people for the Red Cross, with specific reference to the assistance to be given to those possible refugees. I repeat that I feel that we, more than any other people, are bound to give whatever assistance we can to nations in trouble, not by participating in belligerency, but by giving what help we can to people who have suffered from that belligerency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word or two on this question.  I think it is a very good thing that the motion has been put down, because we should all be thinking about this problem.  I am convinced that it is a problem we will have to face.  I do not know whether we can be sufficiently optimistic <Col N="1823" /> or not to believe that we will not have refugees of our own.  But, anyhow, we might as well be quite clear about it that there will be millions of refugees seeking homes, shelter and food somewhere before this war is ended and that we had better make our plans.  I feel, however, that to attempt to do much here, as the conditions are at the present moment, would be very unwise, if not impossible.  In the first place, we must have the people's minds prepared for the reception of refugees, and I do not think that we have done that yet.  I think we might declare that our state of preparedness for any conditions except conditions of peace has not reached the point when we can be satisfied that we are ready for new conditions such as Senator Sir John Keane would like us to accept.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that our first task, even if we are to prepare for the reception of refugees, is to organise our own people as completely and as perfectly as we can for the purpose of defence.  That is the first stage.  You cannot get people to think about the trials and tribulations of those who have to flee from battle zones and away from war until they get a realisation that this thing can come very close to themselves.  There was a period, no doubt, when our people's attitude about this was somewhat different from what it is to-day. In their rather apathetic frame of mind, they have to be subjected to a good deal of stirring up and of making ready before they will do their job fully and completely, either in the matter of defence or in the matter of being willing to receive refugees from one country or another in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot prepare for refugees without thinking of the cost.  Any of us who had any experience of this in the past knows just what happened.  You cannot to-morrow take a number of refugees into a remote country parish and, so to speak, impose them on a community there without having made all your plans for maintenance for, perhaps, one, two or three years.  You have to look ahead and prepare for them.  I recognise that there is the humanitarian side of this and the Christian aspect of it, and that we <Col N="1824" /> ought to be prepared to share the things we have got with others who have not got them.  There has been very little of that in the world during the last 20 years.  Perhaps that is what brought the war on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the point of view from which you approach it.  Looking at it from the point of view of the conditions as they are in this country to-day, we definitely have to make up our minds that, in the first place, our people are not ready for the reception of the idea that we are to have amongst us a considerable number of refugees.  What the Minister says is true.  You will have all sorts of difficulties about the people whom you are to take in.  If you take in refugees, in my judgment it is very important that, as far as is possible from the point of view of making life worth living, either for the refugees or the people amongst whom they live, the temperamental, or even the religious outlook, and other considerations should be taken into account.  If a fairly wide scheme is to be put into operation, all sorts of difficulties have to be faced.  I believe it is better that they should be faced.  I believe that we ought to make plans for the possibility of having refugees of our own, or refugees from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe myself that our people will, after a little while, feel that there is an obligation on them to share their goods with others.  I am certain that the vast majority of them will be very happy indeed if that is all they are asked to do before this war is ended. But, whatever is done, we should not go about it in a spectacular fashion. We should have well-laid plans so as to ensure that, when refugees come, life here will be at least bearable for them and for the people with whom they will live.  We have only limited resources, either from the point of view of accommodation or housing, and in various other ways.  We cannot do what great nations can do.  Our hearts may be warm and we may be willing to do quite a lot.  But it would be very unwise to ask us to do anything until we are in the frame of mind when our people are ready to accept the responsibility of doing it.  It would be equally unwise to expect that we can <Col N="1825" /> do more than we are physically or financially competent to do.</P>
    <P>We have to measure our resources against the magnitude of a problem which to-day seems likely to become greater.  As to how we might be able to alleviate the sufferings of those people, I can only say that the more this question is discussed the better, because it wants talking and thinking about, not only in this House but outside. If a scheme were put before the country to-morrow to take in hundreds of refugees, I do not know what would be said about it in the country.  I am rather afraid that people might not do what they ought do, that they would not show that sense of responsibility and readiness to take them in that we would all like them to show.  That attitude can only come when our people are made to appreciate the fact that these risks and dangers are very imminent here, and that our common Christianity demands that if we have to suffer we must share in the sufferings of others, just as we would share our joys with them, if we had any joys. If we escape the pains imposed upon others, I am sure our people will be ready to make their contribution towards easing their sufferings.  But, we have to go very slowly and very cautiously.  To give the impression, even now, that we are going to have here a very considerable number of refugees, that the country should be ready for them, or that the Government is going to back a plan of that kind, might hamper the Government in whatever scheme of defence they develop, along lines that we want to see developed quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of this motion, but I am not prepared to go so far as is suggested at this stage in the development of our country's defence or lack of defence and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to call upon the Government to prepare, foster and put into operation, in co-operation with voluntary institutions on a scale commensurate with the magnitude and urgency of the problem, a scheme for the reception, placing and after care of as many war refugees as our resources permit and, where necessary, to obtain legislative and financial powers to this end&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> I do not want Senator Sir John Keane to think that I am cynical when my attitude is that in this matter charity really begins at home.  Notwithstanding that, I should say that many of the refugees of to-day were personal friends of mine for over a period of nine years that I spent at the centre of internationalism, in Geneva. I made many friends there from many countries, and many of them, after my first year there, were sent to their deaths in German prisons.  I suggest that before embarking on any campaign of this kind we should ensure that our own defences are in as perfect a state as our financial and other resources permit.  We have been told that there is a real danger of this country being invaded.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what preparations have been made for the chaos that would ensue if there was an air raid on this city to-night.  There are 10,000 people in the populous districts of Dublin, and I guarantee that not 1 per cent. of them would know what to do in such an eventuality.  We hear air-raid sirens sounded.  I have been stopped in the street innumerable times by people who wanted to know what they should do in such circumstances.  I could not tell them.  If there was an air raid to-night there is no one, as far as I know, to tell the people what to do. Until such time as our preparations for the eventuality of invasion are complete we ought to go slowly in this matter. I agree with Senator Baxter that we have got to make our people refugee-conscious or refugee-minded.  From my casual perusal of the newspapers, it appears that our efforts to get a sufficient force to defend our country have failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I saw by the newspapers, I think there has been a very slow response, and before starting any scheme of this kind we should be very careful about asking the Government to undertake such a task. I agree that if voluntary organisations like the Red Cross were developed on the lines suggested by the Minister, that might help.  We should realise the danger that we are told exists and not add chaos to the confusion that might ensue if there was an invasion.  There are not many large institutions here <Col N="1827" /> that we could use for refugees.  The suggestion to erect camps for that purpose is not a feasible one in this climate and, at any rate, we might need all the available accommodation we have if there was evacuation of our own large centres of population.  I am anxious that we should give as much hospitality as possible to refugees, and to people from other lands who helped us in the past.  I appreciate that help as much as anyone.  I do not want to stand in selfish isolation, but I suggest that our first duty is to our own people.</P>
      <P>There is certainly great fear in the hearts of many as to what would happen in the event of any attack being made on this country from any source. I suggest that we should be slow about asking the Government to undertake any more responsibility until our own preparations in the event of attack are perfected.  I do not want to strike a discordant note or to prevent refugees driven from their own lands being given the maximum amount of hospitality and asylum, but having regard to our small resources, financial and otherwise, and until our own preparations for whatever may happen here&mdash;and I hope nothing of the kind will happen&mdash; are perfected, we ought to go slowly. I agree with the principle of the motion but consider that our first duty is to our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The tradition of Irish hospitality is not a myth.  The Irish people have never been backward in that respect.  Although I agree to some extent with what was said by Senators, we should be guided more by our heads than our hearts in this matter.  We should not allow our hearts to run away with our feelings. Apparently many people are not aware of the fact that part of this country is at war, that at any moment the northern counties may experience invasion and bombardment, and that we may have a rush of refugees of our own from the North.  Although charity begins at home it is not selfish to suggest that our people from the North of Ireland should have our first attention. This country has never been counted a wealthy one.  In the past few years there has been a moderate amount of prosperity here, but not very <Col N="1828" /> much more than was sufficient to make the people fairly comfortable.  Quite a considerable number of people in this country of ours to-day, owing to unemployment, are not at all in a prosperous condition.  Although I am saying this, I am not at all against the motion.  We would all be glad, if we could possibly do it, to give every shelter to refugees from any country. After all, we are Christians and recognise it as a Christian duty to help our neighbours.</P>
      <P>The only way the thing could be managed is, as has been suggested, through the Red Cross Society.  The Irish Red Cross Society is affiliated to the International Red Cross Society in Geneva.  By getting in touch with the Red Cross in the belligerent countries where there are refugees at present, arrangements could be made for the reception of a certain number.  However, every effort must be taken to see that this country is not flooded with refugees.  At the moment, the belligerent countries will be anxious to get rid of as many as they possibly can, but it would never do for this country to be flooded with a crowd of people whom we would find ourselves unable to support.  We might have to deprive our own people of the absolute necessities of life, in an endeavour to cope with an inrush of foreigners.  We must not allow our hearts to run away with us, as I have already said.  If we have to accept refugees&mdash;and we may have to&mdash;the Irish Red Cross Organisation must take care that only such a number is accepted as we can cater for.  In the last world war, this country took a number of refugees from Belgium, and I believe many of them were not desirable people.  I take it that the Government will see to it that any refugees who do come will be people we can cater for and that on no account will any young people&mdash;especially men of military age&mdash;be allowed in here from another country. I do not think it would be fair to ask the Government to undertake the responsibilities at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Campbell has pointed out that, from the defence point of view, our position is not at all satisfactory. The people are not conscious of the dangers which face them, and, as the <Col N="1829" /> Senator has pointed out, if an attack took place on this city to-night, the people would not know what to do.  As far as I know, there are no air raid shelters anywhere but in Dublin, and the people in the smaller towns and in country districts have no idea as to what they should do in case of attack. If, by any chance, the South of Ireland were involved in a war, our first duty would be to our own people.  We are ever so anxious to do all that we possibly can for people who are oppressed and in trouble, but above all&mdash;having made sure that we are in a position to do it effectively&mdash;we must be sure that our own people do not suffer as a result of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this motion, because, considering that there are millions of refugees all over Europe to-day, any help we could give in comforting them would be infinitesimal. Anybody who wishes to assist in helping refugees should increase, double or treble the subscription to the Red Cross Society, and so send that money to the place where it can best be applied in helping such destitute people.  We could not take in refugees to-day, as a country, and try to succour them here: the most and the best we could do would be to subscribe as liberally as possible to maintain them in their own countries or in the districts to which&mdash;on foot or by other means&mdash; they have succeeded in escaping.  To my mind, if there were refugees coming here, it is not the worst-conditioned refugee who would reach here, but the privileged type.  I maintain that the best thing for us to do would be to put the Red Cross Society&mdash;as an international association&mdash;in a position to help the refugees in the districts in which they can be helped, without bringing them to our shores.  I can see endless trouble if we were to try to succour any small number as, if it is a small number, I fear it would be a privileged class, and would not be the poor suffering people of those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were ensured of the continuance of our neutrality in this nation, we may be able to give a whole-hearted welcome and say: &ldquo;Come along; we will do all we can for you.&rdquo;  But we are not sure of it.  The fact remains that one of the belligerents is in possession <Col N="1830" /> of portion of our country. Therefore it would be very, very wrong for us to try to embark on such a scheme, though I approve of our doing all we possibly can to help those suffering people.  The position pointed out by Senator Fitzgerald is not a parallel one: the countries which gave money and assistance to succour us in our fight were in assured possession of peace at that time.  We are not in assured possession of peace at present. Even if we were, we could best help the refugees by forwarding subscriptions to the Irish Red Cross Society, instead of embarking on a scheme for succouring refugees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the argument that, because the amount of help we can give&mdash;in the present grave distress of many millions of people&mdash;is infinitesimal in proportion to the need, therefore, we should make no attempt to give any help at all. In fact, the help which we may be able to give may be, from a proportionate point of view, infinitesimal but from another point of view&mdash;the humanitarian one&mdash;it may be and it could be very real, substantial and important. To help, perhaps, 10,000 refugees or war evacuees in a total of European refugees which runs into millions at present, is very small proportionately, but it may make all the difference in the world to the life, the comfort and the future of the 10,000 or so which we may possibly aim to help.  It may also make a vital difference to our national self-respect, since we have enjoyed the privilege of continued neutrality and the absence of warfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion raises in a very acute form one of the most interesting ethical or religious questions&mdash;the question as to how far people, in their collective character as nations and states, should react&mdash;in accordance with Christian principles and in accordance with the ordinary principles of decency and common ethical goodness&mdash;to the problems which confront them.  We are a Christian people and most of us are Christians who accept the spiritual leadership of His Holiness the Pope.  The cause which is now being defended by the Allies has received the blessing of His Holiness but I am not suggesting that <Col N="1831" /> on that account, we should actively associate ourselves with that cause.  It is one of the ironies of our curious history that the Orangemen of Sandy Row, in Belfast, who are our fellow-countrymen but not our fellow-citizens, are actively associated now with the defence of a cause which has received the blessing of His Holiness.  For reasons which we all appreciate, we are not able, as an organised community, to take any active part in the defence of that cause but, in consequence of that very fact, the moral obligation on us to endeavour to alleviate the humanitarian problems occasioned by this European disaster is all the greater. If we cannot be good Christians and good Roman Catholics, in the political and ethical sense, let us be good Samaritans and not pass by on the other side.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come when we should make a gesture of national goodwill to those who are suffering, directly or indirectly, the horrors of war in neighbouring countries and even in the neighbouring island.  I was horrified to notice that the British Government are contemplating evacuating British children to Australia and Canada. Apparently, it has never occurred to them, nor has it yet been suggested by our Government, that here they have at their own doors an island, thinly populated, where British children could very conveniently and comfortably be evacuated and kept in greater safety than they are likely to enjoy even in the western part of their own country. The time has come when we should tell the British Government officially that we shall be prepared to receive and welcome their evacuee children.  In regard to such evacuees, who are, in effect, refugees, no objection could be raised that they might include objectionable aliens or fifth columnists.  If any such question did arise, then we should have adequate opportunities, in association with the British Government, for testing the <i>bona fides</i> of any such person.</P>
    <P>We have large empty houses which formerly echoed with the laughter of children.  Let these houses be filled with children of the neighbouring country and let us extend to them the <Col N="1832" /> hospitality which is one of our proudest national traditions and which we have always willingly extended to strangers. If we do that, it will be a gesture of goodwill between our nation and the British which will have the best possible effect both from the moral point of view and from other points of view, something which will tend to bind us together as friends after many centuries of estrangement and enmity and which will, perhaps, build up a happier relationship between our two islands. I would also ask: why not extend a welcome to children evacuated from Belfast, even if their homes be in Sandy Row?  If they spend some time amongst us, they will learn more of our real character and will realise what we have in common with them more than they will if they remain up there in their little world and we remain here in our little world.  Let us use the opportunity which presents itself now not only as a means of alleviating human suffering but as a means of breaking down the barriers that separate race and class in this island and in these islands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not gathered, so far, from what country it is proposed to receive these evacuees.  If they are to come from the neighbouring island, I suggest that a very good case has been made for their reception.  But I would also point out that, in England, Scotland and Wales you have, probably, 50,000 or 100,000 families of Irishmen, and it would probably be to the advantage both of these people and of Great Britain if they got first preference in our reception arrangements. The problem for us would, in these circumstances, be very considerably relieved inasmuch as most of these people have friends here who would accommodate them.  Probably, some help would have to be given to those who would maintain and support them but, in a great many cases, help would not be required at all.  If there is a danger that Great Britain be raided and if there is to be a general evacuation of women and children, I think that the wives and children of Irishmen serving in Great Britain in one capacity or another have first claim on their native country.  As I pointed out before, this course would <Col N="1833" /> lessen the problem, because these people have many friends here.  The Red Cross Organisation has not a very large sum of money at its command to deal with a heavy problem of that kind.</P>
      <P>Their funds are intended only for occasional emergencies.  A lesser amount of money would require to be spent on our own people from Great Britain than would have to be spent on others who might come here but those responsible for the maintenance of the people who would come would have to be subsidised from some public source.  It would, I think, ease the position of those who would think of receiving refugees if they were to understand that the refugees would be our own kith and kin&mdash;the wives and families of Irishmen working in England, Scotland and Wales.</P>

      <P>The motion of Senator Sir John Keane, if it served no other purpose, has served the purpose of bringing home to us in some slight measure our unpreparedness for such work as he suggests.  A Defence Council has been set up and has been operating for some time.  So far as I am aware, the country has not, so far, seen any results from the work of that council.  The problem of accommodating refugees is already with us. We have refugees from one part of our country to another and no preparation is made for the accommodation of these refugees.  It is time the Defence Council looked into that matter.  In certain areas, up to 1,000 families have been asked to leave their homes and go God knows where.  They have got notice&mdash;very short notice&mdash;to leave the homes which they had founded and to transfer elsewhere.  That is going on and nobody seems to take any notice of it.  That is an urgent matter and should be looked into by the Minister. It shows our unpreparedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The request made in Senator Sir John Keane's motion is, I think, characteristic of our country and of our self-respect.  For a country which has enjoyed the blessing of neutrality so long, it would be churlish to refuse support to that request.  But the motion goes too far and is premature. We have our own domestic troubles.  I do not want to refer to them here or to say that &ldquo;charity begins at home.&rdquo;<Col N="1834" /> But we have problems crying out to us at the moment&mdash;problems involving our safety and our defences.  The work of solving these problems seems to be slow and, so far, ineffective; there is apathy in responding to the call of the Government in connection with national defence. The problem is full of difficulties so far as the things that Senator Sir John Keane suggests should be done during the period of war.  Even after the period of the war, there would be difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves, for instance, is this country safe for refugees at the moment?  We may be within the maelstrom of war before many weeks pass, and I wonder is it quite safe to invite others into difficulties which at the moment we are making very poor efforts to face.  I would be very slow in inviting children from England or any other country to come to this country in present circumstances.  In England, there is a tremendous national defence. You have parts of Scotland which are very remote, and which should be very safe for refugees.  If I were a refugee or an exile, I would prefer to go into the highlands of Scotland than to venture into this country in present circumstances. Another problem that has to be faced arises from the vast difference in outlook, in customs, in religion, and in many other matters between some of these refugees and the people of this country.  There is also the problem that will arise as a result of great masses of people who are foreigners settling down here and ousting some of the people who are at present in employment here, thus adding to the ranks of the unemployed. There are about 120,000 unemployed in this country at the present moment. One of the biggest questions which the Defence Council has to face is how to get these people into productive work. Whether that can be done through the medium of the Army or through some other organised body is for the Government to decide.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that there is an abundance of food here.  I do not know whether there is such an extraordinary abundance of food at present, but let us hope that there will be, in due time, in this country.  We know that additional grain has been sown, but we do not know what the harvest will bring.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> Harvest time has its problems, perhaps problems of a more outstanding and a more difficult character than spring time.  The difficulties associated with seeding time can be generally overcome, but reaping time presents many difficulties for the food producers of this country, and I do not think we can yet be sure of any surplus of food. I think we shall be lucky enough if we can get the wherewithal to supply our present population.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of fuel. Fuel is rationed, I understand, and a big effort is being made to make up the deficiency in imported fuel by producing fuel from our bogs.  I think that effort should be directed in a more organised fashion.  An effort should be made by the Defence Council to bring about a revival of the turf societies that existed up to a few years ago.  Much enthusiasm existed at that time, but that enthusiasm has largely disappeared, and I think the turf societies should be urged to come together again and to do much more than is being done.  We cannot speak with complacency of our food supplies when we read some of the reports of the medical officers of health published in the Dublin papers which refer to the serious malnutrition of a great number of people.  This may be a rather melancholy kind of speech, but I think that is a fact that should be faced.  We should be told when and how the Government, which is responsible for solving these problems, propose to feed the people who are refugees, or when they can say: &ldquo;We are in a position to house and clothe you; come along and be sure of a hearty welcome.&rdquo;  We should first place ourselves in that position. The housing problem is acute in this country.  There may be a few houses in remote places throughout the country which are vacant, but it is very doubtful if very many people, except the privileged classes who can afford to pay for their food and their shelter, would seek refuge in such houses.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see the reception given to Senator Sir John Keane's proposal. To carry that proposal into effect, to my mind, would require machinery such as can be provided only by the Defence Council or the Red Cross Society.  The Red Cross Society started in this country with a great <Col N="1836" /> flourish of trumpets a few months ago but, whatever has happened, it does not seem to be making the progress that such a worthy organisation deserves.  I think that that matter should be taken up.  Some counties opened the campaign with a great show of enthusiasm, but suddenly for some reason that enthusiasm died away.  The Government should make some inquiries into the matter with a view to seeing that the movement is set going again.  I am sure that sources of supply and support could be tapped by that body that could not be utilised by the Government by any other means.  The Red Cross Society will command support from sources and from people from whom the Government could not extract the same measure of assistance.  Help could be more effectively given through sources which the society can tap than from sources to which the taxpayers or the ratepayers would have to contribute and which could only be tapped by the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke of the place our country held amongst the nations of the world, and said that its reputation was such that it commanded the support and sympathy of many other countries when it needed them.  I think that we should do everything to retain that reputation, and that Senator Sir John Keane would do well to urge the speedy reconstruction of the machinery of the Red Cross Society, and also the speeding-up of the whole question of national defence, so as to bring about the conditions which he desires in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to say only a few words in connection with this proposal. First and foremost, I should like to say that it is well that the discussion has taken place so as to give various Senators an opportunity of expressing their views on this question. As far as I am concerned, the remarks of Senator Honan made the most forcible impression on my mind. No matter what Senator Sir John Keane may think, our first duty is to our own.  We have refugees all over the world.  The Irish people are refugees all over the world.  At this stage, I am not going to enter into an explanation of the reason why they are refugees, but I would ask the Government very seriously, in the event of <Col N="1837" /> raids on England, to make provision to see that Irish citizens, some of whom only left this country quite recently, will be in a position to return to their own country.  I think that is our first duty arising out of this motion.  I understand&mdash;I hope I am not correct&mdash; that at the present time some Irishmen are being refused permission to return to their own country.  I think it is the duty of the Government to see that our own people who are refugees, who had to migrate because of unemployment, can return forthwith to their own country if they desire to do so.  I think that is the first duty of the Government before they consider making provision for refugees from any other country.  People may think I am selfish, but I think that is the burning question at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not at all agree with my colleague, Senator Cummins, in his remarks about apathy.  I think it is a grand thing that the Irish people are not panicky.  Some people might desire to make the Irish people panicky. I think it is a grand thing the Irish people are satisfied to see unity amongst their leaders and that they are quite pleased to leave their fate in the hands of those leaders.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason why anybody should try to make the people more panicky.  The one thing I very much agree with Senator Cummins on is the question of the production of fuel and food.  Even at this late stage of the year I would have every unemployed person producing such things as turf, swede turnips and other crops which would provide good feeding for our stock.  The great danger is that there will be a shortage of food stuffs.  Our unemployed could be very usefully engaged on necessary production work of that sort.  Eire should be engaged in the production of some kind of wealth. It is the best thing we could do.  No doubt, if the war should continue for a long period&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;we are bound to have refugees.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied to leave the destinies of the country in the hands of the Government.  I hope and pray that our country will get over the present crisis without invasion from any party.</P>

      <P>It is odd that the Senator should be so satisfied that the country should go to sleep and leave <Col N="1838" /> everything in the hands of the Government. That is precisely the opposite to what the Government are asking it to do.</P>

      <P>The Government are asking the country to realise the situation and to shake off the apathy and lethargy in regard to which so much complaint has been made.  Statements have been made by several Senators about recruiting, statements which I heard with some regret.  I think it is altogether too early to say that the recruiting drive is going badly. It does harm to the recruiting drive to say that, and I am sure that is the last thing Senators would wish.  You cannot expect to change the frame of mind of the people overnight.  The truth is they have been taught for the last eight months to rely on neutrality as a sort of magical word that was going to get them out of everything.  They now find that neutrality is not so much to be relied upon.  It is at least only a means to an end.  The things that really matter are peace, security and freedom.  Several Senators have spoken as if the fact of our being a neutral country made it specially appropriate for refugees to come here.  I do not think it does.  This country is only appropriate for refugees to come to if it is a relatively safe country, and it might be a great deal safer if it were not neutral.  We might be better guarded against attack, and for that reason more likely not to suffer attack, if we were actually at war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discussion has ranged over a rather wide field, and I do not want to extend it further.  I am in sympathy with the principle of the motion, and I think it a pity that a motion such as this should ever be met by the use of that old and mischievous motto &ldquo;Charity begins at home&rdquo;.  Probably no saying has ever done so much harm in the world as the saying &ldquo;Charity <Col N="1839" /> begins at home&rdquo;.  It enables us even to put back our guinea in our pocket instead of subscribing to the Red Cross, as various Senators urged we ought to do.  I believe one of the best things that could emerge out of this debate would be a larger support of the Red Cross.  It is quite true the Red Cross organisation has not had the measure of support, especially financial support, but even other kinds of support, too, that it ought to have had. If we are to receive refugees in case of need, or if we have to deal with all the misery that may arise in our own country should we be attacked, it is urgently necessary that we should support the Red Cross on a larger scale than we are doing at the present moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taking of refugees from England in particular, there is one consideration that has not been mentioned that occurs to me.  So far as we can judge, the British Government are at present trying to impose very severe restrictions on movements between Great Britain and Ireland. Anyone who passed along the north side of Merrion Square to-day and saw queues stretching along down the side street of people trying to overcome the difficulties of such travel must have realised this.  It seems to me unlikely that for a considerable time to come the British Government will be willing to encourage any large movements to this country, even of refugees.  But that is a condition of things that may pass away later.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that if we are going to accommodate refugees we should only accommodate those who are described as our own kith and kin.  By all means we have a duty to our kith and kin, but the whole idea of an international morality and a sense of responsibility to humanity as a whole implies that we should not be bound in matters of Christian charity by a narrow nationalism.  It may do us a lot of good, even though it does not do them a lot of good, to take in people from other countries and get to know them and their point of view.  A number of Senators said that the mind of our country is not attuned in any way to the reception of refugees.  If that is <Col N="1840" /> so, and I think it is, so much the worse for the minds of our people.  We, and the Government in particular, have a considerable responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>It so happens that the Minister here to-night, dealing with this subject, must have been rather specially interested by many things that have been said. He is concerned with our defences, and much has been said about our defences. He is also concerned with the censorship, and I am going to take this opportunity to suggest that if this country is in a state of lethargy, and if it has such an isolationist point of view that it comes as a shock that there should be any suggestion of receiving refugees from abroad&mdash;if there is this kind of deadness and unawareness about everything that is happening in the world around us&mdash;it is largely due to the operation of the censorship which, in accordance with its conception of what neutrality ought to be, a very new, a very modern and a very novel conception, has absolutely stifled the moral sense of the country, forbidding us certainly to express, perhaps even to form, any moral judgment about the events going on in the world around us.  Similarly it has contributed to our extraordinary blindness to our own dangers and interests, the perils that face us, the possibilities that lie ahead of us which so many Senators have remarked on.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied, on the whole, with the reception that has been given to this motion.  I naturally do not agree with the words that have fallen from certain quarters, especially on any kind of limit to hospitality to people who may happen to be across the water.  I think the Minister has explained the position, and I quite agree with him on the difficulties of the problem.  I do not think I shall ask the House actually to pass the motion. It is drawn in rather comprehensive terms, and I quite agree that it cannot be put into operation in the form in which it is worded.  I am satisfied that it has received such general acceptance in the spirit more than the letter and, if the House will permit me, I would like to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
