      <P>This Bill may be described as a kind of hardy annual.  It has to be passed before the end of the calendar year.  The Schedule, containing the list of Acts which it is proposed to continue in force for another year, is the same as that which was in the Bill passed by the House last year.  I think that a memorandum explaining the nature of the Acts in the Schedule has already been circulated to members. It is the intention to replace by permanent legislation two temporary Acts which appear in the Schedule, the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, and the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  The enactment of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, has made it possible to dispense with the renewal from year to year of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, but the superseding Act has not yet been put into operation, pending the passing into law of the general Local Government Bill, 1940, which, if enacted, will supersede the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  A permanent <Col N="2490" /> measure repealing the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, has also been enacted, but as it may not be possible, owing to the emergency, to bring this Act into operation before 1st January, 1941, it is thought necessary to continue the temporary Act.  I may add that consideration has been given to the desirability of enacting legislation to give permanence to the Acts hitherto continued by means of the annual Expiring Laws Act, but it is not considered desirable to do so except in the cases to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity of pointing out to the Minister the hardships that now exist under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  This Act has been continued year after year for 17 years, and a number of changes have taken place during that time.  The whole matter is somewhat technical, and I do not intend at this stage to inflict the details upon the House.  An organisation representing property owners has sent a memorandum to the Minister for Justice, pointing out the hardships under which property owners now suffer, and I may mention that one of the hardships is that, under a ruling of the courts, in certain cases the ground rent has been taken to mean the standard rent.  The effect of that in one case I know of is that the maximum rent that could be charged on a house which would let normally for £96, is £6 5s. Od. a year.  The outgoings in rates and taxes on that house are £14, so that the unfortunate owner is out of pocket £8 on the ownership of that house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty is the lapse of 26 years in ascertaining what was the rent payable in 1914 which normally is the standard rent.  There are other grievances, and legitimate grievances, under which owners of property are suffering, and I am sure that the House will recognise that owners of properties, however unpopular they may be, are necessary to the stability of the State, and are entitled to at least elementary justice.  I hope the Minister will give an undertaking that the matter will be inquired into with a view to an amendment <Col N="2491" /> of the Act during the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the Bills we have every year which I have never been able to vote against, and which I have never approved of, because no one could possibly propose suddenly that there should be such changes in the law, even if there was a majority in the House, as would prevent all these laws which have been in existence for so long from operating any further, though it seems to me that it is one of the bad principles which we have taken over from Great Britain, and that it is time we amended it.  The whole case for annual Acts is that they are of a temporary character and it is the height of absurdity that, both in Britain and here, we have an Act since 1868 which presumably has been renewed every year pending the period when somebody finds time to revise it in order to make it permanent.  Either it is a satisfactory Act and should be permanent, or we should have got rid of it.  The same applies to a lesser extent to most of the Acts set out here. I think I am correct in stating that, during the last ten years, the list has somewhat shrunk and I hope that, by next year, it will have shrunk still further and that there will be an effort made to get rid of it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with what Senator Sir John Keane says.  I think there are many respects in which this Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, is quite unsuited to present conditions.  That, to a certain extent, cuts both ways.  It is very largely unworkable and it gives a good deal of dissatisfaction.  One of the difficulties about this Expiring Laws Bill is that it comes always to us in December and no Senator as yet, and so far as I know, no Deputy, has had the energy or courage to do what I think he would be quite entitled to do, that is, to proceed with a full list of the amendments of all these Acts which he would like to see carried out.  If someone had the courage to do it, it would probably mean sittings for a considerable time in December, but just possibly it might give us a remedy for, <Col N="2492" /> and perhaps the only method of remedying, the system of having an Expiring Laws Bill every year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything that one could seriously object to in principle in the idea of an Expiring Laws Bill.  We have had such a Bill ever since the Oireachtas was established and we probably will have it as long as the youngest member of this Oireachtas lives because we will always find some reason for continuing some enactment for another year.  As Senator Douglas has said, the Schedule to the Bill has diminished very considerably over a number of years.  When I first took an interest in it, the Schedule ran into several pages.  It was reduced gradually by the last Government and by this Government, and there are at least two Acts in the Schedule this year which will probably not be in it next year, but the others, I think, will remain for some time. This Government and the previous Government found it difficult to bring in permanent legislation in respect of some of them, owing to the circumstances under which these Acts were originally passed and circumstances which have continued more or less in a state of flux over these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the remarks of Senator Sir John Keane. I know that there are considerable anomalies relating to the Rent Restrictions Acts, but the present is not a good time to bring in legislation.  I do not say that it would not be a good time to consider legislation, but I cannot speak for the Minister for Justice.  I have not discussed this matter with him, but I shall call his attention to the Senator's remarks.  I do know that the subject is one which has, in recent months, caused anxiety to the Minister.  I happened to be in the Dáil on more than one occasion when questions were addressed to the Minister on the subject and on the subject of the report of the tribunal which was set up a couple of years ago which has not yet been received.  I know the matter is receiving his attention, but I cannot, as the Senator asked, give a promise that legislation will be introduced <Col N="2493" /> this year or next year.  I shall call the Minister's attention to the Senator's remarks.</P>

      <P>The first two Acts mentioned in the memorandum are the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868, and the Corrupt Practice Commission Expenses Act, 1869, and the reason for their continuance is that the two Acts relate to the trial of election petitions and should be continued pending a revision of the whole law relating to election petitions.  That, surely, is a joke.  Meantime, I have no objection to their being continued.</P>

      <P>I want to take the opportunity to make one remark in answer to the statement which the Minister has just made.  The Minister said the present is an unsuitable time to embark on fresh legislation.  No time is suitable to stereotype injustice and, in this case, I suggest to the Minister that a serious injustice is being perpetrated under the Act to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (3), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2494" /> (3) No certificate shall be given by the Minister under this section unless at least 50 per cent. of the cost of the work to which the certificate applies is defrayed out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment in order to have the position clarified.  As I read this section&mdash;my interpretation may be wrong&mdash;the Minister has power to direct any council to do a certain work.  I should like to know whether, if the Minister exercises that power, he is committed to contributing to the cost of the work which is carried out.  Will he contribute to the cost of the work done by the local authority under these conditions, or will the local authority have to carry out the work at their own expense?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised in the Dáil and, as I stated there, moneys for the relief of unemployment are voted by the Dáil and the conditions under which these moneys are to be applied are fixed by the Minister for Finance.  While I cannot give any definite guarantee as to what relation grants from the Central Fund will have to the contribution that may be asked from local bodies, I did indicate in the Dáil that, so far as I was aware, procedure along the lines adopted in regard to unemployment relief moneys would be adopted in respect of the provisions of this Bill.  So far as the counties are concerned, the moneys coming from the Unemployment Relief Vote account for about 80 per cent. of the cost, and I said in the Dáil that I did not see any reason why that should be departed from.  Other than that, I do not see what I can do.  I feel that it is the duty of the central body, if it asks local bodies to do certain works, to give them all the assistance possible. For a number of years, so far as the counties are concerned, the contribution of the central authority represented about 80 per cent. of the cost of the relief works.  I do not think a case could arise where the central body would seek to impose unreasonable conditions on a local body and thus <Col N="2495" /> make a pretext for having that body abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to raise a point on this section and, having heard the Minister's statement on Senator Byrne's amendment, my point seems to be all the stronger.  This section provides that the Minister shall have power to dissolve a local authority which refuses to carry out certain works.  Under the 1925 Act, there was also power to dissolve local authorities in certain cases but, prior to that dissolution by the Minister, it was necessary to hold a local inquiry.  This section puts aside the provision as to a local inquiry and gives the Minister absolute power to dissolve a local body which refuses to execute a certain work. In the light of the Minister's indication that the Government will subscribe, at least, 80 per cent. of the cost in every case, is there any possibility that a local body will refuse to carry out any work of this kind&mdash;that there will be no possibility of agreement between the Minister's officers and the local body?  The Minister seems to be providing for a very rare case.  If a local body refuses to find even 20 per cent. of the money required for the relief of unemployment, they must have some sound reasons for so doing.  Whatever reasons they have, they will not be allowed to give.  It seems very arbitrary that, without any hearing, the local body should be condemned.  It is a departure from the ordinary principles of law and it is a departure from the ordinary principles of justice and commonsense.  I can remember when three and a half days were not sufficient in the Dáil to discuss a Bill for having a manager in the City of Dublin, because of the way in which the <Col N="2496" /> Minister and members of his Party objected to the departure from democratic procedure.  This is the highest point&mdash;or, if Senators like, the lowest point&mdash;to which dictatorial powers have, so far, reached in this State.  The Minister can, without holding any inquiry, dissolve a local body.  I wonder whether this section is really necessary at all or not, or what is the situation the Minister contemplates in which the section will have to be used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The section goes further than the act of refusing; it also refers to delay and inefficiency.  The Senator is not exactly correct in saying that, under the 1925 Act, an inquiry was necessary before the dissolution of local bodies.  In several cases it was not necessary&mdash;for instance, in the case of refusal to carry out any lawful order of the central authority.  This provision does seem drastic, but an extreme case may arise in which a local authority delays in carrying out a particular work.  Other things may also crop up.  The situation which the Senator has in mind will not, I think, arise.  He is afraid of something that is unlikely to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Refusal to carry out a lawful order, as prescribed by the 1925 Act, was open to legal remedy. The authority could discover from a court whether the order was lawful or not.  In this case, the Minister may want a particular thing done in a particular place, and in a particular way. The local people may say that they do not want to do it in that particular way or in that particular place.  The Minister is empowered by this section to dissolve the body which says that. Take, for example, Dublin Corporation, which has an enormous revenue and very varied functions.  It may be carrying out all its other functions to the satisfaction of the Minister, but it may come in conflict with him on one point arising under this Bill.  Without inquiry, the accused body can be executed.  Without an opportunity to appear before any tribunal, its head can be cut off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down to challenge the violation of an important principle of finance which is contained in this section.  The matter is somewhat complicated.  Originally, a statutory limitation was set upon the borrowing powers of local authorities.  I do not know exactly what the formula was, but they were not allowed to borrow more than the amount represented by a certain percentage of their valuation. As time goes on, that limitation is being more often evaded than observed.  It has almost become a chronic practice to exclude borrowings from the borrowing limit, as is now intended in this Bill.  What is the object of the borrowing limit at all?  The borrowing limit was intended to keep the finances of local authorities in a sound and solvent position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If as time went on, the limits were found to be too small, the proper method was, by an amending Bill, to increase those limits.  Then we would know where we are.  Now by a steady process of nibbling those limitations have been indirectly increased.  It is a thoroughly unsound practice, and was condemned as such by the Banking Commission.  The Banking Commission admitted that circumstances had changed since the original limits were set up, but it said that future practices of this kind should receive the most careful scrutiny.  It is now two years since the Banking Commission reported, and I know of no instance where any of their recommendations has been put into effect or treated seriously by the Government. I think it really is time that the Minister looked into this matter, and overhauled this question of borrowing powers.  I admit that there is a certain justification for excluding expenditure of an essentially reproductive character, but on a general view I fail to see that the expenditure contemplated in this Bill is going to be reproductive. It is going to be mainly <Col N="2498" /> for the purpose of relieving unemployment and will not necessarily be reproductive.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to inquire into this whole matter, and have regard to the principles of sound finance in local administration. The rates have gone up steadily in the last three years, and borrowing has gone up, too.  The time has already arrived when there is considerable uneasiness about the whole question of the finances of the local authorities.  This matter of borrowing is involved in the whole question of finance, and is overdue for overhauling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to add a word or two to what Senator Sir John Keane has said.  I raised this matter on the Second Reading, hoping that the Minister would give some explanation of it, but I noticed that he did not do so.  I should like to learn from him what good and sufficient reason there is for the inclusion of this sub-section in the section.  Everyone who has any experience of borrowing money knows there is not much use in trying to blind oneself to the fact that, having borrowed, you owe a debt.  You will be reminded of it very frequently even if you attempt to forget it.  The indebtedness of local authorities to-day is very considerable indeed, and has been mounting up at a very rapid rate in the last six or seven years.  The trouble about it is that the sources from which the local authorities must hope to derive their income are not anything like as solid as they were six or seven years ago.  Their indebtedness has grown with every new scheme which has been put into operation, schemes quite good in themselves but costing quite a lot of money, and having to be paid for by people whose incomes are certainly not growing.  It is unwise to borrow money unless you have hopes of being able to repay it. When people at other times ask that the farmers be enabled to borrow money for their own particular uses, they are reminded continuously on every side, by bankers, economists, and so on: &ldquo;That is not possible unless you are able to prove that they have incomes sufficient to repay the borrowed <Col N="2499" /> money,&rdquo; but the local authorities apparently, can go on assuming that they are going to have incomes to repay those borrowings, and the Minister is facilitating them by including in this section a sub-section whereby it is not necessary to write down against the indebtedness of those local authorities certain sums borrowed for the purpose of relieving unemployment.  I do not think that is sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is much better that the total indebtedness of local authorities should be written down to their discredit so to speak.  They have to pay it, every penny of it.  Whether it is written against them or not, they have to make provision for the capital and interest.  Why not write it down? Some day there must come a limit to the amount which local authorities are permitted to borrow.  It is much better to see the limitation in time, to see it a bit ahead, and not have the local authorities finding themselves up against a very difficult situation, perhaps partly artificial, as was the experience of the Cork Corporation and the Dublin Corporation some time ago.  That is not, I think, a situation which the Minister ought to facilitate or permit to develop.  As far as the local authority is concerned, if money is to be borrowed for those purposes, it will be expected to repay the capital and interest.  It will have to find it from its ratepayers, whatever their incomes are, or however they are to be derived.  It would be much better that those ratepayers should know what are the liabilities of the local authorities. Ratepayers everywhere have to look at their outgoings, and they know that certain sums have to be considered by them as the contribution which they have to make for the maintenance of local services.  Here you are going to spend money, and apparently you are going to create a situation where you pretend that it is not really a debt of the local authority.  Even if money were being spent for a purpose which would add to the capital value of the assets within the territory of the local authority, I still think it would be much better to write it down on the debtor <Col N="2500" /> side of their account, but, where you are spending it mainly for the purposes of relief, and are not going to do much to raise the productive capacity of the area from which the rates have to be raised, I see no justification whatever for this line.  I certainly think it is unwise; I think it is very bad finance, and I strongly oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather agree with the last two speakers, though not on the book-keeping point.  They referred to those sums not being included in relation to the maximum borrowings allowed to a local body.  I read it as meaning that the restriction on borrowing by local authorities is being removed.  Now, in a general way, I object to local bodies having power to borrow at all, but the ordinary case made for borrowing is that it is for capital expenditure.  Although, as I say, I disapprove of their borrowing in any case, if a local body were going to borrow money to build a port which would last for generations, and which would give good service to the people over a long period, then you could say that it would be absurd out of one year's revenue to put up this large sum of money for something which is going to be of service for many years to come.  It might be said: &ldquo;Let the payment be made during the period in which the service will be received.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here there are two points on which I disagree.  First of all, as I have often said here, I have always felt that local government should have its own definition of power and responsibility.  The thing is so complicated now you cannot say where is the responsibility and where it is not.  The Minister gets up and says that generally the Government will give 80 per cent. of the amount to be spent.  That does not interest me much.  I know that when a local body has a chance of having £100 spent immediately in their district, irrespective of the utility of that £100, at a mere cost of £20 to the district, they are all for it.  But what I query is the £20 that is going to be raised.  The local body is empowered to get into a condition of indebtedness <Col N="2501" /> in excess of what they are legally allowed to do now.  They are borrowing at present under their powers for what is called capital expenditure, for the production of something which is locally necessary and good and which will be available to the people over a long period of years, not merely during the period of the production of that necessity.  Here, the purpose of these works is not a thing that is going to be made.  There are too many roads in this country (and this adverts mostly to the making of roads).  We have too many roads because, for many generations before any of us was born, people were making roads in this country, not because roads were necessary, but in order to qualify for the receipt of certain payments out of relief funds. That has been the purpose of it.  Now the local bodies are not only invited, but are going to be forced to get into a further state of indebtedness, not to create something of capital value, but merely to be paying out money weekly to be consumed by the recipients of that money during the week.  In principle the whole thing is completely wrong.  Neither the Government nor the local bodies should borrow in any circumstances except when it is for the creation of an asset either local or national which will remain an asset to the people over a long period of years. Normally, when the Government borrow for such a purpose, they begin paying back the moment they start borrowing, as they estimate in taxation for the payment of sinking fund, and the thing is paid for while it is still available to the people.  In this case, it is merely a dole which is going to be given out.  It is merely a form of charity which is going to be dispensed during the time these people are working. The asset that is going to remain afterwards will be a negligible asset&mdash; a bit of a road here and there when, as I say, this country is already more road-beridden than almost any country in Europe.  We have more roads than much more highly developed countries, and these roads are there merely as a result of relief works.</P>
    <P>The Government is interfering with and imposing upon the local bodies. It is insisting that the local body shall <Col N="2502" /> raise money and get into debt, not on its own decision that such a thing will serve a useful purpose, but on the decision of the Government.  It seems to me to interfere with the autonomy&mdash; if you can call it autonomy&mdash;that is possessed by the local bodies.  It is extending the indebtedness of the local bodies, which is already a problem facing this country; it is demanding that future generations will pay for the wages earned by certain people during this week and the asset that the future generations will receive might be written off as nothing&mdash;an unnecessary road.  Therefore, this whole thing seems to me to be following on a course that we have been pursuing, ever since this State came into existence, if you like, but eminently during the last eight years.  The national indebtedness has increased enormously and the local indebtedness has increased enormously, which means that during that time we have not only been consuming what we have produced but we have been anticipating what is going to be produced by the people who come after us and spending in anticipation of what they are going to produce.  That seems to me to be one of the causes of the economic condition of the world generally.  It is just putting off an evil day and making that day more evil than it otherwise would be.  There is going to be no economic health in this country until the people are told that they have got to live upon what they produce in any 12 months.</P>
    <P>One hears talk about an emergency. If you go all over this country you will see things that were done in 1840, in 1850, 1922, 1926, right through.  We never got out of an emergency and now we say: &ldquo;As there is an endemic emergency here, we will be borrowing money and attributing it to the emergency.&rdquo; You have got to get to the position when you recognise that what you call emergency is just mere normality in this country and being normal you have got to pay to meet the situation out of normal expenditure, that is to say, in any 12 months the people cannot spend more than they produce during that 12 months.</P>
    <P>The content of this clause here is <Col N="2503" /> just another example of an evil course, which has been pursued not merely by this Government but by its predecessor, if you like, to a certain extent, but not to so great an extent, and which is going to face the people of this country later on with a situation in which they will have to recognise that while they will have to pay more taxation they will have to get less for that taxation, and while they will have to work harder they will have to expect a lower standard of living. That is the normal conclusion of the course which is indicated in this clause.  In this case, if the local authority, by any miracle, should in its wisdom and its sense of responsibility say that it does not want to incur this additional debt the Minister can come along and say: &ldquo;Whether you want to incur this additional debt or not, I decide that you have got to do it and if you do not I shall abolish you and your people will incur the responsibility of that debt in any case.&rdquo;  I do not know what happens here but in England in connection with certain resorts where they are trying to get people to live, there, particularly in sea-side places, you will see advertisements telling you of the low rating in that district.  They do that in order to assist in the development of the district by getting new people to come and build houses and live there.  Under those circumstances the local authority is, as you might say, trying to sell its goods to get more people to come and build houses in that desirable locality.</P>
    <P>In this country the constant increase in rates is, to my mind, a definite social evil.  There are many houses in this city on which the ordinary rates which are to be paid, viewed rightly, would be an excessive rent for the house irrespective of the rights of the owner of the land and of the fabric of that house.  That is the situation in this city, which means that you have got to have higher wages, and which has a social effect with enormous ramifications. Take the case I speak of.  I do not know whether there are such places here where the local authority feels that there is an opportunity for <Col N="2504" /> developing by getting people to come and live in those places.  In England you will constantly see advertisements telling you of the low rateage in such places.  The Minister, sitting in his office in Dublin, is presumably going to force local bodies to impose an additional rate for ten or 20 years hence, because that is what is being done when you assent to the addition of debt.  You are condemning the people in ten or 20 years' time to pay additional rates for a service that they are not getting, a service which has been enjoyed, which has been expended and exhausted during our times.  It seems to me that you implement a thoroughly pernicious principle.  I do not think what I am going to say is going to make the Government cease doing it, but I am not going to miss an opportunity of repeating what I have said so often.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse both in the spirit and the letter the very excellent and appropriate remarks on this subject made by Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Baxter.  I have mentioned the matter here before.  I have on a few occasions asked in my own council if there was any limit to the borrowing powers of public bodies and even there I got an evasive answer.  But the borrowing is going on and if my memory serves me right the amount of money borrowed in my council over the past six or seven years stands to-day at the colossal figure of about £1,250,000.  That cannot go on indefinitely.  It is bound to have serious reactions upon the general and rural ratepayer because of his growing incapacity to meet these commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated here, on the occasion of our last meeting, the hardships and the difficulties that have been created in the area administered by my council in an effort on the part of the rate collectors to get the ratepayers to bring in the first moiety of the rates. The second moiety should have been collected in October, and the fact that in many cases the first moiety has not yet been paid will give Senators an idea of the position in the rural districts.  My council budgeted last year to the extent of £90,000 in respect <Col N="2505" /> of roads.  Very essential employment is given in connection with the construction and maintenance of roads and we realise how important it is to give that employment, so that rural workers may be kept working regularly all over the whole county.</P>
    <P>During the last four or five years my council has ceased to consider anything that would come under the category of members' requisitions.  For many years it was the practice to consider motions dealing with essential, imperative and accommodating work for the general ratepayers, such as constructing and maintaining roads, particularly to bog lands.  That type of work can only be done with the consent of the Minister.  For the last five years we have ceased to consider motions of that type.  Under no circumstances would we allow members of the council to submit motions, no matter how important, how urgent, or how accommodating the work might be. What was our reason for prohibiting them?  It was because we realised the growing incapacity of the ratepayers in the rural districts to meet even the normal commitments in the county.</P>
    <P>In order to give the maximum amount of work in the area under our control, we budgeted to the extent of £90,000.  Possibly the Minister may say: &ldquo;Well, Senator Madden, you eulogised the great work that was done by your council when the Seanad last met; you indicated all that had been done under the heading of social services, and all the other great things that you have accomplished.&rdquo;  I may be met with that type of argument, and it may be suggested that we should cease worrying about social services. If expenditure is going to proceed indefinitely on the present colossal scale, we are bound to reach a period when there will be a complete deadlock, and when the people will be unable to pay. The point will be reached when those people who are now asked to find money for home help and the maintenance of various public works will themselves be looking for home help.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing a vicious cycle which has been created by the Department, and which has been pursuing its <Col N="2506" /> course for the last two years.  We budget, let us say, for a sum of £90,000 in respect of roads and at a later meeting of the council a letter is read from the Department, something to this effect: &ldquo;I am instructed by the Minister to inform you that the Department are prepared to give a grant of £10,000 if the county council are willing to extract from the rates a sum of £3,000 or £5,000.&rdquo;  I would like to call the attention of Senators to the wickedness of that type of letter. There is a certain attraction in it for us, because we are told we will get £10,000 if we are prepared to spend £5,000.  A couple of months later we may be offered £15,000 if we are prepared to spend £5,000.  This is altogether apart from the normal commitments in the county.  These attractive sums of £5,000 or £10,000 are added on to the rates.  Last year in my county we had certain calls on the rates representing 2d. or 3d. in the £ and accumulating something like £6,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the attention of the Minister has been drawn to one very important point, the capacity of the local authorities in the matter of borrowing.  If they are allowed to borrow indefinitely, even though on the borrowed money productive work may be done, the cure eventually will be worse than the disease because the ratepayers from whom all this money will be slowly extracted will have reached the point when they will be unable to pay and you will have a complete deadlock in public administration in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite true to say that the work that is now being carried out is work of a non-productive nature.  We all realise the great need of employment that exists in many areas, and how desirable it is that many of our unfortunate brethren, now unemployed, should be engaged in some type of work on the approach of the Christmas season.  It is very desirable that we should provide some type of employment at such a period of the year.  In my experience the work that is carried <Col N="2507" /> out is usually of a substantial and lasting nature.  For instance, very useful work could be done in laying down concrete footpaths, opening up new drains and cleansing and maintaining existing drains.</P>
      <P>There are many works that are quite essential in our towns and villages, but the local authorities find themselves in the position that they have not sufficient funds at their disposal to carry out those works.  In my town concrete paths have been constructed and they will last at least 25 years.  Many valuable works have been done in the country districts under relief schemes. I have in mind the widening of corners where very serious accidents used to occur, where people were killed and great damage done to property.  Those corners would have been widened, I dare say, at some time or other when the money would be available, but it is all the better that they are done under those relief schemes.  I expect the work would have to be done sooner or later by the local authority on its own responsibility or with the assistance of a grant from the Central Funds.  I suppose everybody has to contribute eventually to the carrying out of these works.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that a case has been made out that the money expended will not be in some way productive. I submit that it is money well spent.  I only wish we could get much more money of the same kind and I have no doubt it would be expended with great advantage to the country.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of sound logic in the arguments that have been put forward in favour of this amendment and they are arguments which I would be very much inclined to support on almost any other kind of Bill.  In this instance, however, my difficulty is that we are dealing with measures for the relief of unemployment, and it is growing more and more to be a conviction in my mind that the feeling of the people both here and in other countries is something like this: If you can borrow <i>ad lib;</i> if you can <Col N="2508" /> do everything contrary to all the principles of good finance in order to carry on the war or in order to prepare to defend your country, then, to provide the means by which an ordinary man can just earn enough to provide for himself and his family, it is not good enough to say that you must keep strictly according to the rules.  I think the people are not going to stand for that position very much longer.  If you can find money, as our neighbours are doing, at something like £10,000,000 a day to carry on a war, and if we can find money at the present rate, which we know is very large, I do not think we wisely quote technicalities as a reason for opposing anything that is going to provide for a man the means of earning a livelihood.  For my part, if there is anything which will substitute honest work in the place of doles in order to enable people to live, I would be very chary to criticise it on technicalities, and although I admit the great logic of many of the arguments that have been advanced, I could not support them in order to delay this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have inquired but I have not been able to ascertain the purpose behind the Act of 1878 which provided this restriction on borrowing, namely, twice the net annual rateable value, but the trend from that time down has been to get away from these restrictions.  We had in the Act of 1898 a provision made by which mental hospitals would not be subject to the restriction.  Similarly the Housing Act of 1908, popularly known as the Clancy Act, did not come within this restriction. The Labourers Act 1930 also excluded that restriction.  In 1921, there was passed the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act which is still the law here.  Section 6 of that Act states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any money borrowed by a local authority before the 1st day of April, 1923, if certified by the Minister of Health to have been borrowed for the purpose of any work undertaken by the authority with a view to the provision of employment for unemployed persons and any money borrowed under the provisions of this <Col N="2509" /> Act for the purpose of providing temporarily for current expenses, shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of the local authority for the purposes of any enactment limiting the powers of borrowing by that authority.</P>
    <P>That is exactly similar in its terms to the section of the Bill that is now before the House.</P>
    <P>It is not right, perhaps, to say that we are giving unrestricted powers to borrow because any powers to borrow are subject to sanction and sanction has always depended, not alone upon what might be the potential ability of a local authority to pay but upon the way in which that local authority has been discharging its past or present liabilities.  In that way, the Department can form a very good idea as to the capability of any local authority to discharge any debts that it might incur.  Applications for authority to borrow are examined in the light of the information which the Department has as to the present indebtedness of the local authority.  The Department knows how the local authority has been discharging its debts and it has always been difficult for a local authority to obtain sanction for a loan, if that local authority has been creating difficulties, in other words, if it has been trying to shelve instalments due on loans.</P>
    <P>Senators seem to be alarmed by the amount of money due by local authorities, but let us compare the amount which accrued up to 1932, with the position as it existed up to March, 1939.  You will find that on the 31st March, 1932, the total indebtedness of local authorities including housing, poor law, outdoor relief, etc., was £15,704,780.  Of that sum, £10,008,181 related to housing.  Taking the position on the 31st March, 1939, we find that the total indebtedness of local authorities was £31,468,303.  Of that sum, £24,502,808 was in respect of housing.  If you exclude housing&mdash;and I do not think anybody would object to borrowing for that purpose; I think even Senator Sir John Keane said that it might be justified for reproductive <Col N="2510" /> work&mdash;there is a very small increase in the indebtedness of local authorities in respect of other public works.</P>
    <P>Some mention has been made of the fact that this money is being used for road work.  The position in regard to unemployment and road work is this: As Senator Madden mentioned, the local authority is asked to contribute towards the cost of such works from revenue.  It is very rarely, indeed, that the local authority is able to get sanction for a loan for that purpose.  Local authorities are always asked, when a grant is being made by the central authority, to make a certain contribution from revenue and not from borrowed money.  There may be rare cases where it will be necessary to resort to borrowing, for example, in the case of a big public health scheme.  Anybody will admit that it would be unfair and ridiculous to ask a local authority to provide out of revenue for a big public health scheme such as the Poulaphouca scheme.  You could not ask a local authority such as the Dublin Corporation to provide the moneys required for such a scheme out of revenue.  On the whole, however, it has been a condition, when a local authority gets a grant for unemployment relief works from the central authority, that it shall provide the balance out of revenue, except, as I say, in the case of bigger schemes.  Some of the bigger schemes may have to be included in the list of works to which this Bill will apply.</P>
    <P>This is an emergency measure.  In the present state of affairs the army is not being maintained under peace-time conditions.  In the same way, in dealing here with unemployment in an emergency, you cannot keep to normal procedure.  So far as possible, the policy pursued by the Department has been to ask local authorities to provide for expenditure out of revenue.  That policy will be pursued in future, but, as I say, certain schemes may have to be operated in which it would be unfair and unjust to ask local authorities to provide the money required out of one year's revenue.  I might point out that we are only asking in this section for the re-enactment <Col N="2511" /> of a provision which has been already the law.  The 1921 Act contained a similar provision, and that Act has been in operation since the State was established. It could hardly be construed as applying to this particular Bill, though I do not think it would be stretching things too far to say that it does.  However, we are only asking the Seanad to re-enact a law that has been in existence up to the present time.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement is interesting and noteworthy in that he makes no attempt to deal with the necessity for any limitation on the borrowing powers of local authorities.  We are simply told that we can go on borrowing until something happens.  When the thing reaches breaking point it breaks down, and that is the end of it.  The figures which the Minister gave in respect to increased borrowing were rather interesting, but the test, in my opinion, is the amount of the increase and not the purpose for which the borrowing took place.  I admit that housing is an important service, but can the ratepayers continue a rate of expenditure which is represented by the fact that the amount of money borrowed has been doubled in nine years?  However, there it is.  As far as I can see, this tendency is inevitable with popular Governments.  A popular Government is expected to go on spending and that is the danger.  That danger is implicit in government by universal franchise. The Government, however, has a responsibility; whether it will shoulder it, in view of periodical elections, is another matter.  The Government has a serious responsibility.  It should keep realistically before its eyes the amount which local authorities can afford to spend and insist on their keeping to that figure.  We have all got to do that in our private lives.  We cannot go on gaily spending on borrowed money.  These same canons of conduct do not appear to apply at all to Government expenditure.  We go on and on until something happens. That is the conclusion I have drawn from the Minister's statement.  I do not propose to move the amendment, because I think its effect would be to <Col N="2512" /> wreck the Bill and there would probably have to be further legislation. We, at least, have got a general statement on the question of borrowing by local authorities, which is profoundly disappointing.  That disappointment is reinforced by the comments of the Banking Commission which inquired exhaustively into this whole matter and reported, apparently without any effect, two years ago.</P>

      <P>What profoundly disappoints me is that the people who know all about finance do not seem to be able to tell us how to solve our ordinary problems.  Senator Sir John Keane is under the impression that popular Governments, by which he means, I suppose, democratic Governments, have to spend money.  But, so far as I can read English and other languages, unpopular Governments, that is to say dictatorships, seem to spend far more money.  They seem to spend it steadily and do not seem to reach the breaking point about which we hear so much.  I do not know how it is done.  I am not saying that we ought to do it.  This is not a comprehensive scheme for solving unemployment. It is a number of petty schemes all over the country.  But, such as it is, it does help to solve the matter piecemeal in certain areas, and I would not like to delete anything from the Bill, even this extension of borrowing powers to local authorities, which would tend to stop any solution of the unemployment problem.  There may be a breaking point for the financial situation, but I suggest that there is also a breaking point with regard to the unemployment situation, and it may be worse when it comes.</P>

      <P>When the Second Reading was going through, I raised the question of the acquisition of land and the Minister put me out of court to some extent by stating that land which it was proposed to acquire could be acquired within 14 days after the vesting order was made.  But, good advocate that he is, he did not say how long it would take to make the vesting order.  I suppose I should have raised this matter when the Expiring Laws Bill was going through, as it is possibly germane to some of the Acts we have continued under that Bill.  I find that it would take a very considerable time before land could be acquired under this section.  The Minister is just after telling us that this is an emergency measure.  It is an emergency measure introduced for the relief of unemployment.  If it is proposed to acquire land for the making of roads&mdash;I am afraid to say that, because Senator Fitzgerald may travel on the wrong road and never reach the end of it&mdash;we find that, first, you make a preliminary order.  Then you have to give notice to everybody who has an interest in or right over the land that you propose to acquire.  You have to give notice to everybody having <Col N="2514" /> a mortgage interest in it, such as the Land Commission, or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or an ordinary bank.  If that is resisted, you have, I suppose, to have an inquiry and the report of that inquiry has to go before the Minister.  Then you have the valuation.</P>
      <P>We know how long the compulsory acquisition of land in respect of housing schemes takes.  Sometimes it is one or two years before anything is done.  I wonder if the Minister thinks that anything is going to be done in an expeditious way under this measure.  I am anxious to know if the Minister will lay down a time limit within which this can be done.  I would be satisfied with that.  But I am not satisfied that in this Bill he is carrying out anything that is desirable in an emergency measure.  If, when you propose to acquire land for the improvement of a certain road for the relief of unemployment, all the preliminaries necessary for the acquisition of that land must be completed within two months, that would be something.  But, so far as I can see, it can drag on indefinitely, with interest after interest making objections, an inquiry being held and a report made, valuation, vesting order and all that.  I ask the Minister whether he proposes to put a limit upon the time within which all this must be done?  If not, it is not making any emergency provision to deal with unemployment.</P>

You then make a vesting order and 14 days after that you go into possession.  Suppose there is an appeal to the Minister, it will depend on the Minister how he will deal with it.  Whether he will hold an inquiry or otherwise is another matter which will depend on the regulations he will make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this <Col N="2516" /> Bill is to provide that certain sections of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, which are due to lapse on 6th January, 1941, shall continue in force.  It is concerned only with the contributory provisions of the Act of 1935, in so far as they apply to workers in agriculture.  It does not in any way affect the non-contributory scheme of pensions.</P>
      <P>Under the contributory scheme of pensions established by the Act of 1935, which is the Principal Act, contributory pensions are granted, without any means test, to the widows and orphans of persons who, when they died, were insured persons under the Act and had paid a certain minimum number of contributions.  The normal rate of contribution is 8d. per week for a man and 4d. a week for a woman, the employer paying half the contribution in respect of men and the whole contribution in respect of women.  In return for these contributions, contributory pensions are payable at the rate of 10/- a week for a widow, 5/- a week for the eldest dependent child of a widow, 3/- a week for each other dependent child of a widow and 7/6 a week in respect of each orphan child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was recognised, however, that it would be proper to have regard to the lower level of wages paid to agricultural labourers as compared with other insured persons.  Accordingly, the Principal Act provided that during the five years beginning on the second appointed day, which was the 6th January, 1936, these rates of contribution and benefit should be modified in their application to persons and the widows and orphans of persons engaged in agricultural employment.  Instead of the full contribution of 8d. for a man and 4d. for a woman the contributions for agricultural workers were fixed at 4d. per week for a man, of which half is payable by the employer and 2d. a week for a woman, paid in full by the employer.  This provision is contained in Section 38 (1) (b) and Part II of the Second Schedule of the 1935 Act.  The effect of this provision is to require from persons employed in agriculture only half the rate of contributions applicable to persons engaged in non-agricultural employments.  The contributory <Col N="2517" /> pensions payable in return for these contributions are 8/- a week for a widow, 4/- a week for the eldest dependent child of a widow, 2/6 a week for each other dependent child of a widow and 6/- a week for an orphan child.  These provisions are contained in Sections 10 (2) and 12 (2) of the 1935 Act.  It will be seen that whereas the agricultural rate of contribution is only half that of the non-agricultural rate, the contributory pensions payable to the widows and orphans of insured persons engaged in agriculture are approximately 80 per cent. of those payable to the widows and orphans of other insured workers.</P>
    <P>These reduced rates of contribution and benefit were to remain in force only for a period of five years from 6th January, 1936, and under the law, as it stands at present, the position is that on 6th January next, the full contributions of 8d. and 4d. will be payable in respect of all insured workers, including insured workers in agriculture. On the other hand, the rates of contributory pension now applicable to the widows and orphans of insured persons employed in agriculture will become the rates at present applicable to the widows and orphans of insured persons who were not engaged in agricultural employment.  In other words, if those sections of the 1935 Act, which provide for reduced rates of contribution and contributory pension in respect of agricultural employment, are allowed to lapse, the contributions of insured persons employed in agriculture will be doubled while the corresponding rates of contributory pension will be increased only by one quarter approximately.  The Government is of the opinion that this is not desirable, as experience has shown that the lower rates of contribution and benefit applying in the case of agricultural labourers are justified, and when compared with the normal rates, are favourable to both employers and employees in agriculture.  The Bill now before the House is, therefore, designed to provide that these provisions will not lapse on the 6th January next.  In effect the Bill will merely preserve in the future the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion standing in Senator Baxter's name deals with a problem which has assumed its present interest and importance on account of the war situation, but I think it is only a special aspect of a general problem which is always with us, and part and parcel of what we should consider in framing our general agricultural policy.  In this connection I should like to say that, although not a member of that body myself, I think that it is a thousand pities that the Agricultural Commission has suspended its sittings or has had its organic existence terminated for it, because already it has done valuable and important work and it could continue to add to the services it has already rendered in dealing with problems of this nature and other problems. I think, in fact, however, that there is reason why we should investigate, at the same time, the special problems of our present abnormal situation and the permanent problems which we have to solve in framing a long-term agricultural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as far as I understand the matter, the present crisis with regard to prices has arisen in this way.  It has arisen especially with reference to the prices of oats and barley.  Last year, when the war broke out, everyone anticipated a shortage of cereal products as well as of other forms of foodstuffs, and Government policy rightly urged and, in fact, compelled our farmers to extend the area under cultivation so as to increase as much as possible the quantity of home-grown cereal and other products that would be available as food for man and beast.  Now, last year, owing to the effect of the war <Col N="2520" /> situation the prices of all cereal products rose to a very high level, and at the prices current last season there was no difficulty whatever in inducing farmers to extend their cultivation of oats because oats at that time&mdash;or during the latter period of the season at any rate&mdash;were as high as 13/6 a cwt.</P>
    <P>The price of oats last March was 13/6 per cwt.  With a price like that farmers were certainly more than willing to maintain and expand the cultivation of oats, but I noticed at that time, although the price of oats was rising enormously, the prices of the other things for which oats is used as the raw material had not risen in the same proportion.  Eggs went up in price and also beef, but not in the same proportion as the increase in the price of oats.  The result of that was, owing to the high cost of feed, that poultry keepers in particular found that egg production last winter did not pay, and did not look like paying, and consequently they cut down poultry stocks wholesale.  As a result there were not enough birds and animals in the country to eat up all the available oats at the then existing price.  A good deal of that oats was carried over to the new crop season, and when the new crop came along and was added to the available supply there was still the same problem, of an excess amount of home feeding and an inadequate number of birds to eat it.  The reason for that curious phenomenon was this, that the relation between the price of oats and the price of animal products had got out of proportion.</P>
    <P>We cannot in our agricultural economy carry on with any degree of comfort unless there is a suitable price regulation between the various aspects of our agricultural cultivation, so that the price of oats is reasonably profitable for a man who specialises in oats while, at the same time, the man who specialises in animal products will find that it will be profitable for him, even if he has to buy oats from his neighbour.  The price was dislocated by the unexpected events of last winter, and oats fell to a level which was not profitable from the point of view of the oats producer.  As an egg <Col N="2521" /> producer in a small way, I regard the present ridiculously low price of oats as something that I feel will be of temporary duration, because, owing to the unprofitable level of the price of oats to producers, I fear the danger that, in the next season, farmers will not be so enthusiastic about producing oats and, in spite of compulsory tillage, there may be a shortage then, following the temporary glut of this season and that then will come the turn of poultry producers to feel the effects. At the moment the position is favourable to them and unfavourable to oats producers.  I want a situation in which every branch of our agricultural production will know that they are on an even keel, so to speak.</P>
    <P>In the nature of the case, and in the circumstances of our agriculture, about 70 per cent. of the oats produced in Éire is not consumed directly as human food, but is used indirectly on further agricultural production, and finally goes to market and is exchanged for money in the form of eggs and beef or some form of animal product, so that oats, generally speaking, is not a commercial crop.  It is a crop which, from the point of view of our agricultural economy, is produced as raw material for producing other things.  That makes it practically impossible to fix a price for oats in the same kind of way as the Government, as we saw, successfully fixed a price for wheat, because so much of the oat crop is not sold at all as oats but walks off the farm on four legs or in the form of eggs.  However, the fact remains that, in any kind of normal circumstances, in the long run the price of oats is governed by the price of the products for which oats is used as raw material.  Eggs are one of the products and beef is another, because I understand that crushed oats are an important element in the ration in the now lost art of stall feeding fat cattle.</P>
    <P>I had the curiosity to work out the proportionate relation between the price of oats and beef for the last 60 years, bearing in mind that it takes about 4 cwt. of a cereal product, of which oats forms an important ingredient, to produce 1 cwt. of beef <Col N="2522" /> live-weight, I compared the annual average price of 4 cwt. of oats and beef by 1 cwt. live-weight, and I found in the normal year that the price that 4 cwt. of oats bore to the annual average price of 1 cwt. of beef was remarkably close to 70 per cent.  The variation was from 70 to 75 per cent. and was very slight.  In other words, with the price of 4 cwt. of oats in or about 70 per cent. of the price of 1 cwt. of beef live-weight, then our economy is on an even keel, and it pays to use oats as feed for the stall feeding of live stock.  That proportion means that if 4 cwt. of oats cost 32/-, with beef at 45/- per cwt. it should pay to stall feed.  If the price of oats rises more than the proportionate price of beef, then the proportion is increased above the 75 per cent. level, and the stall feeding of cattle will be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Actually our oat crop year by year is only a matter of about 12,000,000 cwt. and tends to diminish, although in the present season, on account of the expansion of our oat crop it has increased in a gratifying way.  There are nearly 20,000,000 poultry in the country, and according to the books a hen, if let, will consume about 1 cwt. of cereal products in a year, and about half of that may well be native oats, or if our hens got all the oats they would like to get, they would go far towards using our whole oat crop. Personally I do not believe they get anything like the amount of oats they would like to get, or that they should get, but if our poultry population was properly fed I do not think this glut of oats would be so much in evidence and we might find that we have not half enough of oats, instead of having too much.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the diminution in the population of poultry has undoubtedly diminished the demands for the oats that are available, and has made it impossible for farmers who specialise in producing oats to realise those oats at a profitable price.  The fundamental trouble, which accounts for our failure to use up the oat crop of last year and from which arose our difficulty in using up the oat crop this year, is the fact that the stall feeding <Col N="2523" /> of beasts has been discontinued now for many years and has not been revived to anything like the extent that is desirable in the long-term interest of our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>Reverting to that proportional thesis, I pointed out that, with 4 cwt. of grain about 75 per cent. of the price of 1 cwt. of beef live-weight, stall feeding was a profitable practice.  For a number of years, however, during which the so-called economic war raged, that proportion was raised from about 75 per cent. to about 120 per cent., and no farmer was going to be fool enough to feed 3d. worth of grain in order to produce 2d. worth of beef.  Now, on account of the very special circumstances that existed during this year, with stall feeding out of fashion&mdash;and it is not being revived&mdash;at the price relation between beef last winter and oats last winter, it was not profitable to stall feed.  Oats were too dear and beef was too cheap.  At the present relation between the price of beef and the price of oats, it would appear to me&mdash;looking at it as a mere matter of theory&mdash;that it ought to be profitable once more to revert to the practice of stall feeding.</P>
    <P>However, there again we are up against another difficulty, and this time a difficulty not of our own creation but created for us by our neighbours.  The British differentiate between the price they pay for beef which has been reared and fattened in their own country and beef which has been produced in this country, sold to them as stores, and only finished in their country.  The position is that they give a pretty large differential price for beef which is altogether of their own production and a price which is about 10/- per cwt. less for beef which they import from us and kill immediately after importation.  In practice, what happens is that our cattle go out, perhaps nominally as fat cattle, but after three months' stay in Northern Ireland or Great Britain they qualify for a lesser degree of subsidy, which adds about 5/- or 7/6 a cwt. to the price, as compared with the <Col N="2524" /> price if they did not get that subsidy. The effect of that three months' rule is that, from the point of view of a person selling a forward store in this country which would be ready for slaughter in March, if he kept it here and stall fed it during the winter, and sold it in March, he would only get the beef price for imported beef fit for slaughter which is, as I say, some 7/6 or thereabouts less than is otherwise obtainable.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if he sells it in January to somebody who keeps it for three months in the other country, that person can look forward to getting a differential price after three months, and the result is that the man selling the beast in January may look forward to getting a price nearly as high as if he kept it for three months more.  During that final three months' interval, the animal will lose as much in the price per cwt. as it will gain in the net weight, and, consequently, the final three months, in the case of the fat beast, is not considered profitable for our farmers, and therefore stall feeding is not practised here to anything like the extent to which it should be.  This differential price, which has put stall feeding out of the question for our farmers, is a price imposed by the British in their own supposed interests. They ought to be the best judge of their own interests, though&mdash;looking at it as an impartial outsider&mdash;I say that it should be in their interests now that we should feed and fatten as many cattle as possible during this coming winter, and sell them only when fit for slaughter.</P>
    <P>By imposing this differential price, they compel us to unload on them in January cattle which would be better if kept until later.  If we could get the British to alter that three months' rule to, say, one month, it would make the stall feeding of fat cattle profitable once more.  Then, far from having a glut of oats and selling it at a rotten price, we would find that there would be hardly enough oats in the country to meet the increased demand.  That is the primary and most important way in which we can use our oat crop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the <Col N="2525" /> main concern of Senator Baxter, and of the Senators who support this motion, is to obtain some form of a guarantee from the Minister that the people who are compelled to till their land will be assured of a market for their crops, a return for their outlay, and a living wage for their labour.  Senator Baxter is neither very sure nor very keen about the minimum price for oats, barley, and other crops.  He sees a difficulty in obtaining that minimum price, and a difficulty for the Minister in giving it.  Senator Baxter has proposed another remedy&mdash;one which, to my mind, is very much more feasible than that of guaranteeing a minimum price for oats and agricultural crops: he suggests that there be a guaranteed price for the finished article to which those crops are fed.</P>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with that statement and that policy advocated by Senator Baxter.  It is one which has been advocated by every responsible agricultural representative for many years.  It is the policy advocated by the Minister's predecessor, the late Mr. Hogan.  Mr. Hogan had very little regard for the farmer who grew oats as a cash crop, or any sort of grain as a cash crop, but he had an extraordinary veneration and admiration for the farmer who grew corn and other crops and&mdash;as he put it, and as Senator Johnston put it now&mdash;&ldquo;walked it off the land&rdquo;.  That is the policy which would meet the ideas of Senator Baxter and other Senators who believe in the principle of the motion.  The Minister should consider doing something regarding that policy, as it would be in the interests of the country, it would continue the fertility of the land, it would create employment and would help to keep us with a favourable trade balance, besides meeting the wishes of Senator Baxter and the others by creating a market for our surplus crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of which Senator Johnston speaks&mdash;that of &ldquo;walking the produce off the land&rdquo;&mdash;is as sound to-day as at any time when it was advocated.  Senator Johnston spoke of stall feeding.  I am afraid we will have very little of it this year.  The cattle <Col N="2526" /> which we would buy for stall feeding, or which we have at the moment, are worth more for export, to be stall fed in England, than if kept here to be stall fed and later exported as beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have controlled prices in England, and quite a different price for Irish-fed cattle.  At the moment, it represents a difference of 6/- or 7/- a cwt.  So far as the price of beef in England is concerned, the increase in the controlled price there between now and the 1st February next will be very small&mdash;only about 5/- a cwt.  At the present time, forward stores here, suitable for stall feeding in England, are making from 48/- to 50/- per cwt.  If we were to keep them and stall feed them, we could not expect to get much more than that for them before next March.  It would be very foolish, therefore, for our farmers to keep them.  They are suffering enough as it is, and surely they are not so foolish as to keep cattle in these circumstances.  They are not going to use up their feeding stuffs stall feeding, in view of the fact that they are not likely to get more for the cattle, as beef, than they are able to get for them to-day as forward stores.  The only thing extra they would have from the stall-feeding is the manure.  The Minister will not allow oats or straw to be exported despite the fact that oats is worth about twice as much in England as it is here.  In England, at the moment, they are paying £4 10s. a ton for straw, while in this country straw is unsaleable.  I agree that the Minister is justified in stopping the export of anything that we want for our own use.  At the same time, he should see that our producers are given a profitable price for anything they have to sell and are not allowed to export.  If the Minister compels people to keep stuff in the country, then I say the farmers should not be the only sufferers so far as that kind of transaction is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, straw is selling at a very good price in England.  I understand that it is being used for making paper.  I think that our Minister for <Col N="2527" /> Industry and Commerce should suggest to some of our paper manufacturers that the surplus we have here should be used for the manufacture of paper. We must be importing a lot of pulp for the manufacture of paper.  If they are able to convert straw into paper in England, why cannot the same be done here?  The Minister has suggested the cutting down of production in the case of a few commodities.  I think that policy is entirely wrong.  I strongly advocate increased production, even of pigs.  I think we should go in for all the agricultural production we can.  We may need it all in a short time.  In the course of a few years it may be the only thing we shall have to barter for the imports we need.  If the Government compel farmers to till their land in the interests of the nation, it is only simple justice that they should guarantee to the farmers a fair return for their outlay and labour.  We all realise it may not be feasible to give a minimum price for oats, and for other agricultural produce, such as roots, which are all consumed on the land. All that could be met by the policy advocated by Senator Baxter, namely, a guaranteed price for whatever is produced on the land.  If the Minister were to do that he would be meeting the situation, and would, I believe, be doing a good service to the country.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Seanad passed a motion dealing with the question of credit for farmers.  The Minister, I think, undertook, when that motion was passed, to have the question it dealt with investigated by the Agricultural Commission.  Senator Baxter, who is a member of that commission, says that the motion never got there. In view of the promise given by the Minister, I would like to know why the Agricultural Commission did not consider the question.  I think it is the lack of credit that is keeping many farmers from going in for the stall feeding of cattle this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree altogether with the proposal to have fixed minimum prices for food produced on the land.  I think it is true to say that over 60 per cent. of our farmers have only 30 acres or much less.  They <Col N="2528" /> are prepared to use all the food they produce and, consequently, a fixed minimum price would be of no use to them.  Fixed minimum prices for food are of no use if you have none to sell. I am rather inclined to stress on the Minister the advisability of having fixed minimum prices for three items of food that are raised on the land, namely, eggs, butter and pork.  We all know that from the month of February to about the end of June we always have a surplus amount of eggs.  Prices during that period are at their lowest. It is all very well to say that, at the moment, eggs are selling at 2/9 and 3/- a dozen, but in view of the fact that there are no eggs, or at least very few, in the country, the number of people who will benefit from these prices will be very small.  There is a difference of 9d. per dozen in the price paid to producers for eggs in the Six Counties and the price paid here.  The women, who are chiefly concerned in the production of eggs and poultry, feel, in view of that difference, that it is useless to be feeding fowl for egg production. If the women were encouraged, by having a fixed price for eggs, there is no doubt but that home-grown corn would be fed to the fowl, that a considerable amount of it would be consumed and that our egg production could become profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of butter, I think it will be admitted that the Minister did everything possible last year to level prices.  On a recent occasion here, the Minister referred to the decrease that had taken place since 1939, in the case of our milk supply.  He attributed it to two or three causes.  There is one cause I would like to refer to, and I believe we will suffer very much more from it in 1941 than we are suffering at the moment: that is, the prices now being offered for springers and in-calf heifers.  At the moment, the ordinary farmer with four or five cows is being offered anything from £40 to £45 for cows up to ten years of age.  In view of the fact that he has not got a great amount of capital to draw on, he is tempted to sell that cow.  That cow is exported to the Six Counties or to Britain, and that is the last of the cow <Col N="2529" /> so far as he is concerned and the last of a good cow so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>The same applies to in-calf heifers. They are being sold off, not because the farmers wish to sell them, but because the fancy price is available and they want money, and as bad as we felt in 1939, I fear that, in 1941, milk production will decrease to a greater extent than in 1939.  There are two alternatives.  One is to prohibit the export of in-calf heifers and cows under ten years old&mdash;personally, I would not be in favour of that because I feel it would be a rather drastic measure&mdash; and the other, which I would recommend, is to fix a price which will encourage the farmer to keep a good cow and, from September to May, to guarantee a price for his milk or butter.  If he sees that there is a prospect of making something, he will keep the good herd.  It will be to his interest, as well as providing an asset for the State.</P>
    <P>The third matter to which I wish to refer is pork.  Surely no sane person would think that anybody could raise pork at the moment at a price of 88/- per cwt. for first-grade quality.  This time 12 months, young sucking pigs, or bonhams, as they are called in other districts, were realising 50/- each.  At the last fair at Cavan this year, they were sold at 25/- each.  A pig will be doing very well if it weighs 1½ cwt. after four months' feeding.  There is no hope of getting imported feeding stuff like Indian meal, and the farmer has to feed his stock on stuff raised on his own farm and, taking into consideration the fact that his labour is free, such a man is producing pork at a loss.  I do not want to go into details as to how that could be remedied, but I have no hesitation in saying that the price which the bacon curers charge the retailer or merchant is one which should call for special comment.  I have seen some of the invoices of decent, respectable merchants.  They show that the price charged to the consumer was reasonable, but that the price charged by the bacon curers was unreasonable and represented even far more than double what the producer <Col N="2530" /> got for the pork he raised on his farm.</P>
    <P>That is a well-known fact, and that position should be remedied immediately. The consumers think that the farmers are getting an enormous amount, in view of what they pay for bacon, but that is not the position. They are paying for profits which they should not be paying.  These are three matters which, if the Minister considered them, I feel would result in 85 per cent. of the stuff produced on the farms being consumed on the farms, leaving very little for sale.  I hope that when the Minister is making his New Year good resolutions, it will be one of his good resolutions to consider these matters and to give all the assistance he can to the type of farmer I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the House for not having carried on the debate as, having moved the adjournment on the previous day, I should have, but I did not expect the debate to be resumed so early.  In principle, I am altogether in favour of the motion.  I have been advocating fixed prices and arguing in favour of them for a very long time, but in that period, I also began to realise that I was up against some very big obstacles.  I entirely agree with Senator Baxter in his statement that all of us who are engaged in agriculture are put in a false position compared with the rest of the community.  Most of our charges are fixed and in every shop we have to pay the price demanded from us, but in respect of nearly all the things we have to sell&mdash;there are some exceptions now&mdash;we very often have to take what we are offered, and not only that, but we have to spend time haggling and bargaining with dealers, middlemen and all kinds of people in an effort, very often unsuccessful, to get anything near the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I could see any possibility of carrying these proposals out, I would be altogether in favour of the motion, but I see very big difficulties in the way.  We have fixed prices at the moment for wheat, for beet, and, to an extent, for milk, and I am quite satisfied from what I know of the Minister <Col N="2531" /> that he would extend that principle much farther if he saw any possibility of success, but we have this big problem: What are we going to do with all the corn, outside wheat, and with the roots?  Senator Baxter, on the previous day, admitted that difficulty. We have also the problem, when dealing with the corn crop, to which Senator Quirke pointed, that is, the development of machinery on the farm.  That development has taken place to such an extent that I notice that the man with less than 20 acres is now employing hired tractors like the people with farms of over £200 valuation. In my young days my business often brought me to the hay-market in Smithfield, and I remember seeing hundreds of horses drawing out loads of hay, but the other day I found that it was all being done by lorries.  The horse was the greatest consumer of oats we had, and he is fast disappearing from the farm.</P>
    <P>The only market for oats at the moment is in what Senator Baxter has stated and what the Minister has advocated, the feeding of cattle, but how far that is going to bring us, I am not quite sure.  There are a number of people in the counties with which I am acquainted, who, for one reason or another, are unable to grow wheat, who even probably find it difficult to grow barley, and who cannot grow beet, for the reason that they have no beet factories near them.  These people grow oats every year, and mainly as a cash crop, because they want money at certain periods to pay rents and taxes.  The solution suggested that we could get over that difficulty by feeding does not altogether meet the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not see how we are going to do it, although we were told by Senator Counihan and others that we would get a better price, and I think Senator Baxter suggested that we should give a subsidy on the export of cattle and bacon.  But there is a very big problem there.  There is a certain amount of oats being bought for the manufacture of oaten meal and oats is even being put into mixtures for cattle, but the price we are getting is not adequate. <Col N="2532" /> It is suggested that the Minister should fix a price there.  Could there be a fixed price for all the feeders and dealers who are going to fatten cattle?  Are they prepared to pay a fixed price or a decent price?  I am not quite certain that we can get over that problem by the means suggested. It would be all right for the man who dealt largely in cattle, who tilled and fed with his own oats.  He could proably make a profit on the transaction but it is very doubtful if it would help the vast majority of the people, and I cannot see how we are to get over that problem.  If we could deal with it as we have dealt with wheat and beet, where we had a home market sufficient to consume all we produced, it would be workable.  Even in the case of milk, we might be able to do more but it would be very difficult.  Despite all Senator Counihan says about greater production, I am not in agreement with him.  In the case of many things, if you produce too much, you will make it impossible for the farmer to get the price he should get or the price fixed for him.  The problem is: What are we to do with the large amount of oats we have?  How are we to get a fixed price for the barley not used for malting or for our root crops? It is easy to say that you can feed stock.  I agree that you can and I think that the Minister is right in seeing that nothing is exported this year. I do not think he would be justified in doing otherwise and nobody would recommend him to do so.  But I do not know how the motion is to be given effect and I have not heard from any of its supporters how it is to be done. I should be anxious that the Minister and the Department would give it consideration because I believe we cannot get farming on a proper footing or provide a living for the farmer until some means is found of letting him know what he will get at the end of the year.  The difficulty is that he is engaged in a gamble against drought and rain and other conditions.  When he puts in a crop he does not know how much he will get when he takes it out. Nobody is more keen than I that some solution should be found but I cannot see the solution at the moment. The Minister, or some Senator, may <Col N="2533" /> have some solution up his sleeve but I do not know what it is.  It is easy to say that a subsidy should be given to the farmers but that is a very big problem because we do not know what price we will get in the external market and there are big difficulties in reaching that market.  I am not satisfied that that would solve the problem either.  While I should be very anxious to see Senator Baxter's idea carried into effect, I do not know how it is to be done and I cannot see that the adoption of this motion would get us any farther.</P>

      <P>This problem of agriculture which, like the poor, is always with us, seems always to induce people to propose solutions in the nature of confiscation of the land or of State ownership of everything.  Senator Byrne seemed to me to suggest that there could be no hope for agriculture or no prospect before the farmers unless a situation could be created in which the farmer had a guarantee that at the end of the year he would become possessed of a certain fixed sum of money.  I think that, if there is no hope for farming except on those terms, we might say there is no hope for farming, because the very basis of farming, in which man cooperates with nature, means that he is indulging in a certain amount of gambling.  Nature itself is more propitious in one year than another, and it is the natural order of things that the farmers should be better off as a result of one year's labour than another.  Nevertheless, the farmer does, to my mind, suffer from very considerable injustice as things are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may remember that, some months ago when we had before us here a Bill dealing with conditions of employment and statutory holidays for <Col N="2536" /> workers, there had always to be clauses stipulating that those rules would not apply to people who were working on the land, because it is possible, one might say, to rationalise and to control industrial production in a way that you cannot do with agriculture. You can order that boot-factory workers shall work only seven or eight hours a day, that they shall have a fortnight's holiday in the year, a half-day off every Wednesday, Sundays free, and so on.  The manufacturer of boots then works out the production of boots that will result from such a number of hours, working so many days, and decides that as his wages amount to so much and his cost of raw material comes to so much he will charge the public such a price for those boots, ensuring that he will get a fair profit out of it.  In the case of the farmer, there are two things interfering. The boot manufacturer, if he has produced too many boots, closes down the factory and says: &ldquo;I will not open until 5th November next, because we have such a stock of boots already that if we unloaded them on the market the price of boots would diminish to a figure which would leave us a loss rather than a profit.&rdquo;  But the farmer cannot say to the grass: &ldquo;Stop growing now, but get going at full speed on 5th November next.&rdquo;  He has to co-operate with nature, and nature dictates his operations.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty for the farmer is that, except where he is producing goods for home consumption, the price of which is controlled by the imposition of high tariffs, he has to compete in a world market.  He cannot say: &ldquo;My land has been less fruitful this year than last year, so I must charge more in order to get a fair profit.&rdquo; Except in the case of tariffed articles he has to accept the price, both for internal and external consumption, that is dictated by world conditions and not by his own will.</P>
    <P>The proposal which is always put up to solve the agricultural difficulty is, as I say, the State guaranteeing everything and the State taking everything over.  I remember some months ago when our Labour colleagues here were <Col N="2537" /> proposing a system which seemed most carefully worked out to pretend that the right of ownership remained, but which in effect demolished it altogether. It was something like this, that the State should give the farmer the land, should provide him with his seeds, should arrange what he should grow, market what he grew, and give him a fixed price.  The farmer was to have no say in the manner in which he was to utilise his land, and have no say as to what use he was to make of the produce of that land.  That was a complete elimination of the dual aspect of ownership.  With regard to this motion which is before us, it begins with the phrase: &ldquo;While recognising that compulsory powers are essential to the Government in the present emergency...&rdquo;  I do not know whether or not they are essential to the Government in the present emergency. If the Agricultural Commission which was set up a few years ago had gone into this whole question and had said that it was nationally necessary that a certain proportion of the land be devoted to tillage, and that that could only be done by the exercise of coercive powers by the Government, one might say: &ldquo;They presumably have examined the case.  We must assume that that decision is based upon sound evidence, and accept it, coming from that quarter.&rdquo;  I believe as a matter of fact that the Agricultural Commission set up by the Government some years ago&mdash;I am speaking subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;has just ceased to function; that they have just suspended their operations, whether permanently or not I do not know.</P>
    <P>In this country the various activities of a farmer are all correlated.  When the Government some years ago, when there was no war in existence at all, decided that they wanted the farmer to grow wheat, they took the method of offering subsidies.  It worked out rather unfairly for a great number of farmers, because a great number of farmers were not able to grow wheat at all.  When there was talk about injustice to the farmers, the Government always stated the amount that it was paying in subsidies.  Now, that applied <Col N="2538" /> only to certain farmers.  The fact that a certain amount of money was given in subsidies does not mean that the equities were met.  The man who before the Government interfered was producing a beast&mdash;I am not being exact in my figures&mdash;and as a result of certain expenditure, certain labour, certain capital and so on, was able to make £6, could be switched on to another work; for instance, they were put on to growing wheat and beet, and a certain subsidy was given.  If, instead of that, the Government had told them to grow tea&mdash;it could have been done; they could have put up glass and so on&mdash;and had given them some subsidy, accepting the subsidy the farmers may have been at a disastrous loss. Therefore, the mere giving of money in the way of subsidy to force the farmers to switch from one form of production to another does not necessarily mean that the farmer is getting justice by receiving that money.  The ordinary system of farming in this country has been mixed farming.  It was generally agreed by those who had the best intelligence and the most experience of conditions in this country that it was the most fruitful form of production for farmers here.  When the Government offered a subsidy for the growing of wheat, the man whose farm was situated in a place which was comparatively suitable for the production of wheat, could sit down and say: &ldquo;I will work out whether or not it will pay me if I devote so much of my time and so much of my land to the growing of wheat, and get such a benefit given to me generously by the Government and taken by them out of the unfortunate consumers' pockets&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now we have this system whereby with regard to wheat the subsidy still remains, but there are also compulsory powers taken by the Government so that the farmer no longer sits down and says: &ldquo;Will it be worth my while to grow wheat and receive that subsidy or would it better serve the wellbeing of my family if I did not grow wheat and did not bother about the subsidy?&rdquo;  The Government takes powers to dictate to the farmer how he shall use his land and supports its action by all the sanctions that the <Col N="2539" /> Government has power to enforce against him.  In farming, you cannot segregate one item from another.  You cannot say: &ldquo;Put so much of your land under wheat and carry on otherwise as you are doing,&rdquo; because the whole thing is a unit and one thing fits in with another.  Therefore, when the Government says to the farmer: &ldquo;In view of an emergency, your personal interest must be subordinated to the social good,&rdquo; it is ordering that the farmer shall order his life, not as his judgment indicates to him as best for himself and his family, but that that interest must be subordinated to the social good.  When the Government does that there is a corollary to it.  If the farmer's action is to be dictated by the social authority with a view to the social good, then that authority must recognise that it is bound to him in other ways as well. If the Government here said to the boot factories: &ldquo;You have got to manufacture something else; one-fifth of your production must be women's hats,&rdquo; or something or other like that, you would have all the manufacturers saying: &ldquo;As our machinery and all the rest of it is going to be put out, as our whole economy is going to be upset by this proposal, then you must make such arrangements as will guarantee to us that as a result of a year's labouring we will have received a fitting reward for our labour and for the expenditure of our capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government, by this action&mdash;and it is justifiable in a time of war though that does not necessarily make it justifiable at all times&mdash;is interfering with the farmer's economy.  It just happens that this comes after the previous interference we had before the war.  It does seem to me that if the Government can make a claim on the farmer, the farmer can make a claim on the Government, and that is not merely met by saying: &ldquo;Segregate certain things; devote a certain portion of your land to wheat and we will give you a subsidy&rdquo;.  It seems to me that in a large part of the country it is no good trying to grow wheat.  You can grow things such as oats and barley. When the Government says, &ldquo;You <Col N="2540" /> must give up such a percentage to tillage&rdquo;, the Government immediately is bound to guarantee to the men who give their land and labour to that form of production a fair return for the use of their land and labour.  That is quite clear.  But also, as the whole economy of farming fits in together like a jigsaw puzzle, it does seem to me that the Government, when it is interfering with the rights of the farmer for the social good should interfere with the social good and should take from the whole of society sufficient to make the farmer's labour remunerative to him. That seems to me to be just ordinary justice.</P>
    <P>What I am a bit afraid of in a case of a motion like this is&mdash;I noticed it, I think, with regard to Senator Douglas, who spoke a while ago&mdash;that people are always looking round and saying: &ldquo;If this can be done now, therefore it or something analogous can always be done&rdquo;.  Senator Douglas said that inasmuch as people are able to produce £10,000,000 a day for the purpose of pursuing a war, nobody is going to tolerate that there will be unemployment just because money cannot be produced to give men wages for non-productive labour.  That does not follow at all.  I pointed out earlier that if you go around this country you will see obelisks and all sorts of works that were done to give people an excuse for drawing wages for doing useless work.  And that is not during the last few years.  That goes back. You will see some nineteenth century productions and some eighteenth century productions.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred to the fact that the British Government are spending £10,000,000 a day.  They are presumably spending that now but if this war was going to be as permanent and as endemic as unemployment and the need of relief schemes are in this country, then the British Government could just as well stop it to-morrow, because they are spending £10,000,000 a day on the assumption that that is an abnormal situation and is only going to last for a certain maximum or minimum time.  If anybody said to the British people, &ldquo;You have got to carry <Col N="2541" /> on producing £10,000,000 a day for war purposes for the rest of the life of this generation and the generation after it,&rdquo; it would be obvious to everybody that it could not possibly be done.  A man on his birthday or at Christmas can disport himself with turkey and wine and all the rest of it.  You could say to him, &ldquo;If you can have turkey and wines and all the things that people associate with Christmas on Christmas Day why cannot you have it every day in the year?&rdquo;  He says, &ldquo;Well, Christmas comes but once a year.&rdquo;  We might say roughly it is the same attitude with regard to war.  You can afford to spend £10,000,000 for a certain number of days but you cannot afford to map out a policy which commits you to spending £10,000,000 a day for the whole of the future.  In the same way with regard to this resolution that is before us.  At the present moment the Government, in view of an abnormal situation, is taking what we must regard as abnormal action in interfering with a natural right of ownership that the farmer has in his land and taking from him one aspect of ownership, namely, the right to decide what use that land will be put to. It is doing that, as I say, under abnormal circumstances.  A corollary to that is that if the Government takes the power it must also take the responsibility of seeing that the farmer will get an equitable return for the use of his land and for his labour.  If we say the Government has the right to interfere, the Government therefore has the duty of making this other arrangement to see that the farmer does not lose by it.  If it is done for the whole of society, then the whole of society must be responsible.</P>
    <P>Senator Byrne is aspiring to a condition of things in which the farmer will have a guarantee from the Government for ever, as it were; that at the end of each year he is going to draw a fixed salary, possibly with a cost-of-living bonus, just like a civil servant.  That is to say, that the farmer, the one charm of whose life is an element of freedom, the knowledge that he is his own master, is going to be caught up in this appalling, crushing machine of the State by being guaranteed at the end of the year that <Col N="2542" /> he will draw so much money and he is going to have shelter and food and clothing and the rest of it, just as if he was living in a totalitarian or communist State.  I do not like that.</P>
    <P>I am afraid of this proposal, because of the tendency to think that what we have in normal times should be suitable as a general rule.  As the Government has taken this power to say to the farmer that he will have to alter his economy in order to suit the Government's purpose, then the Government has a responsibility towards the farmer which is not met by a mere guaranteed price in relation to beet or wheat.  As long as you are going to have the Government in the irresponsible position where the members of it can say: &ldquo;We want wheat and we will force you to produce it, but so far as the rest is concerned we will wash our hands out of it,&rdquo; you will have continual aggression by reason of the Government interfering with men and the ordering of their own lives.</P>
    <P>I know it is popular.  The farmers want the Government to give them Civil Service conditions and the Labour Party want it; everybody is asking for it.  On the other hand, we get annoyed when the warble fly inspectors come in and forms have to be filled up.  If the Government interferes with the farmer, the Government must guarantee certain things to the farmer. If the farmer wants independence, then he must not ask too much from the Government.</P>
    <P>Both sides have to recognise the equity of the position.  When the Government takes abnormal powers, the farmer has a right to claim abnormal conditions from the Government. When a man has to order his life, not as he thinks, but as the Government decides will best serve the interests of the people, then that man has a claim on the Government and on the nation. If we accept the first part of Deputy Baxter's motion, which the Government obviously accepts, as it implements it, then the conclusion he draws from that must be accepted by all of us.</P>

      <P>It might be more convenient if I were to deal with the points raised in the course of to-day's <Col N="2543" /> debate before going back to the speech made by Senator Baxter when he was moving the motion.  There seems to be an opinion among some Senators that we are experiencing some difficulty in disposing of the oat crop.  For instance, Senator Johnston based his speech more or less on the assumption that the farmers cannot dispose of their oat crop.  About a fortnight ago the maize millers' combine advertised for oats and barley and they got no response. They offered what would be considered a fairly good price, but they got no oats or barley.  That is fairly good proof that there is little oats or barley in the country.  Possibly they might get some oats or barley if they offered more money, but I do not think they will.</P>
      <P>This debate has been carried on in the greatest spirit of unreality, because there is no difficulty whatever about disposing of oats and barley.  I should like Senators to remember those words about the end of February next, because I feel quite sure that at that time Senator Counihan, Senator Baxter and others will be supporting a motion to know how they are going to feed their poultry, pigs and other live stock when there are few feeding stuffs available.  No justification exists at the moment for the statement that the farmer cannot dispose of his oats and barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be, but I am afraid they are not holding up enough. The position is that there will be a great scarcity of feeding stuffs for the next six or nine months, until our next harvest comes in.  During that time the farmer who has oats and barley on <Col N="2544" /> hands to get rid of will have no difficulty in disposing of them.  I only hope that we will not have the complaint next February or March that there are no feeding stuffs and, above all, that we will not have the type of complaint that we had during the economic war, that the chickens and small pigs were dying because the farmers could not get maize meal. They will not get maize meal.  Senator Johnston put forward an argument that a child could understand&mdash;if it takes 3d. worth of oats to produce 2d. worth of beef, the farmer will go out of the production of beef.  At the present time 2d. worth of oats will give you 3d. worth of beef.  When you have the reverse position, it is not quite so simple, apparently, to Senator Johnston's mind.</P>

      <P>Possibly it did.  I agree with Senator Counihan that the best type of farmer is the man who grows and uses his own crops.  There are two other types of farmer.  One&mdash;the second worst, if you like&mdash;is the man who grows crops and sells them to someone else.  The worst type of farmer is the one who does not grow crops at all.  We have to keep all these things in mind when we are discussing this motion.  Senator Counihan talked about allowing oats out of the country.  If Senators had any <Col N="2545" /> realisation of the present position&mdash; perhaps they have not, but we have tried to give warnings as much as we could about the position of feeding stuffs&mdash;they would not advocate the export&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever Senator Baxter may have had in mind&mdash;I admit he did not dwell so much on that aspect&mdash; other Senators did talk about the sale of oats and barley.  As a matter of fact, Senator Fitzgerald put forward the plea that if we compel the farmer to use his land in a certain way, we ought to compensate him for any crops he might grow on it.  Probably it would <Col N="2546" /> be a good thing, if, as Senator McCabe said, we had a fixed price for butter, eggs and pork, but we cannot fix the price 12 months hence.  We have made an attempt to stabilise the price of our products.  I admit the price is far too low.  We made an attempt to stabilise the price of pigs, and in the case of eggs we have let eggs take their course on the export price since the war commenced. Before that we were trying to stabilise the price of eggs also.  Whilst I have no intention of saying that the bacon curers may not be making a very comfortable profit, I think we should not fall into the error of exaggerating these things unduly.  I do not believe that any curer gets twice as much for bacon as he pays for pork.  The present price for pork is 88/-.  It must be remembered that there is about 25 per cent. reduction in weight in converting pork into bacon.  Then there is the question of the raw materials used, so that the bacon curer would have to get about 88/- plus one-third of 88/-, that is about 117/-, for his bacon to enable him to pay his way.  I think that at the present time you will get bacon at the bacon factory at 117/- per cwt. if it is unsmoked.  If it is smoked, there is another 10/- added to the price, because of the extra labour involved and of the other materials which have to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fizgerald discussed the question of the compulsory powers used by the Government in a very academic way.  It is interesting, I know, to talk in a theoretical way about these things but we are up against a certain situation.  We have made an Order for the coming year requiring every farmer to till one-sixth of his arable land.  In view of the supply position since the Order was made, and looking at the prospects for the coming year in regard to stocks of feeding stuffs&mdash;it is the year commencing 1st September, 1941, we have to keep in mind when we think of our tillage policy for the coming year&mdash;I think we have made a mistake in fixing the proportion of arable land to be tilled at so low a figure.  I think it is possible that I may have to go back to the Government and say so to them.  However, if we have to come <Col N="2547" /> to the country again with a new Order, it will be done quickly because I know the farmers must soon know where they are in regard to the amount of land which they will be required to cultivate for the coming year.  If a new Order requiring them to till more than one-sixth of their arable land is found to be desirable, that Order will be made before the end of this month at any rate.  I do not think it unjust or unfair to ask farmers to produce more crops at the present time because we want more produce both for human food and for animal products which in turn are required for human food.  When we ask farmers to provide the materials which are required for animal products, and crops such as wheat which are required for human food, I do not think our action can be criticised.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Fitzgerald will agree that we are not in a position to import the same quantity of foodstuffs as in former years and when a reasonable price is guaranteed for crops such as wheat, I think we are quite justified in saying to the farmer, &ldquo;You must grow a certain proportion of wheat because we cannot run the risk of letting our people go hungry.&rdquo;  Senator Fitzgerald said that these Orders might be justified for a certain time but not for all time.  I do not think, however, we are going too far in the powers which we have taken in any of these Orders.</P>
    <P>Turning to Senator Baxter's speech on the last day, he said he would like to know what the position really is in regard to feeding stuffs.  It is very hard to give reliable figures on that or even to make a comparison of how we will stand this year as against last year or the year before.  I shall put it this way.  Suppose we could import half the feeding stuffs we imported in the year 1938, the year before the war, we should still be short.  There is no doubt at all about that, but I think there is no prospect that we shall be able to import half the quantity we got that year.  It appears, therefore, as if we were going to have an acute shortage of feeding stuffs in this country before next harvest.  The position may be modified or mitigated to a great <Col N="2548" /> extent by farmers conserving all the feeding stuffs they have or by using feeding stuffs they would not normally use for some animals.  For instance, we have used oats to a great extent for feeding cattle in this country.  Oats may also have to be used to some extent for pigs because we have not enough maize, barley and pollard.  In turn, cattle can be fed on beet pulp, silage, or on surplus oats.  By readjusting the supplies of home-grown feeding stuffs which the farmer has on hands, he may be able to get through and bring his pigs and cattle out in just as good a condition as in other years if his supplies are managed to the best possible advantage.  If, however, we use feeding stuffs in the same way as we have used them in the past, we shall have to face a shortage.  There is not the slightest doubt about that. I have already said that the millers advertised a fortnight ago for home-grown grain, and I heard from the Millers' Association to-day that they got practically no response to that. They advertised for oats at £8 a ton, or about 14/- per barrel for oats delivered at the railway station, or they were prepared to take it direct.  They advertised for barley without naming any price.  They asked the seller to name his price but, even so, they got no response.  It would appear as if farmers who have oats on hands are holding on to it.  I think any farmer who can afford to do so is probably wise.  A farmer who considers that he has too much on hands may say to himself: &ldquo;Well, if I cannot use it, I can easily dispose of it next spring out if I sell it now and I require it next spring, I may find it very difficult to get it then&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that the millers made a voluntary arrangement with the Department of Agriculture to mix a certain amount of barley and oats with maize.  The reason the Department saw the millers to-day was that the millers requested to be released from that undertaking.  We could not see that any great benefit would accrue in tying them to that undertaking any further.  The position now is that a miller may have maize on hands and no home grown grain.  Should that be <Col N="2549" /> so, he would have to hold the maize until he got some home-grown oats or barley.  On the other hand, there may be certain millers who have no maize but who have certain quantities of home-grown grain.  They want to be free to mill whatever they can get hold of and sell it as quickly as they can. I see no objection, therefore, to releasing them from the agreement they voluntarily entered into a couple of months ago.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by Senator Baxter and by Senator Fitzgerald, and also by some Dáil Deputies, that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to compel industrialists to produce a certain article, probably he would not get these industrialists to do so unless he offered them certain compensation.  That general analogy is not right.  Senator Fitzgerald took the example of getting boot manufacturers to produce something else.  We are not saying to the farmers: &ldquo;You must go into something that you never did before.&rdquo;  For instance, we are not saying to the farmers that they must go into the growing of bananas.  We are only asking them to produce their own raw material.  We are saying to the farmers: &ldquo;You must produce the food we want for our own people, that is, wheat and beet, in particular, as crops; but we are giving you a guarantee of what we consider a fair price.&rdquo; I do not think Senators will say that the price is not a reasonable one in the case of wheat and beet.  I submit, therefore, that the farmer has no complaint as far as wheat and beet are concerned. He is growing food for human consumption, but he is getting a remunerative price for it.  If we said to the biscuit manufacturers: &ldquo;You must turn out more biscuits for human consumption, but we will give you a fair price,&rdquo; I think the biscuit manufacturers would have no complaint.  We are treating the farmers in the same way as far as human food, namely, wheat and beet, etc., are concerned.  In addition to that the farmer is turning out cattle, pigs, sheep, milk, butter and so on, and he must have a certain amount of raw food for that purpose. He cannot carry on as he was in the habit of doing.  Therefore we <Col N="2550" /> say to the farmers <i>en masse:</i>&ldquo;You must produce your own raw materials for this purpose.&rdquo;  If one farmer sells his oats or barley to another for feeding purposes, surely that is not a concern of the Government.  Let him do the best he can in the exchange.</P>
    <P>I will take the analogy if you like. Suppose the woollen manufacturers said they could not go on because they had no yarn.  Suppose they had facilities for spinning that yarn and that some of them were spinning it and others were not.  If the Government said to the woollen manufacturers: &ldquo;You must all spin in proportion to what you weave; we do not care whether you exchange that yarn or not and we do not care what price you exchange it at,&rdquo; surely it is not suggested that the woollen manufacturers would say: &ldquo;You must compensate us for doing this spinning&rdquo;? The farmers, I submit, are in the same position.  We are saying to the farmers: &ldquo;You want raw material; you cannot import maize and cake as you did for many years before the war; you can grow oats and barley for feeding animals.&rdquo;  We know that if the Government or Parliament does not interfere we will not get sufficient oats and barley grown, because the individual farmer will say: &ldquo;I will carry on the way I always carried on and perhaps I will get on all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the special case of the farmer who produced oats in small or large quantities but has no storage accommodation and needs money and has to sell it at the very bad price which he got last Autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases like that. But, let us take the general position first.  Perhaps Senator Baxter and Senator Fitzgerald will not agree, but I do not see any fallacy in my own argument, at any rate.  If farmers as a whole want raw materials, why should we not say: &ldquo;Grow your own raw materials and distribute them amongst yourselves as best you can.&rdquo; There may be individual cases such as Senator Johnston indicated One farmer may grow oats and he may not have the storage or the money to keep <Col N="2551" /> it.  That is a matter that we should try to deal with if we can.  If we are not able to deal with it, I do not think that is a reason why we should drop our tillage Order or depart from the principle we have adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he has any notion as to the way the existing oats crop is distributed between private storage on the farms where it was produced and the stores of merchants and others to whom it has been sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a figure of which I can get a fair idea.  I am not sure if it is complete, but we are making a survey of the amount of oats purchased by merchants and millers.  If we deduct that from what we regard as the total produce of the year, we have what is left on the farmers' hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the farmer who has a large amount of oats and can store it himself will come through all right; but the real problem is that of the man who had to sell it at a bad price in the Autumn because he had not the storage accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The peculiar thing is that farmers this time last year had oats on hands and would not sell because oats were dear and farmers thought they would get dearer.  This year there is no doubt that certain farmers, but not a lot in the aggregate, rushed to the market and sold their oats at a lower price than they would get now.  The strange thing in agriculture is that when a commodity is dear the farmer will always find some method of holding on to it in the hope that it will get dearer, but, when it is cheap, he throws it on the market; he cannot hold it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point made by Senator Baxter, which undoubtedly is an important point, is that we should know, if possible, where we are; that we should know what the extent of our export market is for animals and animal products.  I am anxious to know that too, but I have not found it possible to get that information.  We <Col N="2552" /> have tried over and over again to get the British Government to agree to take, say, all the butter, bacon and cattle we can produce, at a reasonable price or, alternatively, let us know how much they will take.  We have not been able to get that.  We got prices fixed in April which have existed up to the present; some of them will extend even into next year unless there is a change made.  But the British Government have from time to time, as Senators know, changed the prices of our commodities without very much notice, and at other times have introduced restrictions on our imports into Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather interesting. Can the Minister give any explanation as to why the British Government do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any explanation. I suppose the explanation with regard to their restrictions on imports is that they had some difficulty in disposing of them.  Take fat cattle, for instance.  Some time ago, as Senators know, restrictions were put on them at very short notice; when I say short notice, I mean eight or ten days.  Probably the British Government felt that there were more cattle coming on the market from their own producers and from this country than their organisation could deal with, and they had to restrict the cattle coming on the market for some time.  These restrictions are now gone.  But, whatever the British Government's reason may be, these restrictions unfortunately have a very bad effect on our producers.  There is nothing a farmer fears so much as a restriction.  He may put up with the price.  He may say: &ldquo;I will take a chance, the price may improve&rdquo;.  When he sees a restriction coming, he gets disheartened.  He is afraid to go into production more whole-heartedly; he is afraid to enlarge his stocks.  He is afraid that a restriction may be imposed again next year, and he has all sorts of fears about the markets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  Now, the position being uncertain with regard to the quota or the price, the only thing we can go on, in planning for the coming year with regard to the amount of tillage we want or the amount of feeding stuffs we would require to import, is to assume that we will want about the same for the home market and that we will export about the same.  On that assumption we can build up a policy as to the amount of tillage we require and so on.  We are uncertain, as I say&mdash;the Government is just as uncertain as any Senator here, <Col N="2554" /> and almost more so&mdash;about the export market for the future, and especially for the immediate future, but we have to carry on on some policy or other, and it appears to me that as sensible a policy as any other is to say: Well, let us try to carry on as we are: that is, let us assume that we will consume the same amount at home and that we will also export about the same.  In addition to that we must try to keep in mind that we may not be able to import anything in the way of feeding stuffs.  Last year we went on the assumption that we would import a big proportion of our feeding stuffs, and up to a few months ago that was correct, and when we were making a calculation or trying to draw up a programme for the coming year we thought that we might be able to import about 50 per cent. of our feeding stuffs.  Now, however, I do not think it would be anything like that, and so we must amend our tillage order.</P>
      <P>Another thing is that we may not be able to get the amount of fertilisers that we would like to get, and that will mean that our crops will be of somewhat lower yield.  It is not so disastrous as might be thought, that we should get no potash, for instance. That is not so disastrous, and we should not exaggerate the position. Senators will say that you cannot grow potatoes or flax or beet without potash.  They are probably right in saying that you cannot grow them satisfactorily, but it is obvious, from the figures of the amount of potash used here before the war, and the amount of potatoes grown, that only about one-tenth of the farmers grew potatoes with potash.  So even if we have to do without potash we will still get a crop&mdash;perhaps not so good a crop, but we must allow for that in our tillage requirements, because if we were banking on, say, 20 cwts. to the acre of oats, that was an average yield but that was because part of that acreage&mdash;maybe less than half&mdash;had been manured with phosphates.  If we do not get enough phosphates in the coming year, then our oat crop will not be manured to the same extent and the average yield will be lower.</P>

As I was saying, 25 per <Col N="2556" /> cent. of our cows could be dispensed with&mdash;I will not offend Senator Crosbie by saying they could be dispensed with by slaughter, but by putting them in the Museum, let us say.  We could dispense with 50 per cent. of our pigs. We would have no export after that; our cattle would be reduced by about half because the cattle would not be there.  That would mean, of course, that the income to our farmers, provided prices remain as they are, would be reduced by about £10,000,000 and the country's trade balance would be reduced by about £10,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is a good solution, however, but it is a solution, and you could say to a good farmer: &ldquo;We do not want to destroy the fertility of your soil by asking you to produce more oats and barley when you have not the artificial manures, but we will ask you to dispense with one cow out of every four and with one pig out of every two, and then things would right themselves without increasing tillage at all.&rdquo;  I do not think, however, that that is a good solution from the point of view of the farmers themselves.  I think it would be better to say to them: &ldquo;You may not get as good a crop of oats, flax and potatoes without the artificial manures, but at any rate you ought to try to sow these under the best possible conditions that you can get.&rdquo;  Senator Johnston asked about stall-fed cattle.  There is no doubt that the stall-feeding of cattle was a very important type of farming, but principally in Leinster.  I think we might take it that the counties of Kildare, Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford, Kilkenny and so on&mdash;these counties in particular, at any rate&mdash;were the counties that went in for a lot of stall-feeding. They grew a good deal of roots, oats, and so on, for the feeding of the cattle, and they had a good deal of manure to put on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a scientist of course, but I do not know whether Senators Johnston and Counihan are right in saying that that manure was so much superior to other manures.  I remember reading, some place or another, that cows take <Col N="2557" /> less from the land than any other stock, because the only thing they take from the land is fat.  Young cattle, of course, take phosphates and lime from the land because they are growing bone, but cows take nothing from the land except fat, and fat is manufactured by carbo-hydrates and therefore the grass, straw, and hay supply that, and nothing in the way of lime and phosphates is taken from the land at all.  If that is true&mdash;and I suppose it is &mdash;then the maintenance of cows in the country would appear to be more important that the feeding of stall-fed cattle.  I am not saying that, however, in order to minimise in any way the importance of stall-fed cattle because I think it is a very important industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion would seem to be that the problem is solvable by producing cows instead of bullocks only.  In parts of the country you have intensive cultivation, and in one county you would have six cows where in another you have 16, according to acreages, but you cannot expect a county like, say, Louth to change over to the high rate of cows that they have in Limerick.</P>

      <P>No, put personally, as Minister for Agriculture, I would not like to see the number of cows increased because our troubles in dealing with dairy products would increase proportionately.  There is, however, another trade growing up in this country in recent years, and that is the production of good stores.  In fact, I am told by exporters that the trade in good stores exported now is practically as good as what were exported as fat cattle.</P>

      <P>I should have said in my native area.  I think it is almost impossible, as long as the British Government <Col N="2558" /> maintains its present policy with regard to subsidies to native bred fat cattle for our farmers to buy store cattle here against exporters and fatten these for export at a profit.  It is practically impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <P>It looks as if the feeding of fat cattle here is at an end.  If it is, we can only replace it by feeding our store cattle well and exporting them as stores in the best possible condition, and in that way we will get the manure that we got hitherto from stall-fed cattle.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. He suggested that the debate was carried on in a spirit of unreality.  I do not know what he means by that. While he was loudest against the speeches made in support of the motion, I cannot see that he was facing up to the realities of the situation.  May I say that there was general evasion regarding what seems to me to be the real difficulties confronting farmers? Senator McGinley has nothing to do with farming, but he sought to administer one sort of treatment to them while Senator Byrne said that as he could not see how any guarantee of minimum prices could be given for crops or the product of crops, he could not support the motion.  If he could see how it could be done he would support it.  The Minister argued that he does not think there is any justification for the motion or any question of equity involved.  Perhaps it would be rather a lame excuse for the Minister to say that he cannot see how it could be done.  If he said that he would like to do it, it would make one believe that there was justice in asking this request for farmers.  I believe in equity, especially when farmers are in the position they are in to-day, with all their charges fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on a previous occasion their rent, rates, labour costs, fertilisers and machines and other charges and outgoings are fixed.  I am convinced that it is equitable that there should be some indication to them what <Col N="2559" /> their receipts are to be.  The Minister evaded that and suggested that we might fix prices for products we consume here.  He thinks we could lump all farmers together and compel them to grow their raw materials.  I argued previously, and to a certain extent the Minister seemed to agree, that we are faced with a situation in which we are exporting a considerable quantity of our products to another country.  I wonder if, in the circumstances in which the Minister finds himself, instead of declaring that we ought to have one-sixth of our land tilled, he issued an edict to-morrow that compulsory tillage was to be abandoned that would have any effect?  Would it make people from whom he is trying to get a just price for our farmers sit up?  I think we may be forced to take very drastic action in this matter. Farmers are being asked to take a leap in the dark.  Now apparently, one-sixth of the land is not sufficient in the Minister's judgment to put under the plough.  Perhaps it will be made one-fourth. For what?  To supply goods to England without any guarantee that the prices received will be paying prices.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that if there was going to be no loss in such production, probably he would be prepared to give a guarantee of certain fixed minimum prices for butter, pigs, cattle and poultry products.  These are the ultimate results of the crops we grow. If he thought there was not going to be a loss on these things going to England, I suggest he would be prepared to risk it and state that there were to be certain fixed minimum prices.  Because he fears the risk of doing that in the name of the State he will not take it.  The net result is that farmers are left to take the risk and to bear the loss, and if they do not the heavy hand of the law is there to threaten them that they must obey. To me that is all wrong.  If to-morrow we were in this situation, that we were faced with total war, what would happen?  I wonder if farmers would be left in the position that they were to go on and on, not knowing what was going to be the end, but having to buy <Col N="2560" /> artificial manures, machines, pay labour, rates and rent, while at the end there was no evidence whether the return they were going to get from their pigs or their cattle would pay the outgoings to which they had committed themselves.  I wonder if that situation would be permitted to continue.  I suggest that it would not continue.  I believe that present conditions under which the Minister expects agriculture to operate cannot continue indefinitely. In fact, when the farmers are faced this year with a situation where they produce crops that cannot be cashed at a profit, the disturbance of mind and the unhappy plight into which they will be driven may be such that the State must take cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>You cannot have here stability, order, or progress unless there is stability in Irish agriculture.  It is not too much to expect that the whole resources of the State will be available to put agriculture on a stable foundation, when the resources of the State&mdash; that is, the law&mdash;are operated to make the farmer do things which he would not do in his own judgment and which to-day he doubts the wisdom of doing, even from the point of view of the State.  Men are being compelled to till fields.  I am all for tillage: I would put every conceivable acre under the plough, and not alone am I for increasing the area under the plough but for increasing the stocks of cattle, pigs, and poultry.</P>
    <P>I said the last day that I was not in agreement with the statement of the Minister at a meeting in Wexford, that probably we would have to face up to a reduction in our stocks.  Still, I put it to the Minister that one can produce on grass just as well as on grain and roots.  Very many farmers who possibly did not obey the law last year and continued the land under grass and produced beef, did better&mdash;out of disobedience to the law&mdash;than the men who engaged labour, purchased fertilisers, tilled fields and brought the crops into the farmyard to feed stock or to the market to be sold as feeding for other men's stock.</P>
    <P>When a situation like that arises, where the farmer can produce good food and make more money by producing <Col N="2561" /> foods in one way than in another, I do not understand the Minister's conception of equity when he compels farmers to change.  I realise that we may be short of foodstuffs for our cattle and pigs, probably before the next harvest is gathered; but, on the other hand, the sooner we make up our minds as to whether we are going to go on in the position in which we are at present, or were two months ago&mdash;not knowing whether our pigs could be sold when ready for the market and not knowing whether Britain was going to take them or not &mdash;the better it will be for the agricultural community.  I suggest that the Minister should consider whether he could not help towards that end by telling farmers whether he is going to compel them to till or whether he is going to leave it to their own judgment as to whether they will till or not in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Both in their own interests and in the general interest, it is quite conceivable that the people across the water, who know that we have 12,000,000 acres of arable land capable of producing more than it is at present &mdash;if there were any fixed and definite policy which would not be changed from week to week and from month to month&mdash;would begin to wonder whether that land and its products might not be better used in the difficult times through which they are passing, and through which they will pass before the next harvest is gathered.  When you put farmers under the rule of the law, commanding them to do things which are against their better judgment, and to incur expenditure and probably loss without any security at the end as to whether the crops can be marketed on a paying basis or not, I suggest that is doing something which the Minister for Agriculture should not do and that it is creating instability in agriculture and a spirit which is very bad for farming in general.  There are a few people here and there who are, for economic and other reasons, opposed to Government interference in their land in the shape in which they have experienced it and they are being made a rallying centre for disaffection which the country cannot afford at the present time. <Col N="2562" /> Even though the Minister may not be prepared to accept this point of view now, I am convinced that it is a point of view which inevitably he&mdash;or somebody else in his position&mdash;must be forced to accept in the end.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to draw a comparison between the industrialist compelled to do something not in his line, and that of a man compelled to grow certain food for his stock, saying that the positions would be entirely different. I suggest that the position of the industrialist, compelled to embark on a line of production to which he is not accustomed, is no more different from that of the farmer who is entirely unaccustomed to till and who was producing food by using his land in a particular way and who is now compelled to change over to a new scheme which neither he nor his workers are well equipped for.  One is just as unfair as the other.  If the industrialist were commanded to do that, no doubt he would give his answer.  The point of view of farmers ought to be that this is not a question of administration or executive responsibility, it is a demand for bare justice.  The Minister rejects that point of view and seems to think that it is quite legitimate and fair to compel farmers to do anything, even though the farmers may know that it will not pay, and even though the Minister himself fears that it will not pay.  I suggest that, if the Minister had not got this fear, he would be prepared to give a guaranteed price but, because he would not be able to get his colleagues in the Government to undertake the responsibility, he is making the farmer bear the burden.  While the farmer may be regarded by a great many as merely the hewer of wood and the drawer of water, and the slave of the State, to do whatever the State commands, I say that a change must come, and that it is coming, in the mental attitude of the farmer to all this State interference.  We may not be ready now to give him justice, but justice must come to him and the longer it is kept from him the more rebellious and revolutionary he will become in his demands when the time comes to carry them into operation.</P>

    <Title>Press Censorship&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion which appears on the Order Paper in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of this House, the manner in which the powers of Press Censorship in domestic matters are exercised is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>In rising to move this motion, I claim to be making a proper use of Parliamentary methods.  When, during the passage of a measure through Parliament, the Government has been criticised on the grounds that it is taking arbitrary and wide powers, frequently the reply has been that the citizen has the protection of Parliament, and that at any time the citizen considers those powers are being abused the matter can be raised in Parliament.  I am acting on that principle to-day.  Nobody will deny that in times like these the Government, even in countries not at war&mdash;probably even more so in neutral countries &mdash; must have exceptional powers, but those exceptional powers imply a corresponding obligation: the obligation to exercise them with due regard to the liberty and rights of the citizen, and to temper them with moderation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to the motion itself, I realise fully my responsibility in moving it.  It was originally my intention to put it down in an unrestricted form.  The Minister, quite properly, and, I need scarcely say, without any suggestion of pressure, pointed out to me the dangers that might follow from an unrestricted debate, and, anxious not to embarrass the Government in these times, I agreed to confine the matter to domestic issues, but it remains to be seen in the future whether that will be sufficient.  I am not making a threat at all, but I do say to the Minister that feeling in the country at present at the way censorship is being exercised is such that not necessarily myself but others may be forced on another occasion to widen the scope of the debate, unless some amelioration in the conditions which now apply follows.  It is undoubtedly somewhat difficult to draw a hard-and-fast dividing line between domestic and external issues.  I shall do my best to keep&mdash;and the Chair no doubt will see that I keep&mdash;within the terms of <Col N="2565" /> the motion, but I regard domestic issues as matters which have no direct bearing on external policy or the policy of neutrality, although it is impossible to conceive a domestic issue which has not conceivably some direct bearing.</P>
    <P>The whole justification for this motion lies in supporting facts, and I might tell the House that never before in the whole of my Parliamentary experience have I had such a volume of spontaneous correspondence from people who have been affected by the restrictions now imposed by the censorship and, although I cannot give the names, I can assure the Minister that although some of the people who have approached me have not always signed their communications to me, I know them, at the same time, to be authoritative and I have satisfied myself that the cases brought to my notice are genuine.  When I say: &ldquo;not signed,&rdquo; I wish the House to understand that not only in connection with this matter but in connection with other matters too, there is great difficulty in getting at grievances, the position being that no person wants to get into the black books of the Government. The Government have such power now not only in respect of censorship but in respect of industry generally, and it is so frequently necessary to go to the Government for concessions and so much in the power of the Government to penalise an individual by withholding a concession, that it is only natural that people suffering grievances should frequently prefer to remain silent.</P>
    <P>The first case I have is the use of the censor's powers to prevent any references to the poisoning of fish in the River Blackwater by the effluents of the Mallow factory.  I have a letter herewith which I shall read, which was sent to a reputable paper and I may mention, as a preliminary, that, when this poisoning took place, certain representations were made to the Government and, as the outcome&mdash; this is not really material but it shows the background&mdash;those who were suffering and aggrieved by this poisoning were told to exercise patience, and this letter was sent from <Col N="2566" /> one of the conservators following that. The letter says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel your article of October 10th cannot be allowed to pass without comment.  For years I have been one of those who have complained of the deadly effect upon fish life from the effluents of factories but it took the abnormally low conditions of the River Blackwater this season to show its absolutely disastrous results. Since the factory started work last week, the fishery inspector collected 75 dead salmon, mostly hen fish and over 5,000 trout in a few hours' time and on a stretch of the river reaching 12 miles below the factory.  Numbers of salmon trout and eels have been seen dead that could not be reached.  While fully realising the benefit of the sugar beet factory industry to the country, it should also be remembered what the value of the river means not only to all those men in the tidal waters whose livelihood depends on the river's productiveness, the amount of money spent by fishing visitors which the river used to attract, also the unfair position of fishery owners who are obliged to pay rates for the protection of fish, the angling clubs who are doing so much to improve the river by preservation and restocking.  Having exercised to the utmost &lsquo;patience&rsquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I understand that that is what the Department of Fisheries advocated.</P>
    <P>&mdash;as advocated in your article, I am confident the time has come to apply the only remedy, namely, that immediate steps should be taken to erect the most modern filtration tanks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that, the editor of the paper says:</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter, we regret we cannot publish the matter you refer to, as the censor has shut down all statements concerning this, except what is supplied by himself.</P>
    <P>Nobody, I think, will deny that that is a domestic issue, and that alone, I think, should be sufficient to create very considerable alarm and apprehension.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I wish to refer is the question of agricultural <Col N="2567" /> statistics.  Certain agricultural statistics were published in, I think, all&mdash; certainly in one&mdash;of the leading papers in the country.  When it came to the censor's passing a letter for publication abroad containing these very statistics, that item of information was stopped. That, again, I submit, is domestic, and I cannot see any conceivable reason, direct or indirect, for that action on the part of the censor.  Then, I have a case with regard to photographs, because not only printed matter but photographs are subject to censorship. I have before me a photograph of a certain well-known building in a city in this country.  On the facade of that building is an historical emblem representing the old days of cruel ascendancy, if you like.  In front of that building is taking place a monster rally in favour of recruiting for the Local Security Force.  When that photograph was submitted to the censor, it came back with the instruction that the emblem of the ascendancy was to be taken out.  The only way in which that could be done was by scraping the plate.  The plate had to be scraped, and the House can imagine that the photograph was not as good as it might have been.</P>
    <P>I have also a photograph of a certain individual, an Irishman who distinguished himself outside this country. No mention whatever was made of the distinction, but merely the fact that he had distinguished himself was sufficient to forbid publication of that photograph. I am informed on the very best authority that there is great difficulty in getting publication for the deeds, or even the deaths, of those who die outside this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The information is not bad.  I have it on the very best authority.  It may not be correct, but it certainly is not bad.  I took no information which was without authority. Recently we had a play put on at the Gate Theatre.  I happened to be present on a rather interesting occasion when the house was informed that, on the instructions of the Minister for Justice, the play could not be performed. The play actually was performed. I need not say how that was arranged.  I understand it was performed in a perfectly legal manner. When it came to a reference to that occasion in the papers, my information is&mdash;again, I may be wrong&mdash;that the Press were told they had to act strictly, not on the <i>ipsissima verba,</i> but on the inspired instructions, of the Bureau of Information.  When one editor objected to having certain words put into his mouth not believing they were true, he was told he must put in the whole or nothing at all.  I suggest that that is again an unreasonable use of censorship&mdash;to say to anybody: &ldquo;Unless you put in what we say, you will put in nothing at all.&rdquo;  It is, certainly, an abuse of censorship to suggest words to any responsible journalist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the powers of censorship are being used to prohibit references to an organisation called the Kimmage and Crumlin Tenants Association. <Col N="2569" /> When that association approached the responsible authorities, it was accused of having connection with a body called the Dublin Unemployed Workers' Movement.  When the Government was satisfied that that connection did not exist, the ban was released, but I do ask: Is the Dublin Unemployed Workers' Movement an illegal body? If it is not an illegal body, on what grounds are its activities subject to censorship?  I also understand that there is a very marked discrimination between references to the activities of the I.R.A. here and the I.R.A. across the Border.  I know that when the Minister for Defence, in reply to a Parliamentary question in the Dáil, gave the number of the I.R.A. in detention, the publication of these numbers was prohibited by the censor.  I think we all know that Parliamentary debates are subject to drastic censorship. I know that the Official Report is not tampered with but the Parliamentary Debates, as they appear in the Press, are very different from what the editors would like to publish of what the speakers said.  I should be rather surprised to find that the Press will be allowed to publish, as they would wish to do, the remarks I am making now.  I understand that the Trade Union Congress took some interest in a scheme to succour air raid victims, and reference to that was prohibited&mdash;a purely humanitarian work. I understand that the censor dictates and regulates the position in which matter is to appear, the prominence it is to have and the headings that are to be given.  These are the instances I give for what they are worth.  I suggest that, even if they are not all fully substantiated, there is a sufficient volume of credence behind them to create very general apprehension.</P>
    <P>With regard to the machinery of censorship, as the Minister may have read to-day, the Press suffers very considerable inconvenience by the hours it has to work and the censorship staff that has to deal with them during those hours.  As any newspaper man knows, the work is hot-news work, and has to take place between, perhaps, ten o'clock and two o'clock in the morning. During those hours, responsible officials <Col N="2570" /> are not available unless they are rung up and taken out of bed.  The officials on duty are, according to my information, junior officials who, naturally, do not care to take responsibility and, unless the matter is of urgent and grave importance, do not care to rouse their seniors.  The Press are, naturally, loath to insist that the matter should be referred to some responsible authority and the natural tendency on those occasions is for the junior official to play for safety and say: &ldquo;Better not take the risk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel, and here I speak with a considerable sense of responsibility&mdash;that one of the major causes of this trouble is the personnel.  I do not want to make any personal attack on the censor himself.  He is a civil servant and has been appointed by the Minister. He has to act according to his own lights, but I do feel that the Minister made&mdash;and here is his responsibility&mdash;an unfortunate choice in that appointment.  He is not a person constitutionally&mdash;I do not think he himself would claim to be a middle-of-the-road man, a man with a conciliatory outlook&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These are the grounds on which I claim that the censorship has been, and is being, exercised on domestic issues in an unreasonable manner.  I know from the correspondence I have had that there is very considerable apprehension in the country about this.  I do feel that there is a special responsibility on the Government in this matter of censorship, because the powers are entirely arbitrary.  On a question of other rights of citizenship resort can always be had to the courts. Even if things are done by Order, the Order has the force of law, and the citizen can go to the courts to test the validity of the Order.  But here there are no rules or no Orders; the powers of the Government are entirely arbitrary, and I suggest that they have, as urged by the illustrations I have given, been exercised in an unreasonable manner.  I move the motion.</P>

      <P>I will second the motion.  You have given me to understand that the amendment would not enable me to broaden the basis of this discussion to the extent to which I wished.  Therefore, I wish to leave myself free to propose it as a substantive motion on a future occasion. Meanwhile, I am seconding Senator Sir John Keane's motion&mdash;although its terms do not entirely please me&mdash; because I think it is high time that we had a discussion in Parliament on the subject of censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has asked us to say that the mode in which the censorship has been carried on has sometimes at least been unreasonable. I am not familiar with those cases which the Senator has cited.  I myself am brought into contact with the censorship directly every week, and the first thing I should like to say is <Col N="2572" /> that there has been nothing in such contact to arouse anything in the nature of personal antagonism&mdash;quite the contrary.  I should like to pay tribute to the invariable courtesy and intelligence of the particular official with whom I have to deal.  But I do think that it would be nothing short of miraculous if the powers of the censorship were not exercised unreasonably under present conditions.</P>
    <P>There are two crying needs in connection with the censorship.  One is that the principles upon which it is to proceed should be promulgated by the Government and assented to by Parliament, clearly established for all men to know.  At present, I at any rate, am not aware of such principles.  The second thing is that there should be a system of Parliamentary control over the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, whose principal task seems to be in fact the conduct of the censorship.  There is no power possessed by the Government the exercise of which is carried on in such complete secrecy and such complete absence of control as this power of censorship.  I do not believe that the people of this country have any idea of the extent of this power, or of the ruthlessness with which it is applied.</P>
    <P>Now, let us consider just for a moment what are the principles on which censorship ought to proceed.  I agree that in times of such peril as the present there has to be censorship, and that a great many of the fundamental principles of freedom and democracy&mdash; for we are still democrats&mdash;guaranteed to us by the Constitution and sanctified by tradition have got to be suspended.  Of those, one of the most important, without any doubt, is the right of the citizen to express freely his opinions about public affairs, and, if he thinks them of sufficient importance and sufficient value, to try to persuade his fellow citizens to that effect.  That ought not to be abrogated, I submit, even in war time, to any further extent than is absolutely necessary. I quite agree that it ought not to be open to us to give away military secrets, the disclosure of which would imperil the safety of the country.  I agree too; that even more than in <Col N="2573" /> times of peace seditious language must not be tolerated.  I agree that there should be an effort by everybody&mdash;and that the censor has the right to see that everybody makes that effort&mdash;to keep language within the bounds of studious moderation, to try and keep the political temperature low, shall we say, to prevent people from getting unduly excited, to deal with everything in a spirit of perhaps greater gentleness than one would in peace time. But is it right that on any subject the people of this country, and particularly the members of the Dáil and the members of the Seanad, should be actually prohibited from making their views known to their fellow citizens when they can do so without giving away any military secrets and thereby endangering the safety of the country?</P>
    <P>An argument constantly used by the Taoiseach himself against persons disposed to violence and sedition is that there was no need for anything of the kind in our State, because it was always perfectly open to them if they wished to exert themselves to persuade their fellow-countrymen that their views were correct.  Now, by shutting out the expression of opinion altogether on important topics, surely the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and his colleagues are presenting seditious persons and persons with a taste for violent methods with an excuse that they never possessed before, and I submit that that should not be done without very careful consideration, and without the full consent of Parliament.  Such consent has not yet been obtained, nor has the matter ever been threshed out in Parliament as it ought to be.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has referred to the censoring even of Parliamentary debates, as reported in the Press, and I submit that that is a thing which ought not to be done, again unless there is some indiscreet disclosure by a member of some State or military secret that ought not to be made known. So far as it is a matter of expression of opinion, I submit that if democracy means anything at all the representatives of the people in the Dáil and in the Seanad should have the right to address themselves to their fellow-countrymen, <Col N="2574" /> and that their fellow-countrymen have a right to know what the opinions of their representatives are.  I do think that we should, before long, quite seriously and definitely, come to conclusions about the principles upon which the censorship should proceed.</P>
    <P>When we have done that, I think we have still to face the problem of establishing some degree of Parliamentary control.  The Minister cannot be brought to full Parliament over everything connected with the censorship because that would mean the defeat of the objects of censorship.  It would mean the disclosure to considerable numbers of people of things which it is desired by the Government to conceal, and which it may be right or may be wrong to conceal.  But some measure of Parliamentary control there ought to be, and what occurs to me is the sort of committee that I suggested in the amendment which, for the time being, I withdraw.  I invite the Minister to meditate upon the merits of that proposal. It has been very well established by human experience that the exercise of arbitrary power has a corrupting effect upon character.  Theobald Wolfe Tone said that in the course of time it would corrupt even an angel.  I have no doubt there are some angelic elements in the Minister's character, but I do not feel complete confidence that those elements would not sometimes be subordinated to others, and I have observed, without any bitterness and without any surprise, that, as time has gone on, the censorship has in fact got tighter and tighter and that the taste for exercising one's authority despotically to prevent things appearing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The appetite for exercising despotic authority inevitably grows with what it feeds upon, and there is a strong tendency all the time to exclude things, not because they are really dangerous to the State, but simply because the Government does not like them.  That is common sense.  That is what happens.  That is human nature, and I maintain that in order to save the Minister from himself&mdash;and I would say the same about any other Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is quite understood. I am not suggesting that executive authority should be taken away from the Minister and transferred to a committee.  What I am suggesting is that the Minister as he goes along and makes his decisions, which generally have to be made quickly and at short notice, should be conscious of the fact that ultimately, if complaints are made, he will have to render an account to some parliamentary authority and that, if that parliamentary authority disagrees with him, further action can be taken in the way of complaint to the Taoiseach or, possibly, in extreme cases, where the public interest would not be damaged thereby, by the ventilation of the whole subject in Parliament.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>While I wish to support Sir John Keane's motion in the main, it would hardly be fitting for me to go too deeply into this question of censorship because, naturally, my views on Press censorship would not be what one might describe as entirely unbiased.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Press censorship as it has existed since the start of the European war in this country is concerned, I must say&mdash;and I think I can speak for most journalists&mdash;that we have always found the censorship officials willing and helpful.  Of course, they have not always been quite as helpful as we would like, but then, of course, there is an old saying that nobody can ever really satisfy a journalist.  But what I would like on this occasion to draw attention to is a subject that does not really apply strictly to Press censorship but which, on the other hand, does come under the heading of censorship&mdash;I now speak as a representative in this House of the Institute of Journalists&mdash;and that is, that the leader of the present Government, the <Col N="2577" /> Taoiseach, since he came into office in 1932, has developed a habit&mdash;and a very bad habit, in my opinion&mdash;a habit that amounts to, first of all, an insult to the Irish people and, secondly, an insult to and a lack of trust in the Irish newspapers, that whenever he has anything of national importance to disclose, whether it is a question of national policy or, as far as this country is concerned, of international policy, he does not send for an Irish journalist; he does not even send for the editor of his own paper, but he sends for foreign journalists.</P>

      <P>I am relating all that to the motion in this way, that it is an unofficial censorship.  The Taoiseach is the Prime Minister in this country, and when he has something to say that is of national or international importance, something respecting all our lives here, his duty is, first of all, to say it to the Irish people and to say it through the newspapers of Ireland.  His predecessor did not behave like that.  His predecessor, whenever he had anything of importance to say, always sent for the representatives of the Irish papers and he said it, if necessary, with brutal frankness.  I do not want to go any further than that.  In my opinion the Taoiseach has insulted the Irish people and Irish journalists, and I hope that in future a different Government policy will be observed.  I do not, for one moment, suggest that he should send for any particular newspaper, but I do <Col N="2580" /> suggest, and suggest perfectly sincerely, that when either the Taoiseach or any other Minister wants to promulgate Government policy, there is no better means by which they could do it than by sending for the representatives of the various Irish newspapers, taking them into their confidence and giving them interviews.  I suggest that more good could be done in that way than by sending for the representatives of foreign newspapers and giving them long, detailed and rather high-falutin' interviews of what Eire will do or what Eire will not do in a given set of circumstances.</P>

      <P>This motion is very restricted in its scope.  It refers entirely to Press censorship upon domestic matters.  My purpose in rising is largely to find out how this particular censorship works.  I think we are all agreed that, in the present circumstances, the censorship is necessary. I think that anybody who has access to any other papers except ours will realise that more freedom is allowed in other neutral countries than is allowed here.  As far as I can make out, for example, in Switzerland considerably more liberty is allowed. There may be a reason here for not allowing so much liberty, and I admit at once there are certain difficulties in the way.  But the job of being a censor is a delicate job, and it should be done on certain principles, and I hope, before the debate closes, the Minister will be able to enlighten the House as to the instructions laid down for Press censorship.  It should be done, of course, as sparingly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when mention was made of an official this evening, rather indignantly objected to any mention being made of officials.  I am not sure whether, in that particular matter, there was not a misunderstanding, because my reading of the motion is that it refers to Press censorship only.  In that case Senator Sir John Keane's allusion would be to the Press censor. I very much doubt that the Press <Col N="2581" /> censor in the person that Senator Sir John Keane had in his mind.  But, in any event, there is the Minister, there is the chief censor, a Press censor and a staff.  It is realised at once that the Minister cannot do all the work. Neither can the Press censor himself do all the work, and one would like to know to whom an appeal can be made at once and upon whom the ultimate responsibility rests.  There is a natural tendency, I think, to go too far in censorship.  The simplest thing is to say: &ldquo;Take it out&rdquo;.  But if one persists in doing that, naturally the result is that very little gets published at all. The Government have the job of selecting the Minister to take charge of this particular business, and I take it that it would be in order to say that they have made a very bad selection.</P>

      <P>A very bad selection, I think.  I think it would also be in order to say that in selecting a chief censor, the Minister, if he is the person who made the selection, also made a bad choice.  One need not go any further than that, but what is really important to know is whether there are principles and what the connection is between the hierarchy from the Minister down to the Press censor and the Press censor's assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular matter which I would like to raise as an example. we were asked to-night to give examples.  It is difficult to give an example and to be absolutely sure of your facts, because the censorship is exercised and I understand that the Press, to put it mildly, is not encouraged to say that certain things have been censored.  On the 20th of last month there was an anti-Partition meeting in Dublin.  It was reported in all the newspapers in Dublin on the following day and on the 22nd a friend of mine, whose name is pretty well known and who was once a member of this House, taking exception to certain things about our domestic politics which appeared in the report of the anti-Partition meeting, wrote a letter to the Dublin newspapers.  That letter, or any part of it, was not published <Col N="2582" /> in the newspapers.  The writer has been informed, and believes, that the letter was censored.  I do not propose to read it all, but I would like to give some of it as an example of its general tone.  It was dealing with the anti-Partition meeting, various remarks made at which had been reported.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;TO THE EDITOR,</P>
    <P>Sir&mdash;Mixing their ports with their politics seems to have given some of our Six-County friends rather a blurred outlook on the matter of Partition. Having read the Press reports of the meeting in the Mansion House last Tuesday night, I am still in doubt as to what the real purpose of the gathering was.  It was advertised as an anti-Partition meeting but judging from statements made by some of the speakers the question of Partition had to yield pride of place to other matters.  A lusty wallop at John Bull or a boosting of Mr. de Valera seems to have been regarded as of much greater importance than the consideration of how Partition can be brought to an end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not seem to contain anything which might be objected to by anybody, but the end of the letter deals entirely with matters concerning our domestic politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <P>I shall read it all, if the Minister wants it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Eamonn Donnelly&mdash;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister knows him&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;apparently has now little use for Parnell's dictum that Ireland cannot afford to lose a single Irishman.  He is reported as inviting England to deport quite a considerable number of Ulstermen whom he dubs &lsquo;loyalists&rsquo; from their native land. That was not the way of Parnell or Griffith and it will never be the way to win the North to the ending of the Border.  Another speaker got all &lsquo;het up&rsquo; about about the ports, declaring that Mr. de Valera's attitude in that connection secured him 100 per cent. support from the Six-County nationalists.  The relevance <Col N="2583" /> of the ports to the matter of Partition is not very obvious and I would have imagined that, from the Six-County nationalist viewpoint, the basis of Mr. de Valera's claim to their continuing support would be, primarily, what he has done, during his eight years of office, to bring Partition to an end, or what he is likely to do in the future in that regard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be domestic politics and not objectionable from the point of view of censorship.  The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact is, of course, that the only effect on the Border question of the eight years of de Valerian administration has been to harden rather than ease the Partition situation. Unless upon the theory that the best way to unravel a black knot is to pull it tighter, I am at a loss to understand how continued support of the Six-County anti-Partitionist for Mr. de Valera can be advocated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Seán McBride supplied a touch of farce with his allegation that Partition &lsquo;had come about as a result of the Treaty of 1921&rsquo;.  This is grotesquely untrue.  Partition was an accomplished fact before the negotiations for the Treaty of 1921 began, and one of the tasks which confronted the Irish representations at the negotiations was to devise a means of undoing that accomplished fact.  That, in my opinion, they succeeded in doing, but the short-sighted and unfortunate attitude and action of Mr. de Valera and his supporters nullified its chance of operating. Nevertheless, they did secure the Treaty of 1921, which is the foundation of this State, and without which we would not have to-day a de Valerian Government in a position to assert our neutrality in the present world conflict.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I dislike touching upon this controversial topic at the present juncture, but misleading statements like that of Mr. McBride necessitate correction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was not published.  As I say, the writer of the letter, who was once a member of this House, and who <Col N="2584" /> is a member of the Dublin Corporation &mdash;is not that sufficient information for everybody now?&mdash;says that that letter was subjected to censorship.  It may not have been, but I put it to the Minister that if it was, there can be no other possible reason except a political reason.  The letter is a fair, ordinary comment upon matters of domestic concern and contains nothing which should be censored.  It contains something which might be answered but not which might be censored.  However, censorship is a very difficult thing to exercise and it is important that we should have a clear view as to how it is being exercised, what the principles are, and what the relations between the different persons concerned are.</P>
    <P>Is the Press censor, for example, like the Dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations, independent in the exercise of his own functions? What is the link with the Minister? Is it a more tenuous link than the link with the Crown or has the Minister the same powers as the Lord Lieutenant long ago?  Can he override the censor or does he ever himself take the initiative in certain matters?  One would like to hear that threshed out.  I have heard from newspaper men that the powers of Press censorship, with regard to the courtesies of life, are exercised in an entirely sound manner, and I have no doubt, knowing the personnel myself, that that is so.  The remedy that has been suggested is that Parliamentary control should be exercised.  I am afraid I can see no method by which Parliamentary control could, in fact, be exercised.  I have not heard the arguments in full but I am more inclined to leave the matter to the Executive of the day. If there must be a censorship, I think they should exercise that censorship in the national interest and not in a Party interest.  They should leave no suspicion of any kind that they are exercising it in a Party interest.  They should take Parliament and the public into their confidence by stating the principles upon which the censorship is exercised and the exact responsibilities that devolve on the different persons who exercise it.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane performed a useful service in bringing forward this motion.  I do not propose to take up the time of the House by mentioning the various stories I have heard of supposed censorship. My reason for speaking at all is that there is an aspect of this subject which does not seem to have been dealt with and which seems to me to be of considerable importance.  I hope the Minister will see his way to answer the later questions raised by Senator Hayes.  I hope he will also be willing to tell us whether complete records of the various censorships that have taken place are kept so that they can be available at some future date if a general policy had to be devised either by a committee or by a new Government or in some other way, when it may be more opportune to discuss the details.  I think that there is a very wide impression abroad that things are happening inside this country which are not happening at all.  There is also a general impression that all kinds of matters are being censored. You find that view amongst commercial travellers in the country.  Take the case to which Senator Sir John Keane referred, the play &ldquo;Roly-Poly&rdquo;.  I could give the House, if I took the time, at least three different accounts of what is purported to have happened and in each case I could quote somebody of reasonable repute.  Almost the whole of Dublin knows something about it.  I believe it would have been far better to have published next morning a reasonably full and correct statement. Had that been done, the matter would have been forgotten in a couple of days, whereas it is now a matter of mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for my part, find it impossible to distinguish clearly between what is a matter of domestic affairs and what is a matter of external affairs.  I am not sure, if you take the strict reading of this motion, that I could agree with Senator Hayes when he says that everyone is in favour of a censorship.  I am not convinced that if you take the narrow, strict meaning of &ldquo;domestic affairs,&rdquo; that there should be a censorship. The very fact that the censorship is placed in the hands of the <Col N="2586" /> Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence suggests that the object of the censorship is connected with the defence of this country.  So far as the matter is a domestic matter which is not related to defence, I do not think it is good policy, that it is right or constitutional, that it should be censored at all.  I would not have been at all surprised if the Minister had taken the line that there was nothing to debate because there could be no censorship of purely domestic matters and that the only matters which we would want to discuss here would be matters which he would show were in some way or another liable to have effect on the defence of the State.  If that were the case, because I know that on all sides of the House there is a real sense of responsibility, we would find it extremely difficult to discuss any of the questions.</P>
    <P>I have business interests in the Six Counties and I visit there from time to time and I have frankly been much puzzled by the fact that while quite a number of matters relating to what I thought were our domestic affairs here did not appear in any of the papers published inside the Twenty-six Counties, they could be read in papers published in the Six Counties, and read in many cases, in a form in which I do not think it was in our interest that they should be published.  I could not help feeling on many occasions that it would be far better from our point of view here if those matters had been published in our papers here, all of which are read in the Six Counties.  There may have been reasons not obvious to me&mdash;I recognise that.  There is a case in point, but I do not want to discuss particular details, as to which the Minister probably would have all the knowledge and I have only the facts which are open to me, namely, that it appeared in three newspapers on the other side of the Border and did not appear in any here.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the principle underlying censorship should be to prevent the publication only of matters which you reluctantly have to prevent, and that the more you can allow to be published, and the more you can allow <Col N="2587" /> the people to feel that they are getting the facts and getting the truth, the healthier the country will be.  The danger at the present moment is due to the impression which I found amongst people of all Parties that we are not getting the truth.  We have had that first with regard to foreign news.  We are not now discussing foreign news.  If there is anything which the Government or the Minister or this House could do to give confidence, although we cannot get foreign news on which we can rely and know that that is the whole truth that, at any rate, we can get all the domestic news and know that that is as free as it was before, I think we would be doing a very great service.</P>
    <P>It will always be said that a certain matter is censored because the Government did not want it published.  There is no doubt whatever that probably the present Minister and I would disagree as to the relative importance of certain matters, because we disagree in our outlook on certain matters.  That is one of those things you cannot help. It is one of the drawbacks, or the benefits, if you like, of democratic government with which I do not quarrel.  I do feel that we could get a unity on this whole question of censorship if we could believe that everything relating to our domestic affairs was not interfered with, unless the Minister or some very high up official was quite confident that it did affect the defence of this country or its safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that the wording of Senator Sir John Keane's motion is perhaps not altogether such as meets the case.  What is in question is, I think, not so much domestic matters as matters which do not concern in any very special or definite way the safety of the State.  I would be very sorry to refuse to give powers to the Minister and the censorship department to prevent the publication of many domestic matters in which the safety of the State might be involved.  I think it would be well that the Minister should not regard the raising of this matter <Col N="2588" /> and this debate as by way of an attack or as expressing any hostility.  I think the Minister in charge of such a very difficult task as censorship in such difficult times should really welcome a discussion like this in which a certain amount of steam could be let off and in which a certain amount of natural anxiety which the public may feel can be given expression to.  Though I have not come very much in contact with complaints with regard to the censorship, it is because I do feel strongly that there is a danger and that there is need for caution that I should like to say a few words in this debate.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the overriding principle in the whole question of censorship should surely be the safety of the State, and whether a matter in which the safety of the State is threatened is domestic or not, the powers of the censorship ought to be used in the interests of the community. But there is always a danger in censorship, of course, that it will go too far, and that in going too far it will do a great deal more harm in the long run than the people in charge of the censorship at the actual moment may imagine.  I believe it is the principle of the censorship that in theory all news matter may be censored and that it is only by permission of the Minister that any news matter may be published at all.  At least I have heard that stated as the principle on which the censorship works.  That sounds very like a civil service principle, and, if that principle is held, I should like to suggest to the Minister that it is a very dangerous principle in the long run; that if the Minister and his Department take very extreme powers of that kind and act as if anything that appeared only appeared by their consent, they are doing something that may have serious consequences for the country in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a grave danger under Party Government, naturally, that not only matters concerning the safety of the State, but matters in which Party interests may be involved will be looked askance at by an office like the censorship office; that sometimes there will be a tendency to overstep the mark and to take what looks at the <Col N="2589" /> moment like the safe course, and prevent things from being published which the Minister, perhaps, may have a special reason, and from his own point of view a good reason, for not liking; but which, at the same time, it may be very much in the public interest to allow to be published.  That may go very far.  Even the suppression of trifling matters sometimes, if there is a great deal of it, and if it causes a sufficient amount of irritation, may do a great deal of harm.</P>
    <P>I have only come across one or two instances of complaint in relation to the censorship.  One is the case of the Mallow Beet Factory to which, I believe, Senator Sir John Keane made reference, and with which I am sure the Minister will deal.  I must say that it is a matter on which I find it very hard to understand the action taken by the censor, if the information I was given about it was correct.  The other matter is a much more trifling one, but I still think that it is a matter that has its use as being symptomatic of the danger that may be run in all this affair.  A friend of mine wrote a review of a book dealing with recent Irish politics, and, in the course of the review, remarked that if ever a time came for a monument to be set up to the authors of the Constitution of Eire he hoped that the name of the Duchess of Windsor would not be forgotten. Now, that sentence was omitted from the review by order of the censor. There may be some doubt as to whether or not it was in good taste on the reviewer's part to put a sentence of that kind in a review, but surely it would be very hard to establish that a sentence like that had any bearing whatever on the public safety.  It is a trivial matter, I know, and I do not want to make much out of it.  I am only quoting it as one instance which came very much to my notice, and as an instance that does illustrate a certain danger&mdash;a danger that is always inherent in this thing&mdash;the danger that the censor or the officials of his department may, not only from a sense of their duty to the public safety, but by reason of their own political <Col N="2590" /> prejudices or tastes&mdash;perhaps in small matters&mdash;be influenced in any action they may take in this matter.</P>
    <P>We should remember also that when a thing like that is done, when a writer or a journalist of any kind is interfered with in that way, the repercussions of such an action do not always stop with the particular matter itself.  These things get around.  They spread around, one trifle is added to another, and in the end there is a whole mass of suspicion and a feeling among the public generally that nothing that they see in the papers is true and that the untruth that they believe to be there is caused by the influence of the censor's department. You can easily create a public prejudice by trivial actions of that kind, and I think it would be well if the Minister would take warning from these things and not imagine that, by reason of the fact that he has these powers at this particular moment and can exercise them, it is always safe or wise for him to exercise them.</P>
    <P>There have been examples in the recent history of Europe&mdash;and they have often been quoted&mdash;of the damage that a too strong censorship may cause. I am sure everybody knows what I am referring to&mdash;cases where the censorship was so strong that it helped very largely to sap the morale of the country in which it was exercised. Very often, by overstepping the mark in this regard, even in trivial matters, damage has been done, and even in this country, by overstepping the mark, damage could be done and could grow up to such proportions as, in the end, to be almost impossible to deal with.  I suggest to the Minister that, while nobody will query his right and his duty to prevent the publication of anything that would be in the least way inimical to the safety of the State, it would be most dangerous for the Government, and for the party in whose interests it may sometimes seem to be done, and for the community as a whole, if that mark should be often overstepped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather diffident about intervening in this debate <Col N="2591" /> because I admit at once that I am an amateur, and that I have no cuttings and only impressions to give to the House, but these impressions are shared very largely&mdash;at least in the circles which I frequent&mdash;and I think it is well that the Minister should have some knowledge of them.  I realise, and I am fully conscious of, the heavy and even terrible responsibilities that lie on the Ministers in these days It is their duty to think of us all and to think of the safety and the future of our State.  I realise that, and I also realise that the office of censor is a difficult one.  The censor is bound to be criticised from every quarter, and I admit that in days like the present censorship is necessary and that we have to forego to some extent the freedom of speech which the Constitution guarantees to us under certain conditions. It is my impression, however, that the censorship in this country has been going too far and that some definite regulations and rules would be useful&mdash;useful to the censor and useful to the heads of our State themselves, for there is a danger there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of the State is all-important, but there is the safety of the souls of our citizens to think of also. There is a tendency for a censorship to muzzle the conscience.  It creates an insecurity, and as a result of that sense of insecurity one feels that one is moving in an atmosphere of whispers and fears&mdash;rumours, here and there and everywhere, on the wing.  It is not wishful thinking, but fearful thinking that is often characteristic of our society to-day, and a little more open speaking and a little more frankness, perhaps, would overcome that danger.  Civilisation, such as we know it, has got as one of its great foundations freedom of speech, derived from freedom of thought and freedom of conscience, and that we should do our best to preserve.  Senator Tierney has alluded to the terrible results of excessive censorship in another great country.  It destroyed or it sapped the moral sense of that country.  It made the people of that country, I might say, moral troglodytes, who <Col N="2592" /> went down into the earth in their shelters. That is what I should like the Government to take measures to prevent, if it could.</P>
    <P>I do not say that we have gone as far, or anything like as far, as that particular country went, and I hope we never will go so far, but there is always the danger of censorship being pressed too far.  There is a temptation to be a dictator.  We would all wish to be dictators ourselves because we believe that we could make the world much better if it was only run in our way. We cannot all do that, however, but there is that danger, and censorship induces a kind of intellectual black-out whereby we shut off the light of reason from ourselves.  It is to prevent that that we should try, by regulations and rules, to say to the censor: &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no farther.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Safety is a great thing, and it is an important thing to preserve, but sometimes you may pay too big a price for safety, and an American paper, in a great crisis in its country's history, drew attention to that fact when it said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; 'Tis man's perdition to be safe,</P>
    <P>When for the truth he ought to die.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I do not invite you to take such extreme measures, but I do hope that censorship will not be pressed to extreme measures, and it is my impression that it is going too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have been listening to points of view that were altogether on one side, I feel that I should give the other aspect of the matter as far as I can.  Senator Sir John Keane was what I might call quite reasonable in his statement of the facts as he got them, but, generally speaking, after he had finished, I felt that he was a complete flop in making any charge, on merit, that the censorship had not succeeded in giving a reasonable amount of satisfaction.  He told us about something in connection with fish down around the Mallow factory.  Now, I am afraid that, <Col N="2593" /> generally speaking, you can divide by fifty everything that a fisherman has to say about fish.  When a man reads a letter which states that 1,000 trout were killed, it is probable that only 100 or 150 were killed.  While matters of that kind might affect a few people and some vested interests, they do not affect the public generally and are not current topics from the point of view of publication.</P>
      <P>One thing we can be definitely certain about is that we are living in abnormal times.  That being the case, it is far better for the censorship to err on the side of safety rather than to err by taking a chance or by taking a gamble on any subject concerning internal or international affairs.  On the other hand, we have a class of individual like Senator MacDermot&mdash;it is not a joke at all&mdash;telling us it is high time that Parliament should express its opinion on this subject.  High time, mind you!  We are told it is high time for us, in view of all the motions that come from the Senator, that Parliament should express its opinion on all sorts of things.  It has developed into a position of such serious irresponsibility that he should examine himself or have some one to examine him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about it, that anybody who is knocking around the city and sitting in comfortable armchairs in clubs develops such an intense or active mind that he loses all sense of proportion from his country's point of view, or for that matter, any point of view. When we are told that it is high time that Parliament should consider something he concocts and that Parliament should sit for hours discussing it, such an outlook is becoming too serious from the point of view of this country.  It must not be very lightly dealt with.  After all, we are only a small country.  Looking at the situation from the international point of view, while the effect in international operations in war or anything else may not be very serious, the weaker we are obviously the more careful we should be of every aspect of our life, of our sayings and our actions.  That is, at least, one essential <Col N="2594" /> that I am sure very few will dispute. If Senator MacDermot is going to have his way he claims the privileges of Parliament and the right as a member of this House to do whatever he likes regardless of the consequences to the country.  I could do the same if I had my wife and kids over in America.  I could feel sufficiently irresponsible.</P>

      <P>The matter is sufficiently serious from my aspect that I should speak quite frankly and bluntly. Under these circumstances if I were a free lance perhaps I might eventually develop a sense of irresponsibility.  At any rate, it is some consolation, after sitting here and listening to other Senators with all outlooks expressing honest opinions, showing a real genuine spirit of sincerity, that a very fair effort has been made in the censorship, and that in times that are very serious, they are prepared, in the circumstances, to give the powers that be all support and latitude in their work, and that they are prepared to overlook the weakness of human nature in an effort to keep things going normally and successfully.  It is only that spirit will help us through. I may have been a bit heated when talking on this question, but it is too vital for the people as a whole for any excuse to be made for anybody acting in an irresponsible sort of way.  Such abnormal times were never known. Such critical times were never known in the history of the world.  When whole towns and populations can be wiped out in a night, when women and children are suffering, it is acting in an irresponsible way to ask Parliament to discuss some footy question such as whether a matter should be put in a newspaper or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Senator Crosbie talking about the Taoiseach giving interviews. I suppose he was acting according to his best judgment and that he is quite free to do what he did.  It might be a fair argument for Senator Crosbie to quote what he did about seeing so many foreign correspondents.  There is another side to the question.  I suppose <Col N="2595" /> in nearly every case within the last 12 or 18 months the questions that were dealt with in the interviews were a counter blast to wrong publicity about Ireland in the American newspapers. In America the newspapers are pro some side or other from their point of view and that creates confused thinking amongst the American people as far as Ireland is concerned. It was obvious that the Irish leader should from time to time get a proper statement put before the American people and have it published not alone in the American papers but published widely.  I often heard in the past that our only hope of getting wide publicity in the American newspapers was by giving information to American correspondents.</P>
    <P>It would be ignoring their Irish correspondents, but they do not seem to pay the same respect to them.  I do not see why that should be so, but the fact remains.  However, I suppose that American papers pay very high fees to the American correspondents here in Europe and, naturally, like to hear from them on spicy questions and give more publicity to their own journalists. Besides that, I suppose that there are other aspects which I need not go into in detail.</P>
    <P>I feel that Senator Crosbie himself admitted that the censorship office generally has worked out very well, so far.  I do not know, and I did not hear, that journalists were finding things, internally at any rate, any more difficult now than they were in the past.  The most important fact is that journalists, as a whole, have been able to keep things moving; they have been continued in employment and, generally speaking, there is stability in the conditions in the newspaper trade. That is a very consoling factor and, under the circumstances, while those conditions can prevail we should be rather satisfied with the way in which we are moving along, and that we are able to preserve the essentials of continuity of publicity with the peace that we have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2596" /> The spirit in which some of the speakers spoke to-day, from different sides of the House and representing different vocations in life, is a very happy one, and it is absolutely vital and essential to consolidate that and improve on it.  With that atmosphere &mdash;with the one exception&mdash;I believe, if we can discuss this question next year at this time, and have another row about the censorship, we would be in a very happy position.</P>

      <P>In all countries&mdash; whether belligerent, non-belligerent or neutral&mdash;the powers of censorship are rightly regarded as part of the system of defence.  It is from this point of view that we ought to consider it, and I regret very much that that point of view seems to have been lost sight of in the discussion which has taken place. When we met here on that night of the 2nd September and gave the Government emergency powers to save us from what might be grave danger, we gave them this power of censorship.</P>
      <P>The Government had only one way of putting it into operation: they chose the chief Press censor and the others whom they thought best fitted for the job.  I regret very much that the debate so far has, to a certain extent, resolved itself into reflections on those people.  They are doing a great national service and carrying out a task involving great delicacy, yet advantage has been taken of the privileges of this House to attack them when they cannot defend themselves. I listened very attentively to the case made by Senator Sir John Keane.  It was very well made and he purported to be making it on facts&mdash;which is the only way in which he should make a case of this nature&mdash;but when we come to examine these facts, I do not think that Senator Keane claimed they were authoritative, though he believed they were.  As far as I can gather, some of the statements made were by people who would not put their names to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacDermot was equally vague: he would not give facts at all. It was a case of: &ldquo;Dubhairt bean liom <Col N="2597" /> go ndubhairt bean lei&rdquo;&mdash;one person said that he heard something, and there was talk and whispers.  Whether these facts of Senator Keane's were facts at all we do not know, and that is why I hope the Minister will intervene soon.  Even if those were facts, they were really very trivial.  People are trying to make a case about the liberty of speech.  We would have no liberty if indiscreet words&mdash;and indiscreet words are a great danger&mdash;involved us in a war.  Then there would not be very much liberty of speech. We talk about living dangerously.  We would get plenty of it then.  When the Government were given these powers they exercised their discretion.  But people are human and, perhaps, they did not choose the best person: I do not know, but I think that they did. On the whole, they have exercised those powers in the right way: I think nobody will deny that.  Then this House interferes with what might be a very vital portion of the national defence.  That is most regrettable, and I hope that when the Minister intervenes he will tell us the exact position.</P>
    <P>There is one case which seems to me to have been the cause of legitimate complaint.  It was stressed by one of the speakers and was referred to in an article in to-day's <i>Irish Times.</i>  It was that, when news comes in, there is no responsible person in the censorship office to deal with it and to say whether such a thing should be passed or not.  That should be remedied and there should be some superior officer there.  It is important that Civil Service hours and regulations should not be maintained, and that there should be a responsible person to decide in a matter of this kind.  Probably, many of the complaints made to-day have been caused by people who are afraid to take responsibility and who may have been over-cautious.</P>

      <P>I am not going to detain the House very long, but in a few short words I wish to express my views.  I am disappointed, and many of the Irish people will be disappointed, to see that this House wastes its time to-night discussing the question <Col N="2598" /> of censorship.  A very severe attack has been made on the censor.  I happen to be in the position that I have no idea as to who the censor is, but I will say that, despite the fact that a personal attack has been made on him by Senator Sir John Keane, he has the support and the good wishes of 99 per cent. of the Irish people.  You must always judge people according to results, and the very fact that powers were given to the Government in this country to take certain action to keep it out of war and out of difficulties&mdash; and, mind you, we were not as united then as we are to-day&mdash;speaks for itself.  Judging by results over the last 12 months, I am satisfied that the censorship portion of defence&mdash;as Senator Mrs. Concannon has termed it&mdash;is very satisfactory and is fully appreciated by the Irish people outside.</P>
      <P>Regarding that item of the letter in connection with the Border meeting, Senator Hayes complained of its not being published.  It appeared at the start that it was from an ex-Senator. Now, if an ex-Senator had the right to give his views, some other person had the same right, and where would it all end?</P>

      <P>It would bring the country nowhere, and I, for one, say that the censor was right to cut it out at the start.  Then, again, I doubt the sincerity of Senator Keane in advocating that justice has not been done to the Dublin Unemployed Workers movement. I am just as interested in the workers as Senator Keane, and I feel that, if something were not published in connection with those workers there must be some reason for it, as in the case of his remarks in connection with the I.R.A.  I, for one, think that the Irish people are quite satisfied with the censorship as it is, and we hope that nothing, so long as the present crisis lasts, will alter that position.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, in reciting some of the bodies <Col N="2599" /> whose communications were censored in the daily Press, referred to the Trades Union Congress and their action in connection with refugees.  I want to correct that mistake.  The Trades Union Congress never considered the question of refugees and never expressed any views about censorship. I want to clear up that matter before making a few remarks on the motion before us.  If I were a theorist, instead of a realist, I should unhesitatingly subscribe to the fine principles expounded by Deputy Alton and other Senators.  I, too, believe in the freedom of the Press, but I am not such a fool as to think that this is a time when we can fully subscribe to the fine principles enunciated by these Senators.</P>
      <P>I mix among the people of this State probably more than any man in the House, and I know that the predominant anxiety of the people of this State is to keep out of the war.  They would be prepared to sacrifice a lot to achieve that.  It is easy for these fine theorists to come here and indulge in this high-falutin' talk about freedom when what they mean is not freedom but licence.  I wonder to what extent these spontaneous communications which Senator Sir John Keane received are representative of the views of the real people of the country. Would they be more representative of the views of the retired, choleric type of colonel who would like to see the country involved in the present war? I have grave doubts as to the volume of this correspondence.</P>

      <P>It may not be but the spiritual home of the people concerned is not in this country.  I can speak for the organised workers of this country. We represent a quarter of a million of them and we have heard no great outcry against the censorship.  What workers fear is not the position that might be created by some form of censorship but the economic consequences <Col N="2600" /> likely to affect them as a result of this war.  As I said, I mix with all these people and I mix in other circles, represented by 15 or 16 bodies in Dublin, ranging from the Committee of Mountjoy Prison, where I spend a considerable amount of time, to people who are more intellectual than those who complain of the censorship, and I can find amongst those people no great outcry against the censorship.  There is a little coterie in this country who affect to be devotees at the shrine of liberal thought and who do not like censorship of books, nor our divorce laws nor many other things which people of this country favour.  That is the type which I think is responsible for the storm in a teacup this evening.  I am saying that as, to some extent, a representative of the people.</P>
      <P>I have been associated with newspaper life for 32 years, both at the technical end and in dealing with people at that end, and I say that there is a considerable amount of vexation not only amongst the editorial but amongst the technical staffs because of the way they are held up by censorship and the rush which is necessary at the last moment to get the paper to press.  A classic example of that which was cited to me was this: in the bad weather following last Christmas, a photograph was taken of Westmoreland Street on a very wet day.  There was not a soul on the street and only a bus could be seen.  That photograph was refused publication.  I thought that was fatuous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff of this particular paper has a partiality for that type.  During August I was down on holidays in Wicklow.  I read this paper every day, though Senators might think I read the other two.  On the submission of the leading article to the censor, it was cut up so badly that the editor said: &ldquo;To hell with it; I will put in no leading article&rdquo;.  And he put in a paragraph on slang.  I do not know whether that was a good substitute for a leading article or not, but <Col N="2601" /> I am informed that he was so wild he took the whole thing out and put in this paragraph on slang.  Senator Sir John Keane referred to the communications of certain bodies being censored in the Press.  I think there must be some good reason for that censorship. These bodies are out to cause disaffection&mdash;I do not refer to the body you are, probably, all thinking about. I do not want to incur the risk of being brought before the Special Tribunal.  There are other bodies who are out not alone to cause disaffection in the State, but disaffection among their fellow workers.  There is, probably, good reason for suppressing the activities of these bodies.</P>
      <P>I do not want unduly to prolong this debate, which was very interesting. While there is a great deal of justification for the censorship at the present time, I think some effort ought to be made to relax the censorship in so far as domestic news is concerned.  I make no charge whatever against the officials of the censorship office.  I know some of them personally and some of them by repute.  The journalist concerned is a man eminent in his profession, and very fair-minded.  I am sure that he would do nothing to hurt the newspapers of this city or country.  We have had something in the nature of a storm in a teacup. There is an element in this country which does not like censorship of any kind.  They call themselves devotees of the liberal school of thought.  They must not forget that the vast majority of the people favour censorship&mdash;not alone the censorship we are discussing at the present time, but censorship in other matters in respect of which we hear complaints from these particular bodies from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody said that the censorship was becoming tighter and tighter. We are told by the Taoiseach and other responsible Ministers that the position is becoming graver and graver so far as this country is concerned. I wonder how those people, who profess so much concern about censorship, would feel if, as a result of <Col N="2602" /> relaxation of the censorship, a crisis were to occur here?  I do not want to be personal but the vast majority of us have to live in our own homes in this country and we have got to be very careful.  It may appear that I am a bit of an agnostic so far as the labour outlook is concerned.  I do not make any secret of that inside my own Party or outside it.  I believe that the censorship we have is necessary but I would like some relaxation of that censorship, in so far as domestic news is concerned.  I know the difficulties under which newspapers are working at the present time, not alone in respect of news but in respect of the whole production of newspapers.  We have a sympathetic man in the censorship office&mdash;the eminent professional man to whom I have referred&mdash;and I am sure he will see that every effort is made to render these restrictions less severe in future.</P>

      <P>After all that has been said on this subject I do not propose to keep the House very long.  I am in agreement with the last speaker as regards the necessity for censorship. These are abnormal times, and censorship is a product of abnormal times. Censorship is compact, to some extent, of tyranny and despotism.  It must be, because any other weapons are incapable of grappling with such an emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is compact of these two, to a certain extent, and must needs be.  Desperate diseases require desperate remedies, and when the ship of State is tumbling about in stormy waters it is no time to quarrel with the admonitions, or even the curses, of the pilot.  I am really intrigued as to all this pother about censorship, coming as it does from those who are advocates of this present motion.  I seem to visualise a time not so very long ago, in the time of the late Arthur Griffith &mdash;shades of <i>The Spark,</i> shades of <i>The United Irishman</i>, shades of <i>Scissors and Paste</i>, and where were all the <Col N="2603" /> advocates of censorship then, or the advocates, I should rather say, of free speech then?  No.  They were too busily engaged in turning the screw on the unfortunate people who eventually made this Assembly possible and now they have the audacity to come forward as the advocates of free speech.</P>
      <P>I am emboldened greatly by the latitude given by the Cathaoirleach, and if I only chose to wander as far afield as some of the previous speakers, I would probably have to range from China to Peru on this motion.  I cannot help thinking how desirable it would be if the censorship were ten-fold tighter, not merely in this particular instance but in the more universal case of ordinary current censorship in normal times.  More damage has been done&mdash;and I am particularly anxious to get this in&mdash;by the literature which has come to our shores by the ton from another country than could possibly be done by any want of free speech.  Of course, I cannot pursue that topic.</P>
      <P>I may add that in my opinion the censorship is not half tight enough&mdash; sensation in court!  If, on the one hand, the windy and rather flambuoyant rhetoric of the Continent is debarred, I do not see why Imperial tripe should not be debarred also, but, of course, I cannot pursue that subject either.  Senator Campbell referred to the fact that he mixes with ordinary people.  I think I also can say that I mix with the ordinary rank and file, and, speaking for them, I can say that I know they do not give a twopenny ticket about the censorship.  They are more concerned in seeing that their homes and altars are safeguarded from the ultimate maelstrom than in picking holes in a Government which has assiduously tried to do its best for the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Journalists, on the whole, are certainly a far-seeing tactful body.  I have every admiration for them.  I had a little to do with the Press, ranging from being an editor for one dizzy week about 30 golden years ago, to writing notes under the title of &ldquo;Linesman&rdquo;<Col N="2604" /> or some equally nebulous name, of having my proofs and my bad grammar corrected and my solecisms regulated by competent artists, and I have the utmost admiration for the profession. Whether it be a case of judicial ignorance or not I do not know, but I heard Senator Tunney say that he did not know who the Press censor was.  I think we all know who the Press censor is.  He is a man who made a name for himself in instructing Parliamentary neophytes in the niceties of Parliamentary debate.  I think we should be ever grateful to him.  He has a hard row to hoe, particularly in times such as the present when things are looking rather ominous in Europe.</P>
    <P>In my opinion now is not the time to quibble at restrictions, however troublesome they may seem, because they are absolutely necessary in times such as these.  On the principle that out of a ton of pitch blende you can make a dwt. of radium, there may be something in the criticism voiced by the Opposition.  But if I were in a position to address a word of advice to the Press censor&mdash;of course, I am addressing a mythical censor and speaking in a purely Pickwickian sense&mdash;I think I would say something like this: &ldquo;Be as despotic as you please, because the more you are the more it will be welcomed; be unreasonable because censorship does not admit of reason in stormy times, but, for goodness' sake, do not be petulant and do not be fatuous.&rdquo; Remember I am addressing a mythical censor, one who does not exist, and I am speaking absolutely in a Pickwickian sense.  I had the good fortune to see sometime within the last 12 months a blue-pencilled proof, not a very desperate document, but incorporated in that proof, which was blue-pencilled throughout, I observed that 50 per cent. of it was composed of paragraphs which had occupied space in the daily Press three or four days previously.  Now I do not know what exactly one is to judge from that: whether in a fit of weariness the Press censor blue-pencilled the whole thing with a feeling of &ldquo;Here be damned to it,&rdquo; or whether he favoured the daily <Col N="2605" /> Press as against the provincial Press. If so, are we to take it that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What in the captain is but a choleric word,</P>
    <P>That in the private is rank blasphemy&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It may have been a case of mere slipshodness, if I may coin a word.  If so, I think it is quite regrettable.  I think the essence of censorship is that it should be perfectly impartial.  We know the difficulties under which the censor labours at times.  I do respectfully submit that an article containing 50 per cent. of matter which had already appeared in the daily Press should not necessarily be blue-pencilled wholesale, but that there should be, so to speak, a process of selective elimination.  As I have said already, I, like Senator Campbell, have a good deal to do with the ordinary people.  I have been touched by their misfortunes.  They have been touched by mine, and&mdash;I have been touched by them.  I have no hesitation in saying that the censorship, unreasonable as it may appear, is dictated by the exigencies and the circumstances of the time, and I fail to see what purpose could be achieved by a discussion of this kind, if it were not to assure the choleric colonels of Senator Campbell's vivid imagination an arena in which to pose as champions of freedom and an audience to which they are perhaps not unjustly entitled.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Senator Tunney when he says that this debate is a waste of time.  I would be rather more inclined to agree with Senator Tierney when he said that it was a valuable discussion, and that I should welcome the debate. I agree also with Senator Tierney when he stresses the need for caution in censorship, and that there is always the danger of going too far.  Now, it is over 15 months since the censorship powers were given to the Government by the Dáil and by the Seanad.  Since that time some billions and billions of words have passed through the censorship department, and while the blue <Col N="2606" /> pencil has had to be used occasionally, I think it is a tribute to the censorship staff that, working at the high pressure it has been working at, all the complaints that could be made against it is what has been trotted out here this evening.  I say: &ldquo;All the complaints that could be made against it&rdquo; and I think that is largely true, because Senator Sir John Keane's motion did not come forward here secretly or without advertisement.</P>
      <P>He had a motion down several weeks ago in somewhat similar terms and he got the advertisement of putting that down and withdrawing it.  Those who have been censored read that advertisement and, if they had any grievance, all they had to do was to send it along to Senator Sir John Keane.  From his own testimony here to-day, he got huge volumes of complaints, and I take it that, wanting to make the best possible case he could for his motion, he gave us the cream of the cases he got.  I am prepared to deal with the cream of the complaints he got one by one.  Unfortunately, I am at this disadvantage, that I have to think of a situation that might be created if I replied to some of his remarks in the way I should like to reply, and nothing would give me greater pleasure, if this war ever ends and I and Senator Sir John Keane are alive, than to have a debate on censorship and on what has happened.</P>
      <P>Within my limitations, however, I propose to deal with what he has said. There is one remark I want to pass in the beginning.  It is that if I saw a wolf's tail sticking out through a lamb's skin, I would not be more suspicious than if I saw Senator Sir John Keane's head sticking out from an I.R.A. plus Communist robe.  He accuses us bitterly here to-day of having suppressed certain figures as to the number of members of an illegal organisation in jail and of having suppressed the effusions of a Communist who was here under several aliases, whose organisation was suppressed for three months and then took on a new name, and whose principal object was to deny the right of any body, corporation, government or private individual to receive rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2607" /> Senator Sir John Keane's big complaint, the complaint of which he made the most, was the prohibition of a report of the poisoning of certain fish in a river at Mallow.  What are the facts of the case?  A report on that matter did actually appear in one Irish paper and an attempt was made to send out of the country a version of the poisoning of these fish.  The facts are that a couple of dozen salmon were poisoned by the Mallow Beet Factory and that every effort was being made by the Department of Fisheries to bring pressure to bear on the sugar beet people to remedy that position. A few dozen salmon were, in fact, poisoned.  The report which was leaving this country was that, for ten miles, the river was choked with fish, that you could walk across the river on their backs and that for another couple of hundred years, no one might ever come to fish in that river.  I must say that the censorship department yielded to the temptation to stop that sort of nonsense.  It might have been going a little too far, but it yielded to the temptation to stop that story for 24 hours until the Department of Fisheries told the truth about the matter.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience in this country for a long time of certain scare stories which would do this country, or portions of this country, irreparable damage being sent out by certain irresponsible people, who are not, in fact, professional journalists at all. Taking them by and large, the professional journalist of this country is an honourable man.  He thinks of his country, and does not want to do the State as a whole, or any portion of it, any harm, and he will not earn a few pennies by crying it down, but there are some people in this country&mdash;and we have got tabs on them fairly well this last year or so&mdash;who are prepared to do anything.  They are not professional journalists at all, but they are prepared to send stories out of this country, no matter how untrue and no matter how much damage they may do to this country or other countries, simply in order to get a few pence out of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2608" /> That is aside altogether from this case.  I was led on to say it and I agree with Senator Tierney that, in this particular case, it is debatable whether we went too far or not, but I am giving the facts of the case, that it appeared to the Department of Fisheries that if this lie got out and got 24 hours' advance of the truth, it would have a very bad effect on the people in the locality along that river who are earning their livelihood in keeping people who come there to fish. There should be some way of dealing with irresponsible statements of that kind and I think that, in ordinary times, we should have a law that a man who does deliberate damage like that should be taken by the back of the neck and given a couple of years in jail. However, the censor interfered and used his powers to stop it.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which Senator Sir John Keane referred was a letter about agricultural statistics which was being sent abroad.  He said he was going to deal with domestic matters and then he accused us of stopping a letter which was going abroad containing some agricultural statistics.  I do not know what the letter was and the officials who are here do not know what the letter was.  We have not been able to trace it since Senator Sir John Keane spoke, but if the Senator sends me the letter, a copy of it, or some reference to it, we will look it up and trace it, if we can.  But, anyway, it is not a domestic matter.  According to his story, it was a letter containing agricultural statistics going out of the country.  I take it the agricultural statistics were published here and, if they were, I can only say that the devil sometimes can quote scripture, and people who want to cause trouble can sometimes write a letter abroad twisting statistics around.  As far as agricultural statistics here are concerned, everybody knows that they are published in the country.  There are certain figures which have not been published by the statistical bureau, those are the details of certain exports, but Senator Keane was not alluding to them.  The next violent crime we committed was to strike out an emblem in <Col N="2609" /> a photograph for a Dublin paper. That was done quite deliberately.  We were not going to let the editor play the little game that he had in mind. He had quite a number of photographs to publish of the same thing if he wanted to do it, and he could have done it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are anxious to get the principles of censorship, would the Minister mind explaining what was the motive for suppressing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The motive for suppressing that was this: As far as I remember it was a photograph of the L.S.F. meeting at College Green.  There was an emblem on one corner of the Bank of Ireland, and this particular photograph, we thought anyway, was taken deliberately in order to get that emblem in, and to put it over the L.S.F. meeting to try and attribute a certain complexion to the L.S.F.  It was for that reason we cut it out.  The Senator also said that the announcement of the death of an Irishman was prohibited. As I said before, that is not true. There might have been propagandist paragraphs about the death of the Irishman prohibited, but the announcement of the death was not prohibited. He said that we prohibited the publication of the photograph of an Irishman who distinguished himself abroad.  That was probably done, but I cannot deal with it without going beyond domestic matters.  The Senator said, in reference to a play which was taken off a Dublin stage, that the censorship suggested words to a Dublin editor in connection with the report on the matter.  That, as far as I am aware, is not true.  What was objected to was a Dublin editor censoring a Government statement.  All that was said was: &ldquo;You must publish those words which are in the Government statement; otherwise you do not publish it at all.&rdquo;  If that was not what was said&mdash;I hope it was said&mdash;whatever was said was to the effect that as he would not publish the whole of the statement, he must cut it all out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons, I think, why newspaper editors&mdash;although we get <Col N="2610" /> along fairly well with them&mdash;do not like censorship is that they themselves have been acting as censors all their lives.  It is no change to the ordinary people of the country to have myself and my staff acting as censor.  It is only a change of function from the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> to myself and my staff.  It is we who have the final O.K. on what to cut out instead of the editors, and, in certain circumstances, when the country is in such grave danger as it is in at the moment, I think the people are better pleased that the censorship should be in the hands of somebody who is responsible to the Parliament elected by the people rather than of persons who are appointed by boards of directors and have no responsibility to the people, although normally they act in a decent way towards them.  I have already alluded to Senator Keane's condemnation of the censorship because we prevented some publicity that was issued by the Kimmage and Crumlin Town Tenants' Association, and I do not want to go any further than I have done.  There was another matter which the Senator raised, and that was that certain publicity issued by the Trade Unions Congress in regard to air raid victims was suppressed.  That is true, because at that time the Government were negotiating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is a matter with which I cannot deal fully without going beyond domestic matters.  However, <Col N="2611" /> I can say this, that at that particular time the Government were negotiating with the British Government for the reception here of refugees &mdash;more refugees than we have had up to the present&mdash;and we did not want a body like the Dublin Trade Unions Council butting in on that matter until the Government here had settled the major question with the British Government. However, the matter is now approaching a successful conclusion, and we expect an announcement to be made about it in a short time.</P>
      <P>Senator Keane and others raised the question of the staff who are dealing with censorship.  I also saw a complaint in to-day's <i>Irish Times</i> that the staff who are there should get some help in dealing with leading articles written by &ldquo;educated men of long and wide experience.&rdquo;  The gentlemen who are censoring the leading articles of this and other papers may not scatter Latin and German words around so freely as the leader writer of the <i>Irish Times,</i> but they are quite competent to censor a leading article or any item of news; they are quite competent to do it on their own initiative in accordance with the instructions they have got, and if at any time there is any question or any doubt they can refer to the higher officials of the censorship branch or to myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that quite frequently the 'phone is used not alone to the higher officials but to myself, at all hours of the day and night, and the men who are on duty are encouraged to consult others in the carrying out of censorship.  Nobody need think that we have any exact yard-stick in the matter of censorship. This weighing up of words is a very difficult matter and, for my own part, in certain cases, I like to consult others.  We like to discuss the matter with the staff and with other people in particular cases.  The censorship staff who are on duty at night are encouraged to do that among themselves, to discuss and to consult higher authority if they are in any doubt. One would think, to hear the criticisms <Col N="2612" /> of the staff that are there at night, that they were not competent to deal with these matters.  Of course they are competent. You have men of the rank of assistant principal, higher executive officer and so on, but if you had an angel from heaven, an editor, when some little word of his is cut out, wants an appeal to somebody higher.  It is not because of the rank of the men that are doing the censorship; it is because there is any censorship at all.  The editors of the country, as I said, have been acting for a long time as their own censors and would prefer to carry on that position if they were allowed to do it.  I may say, too, that, largely speaking, they do carry out their own censorship and it is only when they have any doubt that they consult the censor.  I must repeat here what has been said from all sides of the House, that the censorship staff and the newspapers get on very well indeed, and we have found that on the whole the newspapers are co-operating with the censorship staff to see that nothing gets into the papers that is either going to create internal trouble or trouble between ourselves and other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been mentioned several times and I think it is up to me to reply to it.  Even if it were only mentioned once I would have to do it. I will drop it by saying that I have every confidence in every man who is dealing with Press censorship to do his job and to do it well, and that if he has any doubt he will consult higher authority and, if there is any doubt about any matter, that there will be a general consultation before the thing is finally cut out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would say, as a matter of illustration, is the Press censor responsible to the Minister direct or to the chief censor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>He is really responsible to both.  The fact of the matter is that <Col N="2613" /> the Press censor very often deals directly with myself about matters. He rings me up&mdash;just as other members of the censorship staff deal directly with me, too&mdash;at night if there is an urgent case, and that is very, very often, I may tell you.  For 15 months I have never been more than a couple of hours away from a 'phone, and it has been used pretty often, at very inconvenient hours in the morning, too.</P>
      <P>One other criticism was that there should be somebody higher than the men who were there.  As a matter of fact, the chief Press censor is there very often himself at night and always if he anticipates that anything is likely to crop up that would be a delicate matter to deal with.  The newspaper editors of the city and throughout the country know perfectly well on what matters there is likely to be a dispute about the wording and all they have got to do is to 'phone and the Press censor himself would be there if necessary. But apart altogether from the Press censor, the other staff are high officials.  They are a very efficient staff and are quite capable of carrying out their orders and, if they have any doubt about their orders, they consult before they act.  I think that is all that was in Senator Sir John Keane's basket.  Senator Crosbie more or less dealt with himself.  Senator Hayes made the point that there was more freedom allowed in other countries than here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And, to go a little bit further than that, take the expenditure that neutral nations and belligerent nations make on warlike preparations.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Japan had the navy out but Switzerland had nearly half her man power under arms during the whole of the war.  Again, in this particular war I am sure, for instance, that Switzerland has spent very much more as a neutral than New Zealand has spent.  It is simply a matter of location.  We are prepared here to give, either in peace or in war or in time of neutrality, as much freedom as we can and only to exercise the censorship to the minimum degree that is necessary to keep our country safe.  By and large, we operate this censorship, <Col N="2615" /> as I think somebody said here to-night, to keep temperature down internally and to prevent it from rising between ourselves and other countries.  On that matter we have to remember that propaganda is now one of the most important weapons of war, and there are some nations spending more energy and brains and man power on propaganda than they are on some other vital arms of their armed forces.</P>
      <P>We have to realise that that is so.  No matter what the law of nations, the Hague Convention, may say, and even though it allows neutrals to be belligerent in their words, provided they are not belligerent in their acts, nowadays if nations want to keep out of war they have got to be neutral in their words as well as in their deeds. That is the reason I say to Senator Hayes that it may be true, and I will not deny, that there is more freedom and less censorship in other countries than here but, if that is so, I am sure, if the governments are wise, it is because they are less dangerously situated than we are.</P>
      <P>Now, I think I have dealt with the matter that was mentioned as to the person to whom an appeal can be made.  I have never refused to see anybody on a question of censorship, and if there is any editor or any other man aggrieved, he can always, if it is one of the Press censorship staff who is concerned, make an appeal to the Press censor himself.  It is true, as Senator Hayes says, that there is a tendency in human nature to go too far with everything, even with censorship; but I think we have been doing all that men can do to fight that tendency.  We try to use the blue pencil as little as we can and, unless it affects the safety of the State, either in internal or external affairs, it is allowed to go through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator raised another very important question, but I cannot deal too freely with it.  He asked should the members of the Dáil and Seanad be prohibited from giving their views on any subject to their fellow-citizens.  By way of reply to that I would say this much, that even the Government cannot declare war. The Dáil has reserved that right to itself. The Government cannot act.  It is the Government's duty to keep the peace until the Dáil declares war.  In these days words are sometimes very much more dangerous than bombs.  The Government could without an act, without any overt or positive physical act, embroil this country in war.  It could do so simply by saying something, particularly if it said something that was bad enough or something less bad often enough.  The Government cannot embroil the country in war; at least it has no legal right to do it and neither has any individual.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out before, propaganda is now a major weapon of war.  We have got to treat it as such and walk warily in the zone of propaganda. Senators and Deputies will have to walk warily in that zone also, just the same as the Government does.  No individual or no Government has the right to embroil the country in a war. As regards the censoring of Parliamentary debates, the only way in which the Official Report can be censored is, I think, by agreement with the Ceann Comhairle and the Deputy, or the Deputy's Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to newspaper reports, they are censored if they are thought to be dangerous.  We must realise the circumstances by which we are surrounded. <Col N="2619" /> We can debate certain things here in the Seanad rather more freely than we would debate them if we thought everything we said was going to appear in the newspapers.  I do not like secret sessions at all.  I would rather have public sessions and then cut out anything that is indiscreet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I have better judgment than most people in that regard.  I was delighted to hear Senator MacDermot quote Wolfe Tone's statement that the exercise of power could corrupt angels.  Well, I am no angel, so I hope it will not corrupt me. We have no despotic authority in this matter.  We are limited by law in what we can do.  We are limited by commonsense and we are open to criticism in the Dáil.  Senator MacDermot made a suggestion here about a consultative committee.  My reply to that point is that I made that suggestion in the Dáil over 12 months ago, and it did not commend itself, it appears, to the other Parties in the House.  From my experience since, I think it was a good job.</P>

      <P>The Opposition was right.  I was somewhat over-enthusiastic in my offer to them in those days. I think it is better that there should be one censor, a person upon whom the responsibility for the censorship can be placed.  In this particular instance, I am not shirking any responsibility.  I am completely and absolutely responsible for the censorship.  It is better that we should have a clear-cut and definite responsibility rather than try and put the responsibility on some committee that will not have any control because you cannot divorce <Col N="2620" /> authority from responsibility nor responsibility from authority in this matter.</P>

      <P>I did not say that I regarded myself as an angel.  I am, therefore, not so corruptible as a human angel might be.  I think I have dealt pretty fully with all the points Senator MacDermot put forward. Most of the other Senators covered the same ground.  Senator Douglas asked if records were kept.  Records are kept of anything we cut out of matters submitted to us.  They are there to be seen and can be turned up if necessary. He said that we were cutting out certain things which appeared in the Six Counties and which should have appeared here.  Well, unfortunately, we have not control in the Six Counties yet, and if we had they would be cut out there, too.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Senator had in mind, and seeing that I am not too clear, and he has not told me, I shall not delay further with it. Senator Douglas also said that there was a general impression that things were happening here which were not in fact happening, and that the people were not getting the truth.  The people of this country are pretty cute and, as far as domestic matters are concerned, they do not have to depend on the papers for news.  There is a real whispering gallery or some secret method of signalling by which news can be disseminated over the whole of our territory within a short time.  Whatever happens within the country, they know of it pretty well.  I think, as the war goes on, they will become even more accustomed to discerning truth from untruth in regard to domestic affairs. In regard to foreign affairs, they can hear both sides of the story by sitting at the many thousands of wireless sets which are in the country.</P>

      <P>They can split the difference. I do not see why we should get into trouble in regard to telling them things that are said by both sides.  If they want to know of these things, they can listen in.  I challenge anybody in this country to spend the whole of the night at a wireless set, listen to the news and views from all the countries in the world, belligerent and otherwise, and then turn to the newspapers afterwards to see if he does not get a fair representation of the news from the whole world as well as news of domestic affairs.  It is recognised on the Continent and elsewhere that both our newspapers and our wireless station publish the most objective and the best reports of the war, taking practically the whole world.  There is a lot of flap-doodle and propaganda cut out, but the bones of the news are left, and they can always get at the truth.</P>

      <P>We shall see.  I think I have dealt fairly well, with every point that has been raised.  Generally speaking, in reply to Senator Alton, I agree that there is a danger of going too far.  It is not to-day or yesterday that we realised that.  We realised at the outset that there was a danger of going too far and we decided that we would only go as far as was necessary. I think, by and large, we have lived up to our resolution in that regard. I am not going to say that we are perfect or that we may not have made some some mistakes now and again but the cases mentioned here to-day represented the entire collection that could be made after every crank and every decent man in the country, whose views were suppressed or whose anger was aroused because we had interfered in some way with their beautiful phrases whenever they felt the urge to write or to speak, had an opportunity of formulating their charges against us.  They knew this motion <Col N="2622" /> was coming on for discussion to-day; yet these cases represent the only complaints that could be made.  I think that is not a bad record after 15 months.</P>

We have no complaint at all as to the way in which the Minister has treated the motion.  I am only too glad to admit that he has made a very good case for his Department but I hope he will also concede that there was justification for this motion and that on the whole it will do good.  It will clear the air and set at rest a certain kind of anxiety that does undoubtedly exist, not merely amongst journalists but amongst a large number of ordinary responsible citizens.  I think that the House has every reason to congratulate itself on the manner in which it has handled this debate, and the sense of responsibility which has governed all the remarks made by Senators.  There are only two points which are rather vitally important to which I should make a reply.  The Minister suggested that the emblem taken out of the photograph was put there deliberately.  I do not think that was fair.  I do not think for a moment that a responsible journalist would go to the trouble or that a newspaper would be so malign as to place responsible Ministers in a position that might be anyway embarrassing or give a false impression.  If you look at the photograph you will see that if it appeared without it the photograph would be very queer.  I think the Minister, on further reflection, may be inclined to agree that the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; was not justified.</P>

    <P>The Minister said that papers largely carry on their own censorship.  I am interested to hear that, because my information is that everything is submitted. Perhaps the papers find it more convenient to submit everything. All their leaders I understand are submitted sooner than run the risk of getting into trouble after publication. <Col N="2623" /> Of course in England the practice is different.  There editors take responsibility. The Minister also said that his powers were limited by law.  I do not want to enlarge on that, but I did not know that practically there was any limitation on the powers of the censorship. I understood it cut out anything and everything.  That is all I have to say.  Naturally, I do not intend to carry this motion to a division.  The <Col N="2624" /> Minister would not admit it, but I have no doubt that it has served and will serve a salutary purpose and justify the position of Parliament in safeguarding the citizens, and as a check indirectly on possible excesses on the part of Government.</P>
