	<P>I have notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to clarify if there are standards in place for noise levels in pubs and clubs for live bands and other music sources and if any inspections have taken place to monitor such noise and, if not, if there are plans to introduce such guidelines.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the need for a permanent school building for Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige, Clondalkin, Dublin, and the request that the siting of the permanent building at the school&rsquo;s current location be pursued by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to outline his proposals for the cohesion of the partnership companies and Leader action groups in Roscommon and Leitrim.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is two years since the establishment of the Health Service Executive, which was supposed to herald a new dawn for health services.  Anybody reading the papers in recent days will realise this new dawn does not appear to have materialised, because there seems to be increased turbulence in the health sector.</P>
        <P>Yesterday we had a discussion on the National Development Plan 2007-2013 in which we were told &euro;180 billion would be spent in the next seven years.  Quality of life is very important to people at this time and no issue is more pertinent to that than health.</P>
        <P>Some 27,000 members of a union, in all categories of the health services, yesterday threatened to ballot on industrial action in May.  Nurses are very upset and Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers on a committee aired their own grievances over the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We believe in free speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does anyone listen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>They appeared to call for a softening of attitude on the question of nurses&rsquo; wages.  Today the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, expresses surprise at the reaction of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers because all she is doing is implementing Government policy.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney, promised in the programme for Government that there would be contracts for consultants.  Now, with an imminent general election, there is still turbulence between consultants and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>What has gone wrong?  A photograph yesterday in a newspaper showing a CAT scanner, for which volunteers had raised funds, lying in a basement in Louth County Hospital, Dundalk, next to the dirty linen, is an indictment of the health services.  Staff have not even been recruited to operate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want people hired without a contract?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government says a great deal on partnership and so on, but it should get on with its business and do the job for which it was elected.  From outside, the health service appears to be in anarchy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport has announced the name of the person to be put in charge of the Dublin transportation authority and the Railway Procurement Agency.  Without casting aspersions, that person resigned from a semi-State body on the basis of issues that could have been of embarrassment to it.  That the appointment is being made without reference to anyone is extraordinary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1963"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>During the past 20 years, Senator Ross and others on these benches have tabled the idea of an appointments procedure in respect of State boards.  The Leader will recall that in the Seanad review, we proposed that the House should vet or meet anyone whose name had been put forward to sit on boards or in the chair of a semi-State body.</P>
        <P>I do not want to reflect on the person in question, as he might be the person for the job, but there is a lack of trust and confidence.  This is not the way to do business.  It is an embarrassment to the Government and a bad start to the new approach to transport.  We should urge the Government to establish a committee in the House to vet those put forward to sit on State boards or to chair semi-State bodies.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the appropriate Minister to address the House on An Post?  Recently, a delegation from the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service returned from a trip to New Zealand where we met with the Kiwibank, which is owned by New Zealand Post and is profitable after four years in operation.  It is opening branches in parts of the country where the main banks have closed and it is giving new life to local communities.  A state-owned body, it provides a fantastic service and people are switching accounts to it in their droves.  In terms of the future of rural Ireland and its post offices, it would be a helpful for the House to debate the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday in Dublin, there was a meeting of representatives of people working in the health services other than doctors and nurses, namely, support staff, clerical staff, etc.  Their simple demand was for the people who are paid to manage the health services to do so.  Their complaint, which was articulated in a dozen ways, focused on one issue, that is, no one will take a decision or responsibility.  This situation obtained before and after the HSE was set up.  No amount of superficial gloss or expensive publicity will distract us from the fundamental problem of the health services, namely, those who call themselves managers are not allowed or are unwilling to manage.  It is not the only problem.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the quality of the health services&rsquo; management?  We should ignore the doctors, consultants and nurses for a while.  Let us hear the stories of those of us who, unlike myself, served on health boards and know about the quality of management in the health services.</P>
        <P>I met a nurse who is doing her second masters degree.  She told me of the list of qualifications for her job, whereas only a good level of education was required for a managerial position that was advertised.  Technical people have specific requirements, but management people only need to talk their way into jobs, which is a problem.  We should discuss the process through which managers are picked.</P><Col N="1964"/>
        <P>On the nurses&rsquo; grievances, while a newspaper headline stated that the Taoiseach said the claim would cost &euro;1 billion, he stated that it would actually cost between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  If ever I wanted a good example of the Government&rsquo;s inability to cost anything, it is the fact that the margin of error is 100%.  If this is the best the Government can do, it should not manage anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader check the status of the proposed pharmacy Bill, which was promised some time ago?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union lobbied Oireachtas Members.  The IPU represents 1,600 community pharmacists who are concerned that the HSE will not enter into meaningful discussions with them.  The HSE refuses to negotiate with the IPU, which represents all pharmacists throughout the country, but is prepared to negotiate with the Irish Medical Organisation and others.  The health boards were willing to negotiate with the IPU, a reputable representative body, when we were among their members.</P>
        <P>The IPU has raised concerns about the idea of linking pharmacies to medical practices.  As the buildings in which practices are housed are owned by doctors, they would get preferential treatment as far as the dispensing of medicines is concerned.  They would have a vested interest in ensuring that high-cost medicine would be used instead of generic medicine, which is cheaper.  They would have no reason to reduce the amount of drugs dispensed, as the dispensary owned by the medical practice would get the benefit.  Serious issues must be examined and the Bill should tackle the situation.</P>
        <P>That we are proud to be members of a Government party does not mean we can turn a blind eye to, for example, the transport of elderly persons to their medical appointments.  I know of an ophthalmic case involving an 80 year old woman.  Her file was examined in Castlebar rather than Roscommon to assess whether she should receive transport to meet an ophthalmic surgeon next Tuesday in Galway.  Why will the surgeon not go to Roscommon to meet clients?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should turn around and ask the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator no Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition was enthusiastic when the HSE was adopted, but I did not see much opposition to the dispensing with of the health boards.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>What is Senator Leyden&rsquo;s question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate to determine the Department&rsquo;s opinion on this matter would be worthwhile.  As far as policy is concerned, the Minister has the final say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is hiding behind the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE runs the health services, but this is a typical example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is running the HSE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>As the files must be moved from Roscommon to Castlebar, it will cost more to assess and process the woman&rsquo;s claim than it would to provide her with transport to Galway next Tuesday.  Why will the HSE not arrange for the health professional to hold a clinic in Roscommon to avoid my client driving to Galway to meet the specialist?  It would be a worthwhile debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We could have an Adjournment debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>And votes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be ideal, but an opportunity may not arise in the next few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments.  The more issues one dodges in this life, the better one will be rewarded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The man paid his taxes.</P>

	<P>He did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not discuss the particulars of the case at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is crazy for a Minister to reward someone who was forced to resign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>He is tax compliant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding transport, I am seeking a debate on rural services.  We have heard much about transport in respect of rural pubs, but services such as communication must be included in the debate.  For example, An Post is pulling out of Roscrea, a large provincial town in the heart of rural Ireland.  It cannot manage its business profitably and it pulls out.  The same is happening with broadband, which is not freely available in rural areas.  The few remaining people who have businesses in rural Ireland cannot accept payment using a card because of the inadequacy of the telephone lines.  This is the situation after ten years of delivery of services by this Government <Col N="1966"/>&mdash; there are no pubs, shops, Garda stations or communications in many areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It has spread to Longford?  I thought only Bandon was experiencing this phenomenon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a crisis and I ask the Leader to organise a debate as soon as possible on services in rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should get out more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator went home more often he might know what the situation is like.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be a debate on health services.  Listening to the other side of the House, one would swear on a mass book that the Minister for Health and Children was responsible for the laundry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Senator&rsquo;s side that raised the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will say to the far side of the House that it could not get rid of the health boards quickly enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators should not speak to the other side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>My remarks are directed to that side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, got rid of the health boards.  The Senator has amnesia.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not tar us all with the same brush.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden referred to medicines.  A sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Health and Children has almost completed a report on the adverse effects of pharmaceuticals which will make for an interesting debate.  All Members of this House should call for legislation to curb the availability of drugs on-line.  This has serious implications for public health and we should be as one to ensure this practice is stopped.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children is a gutsy and courageous Minister who is doing a difficult job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is she doing a good job?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>To listen to some people in this House, one would swear she was responsible for laundry, cleaning and everything else.  Talk about maturity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the remarks by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Coonan about the appoint<Col N="1967"/>ment to the RPA.  It is strange that someone is good enough for the RPA but not good enough for Aer Lingus.  There is an inconsistency that I cannot understand and it should be explained to us.  We are entitled to accountability on appointments of this sort and we are not getting it.</P>
        <P>What I find difficult about this appointment is not so much the reason the person appointed left Aer Lingus, but that he was in charge of AIB Bank at a time when afterwards it had to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be wise to go into the history of the person who was appointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a wise person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not advisable to go into the man&rsquo;s history.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us just say that AIB Bank was forced to pay a fine of &euro;90 million for a period for much of which this person was in charge.  There are questions to be answered about that.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  I share the concerns expressed on all sides of the House about the health service.  Specifically, I cannot understand the reluctance to discuss the very delicate and sensitive nurses&rsquo; claim.  The nurses should be conceded this claim, 10% or not, because they deserve it for good and humane reasons and because the market will demand the claim be conceded sooner or later.</P>
        <P>It is unconvincing for people to say we cannot grant it because the nurses must be trapped within social partnership.  The nurses&rsquo; claim is one of the great arguments against social partnership.  They cannot be given the 10% they deserve because everyone is terrified of other groups making similar claims.  That is one of the major flaws in social partnership.  When people deserve a large claim like this, they will not be given it by the Government because it is frightened of breaching the silly rules it made itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator moving an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I move an amendment to the Order of Business, &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann discusses as its first item of business today the nurses&rsquo; pay claim.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane was correct in all he said this morning about the state of the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we know if risk equalisation will continue?  Legal advice is being sought and we must await it.  As a result of the withdrawal by BUPA Ireland, however, and the purchase of its share of the market by the Quinn group, something to be welcomed in one respect, will a situation arise where many more insurers will be allowed to enter the health market and cherry pick?  The situation must be stabilised as a matter of urgency.  Those who take out health insurance must pay for it and we must show concern for the patients.</P>
        <P>Pharmacists were mentioned this morning.  The Minister for Health and Children stated that she accepted the view of the pharmacy review group that no beneficial relationship or business interest of any kind should exist between dispensing and prescribing.  This arose in regard to group practices and adjacent pharmacies.  Is that still the Government position?  It is happening in more and more places and it could be a dangerous practice that is detrimental to the vibrancy and vitality of the hearts or many of our towns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Ross&rsquo;s amendment.  I point out to Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there is indeed a nursing degree in Trinity College and an extremely good degree it is too.  We should not apologise for that, it is yet another contribution the University of Dublin makes to the life of this country.</P>
        <P>We, however, do not always make a good contribution to the debate on health.  The Government side lectures us for always attacking the Minister for Health and Children.  I have not done that and we should not be tarred <i>en bloc</i>.  Yesterday I went to the briefing by the HSE in this complex and it was one of the most refreshing, honest, clear and professional briefing sessions I have ever attended.  The HSE members were uniformly excellent, with Deputies from all parties and areas asking about their hospitals and patient treatment and they were given immediate, clear answers.</P>
        <P>I disagree strongly with Senator Finucane.  We do no service raising these items culled from newspapers that are ill-informed and plainly inaccurate.  The question of this scanner was raised at that HSE meeting and the response given was that a sophisticated machine has been acquired, it is on target in terms of delivery and it is being stored for safety awaiting the proper technical adjustment which is required.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE staff said this article demoralises people in the hospital and the person from Fine Gael accepted the answer to that question.  If the Senator had been there, he could have asked a supplementary question about it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also agree with my colleagues on this side of the House about the appointment to the Rail Procurement Agency.  We have not been well served in this instance.  In appointing a national procurer, we should be entitled to a broader consideration of the available talent.  Why go for the obvious financial bozos who seem to be slick in this area rather than somebody like Mr. Cormac Rabbitte, who knows what he is talking about and who developed the Dargan project?  I introduced Mr. Rabbitte to the Leader while she was Minister and we also met Professor Melis from Madrid, who showed us how projects could be implemented.  Senator Morrissey is another of the leading people in this area.  Let us appoint somebody who knows what they are talking about rather than a fat cat from the inner circle.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Could we invite the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs before the House to explain the rapid response corps?  It may be a worthy initiative but I am somewhat concerned that we are spending &euro;5 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on recruiting for the UN.  Irish agencies such as Concern and GOAL already work in the same area and I would hate to think they are to be undercut.  Let us put these concerns to the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to try to arrange a debate on rural transport.  Elsewhere in Europe, people in rural areas live in villages to which farmers return in the evening.  Ireland, however, has a unique rural settlement pattern of scattered housing in remote areas.  It would be constructive to license people to provide a rural transport service so that people can go to villages for sports and religious events, as well as to visit the pub.  Such a service would be very useful for communi<Col N="1970"/>ties because Ireland has changed in recent years and the fact that people cannot take more than two drinks before driving has had a significant effect.  The ban on smoking in pubs has also had an impact.  Transport is necessary not only for public houses but also for other places of social interaction.  In addition, major drinks companies might consider low alcohol alternatives to popular drinks such as Guinness and Heineken for people who want to drink two pints and still be able to drive home safely.</P>

	<P>I find it reprehensible in a country which is awash with money that the people of Dundalk had to collect &euro;400,000 to purchase a CAT scanner.  Unfortunately, it is not unusual for hospital voluntary groups to be forced to raise vast sums of money to purchase essential equipment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not be crowing about that because I was led to believe we are living in the richest country in Europe.  The Government is quick to point out that we are spending four times more money on health services than we spent ten years ago, yet the people in Dundalk still have to go around with buckets to raise money for a CAT scanner.</P>

	<P>Has the Senator a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange to have the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources attend the House as soon as possible to outline the initiatives he proposes as a replacement for the rural broadband scheme he scrapped two weeks ago?  In the past two years, I have repeatedly raised the lack of broadband availability in rural areas.  Two weeks ago, a business person from my area contacted an official in the Department only to find the latter was not aware the scheme had been scrapped the previous day by the Minister.  Small businesses face real dangers in many parts of rural Ireland if they cannot access broadband.</P><Col N="1971"/>
        <P>Problems continue to arise in local authority housing with regard to provisions for people with disabilities.  That issue should be considered in the context of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 because, while we are providing units for social and affordable reasons, many are not fully accessible for people with disabilities.  It would be useful if more units were accessible because many of those who have spent the longest time on housing waiting lists suffer from disabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, we had a constructive debate on the national development plan.  However, this morning the chairman of the National Competitiveness Council warned that policies on energy security are key to the longer term growth of the economy.  I am unsure of the Government&rsquo;s policy on biofuels but I understand people who have invested in cars which can use biofuels have great difficulties finding places to fill their tanks.  In Brazil, I understand every petrol station supplies biofuels in addition to petrol because that country&rsquo;s Government recognises the need for alternative energy resources.  We should encourage our Government to take a similar approach by means of a debate in this House on the National Competitiveness Council.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Ross&rsquo;s call for a debate on the nurses&rsquo; claim but for different reasons.  The Senator is incorrect when he claims nurses are being turned down because of fears that the partnership agreement could be damaged.  A system has been established in the partnership process for benchmarking and, while the Senator may not necessarily agree with that system, we should debate the matter.</P>
        <P>I have difficulties with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for the Seanad to vet future appointments to boards.  It is not always easy to find the best person for such jobs and board members and directors already have enough responsibilities without having to face the scrutiny of the Seanad or any other Oireachtas committee.  It is likely that we would end up with an unsuitable second best candidate rather than the best person for the job.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane spoke about the HSE, which he said was originally heralded as a new dawn, and outlined areas of turbulence within the health services.  However, turbulence is the stuff of life because the idea that one can wake up every morning and know that everything is correct is nonsense.  Life consists of ups and downs and the health services employ and treat a huge number of people.  We never hear the many good stories which could be told about health services.  People ask us to tell their stories to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who I do not follow around the corridors.  I acknowledge the issues raised by Senator Finucane but the nurses&rsquo; issues will be addressed. <Col N="1972"/> They were discussed at our parliamentary party meeting because we have free speech.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It got a great hearing.  I speak from personal experience.  When I was Minister for Public Enterprise there were times when the first five items on the agenda related to that Department.  My attitude was that was life and we had to tackle those items.  It is not the case that everything is rosy and that everybody is basking in contentment about the health service and its staff.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole did not mention the person of whom he was speaking, but we all know of whom he was speaking.  During my time as Minister, that same person was appointed to the chair of Aer Lingus and he &mdash; not Willie Walsh &mdash; saved the airline.  The Senators may not like it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Senator did not say any such thing.  He did not even mention the person&rsquo;s name and neither do I because we are not allowed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to that point.  I wish to state that while the plaudits went to Mr. Walsh, the person who guided it, thought it through and implemented it was this person.  I made inquiries before coming to the House and established that he is now tax compliant.  The Senator rightly pointed out that our report recommended having people scrutinised by a committee.  However, that recommendation has not been implemented.  The person is very admirable.  The Senator also spoke about An Post and what he ascertained about Kiwibank while in New Zealand.  Was it set up by the postal authority?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  New Zealand Post Limited owns it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know that.  I understand it is a huge success.  I heard a representative of An Post state it did not want any bank business and I do not know where the matter lies.  Perhaps that is not the official position of An Post.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the HSE support staff &mdash; as opposed to its technical staff &mdash; who <Col N="1973"/>have a job to do and who may have gripes.  The general support staff appear to want a transparent and efficient quality of management in the health service, which is a very small request on the part of technical staff who are asked to implement decisions.  The Senator stated that the Taoiseach had mentioned a figure between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  However, there were two issues.  The retrospective claim going back over four years comes to &euro;500 million and the current claim comes to another &euro;500 million.  We discussed the matter fully at our parliamentary party meeting, which is why I know about it.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden spoke about the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  The pharmacy (No. 1) Bill is on the A list for publication this session.  It will address many of the issues of which he spoke.</P>

        <P>Senator Norris said that yesterday he attended an excellent briefing by the HSE, at which people got answers.  The issue of the equipment in the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk was raised and a proper reply was given.  The hospital is awaiting the technical know-how to assemble the equipment which needs to be professionally done.  He also asked why Cormac Rabbitte was not appointed head of the Railway Procurement Agency.  He is a very fine person.  I wish to pay tribute to the outgoing chairman of the Railway Procurement Agency, an excellent person, who is not unknown in this Chamber.  He also asked for the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs to come to the House to speak about the rapid response corps.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about rural transport.  If I may say so, the rural transport initiative was launched by me.  It was piloted in 32 areas and is now at full scale.  The Senator requested a full debate on it.  He also believes there should be low-alcohol alternatives to full-alcohol drinks.  Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about fund raising in Dundalk for the CT scanner.  Those people decided to do that.</P>

	<P>The Senator seems to be denying people free speech or free action.  They want to do it.  Many people like to do those kinds of things.  The Senator also spoke about the rural broadband scheme.  The Minister will be here next week to take the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which will represent a very useful opportunity for the Senator.  I was puzzled by what he said about local authority houses not being fully accessible for people with disabilities.  The building regulations, which have been in force for some time, make it mandatory for any house &mdash; local authority or private &mdash; to meet specific requirements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendments seek to change the text of the Bill to reflect that communications made with the Director of Military Prosecutions or a member of his staff on behalf of another person do not come within the scope of the offence of improper communication with the director.  The Bill already provides that communications with the Director of Military Prosecutions made by legal and medical advisers, social workers and family members do not come within the scope of this offence.  I do not believe there are any other possibilities that need to be catered for here.  In addition, the current provision reflects the position in ordinary criminal legislation, namely, section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.</P>
        <P>We are providing that the accused person can communicate with the Director of Military Prosecutions.  We are also providing that people acting as legal or medical advisers, social workers or members of the person&rsquo;s family who are acting on his or her behalf may also communicate with the director without committing an offence.  If I were <Col N="1978"/>to accept the amendment as drafted, it would mean that we would extend that immunity to people acting on behalf of such legal or medical advisers, social workers or family members.  This would be to go too far and I regret that I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

	<P>The amendment would be consistent with Article 30.3 of the Constitution in respect of the prosecution of offences on indictment, which employs the phrase &ldquo;in the name of the People and at the suit of the Attorney General&rdquo;.  The Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 transferred the powers of the Attorney General regarding the prosecution of offences to the DPP.  In the case, therefore, of an ordinary criminal indictment, there are two parties to the laying of the charge, namely, the people and the DPP.  This is reflected in the correct form for the indictment, which is &ldquo;The People (DPP) <i>v</i>. the accused&rdquo;.  Under the proposed provisions of the Bill, the Director of Military Prosecutions alone will proffer the charges under military law and the charge will be laid as the Director of Military Prosecutions versus the accused.  If the Bill is amended as proposed, the charge will still be laid in the same terms without alteration and therefore the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

        <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 to the section of the Bill dealing with the military judge are required as a result of the Labour Party Senator&rsquo;s amendment No. 5, which I have just accepted, regarding the appointment of a military judge on the advice of the Government rather than on the recommendation of the Minister.  They follow from my acceptance of amendment No. 5.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 is an amendment to the section of the Bill dealing with the removal of the military judge from office.  This amendment is related to the previous amendment which provided that the military judge is appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  I have accepted the previous amendment, therefore, if the military judge is appointed on the advice of the Government it follows that the removal provision should also be on the advice of the Government.

	<P>This Bill is an amendment of the 1954 Act.  In the case of amending legislation, it is the policy of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to follow the format and language of the parent legislation. In this case the language of the parent Act is not gender neutral although adequate provision for the interpretation of gender references is provided for in the Defence Act.  If and when the Act is to be completely rewritten, I accept that every reference to &ldquo;his&rdquo; would be replaced by a reference to &ldquo;his or her&rdquo;.  While I have no difficulty with the Senator&rsquo;s case in principle, when amending legislation the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel is to follow the wording of the parent legislation, which is the Defence Act 1954.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>If our amendment was accepted, the Interpretation Act would still apply to the parent legislation.  This would be new legislation to which the Interpretation Act did not apply because it would be clear that it referred to &ldquo;his&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo;.

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s point.  As she rightly said, the Interpretation Act states that &ldquo;man&rdquo; includes &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and <i>vice versa</i>.  Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Counsel has advised us clearly that when we are legislating by reference to earlier legislation, if certain terminology appears in the earlier legislation the same terminology should be used in the interests of consistency.  I understand that is the way it is done throughout the system.  I cannot accept the amendment now but I will consider it between now and the debate in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, to delete the figure inserted by Government amendment No. 14 at Committee and substitute &ldquo;&euro;20,800&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I again welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House this week.  I raised this point during the Committee Stage debate last week and the Minister of State should take it on board and accept it.  On Committee Stage, the House amended the upper annual income limit for applicants from &euro;9,000 to &euro;10,400, to bring it into line with the pension rates.  I have looked into this subsequently and in the 2005 budget, the Minister introduced a guideline to the effect that pensioners were allowed to earn an additional &euro;100 per week without affecting their pensions in any way.  This was increased to &euro;200 per week in this year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>My amendment is an attempt to bring the Bill in line with Government policy.  The Government has stated that in addition to receiving their pension, pensioners are allowed to earn up to &euro;200 per week.  My figure of &euro;20,800 is an approximation of what would be involved were someone to have a pension and to be earning extra income.  It is possible that someone who worked on a part-time basis could suddenly become ill and would be obliged to enter a nursing home.  This income would be held against him or her on entry to the nursing home.</P>
        <P>Moreover, consideration should be given to index-linking this sum, as it will go out of date continually.  I assume that regardless of who will be in power, next year&rsquo;s budget will increase the pension again.  This will also happen in subsequent years and this sum will require continual revision.  My amendment is genuine and the Minister of State would be foolish not to accept it, unless he possesses additional information.  It is in line with Government policy as outlined in a guideline that allows pensioners to earn additional income without affecting their pensions.  This is all I seek to do.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1990"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment as this is a good point.  Senator Browne only asks that these sums should be in line with Government policy and the Minister of State should accept this amendment.  Moreover, the issue of indexation is highly important.  I was under the impression that a general decision had been made that this would be the case.  While such a decision may cover this issue, if not, I hope this proposal will be included within the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest my silence might be interpreted as disagreeing with my colleagues, I repeat that I have no inherent objection to requiring older people who are in long-term care or in nursing homes to make a contribution.  My problem has always been with means tests.  Means tests are either so severe that they exclude vast numbers of people or, if they are limited to determining those who can afford to support themselves, the cost of processing the tests is greater than the savings made.</P>
        <P>Given the incidence of poverty among older people, the sum of &euro;10,400 as the upper income limit at which they would be entitled to full financial support is offensively small.  Effectively, it states that anyone who is in any way better off than poor is able to pay for themselves or to make some contribution.  This is not true and I support the amendment as a reasonable attempt to decide on a reasonable figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the three Senators for their contributions, in which a number of issues were raised.  I do not propose to accept the amendment and I will explain the reason.</P>
        <P>The figure of &euro;10,400 contained in Committee Stage amendment No. 14 is not a simple income threshold.  An individual with the State pension as his or her only income and with no other assets would be eligible for the maximum level of subvention.  Instead, this threshold should be read in conjunction with the property threshold.  The increase in the basic maximum rate of subvention to &euro;300 per week means that a person in receipt of the State pension with a house worth up to &euro;364,000 and with no other income and assets may now just qualify for basic subvention.  This constitutes a significant improvement on the past.  In order not to hinder the potential for people to now qualify under this new increased rate, it was necessary to increase the property threshold and the related income threshold, to &euro;365,000 and &euro;10,400, respectively.</P>
        <P>However, these are only technical amendments and will not prevent someone from receiving a subvention as the means assessment, as previously mentioned, will enable those with assets of up to &euro;365,000 and a modest income to qualify for support.  This is because it is the financial means assessment and the imputation of income from the principal private residence under that <Col N="1991"/>assessment that affects people&rsquo;s qualifying subvention and the amount they receive.  The 5% imputation in the means assessment kicks in and makes all the difference.</P>
        <P>However, it should be noted that the HSE has issued guidelines on the standardised implementation of the nursing homes subvention scheme for 2007.  The guidelines clarify that the HSE will assess all applicants for subvention and will not automatically refuse an assessment on the basis of property thresholds.  Although in general, applicants with properties in excess of &euro;365,000 will not qualify for basic subvention, the 15% cap now means that after three years, the value of the property will be disregarded.  In other words, if someone who has been in long-term care for more than three years now applies, no imputation will be taken in respect of the value of his or her home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that on the assumption that such people will have been obliged to sell their homes by then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Moreover, the HSE may still consider such individuals for enhanced subvention and consequently, although the figure of &euro;10,400 could be raised, it would be futile to so do.  It could also raise public expectations unfairly and arguably, it could be seen as being misleading, as people with houses valued at more than &euro;365,000 and with income of &euro;20,800 would not be eligible for subvention, by virtue of the means test and the income imputed from their properties.</P>
        <P>Senators Henry and Browne both mentioned the possibility of indexation.  While I appreciate their argument, it is inappropriate on this occasion.  Later this year, the Government will introduce a new nursing home support scheme, namely, a fair deal on long-term nursing home care.  As it will not contain any income, property or wealth thresholds, including indexation in this Bill would serve no purpose.  Under the proposed new scheme, which will take effect from 1 January 2008, everyone will be eligible to apply for support.</P>
        <P>As for the issue on social welfare raised by Senator Browne on Committee Stage and again today, the earnings disregard for non-contributory pensions is now &euro;200 per week.  This means that income from employment of &euro;200 per week is disregarded in the means test for State pensions.  The underlying reasoning is simple, namely, those who wish to continue in employment after reaching the normal retirement age should be, as far as possible, facilitated and supported.  While this in no way affects the financial assessment for subvention applicants, it should be noted that this is less than the amount of income that is disregarded under the financial assessment for subvention.</P>

        <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments No. 3 is an alternative to amendment No. 2, therefore, amendments Nos. 2 and 3 may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, to delete lines 13 to 19 of the text inserted by Government amendment No. 25 at Committee and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The Health Service Executive shall publish all information supplied to it under subsection 1(<i>a</i>) and may for statistical purposes retain and process information given to it under subsection (1) provided that information supplied under subsections 1(<i>b</i>), 1(<i>c</i>) and 1(<i>d</i>) is not publicly disclosed except in the form of a summary so compiled so as to prevent particulars relating to the identity of any person for whom any home care provider provides home care services being ascertained from it.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Cathaoirleach knows I never disagree with him.  However, I do not agree these amendments are alternates for an important reason.  My amendment is almost identical to that of the Minister of State.  It states the Health Service Executive shall publish all information supplied to it under subsection 1(<i>a</i>), which is the identity of the home care provider.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s amendment states the information may be publicly disclosed.  Mine uses the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; while the Minister of State&rsquo;s uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>With all due respect to the Cathaoirleach a difference exists between them.  This difference goes back to a view I have held for 20 years on the public&rsquo;s right to information.  The Minster of State will quote vast volumes from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to show that &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It does not.  We have plenty of evidence in legislation to show if a Government wants something to happen the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used and if it wants to leave a little wiggle room it uses &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>God knows what reason the HSE might find to delay, slow down or hold up publication of the names of people.  People might regard it as commercially sensitive and such information is precluded from release under the Freedom of Information Act.  It is one reason for not disclosing information.  Given that the Minister of State uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; a home care service provider could object to it, leading to a long rigmarole.</P>
        <P>Am I causing the Cathaoirleach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree a large overlap exists.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Government tabled its amendment.  It would have been an unfortunate omis<Col N="1993"/>sion to leave the Bill as it was.  While I do not wish to blow my own trumpet this is the third time in less than two years I had to point out errors in legislation.  The National Economic and Social Development Office Bill had a section prohibiting Members of the Oireachtas from being members of the National Economic and Social Forum.  Prior to the summer of 2005 we dealt with the issue of institutional redress.  As the legislation was written, people who wished to appeal could not do so themselves.</P>
        <P>I wish people would read their amendments and by that I do not mean the Minister of State.  Sometimes the errors stand up and hit one, as this one did, the minute one reads it.  Although I was poorly prepared that day because I was busy with something else, as soon as I read the amendment on Committee Stage it was obvious either it had malicious intent, which from the moment the Minister of State spoke I knew was not the case, or a mistake had been made.  It would have slipped through if we had not delayed Report Stage for a week.  I am grateful to the House for delaying it.</P>
        <P>I apologise for straying.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be accused of straying.</P>
        <P>I second the amendment.  It is much better to have openness in this area.  Commercial sensitivity is pleaded far too frequently including with regard to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I got that point in before the Cathaoirleach stopped me.  One knows the ire caused by the fact one cannot find out what are the costs of various procedures and operations because it is considered commercially sensitive.</P>
        <P>Not unnaturally, public hospitals feel they are shabbily treated.  If they were given more funds they might be able to do at a much reduced rate what is done in private hospitals.  We still have the spectacle of consultants from public hospitals in a position to carry out procedures in private hospitals or in public hospitals on Saturday mornings under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</P>
        <P>We must consider the economics of these issues and stop talking about matters being commercially sensitive.  Senator Ryan brought up a good point.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s amendment goes some way towards ameliorating the situation.  Perhaps he will also consider Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to accept amendment No. 2 and when I explain Senator Ryan will accept my point.  We often spend time considering the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; when discussing legislation.  Amendment No. 3 is more appropriate with regard to publishing or making available information.  The reason for not accepting amendment No. 2 is not because we do not see the merit in the principle behind what is suggested.  However, a few small differences exist between what the Senator proposes and what we propose based on advices received.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 takes on board the point raised by Senator Ryan and is similar in spirit but different in the detail to amendment No. 2.  Most importantly, the reference to the non-disclosure of details collected on home care providers has been removed.  It was only ever intended to protect the personal details of individual persons and not companies.  This what the Bill will do if amendment No. 3 is accepted.</P>
        <P>I strongly stress the reason behind the original amendment was to collect statistics on the provision of home care which could then be used to evaluate and make improvements to the services provided.  It was never intended to establish a system whereby the HSE would collect information on home care providers but would not make it available to the public.  No secrecy issue arises.  The HSE provides information on home care companies working in particular localities to individuals on a regular basis.  We will not in any way hinder that in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Senators will see we will not only remove the non-disclosure clause on home care companies but we will also remove it from individuals in receipt of home care.  I assure Senators this in no <Col N="1995"/>way means details relating to such individuals will be made public, except in statistical format.  Anything else would be unacceptable and unthinkable.  We will remove this clause because we received advice that to specify in the Bill such details will not be disclosed is redundant insofar as a statutory duty to protect privacy already exists.</P>
        <P>The Data Protection Act 1988 already applies to all personal data held by the HSE.  Under the Act, while the collection of such data is legitimate the HSE is obliged to protect the privacy of individuals by not disclosing the information to others and by not using it without further consent for purposes other than those stated, which in this case is for statistical purposes.  In addition, the Health Act 2004 places an obligation of confidentiality on all HSE staff.  Therefore, I assure Senators data on individuals in receipt of home care is already well protected in legislation.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 addresses a key concern raised by Senator Ryan, namely, that the HSE would collect the details of private home care companies but would be able to release this information only in statistical format.  This amendment specifically provides that information relating to the names and addresses of companies providing private home care may be publicly disclosed by the HSE.  The amendment does not oblige the HSE to publish every piece of data received as the burden of so doing is considered unnecessarily onerous.  Questions also arise as to how they would be published, in what format and how often, etc.  The crucial point is that the information collected can be made available to the public at any time, as is the norm with information collected by the HSE and other bodies.  This provision will now give the HSE power to do that for reasons of transparency and openness.</P>
        <P>The reference to the publication of data on home care providers relates only to legal persons.  A home care provider is defined in the Bill as a natural or legal person who provides, at a charge, home care services.  Where the person is a legal person, in other words a business set-up to provide home care services for profit, the Bill will now clearly provide that the HSE may publish its details.  However, where the provider is a natural person, this individual may not want his or her name made public, for obvious reasons.</P>
        <P>Most individuals providing home care services do so free of charge.  Where a charge is raised, it is simply to cover expenses such as transport costs or may constitute what may be considered pocket money.  This is not the same as providing home care services for business purposes and most individuals carrying out such work do not make a profit.  For reasons of data protection and individual privacy, while we have provided for the public disclosure of any information collected in statistical format, the HSE now has the explicit power to publish the names and addresses of private home care providers where such providers are <Col N="1996"/>companies.  This means the public will be able to avail of details of private companies while individuals in receipt of home care, as well as those providing home care directly and not through a company, will remain fully protected from any of their details being made public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have learned the hard way to be wary of any Government explaining that it does not want to make public disclosures because they may become too cumbersome.  In my experience of a variety of Governments in the past 25 years all disclosure is deemed too cumbersome so their instinct is to disclose as little as possible.  It is a pity the Minister of State did not say explicitly which data must be published but I will not make a huge issue out of it.  I accept the HSE will publish information because it is beginning to develop an understanding that disclosure is better than the opposite.  The best way to deal with public complaints is to put everything out in the open, because the case can be better made, rather than selectively withholding information.  The delays in publishing the report of the inquiry into Leas Cross probably did more harm to the image of the HSE than the contents of the report itself.  The public perception that, for whatever reason, the HSE was reluctant to publish made the disclosures, when they finally came, appear even worse than they actually were.</P>
        <P>I am sorry the Minister of State will not accept my amendment.  I dream about these things but I appreciate his kind words, which were nothing less than what I would expect from a man for whom I have considerable regard.  He is nearly from my own parish so I have little choice in that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not happy with this Bill and can envisage it causing major problems for both HSE staff, who must try to work out rates of subvention, and patients and their families.  The Minister should consider my earlier suggestion as a way to encourage private health insurers to give customers the option of paying extra for their premia&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Bill has now passed and we cannot discuss it again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the Bill following its passing.  Not everybody ends up in a nursing home.  I believe the figure is less than 10%.  However, for those who do, it is very expensive and a mechanism for planning ahead will avoid having to take the family home into account.  Selling it, whether before or after the person&rsquo;s death, will be awkward.  </P>
        <P>I suggest that when the Government intends to give detailed replies to amendments in the future, Ministers provide copies of their replies to Opposition Members so that we can read them, as most times they go over our heads and it does not serve democracy very well.  We could look through them and pick out details to scrutinise, which is our job.</P>
        <P>I am not happy with the fixed, rather than index-linked, amounts in the Bill, which will be a problem for the next Minister for Health and Children, or the relevant Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State for the way he has brought this Bill through the House.  I support the Minister&rsquo;s belief that people should be looked after in their own homes for as long as is possible as that is what the vast majority want.  People in hospitals who are old and dying only wish to get out again and return to their own home.  I have heard them say so many times and it is very important we help them in that way.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Government policy has been to rely very much on private nursing homes.  I have no philosophical argument with that but we must consider the level of trained staff in private nursing homes and their ability to support <Col N="1998"/>patients as death approaches.  The situation is not like in public hospitals, where there were many trained nurses who knew that, for all of us, an end would come at some stage.</P>
        <P>I have had the unfortunate experience of being in the accident and emergency department at St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, not that I was in a particularly bad way.  I was very well treated but saw three elderly people who were close to death and had obviously been brought in by people who were panicking about what might be said to them had they died in a nursing home.  However, they were going to die and an accident and emergency department is no place to die.  Worse still is an acute bed in a hospital.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Government intends bringing forward further legislation on nursing homes but we must ensure the patient&rsquo;s welfare, both in life and through death, is properly protected.  Hospices provide a wonderful palliative service but they cannot be everywhere so we must enhance the training of staff in private nursing homes, who require more support than those in public nursing homes.  Over 50% of the beds in the Dublin area are now in private nursing homes, which represents a huge change because it used to be between 20% and 30%.  It also puts a huge burden on accident and emergency units and on acute beds.  It is unnecessary from the point of view of the hospitals and very wrong from that of the patient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the spirit in which he dealt with our little complaints.  I appreciate his good humour and willingness to respond.</P>
        <P>Like my colleagues, I do not regard the Bill as a momentous event.  We have not yet started to embrace the gradual change to an ageing society, which is not as dramatic as scaremongers would have us believe.  There is a resistance to the idea of universalism in the provision of support for the elderly.  The story described by Senator Henry is hair-raising and distressing and must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I have a simple belief, namely, all ways of doing something should be rational.  It is irrational for the Bill to distinguish between house prices in what is called the Dublin area and elsewhere in the country.  A gradual banded spread of 20 km to 50 km in radius might be rational, but basing this provision on the Dublin area and north County Wicklow, which is probably more expensive than parts of County Dublin, is irrational and makes for arbitrariness on the part of decision-makers.  The HSE is so big and unresponsive that to allow arbitrariness to creep in is a mistake.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, it is better to have something rather than nothing written down.  It is a step forward and a recognition of a work in progress.  The Minister of State informed the House that there will be further legislation, which will be the case irrespective of who is in power, but if there is a <Col N="1999"/>change in Government, that legislation will be different than what is currently intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and my colleagues on all sides of the House for passing this important Bill, which brings into focus the need for people in the medical field to pursue careers in geriatric medicine and geriatric nursing.  That people are living longer is to be welcomed.  A related debate focuses on what role people in their winter years can play in society.  In many respects, they are an under-used resource, which is regrettable.</P>
        <P>I will not delay.  References pertaining to further legislation are welcome.  Everything going well after the big day, I trust that we, like democrats, will be back here agreeing to differ on these points instead of arguing on them.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions since Second Stage, the interest they have shown in issues concerning the elderly and the help they have given in promoting that cause, which is a priority of the House and is debated regularly.</P>
        <P>The Bill was designed to put the current subvention arrangements on a sound legal footing.  The bulk of the amendments made in the Seanad relate to a range of interim measures put in place in respect of 2007 that will benefit many of those in private nursing terms in the immediate term prior to the introduction of the new nursing home care support scheme in 2008.  The interim measures have been in force since 1 January and are being transposed into primary legislation via this Bill.</P>
        <P>A single maximum subvention rate of &euro;300 has replaced the previous three levels of dependency and the property threshold has increased from &euro;300,000 to &euro;365,000 in respect of houses outside Dublin when combined with an income of at least &euro;10,400.  A person&rsquo;s residence will only be taken into account for a maximum of three years.  A number of other changes have been made.  For example, the net effect of another provision is to enable private home care providers to be exempted from VAT, which is in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy focus on home care and will encourage more growth.  It will reduce the cost of home care, which will be welcome news for those availing of it or who wish to avail of it.</P>
        <P>The House will agree that amendments tabled on Committee and Report Stages relate to positive changes that will make the subvention scheme fairer and more equitable, thus contribu<Col N="2000"/>ting to the well-being of our elderly citizens.  More changes will follow in the form of the new nursing home care support scheme.  Senators would acknowledge that the current scheme is far from perfect.  We have made a number of changes to improve the lot of an additional 2,000 people who would not have been eligible for subventions previously.</P>
        <P>The new scheme, entitled A Fair Deal, has been well publicised and will take effect on 1 January 2008.  After extensive analysis, it is viewed as the fairest and most equitable means of supporting elderly people in residential care.  It will create an equitable scheme for those in public and private care and will bed down the concept of co-payment between the individual and the State for the cost of long-term care.</P>
        <P>Legislation is expected before the Houses in autumn.  Regardless of who is in charge of the ship at that time, we will have ample opportunity to examine and debate the legislation.  I hope that we will all be present to do so.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.  I am 33 years of age, which is not old, and I enjoy going out, but I get a pain in my ears and face in venues where the music is so loud that one cannot speak to people.  If I wanted such, I would go to a rock concert, where it would be expected.</P>
        <P>Recently, I was in a small pub in west County Clare where the musician&rsquo;s speakers were almost as big as the pub.  I do not know where he thought he was playing.  If he had been playing at Croke Park, I would have said that was fair enough.  Last weekend, I attended a function where no one, including young people, could speak because the band was playing too loudly for the room in question.</P>
        <P>A man I know is almost deaf and forks out &euro;3,000 on hearing aids.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs pays half the cost.  I do not know whether there are inspectors to monitor noise levels and issue guidelines.  Some of my friends are involved in bands, but if they are exposed to unnecessarily loud noise levels, their hearing will deteriorate in the long term.  The public deserves protection.</P>
        <P>We have all attended weddings, functions and dinner dances where the noise level was ridicu<Col N="2001"/>lous.  Recently, I attended a dinner dance at my local GAA club where a fantastic band played.  While the music was loud enough to sing or dance to, it was not difficult to speak to people off the dance floor, which is as it should be.</P>
        <P>For musicians and the public, this is a health and safety issue in respect of which the Department should have guidelines and inspectors to fine bands and venue managers in breach of the guidelines.  A noise pollution Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il, but I am unsure whether it referred to this proposal.</P>
        <P>I am not trying to come across as an old fogey.  I look forward to going to many dinner dances in the future but I want to enjoy myself at them.  Having to shout in someone&rsquo;s face and repeat oneself three or four times is not fun anymore.  We owe it to the public to have guidelines in place, with a team of inspectors who can monitor the noise levels and make the management of venues responsible so patrons who pay to attend these functions enjoy themselves.  A rock concert is different because if people go to get their ears blown off, that is their choice.  There should, however, be a limit at other functions and guidelines should be in place.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as ucht na ceiste seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il inniu.  I assure Senator Browne that I could not agree more with him.  I also attend many venues and if I want to talk to someone, I ask them to step outside so we can have a conversation in peace and quiet.  I remember the youth club in Corr na M&oacute;na was having a Christmas show and my son did a marvellous take off of me at a venue pulling out the note book, bending the ear and taking the message.  We all do that.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is statutorily responsible for the enforcement of workplace safety, health and welfare legislation.  Earlier this year, Deputy Killeen, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, signed the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Control of Noise at Work) Regulations 2006, SI 371 of 2006, into law.  These regulations are the most modern noise legislation on our Statute Book.</P>
        <P>The regulations transpose EU Directive 2003/10/EC into law.  The directive recognises that the music and entertainment sectors have particular characteristics which require practical guidance for effective application of its provisions.  An interim period up to 15 February 2008 is allowed to develop these guidelines before the new requirements apply.  The Health and Safety Authority will develop and consult on the guidelines or code of practice to provide practical guidance to employers and employees in these sectors.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the provisions of the European Communities (Protection of Workers)(Exposure to Noise) Regulations 1990, <Col N="2002"/>SI 157 of 1990, apply to the sector.  The Health and Safety Authority published guidelines for the entertainment industry association with those regulations in 2004.  The guidelines make a number of recommendations for the management of noise where it has been assessed as a risk to employees.</P>
        <P>Preventative measures highlighted in the guidelines include the reduction of noise at source, such as noise limitation equipment fixed to the volume controls of speakers so that DJs and other performers cannot exceed a given level; the provision of hearing protectors which must be appropriate for protection from measured noise levels; and information and training for employees.</P>
        <P>Control measures were recommended.  These include reducing noise exposure in the entertainment sector, which can be as simple as turning down the sound level and fixing limiting devices which prevent the sound rising above a specified level.  Speakers can also be arranged so that staff are less exposed, staff can be rotated from noisy areas to quiet areas and DJs can be provided with soundproof enclosures.</P>
        <P>During 2003, inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority carried out 73 noise control inspections to measure noise in places of entertainment, of which ten were as a result of follow-up inspections.  Noise measurements were taken and the results showed that 50% of the premises had noise levels above the 85 dBA threshold, while 35% were above 90 dBA.  The compliance rate was found to be about 30%.</P>
        <P>From 15 February 2008, the provisions of the 2006 regulations will apply across the board to all workplaces.  The regulations supplement and add specific detail to a range of general provisions under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The regulations specify exposure action values, the level of daily noise exposure or peak pressure level which, if exceeded, requires specified action to be taken to reduce risk to any employee, and exposure limit values, the level of daily noise exposure or peak sound pressure, which must not be exceeded for any employee.</P>
        <P>An employer must ensure that the risk arising from exposure of his or her employees to noise is either eliminated at source or, where this is not reasonably practicable, reduced to a minimum.  Where employees are liable to be exposed to noise at work at or above a lower action value, an employer must make a suitable and appropriate assessment of the risk arising from such exposure.  If a risk assessment indicates that an upper action value is exceeded, an employer must establish and implement a programme of technical or organisational measures, or both, designed to reduce exposure to noise.</P>
        <P>Where noise exposure exceeds the lower action values, an employer must make individual hearing protectors available and an employee whose exposure equals or exceeds the upper action values must use individual hearing protectors.  An employer must ensure, as far as is reasonably <Col N="2003"/>practicable, that hearing protectors are used in accordance with the regulations, and that the measures are effective.</P>
        <P>In addition to specifying provisions relating to employee information, training and consultation, the regulations require an employer to provide for appropriate heath surveillance to be made available to those employees for whom a risk assessment carried out under the regulations reveals a risk to their health.</P>
        <P>The protection of non-employees from exposure to noise, such as from live bands and other music sources in places of entertainment, is outside the scope of Directive 2003/10/EC and the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2006.  Accordingly, no specific such inspections have taken place to monitor such noise and there are no plans by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Health and Safely Authority to introduce guidelines on the protection of non-employees from exposure to noise at places of entertainment.</P>
        <P>The implementation of some noise elimination and control measures in respect of the protection of employees at work in places of entertainment may also result in reduction of exposure to other persons at a premises to noise but that is a by-product rather than an integral component of the directive and regulations.  Members of the public who wish to complain about noise as a nuisance or as environmental pollution can address their complaints to their local authority for appropriate action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply but the last paragraph says it all.  The Health Service Executive owes it to employees and patrons in venues to protect them.  I would not like to be a bouncer working in a night club four nights a week having to endure such noise.  It must be bad for their hearing and there is a need for guidelines for patrons and employees.  As for going to local authorities, forget about it, it will not happen.</P>

	<P>The smoking ban came in to protect employees but it protects those of us who spend time in other people&rsquo;s workplaces.  It is a by-product that no one smokes in pubs now.  Unless an employee is provided with ear protection, noise must be below a level sustainable for them and a by-product of that is that everyone else present benefits.  The other option is to distribute individual ear protection.</P>

	<P>This is an important issue for the children, parents and staff of Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige in Clondalkin, who have been seeking a permanent building for at least ten years.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht na ceiste a ard&uacute;.  Thug m&eacute; cuairt ar an scoil.  I visited it and know it well.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has always acknowledged the need to replace the building to meet the future needs of Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige.  However, it has been already established that the present site is unsuitable for this development and, in any event, is not on offer to the Department.  Therefore, prior to any progress being made on a building project, a suitable site had to be identified and acquired.  Enormous difficulties were encountered in trying to acquire a site in this built-up urban area.  Through its normal procedures, the Department requested the Office of Public Works to identify possible sites for development.  Unfortunately, no suitable sites emerged under this process.</P>
        <P>Size, location, availability and cost are the critical factors in assessing site suitability.  A site adjacent to the school comprising 0.93 acres was offered to the Department by the school&rsquo;s trustees but the asking price greatly exceeded market value rates.  This, however, was irrelevant as the site on offer was even smaller than the current school site and was not adequate for the modern, purpose-built, 16-classroom school with the full range of ancillary accommodation required by Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige to address the all-Irish primary needs of Clondalkin.  A site of approximately 2.5 acres is the minimum amount of land required.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, the Department had to consider other options and was fortunate that the County of Dublin Vocational Education Committee had land that could be developed and was willing to make this land available.  A number of issues had to be addressed by the Department and the VEC in bringing the site to finality, including a technical assessment for overall suitability for developmental purposes and a discussion with the local authority regarding its requirements.  From the VEC&rsquo;s perspective, the site had to fulfil a number of statutory and procedural protocols before a final decision could be made.</P>
        <P>At its December meeting, the County of Dublin VEC passed a motion agreeing to the disposal of land at Deansrath community college to the Department for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige, subject to the agreement of the Deansrath board of management and staff.  The gaelscoil was told of the position on an informal basis at Christmas.  The matter was thereafter tabled for the VEC&rsquo;s January meeting and the chief executive officer of the VEC wrote to the Department formally in late January confirming its willingness to make the land in question available for a permanent building for Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige.  This development enables the Department to proceed with plans to develop a state-of-the-art facility for Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige and the matter has advanced to the stage at which <Col N="2005"/>the project can be considered for the commencement of architectural planning.</P>
        <P>The Department is cognisant of parents&rsquo; concerns in terms of the new location of the school, which is approximately 1.8 to two miles from the current temporary site.  However, any number of schools up and down the country start in one location and are subsequently permanently located in another.  This can also happen in amalgamation scenarios.  It has to be remembered that, unlike other primary schools, gaelscoileanna do not have catchment areas and are not, therefore, confined to specific locations, although the Department will always try to relocate schools as close to the original location as possible.  It is not realistic, however, in a large urban area to expect this to be easily achieved.  School communities are usually aware of local land issues, so relocations are rarely if ever a problem, especially when a multi-million euro investment is on offer to ensure that the children concerned have a comfortable high-quality learning environment.  Transport is provided for eligible pupils when relocations of this nature take place.</P>
        <P>The Department wants to progress to a position where the needs of the current and future pupils of Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige can enjoy the standard of accommodation to which they are entitled and it looks forward to working with the board of management to achieve this end.</P>

	<P>Some confusion appears to have arisen as a result of media reports on the cohesion process of the Leitrim partnership, the Roscommon partnership and the Arigna Leader programmes.  The House will be aware that the Minister is engaged in a range of cohesion projects.  The geographical location and history of the Arigna Leader programme and its relationship with the two partnerships have given rise to complicated consultations among interested parties, so I felt it timely to ask the Minister to provide clarity on the eventual outcome of these negotiations.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht na ceiste a ard&uacute;.  I heard a report that a debate took place in the Seanad yesterday on this matter which, to put it mildly, was ill-informed.</P>
        <P>The cohesion process is a policy initiative approved by the Government in January 2004 which aims to bring greater coherence to the arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered.  The core objective of the process is the alignment of local, community and rural development organisations to achieve full area coverage of the local and community development programmes operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, including rural development programmes, from 2007 onwards.  In other words, <Col N="2006"/>one office will represent Leader, partnership companies and rural social schemes in any given area rather than having separate offices maintained by the different services, which is currently the case.  The new arrangement makes a lot of sense.</P>
        <P>In rural areas, such as counties Leitrim and Roscommon, this will involve rural and local development groups coming together to secure a unified overarching structure which provides full area coverage.  My intention is that in any given area there will be one company providing local development services so that people wishing to access these supports will in future no longer have to deal with several different agencies.  Requests have been made repeatedly for a one-stop shop, which is what we are providing.  My preference is for unified overarching structures based around county boundaries where practicable, but I am prepared to consider proposals which involve variations across county boundaries on their merits.</P>
        <P>Local development programmes operated by my Department in counties Leitrim and Roscommon are primarily delivered by two Leader companies and two partnerships.  Despite considerable efforts by all concerned, it has not been possible to achieve a consensus to date on the future structures to cover both counties.</P>
        <P>On 31 January, the Department convened a meeting of the four agencies in an attempt to make progress.  Prior to the meeting, we issued a series of ground rules and asked the parties to comment on them.  In view of the sensitive nature for parties of reporting to their boards, one of the ground rules was that no party would go to the media before the boards had reached agreement.  My understanding is that all the parties agreed to the ground rules because they considered them to be in their common interest.</P>
        <P>It is often said when partnership negotiations take place that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The negotiating parties consult their boards about packages before going public.  In this instance, the ground rules were agreed in advance so there was no question of gagging orders being imposed by my Department.  We have been working towards a consensus for more than a year and, rather than using the hatchet, have patiently tried to persuade everybody to agree to a formula.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to the Senator&rsquo;s vital question of whether we have reached a solution, we are getting there.  Good will has been demonstrated and negotiations are ongoing.  The Senator will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to go into further detail on the issues under consideration but I am hopeful we will find a solution within the next fortnight, with the good will of the parties involved, so that we can progress to new and bigger rural development and local development social inclusion programmes which can be delivered in a coherent manner.</P>

	<P>I am grateful that the Minister has indicated that agreement has almost been reached.  Can I assume the parties to the agreement will continue to operate their programmes along the lines they have been operating them without prejudice to any side?</P>

	<P>There is good will and there has been considerable negotiation.  It will not be the same as before.  Otherwise there would have been no negotiation.  I want to reach agreement by consensus.  We are at the midnight hour in this <Col N="2008"/>process.  We have let it go on for more than a year.  It is time for the hard talk and for people to reach agreement in a flexible way.  I have always said I would much prefer the local groups to reach agreement rather than have something imposed by the Department.  Only a handful of issues remain to be resolved and we need to bring it to conclusion.  I would not like to have the money available from both the Exchequer and Europe without being in a position to spend it.</P>
