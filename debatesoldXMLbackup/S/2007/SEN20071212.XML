	<P>I have notice from Senator Dominic Hannigan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the situation with regard to the timetable for the design and construction of the permanent Le Ch&eacute;ile Educate Together school on Mornington Road, Drogheda, County Louth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the start date for the construction of the new school building for Athlone Community College.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2005, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; exposed to the entire country what was happening at Leas Cross.  Going on information supplied to me by the Leader of the House it will be June 2008, more than three years later, before the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will consider a criminal investigation into what happened at Leas Cross.  In light of what we read about the report into the Brothers of Charity, which was published yesterday, no reason exists for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to investigate what happened at Leas Cross while a report is being compiled.  Work on a report and a Garda investigation can be concurrent.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whether a specific reason exists for delaying by three years the investigation into the serious allegations made about Leas Cross?</P>
        <P>Will the House support the establishment of a statutory and independent patient safety authority?  A serious problem exists in the ethos of the Irish health care services.  Many Members on both sides of the House have expressed concern about what is going on in the Health Service Executive.  The only way we can change this ethos is through establishing a patient safety authority.  We have the Financial Regulator and all the services which go with it to protect people&rsquo;s investments and money.  However, we do not have a specific organisation to look after patients&rsquo; interests.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na states it does not have the resources nor possibly the legislation to support it in achieving successful prosecutions with regard to the cocaine epidemic we have.  Perhaps the contribution of the House should be to look outside the box for solutions.  Members of the House have already called for mandatory drug testing throughout society or at traffic stops.  The House should debate concerns associated with mandatory drug testing and whether it is a good idea or an over-the-top response to the drugs problem.  A debate of this nature would assist society.  We will not know if mandatory drug testing is a good or bad idea until we have a proper debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I admire the Senator&rsquo;s optimism about our ability to think outside the box.  Senator Bacik was heckled yesterday when she made a reasonably intellectual argument on mandatory drug testing.  I, too, would like a debate on this issue to determine whether the Senators who heckled will have a thoughtful contribution to make. </P>
        <P>I hope the House will express outrage about an issue in which the Leader has taken a special interest, namely, uninsured drivers.  I will relate a simple story.  It is now widespread practice to have one&rsquo;s car taxed on-line.  To do so, one must fill out an application on the <i>www.cartax.ie</i> web<Col N="67"/>site.  An applicant may enter any insurance policy number he or she wishes.  In other words, by facilitating a system which allows people to obtain a tax disc without insurance or a national car test, we are putting dangerous vehicles and uninsured drivers on the road every day.  I raised this issue last year and the Leader discussed it during his time as Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  Having understood that the issue was being addressed, I am outraged to learn that uninsured drivers of unsafe vehicles continue to have their cars taxed.</P>
        <P>When one hears of road traffic accidents and collisions, one often wonders about the roadworthiness of the cars involved, if their brakes were functioning properly and so forth.  Questions are often asked about accountability.  Someone should be brought to book for allowing the outrageous practice by which drivers of unsafe vehicles log on to a website to obtain a road tax certificate to continue.  Rectifying the problem is a simple, technical matter.  I want two steps to be taken.  The Minister for Transport should explain immediately when he will address the issue and every single on-line taxation transaction undertaken in the past year should be reviewed to determine how many of the drivers in question entered false insurance numbers.  Every insurance company has a databank it can use to generate the relevant information in seconds.  All that is required is to have two technologies communicate with each other.  It is outrageous that this practice is allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>On a related issue, for almost ten years I have been calling for the introduction of credit card type driving licences.  I made this request time and again when Senator Callely was Minister of State at the Department of Transport with responsibility for traffic.  On each occasion, he assured me the European Union was working on the issue and I pointed out that, having taken 29 years to decide on the colour of our passports, I dreaded to think how long the European Union would take to introduce credit card sized driving licences.  Ireland should proceed immediately to introduce such licences and adapt them, if necessary, should the European Union legislate on the matter.  If we carry a driving licence at all times, as required by law, it will fall apart within months because the current licences are not suitable for this purpose.  This is a simple matter which should be addressed in a technologically advanced society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Taoiseach referred briefly to Seanad reform in the other House yesterday.  Does the Leader agree that he effectively dismissed taking any steps beyond perhaps introducing legislation to deal with the outcome of the 1979 referendum?  This is a disappointingly modest approach.  The House spent half of a day debating Seanad reform recently and will, I understand, return to the issue in February. <Col N="68"/> In light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments, are we kidding ourselves that more radical reform of the House is possible?</P>
        <P>While I do not wish to trespass on the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s oral inquiry into the replacement of toll booths on the M50, I will comment on a newspaper article today in which a representative of one of the interested groups, Mr. Conor Faughnan of the Automobile Association, wrote about the proposals for the toll bridge.  His extraordinary description of what is proposed is almost Kafkaesque.  An electronic tagging system is to be introduced to establish a vast infrastructure on the M50 which will include &ldquo;overhead gantries, electronic detection devices, cameras, video imaging technology, ANPR software, systems integration, cabling&rdquo; and many other features.  The AA, an interested party which represents motorists, argues that we should concentrate instead on the provision of public transport to relieve congestion on our roads.  Surely this is the best option.  The AA&rsquo;s proposal to introduce a levy on fuel to assist in funding public transport is a much better idea than creating the monster proposed for the M50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the accession states to the European Union at the earliest opportunity.  I welcome the results of the recent election and the clear transition of power in Russia where President Putin will shortly hand over the reigns to a new president.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must live in a parallel universe. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of a rational debate on progress in Russia, we must note that the country has come a long way since the totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union and the partially democratic era under former President Boris Yeltsin. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Russians were better off under the Soviet Union.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, many people continue to exhibit a Cold War mentality towards Russia.  They must move on because a new state and fledgling democracy have emerged.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has made great strides.  The purest test of democracy was whether President Putin would try to stand for a third term. </P>

	<P>What about electoral abuses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators should refrain from interrupting.  Everyone will have an opportunity to speak.  Please allow those contributing on the Order of Business to speak.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Marvellous strides have been made in Russia.  During the Yeltsin years terrible mistakes were made and vast resources were sold off for a pittance.  The entire gas resources of the Soviet Union, which account for approximately one third of world supply, as well as the country&rsquo;s steel industry were sold off for the price of a house on Shrewsbury Road. </P>
        <P>While I recognise the difficulties the country has experienced during the transition to democracy, Russia is a democratic state and, like all democratic states, must overcome hurdles.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, it is on the right path.  I would welcome a debate on the accession states, including Ukraine and Turkey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on bullying and civility.  I do so in the context of a coroner&rsquo;s report yesterday on the death of a young girl in County Cork.  The debate should focus on the manner in which those who are bullied are categorised and treated by society.  The House should acknowledge the grief of a family and that it has been aggrieved by the coroner&rsquo;s verdict yesterday.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on education.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science, who came before the House two weeks ago, to return to the House to explain the deficit in the summer works scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I request a debate on the drugs issue.  A considerable amount of good work done by Oireachtas committees is consigned to a shelf somewhere and the media, given its lack of understanding of what committees do, fails to pick up on it.  I respectfully suggest that we take as a starting point for a debate on drugs a number of reports completed by the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs during my time as Chairman.  The issues covered included: the effectiveness of investment in sport and the arts as a deterrent against youth substance abuse; the treatment of cocaine addiction with particular reference to the Irish experience; the inclusion of alcohol in a national substance misuse strategy; the relationship between alcohol misuse and drinks industry sponsorship of sporting activities; and what everyone should know about cannabis and drug abuse in Ireland &mdash; a Waterford perspective.  </P>
        <P>A great deal of work has gone into all the various aspects of the drugs issue.  Many suggestions and recommendations have been made.  A good starting point would be to up-date ourselves on <Col N="70"/>what has gone on among ourselves during the past five years.  To show that the committees have a validity, perhaps we could read the reports and check out what has happened since they were concluded.</P>
        <P>My second issue relates to the matter raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, the non-insurance of cars.  In the Lower House I raised the issue of the sting-ray device used in the North which enables the reading of a tax disc on a car.  One stands along the roadside with the equivalent of a speed hair dryer and via technology one can link into the tax authorities and find out whether a car is taxed.  This is more relevant in the Republic on the basis that we display three discs, the NCT disc, the insurance disc and the tax disc.  Therefore the equivalent of a sting-ray here would be much more effective on the roadside to determine who is legally on the road.  It is an issue that ought to be pursued.  When I raised the matter on an Adjournment debate the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, said he had come in with one idea of what he was going to say, but he tore up his script after I had finished speaking and said it was a good idea and that he would pursue it.  Will the Leader give an update on whether the matter has been pursued?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has led the way in much innovative legislation in recent years.  I was impressed yesterday at the launch of a children&rsquo;s plan in Britain.  I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.  It is a 170 page document.  A couple of phrases, in particular, attracted me to it.  It states that parents, not Governments, bring up children.  It also refers to the best place in the world in which to bring up our children and in this regard it identifies families and the benefits of family life.  Given our recent problems with drugs, I was reminded that in the US there has been a big move towards family dinners at home.  It has been discovered that in those families that eat together, at least once a week at home, the teenagers in later years are less likely to have addictions to drugs, alcohol, tobacco and so on and have much better results in their examinations.  While we do not necessarily need legislation for this, we should produce a document similar to that published in Britain.  Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children would provide the opportunity for the House to debate this topic in order to move it along in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I make two requests to the Leader for possible debates in the near future.  On the conclusion of a court case yesterday involving the unnecessary death of a man&rsquo;s wife three years ago, through medical negligence, I seek a debate on how medical negligence is dealt with, how people receive information and whether such information is of a terminal nature.  I have worked directly with the man involved and <Col N="71"/>have direct experience of the frustration he has had in accessing such information.  We are close to one year in the life of the new Health Information and Quality Authority.  It would serve the House well to find out whether the system in place has helped fill many of those gaps.  I suspect it has not.  There is a need to identify why such an inhumane system still exists in terms of informing people of how the health system does not serve their best interests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second matter relates to the launch today by Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann of a series of policy documents about how life on our offshore islands can be immeasurably improved by better action by the political system.  It was launched today by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Given that the House has a particular brief to deal with minorities in Irish society and those who live on the periphery of Irish life, a debate on island life with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs would be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to one matter which featured last week in the discussion on the budget but which was lost in all the various figures and discussions on expenditure, namely, the very basis of our national finances.  After ten years of the Celtic tiger we should not have a national debt.  What has featured in the Budget Statement by the Minister is that we have a return to borrowing and an increase in our absolute debt and an increase in percentage terms.  We all remember the 1990s when we tried to qualify for the European Monetary Union by reducing our debt and keeping down the rate of inflation.  They were difficult times economically and politically but the debt was consistently reduced until this year.  As set out in the Budget Statement, we are now into a period of budgetary deficits and increased borrowing.  This is due to a lack of budgetary discipline and a lack of fiscal control on expenditure, which was a feature of the Fine Gael-Labour Government in the 1990s when we recorded the first budget surplus in the history of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>That was in the 1980s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I say this because it underpins our entire national finances.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to address the specific issue of how we are dealing with the national debt, why we are not debt free at this stage and how in terms of budgetary control and value for money we will be able to sustain continuing budgetary deficits as forecast for the coming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a couple of issues, but perhaps I will respond to Senator Regan first and foremost.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="72"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to respond.  It is matter for the Leader to respond to anyone who raises a matter on the Order of Business.  If the Senator wishes to raise a matter with the Leader I suggest he make it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s call for a debate on our national finances, and the Senator will probably change his view after we have had such a debate.  In fairness to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who has introduced four budgets he went into the Chamber on this occasion clearly indicating he was changing his approach in regard to budget 2008.  He was borrowing modestly to invest ambitiously and continue Ireland on the tremendous economic gain of recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is called a U-turn.  What about stamp duty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think there is anybody in the House who would not support the good work of the National Treasury Management Agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and all involved who have done Trojan work in respect of our national debt. </P>
        <P>I wish to raise an important issue to which many speakers have referred and which I have raised in the past but have not got any satisfaction.  As a parent with young children and as a member of the public aware of what is happening in the area of substance abuse, I ask that the House would come up with a mechanism to deal with this.  We have heard numerous Members speak about this issue.  Senator Keaveney outlined earlier the list of what has been done.  We have a tremendous new committed Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy who, I believe, will prove to be a great asset to the security of the State.  When one raises issues, as I have done in the past, one is told it is a matter for the joint committee.  When one goes to such a joint committee one is told the Garda Commissioner was before another joint committee the previous week and will be back before it in three months&rsquo; time, and that the issue raised is not for this committee.  We are not dealing with the issues.  Will the leaders agree a mechanism whereby this Chamber could address the tremendous anxiety of the general public, parents and a large number of responsible young people who are aware of extent of substance abuse?   All arms of the State should get involved to deal with the serious issues that arise in this regard.  If we must suspend Standing Orders or introduce a new Standing Order, surely this House is empowered to do so. <Col N="73"/> Let us do this and find a way so that we, the Members of the House, can have a system and a mechanism through which to question all the relevant bodies.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator Keaveney listed all the reports available and we have charged very committed people with responsibilities, such as the new Garda Commissioner, who is really committed.  One sometimes hears from members of the Garda or other State agencies that their hands are tied or they need the Legislature to change legislation in this, that or the other regard, but we do not act.  I ask that we would try to find a mechanism whereby we would have a body that would do good work over a relatively short period, come up with an appropriate system, put it in place and implement it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>As my colleague, Senator Alex White, noted, today sees the hearing into the proposal to change the toll system on the M50.  From next August, when the National Roads Authority takes charge of the West Link, tolls for registered users will increase from the current price of &euro;1.90 to up to &euro;2.50, and for occasional users, such as myself, who might use the road once every couple of weeks, the charge will increase to &euro;3, which is a whopping 60% increase.</P>
        <P>The NRA has sent a report on demand management techniques for the M50 to the Minister for Transport.  I am concerned that these toll charges are simply a back-door means of introducing demand management techniques on the M50.  We cannot begin to talk about demand management on the M50 without putting in place sufficient public transport alternatives.  When demand management techniques were introduced in London by the Mayor, Mr. Ken Livingstone &mdash; the congestion charge &mdash; he provided hundreds of additional buses and slashed bus fares.  We cannot introduce demand management techniques on the M50 without doing something similar.  We must provide an alternative.  I would like the Leader to bring the Minister for Transport to the House so we can hear his views on the issue of the changes to the toll and whether he intends to introduce demand management techniques on the M50.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad, with the other House, is probably the only place where major issues can be dealt with honestly and openly.  Watching &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; last night, I did not think it was good that Senator Bacik was heckled while she was trying to make a difficult point.  The <i>Daily Mail</i> has embarked on a campaign to denounce people who are soft on drugs.  As one who does not drink, smoke or ingest any substances, who is more pro-life than pro-choice, and who believes in the death penalty for the shooting of police officers, I am not soft <Col N="74"/>on anything like that.  I have an honest opinion, however, that as long as drugs are prohibited, the criminals will flourish.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night proved that despite &euro;320 billion being spent on the war against drugs, that war is being lost.  This House is one of the few places in Ireland where all aspects of the drug mystery can be debated.  It remains a mystery to most people, who do not understand the world of cannabis, cocaine, heroin and the two terrifying words the Taoiseach introduced last night &mdash; not &ldquo;pay rise&rdquo;, but &ldquo;crystal meth&rdquo;.  Crystal meth will really test the assumptions of Members of this House on how a crackdown on crime will solve this problem.  It has destroyed whole swathes of the United States but it can be made in a bucket in a back garden for a couple of cent.  How will this be dealt with on a criminal basis?</P>
        <P>As Senators Keaveney and Corrigan have pointed out, the public education side of this matter is critical.  We can treat drugs fundamentally as a criminal problem or as a social and medical problem.  I tend to believe it should be treated as a social and medical problem and as a matter of constant public education, of which this Seanad debate is a part.  Of course the police will demand more resources; police forces, like hospitals, will always demand more resources.  We should be able to debate, however, whether it is best to spend &euro;100 on recruiting another garda to hang around drug dealers or spend it on a public education health and substance campaign.  I was struck by Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s remarks yesterday in this regard.</P>
        <P>All addictive substances, whether alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, heroin, cocaine or crystal meth, are bad for us.  What do we do?  Do we wait for them to arrive and then criminalise them or begin now to spend the bulk of our money on public education campaigns to frighten people and show them how dangerous they are and what they do to lives?  This is an important debate.  It should not be politicised and subject to barracking and heckling in this House.  We have the leading role in public education in this country and we should be allowed to conduct this debate without it being politicised and turned into partisan bickering.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senators Harris and O&rsquo;Toole for raising the issue of yesterday&rsquo;s debate.  It is important that when we have a debate on drugs, mandatory testing and other issues, it would be conducted in a rational and civilised manner.  I was very disappointed yesterday to be subjected to the sort of barracking that took place.  It was a lazy response.  I was delighted that last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme presented alternative and quite radical views, and did so fairly and calmly in what was a rational debate.  I am delighted Senator Harris was listened to with great respect today when he expressed his views, which are more radical than my own.  This is correct and I am delighted the debate can be conducted in this way.</P><Col N="75"/>
        <P>I am grateful to the Leader and Deputy Leader for engaging with me in regard to seeking a further debate on the Climate Protection Bill 2007 which I introduced in the House in Private Members&rsquo; time on 3 October.  At that stage, I was promised we could have a further debate on it in Government time before Christmas.  I spoke at a rally organised by Stop Climate Chaos in Dublin on Saturday, which was attended by hundreds of people in the pouring rain.  They were very concerned to hear what was happening with regard to climate protection legislation in the context of the Bali talks.  There is a real groundswell of support for this type of measure and for putting into legislation the commitments to reduce carbon emissions, which we signed up to under the Kyoto Protocol and which we are likely to sign up to further in Bali.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s request for a debate on broader issues in regard to child care and how we look after our children.  I had occasion to spend time in the Rotunda Hospital two weeks ago attending the birth of my second child.  Talking to the midwives there, I could not help but observe how much busier the facility was than the last time I was there two years ago.  The midwives told me thousands more children are being born now than was the case two years ago but the facilities are exactly the same.</P>
        <P>The Master of the Coombe Hospital stated yesterday that there are now serious health issues with regard to how children are being born.  If we are to have a debate on children, we need to focus on probably the most important aspect, namely, how we bring them into the world in the first place.  In Germany, the birth of a child is regarded as being so important that the parents are given &euro;34,000 in a direct payment.  In France, for every additional child brought into a family, the tax credit available to the family is increased.  Ireland is blessed to be in a situation where we expect future population growth.  In any debate on child care, I would ask why we are not better set up to deal with this issue than is the case at present.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point on uninsured drivers on our roads.  We spend so much of our time discussing accountability.  This is an issue of which we all are and have been aware for many years.  In any debate, we should ask these simple questions.  Why has nothing happened?  Why are Members again discussing this issue?</P>
        <P>In any debate on the situation in Russia, it is imperative we do not allow our standards of what constitutes democracy to slip to the point that we are praising what happened in recent weeks.</P>

	<P>I will be brief.  It is a country that has just delivered an election in which observers said there was little point in them observing what was happening as standards had slipped so far.  Whatever debates we may have in future, we cannot remain blind to the abuse of power that is taking place there.  We certainly cannot praise what is happening there at the moment.    </P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the report of the inquiry into the Brothers of Charity that was released yesterday, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to attend the House.  The report raises a number of issues that are not limited to the Brothers of Charity services by any means, but in fact could apply to any disability services around the country.  For example, there are aspects of the current legal system that make it difficult for any legal action to be taken in such circumstances.  It is imperative that we should address these issues.  We must examine what supports we can put in place to facilitate adults with an intellectual disability to give evidence and come forward with such allegations.  A new inspectorate has been established but for the past number of years an anomaly has arisen whereby if one provides a residential service for children with intellectual disabilities one is exempt from such inspections.  While all children are vulnerable, clearly those with an intellectual disability are even more vulnerable.  This makes it imperative that such services should be subject to the work of the inspectorate.  I welcome the fact that residential facilities for children with intellectual and physical disabilities will now be subject to the new inspectorate.  In addition, residential facilities for adults with intellectual disability will be included within the inspectorate&rsquo;s remit.  That system should be put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Some 3,000 people with intellectual disability are currently inappropriately residing in institutional settings.  As a result of yesterday&rsquo;s report, we should examine why our residential services are not keeping up with international best practice.  As a matter of urgency we must first tackle the vast majority of those 3,000 people who reside in inappropriate places.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom d&aacute; mbeadh muid &aacute;balta am a chur i leataoibh f&aacute; choinne d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar acmhainn&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha na t&iacute;re seo.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on natural resources, particularly those offshore.  I listened to Senator Hanafin talking about Russia selling off its natural resources for the price of a house, but in some cases this State did not even <Col N="77"/>get the price of a house, particularly for the Corrib gas field.  Other exploration licences have been offered to multinational companies over the years.  In recent years, there has been a rush to offer licences to different companies off the coast of Donegal where some nine companies are currently exploring.  We need a sensible debate on what benefits accrue to Ireland from our own natural resources.  Other countries use their natural resources to provide public services, but the only benefit of the old terms and conditions we have is to line the pockets of shareholders of multinational companies.  Having said that, I welcome the change the Minister made on taking office concerning some of the terms involved.  Nonetheless, we need to have a further debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a debate on education, even though we had one recently.  Implications arising from the budget include the ending of the summer work scheme, as well as the increased cost of school transport.  The cost of such transport for secondary school children attending fourth and fifth year is to rise by &euro;120 per year.  We should have a debate on those budgetary issues.</P>
        <P>Members of the Seanad should be able to table parliamentary questions in the same way as Deputies can.  Senators should have a right to seek answers from Ministers by way of written questions.  Many Senators are aligned to political parties and can submit parliamentary questions through Deputies in the Lower House, but Independent Senators do not have that opportunity.  Such a system does not have to be part of the overall Seanad reform package, but could be introduced simply to allow all Senators to table parliamentary questions.  This would speed up the Order of Business which is currently used to seek information on a range of issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to an issue I raised yesterday, which is the report of the Irish Human Rights Commission on rendition.  It is an important matter and I compliment the Green Party, through you, a Chathaoirligh, on its apparently firm stand.  I hope that party maintains its firm stand so as to extract for the first time honest answers from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  It is too much to expect honesty from the Americans.  I note that in the documents there is a reference to a statement from the United States ambassador that no US aircraft involved in the illegal transfer of prisoners had landed in Shannon.  We know that is a lie, however.  It is a disgrace that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has attacked those who did the job he should have done, referring to them as a self-appointed activist group.  Thank God for them.  They noted the planes and gave us their flight patterns so we know the truth, which is that planes involved in rendition landed in Shannon repeatedly as part of an unbroken cycle of rendition.  When the Minister talks about Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="78"/>total opposition to rendition does it include refuelling those planes?  How does that express total opposition?  It is time we had a debate on this matter.    </P>
        <P>We should also have a debate on the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  It is outrageous that a person who heard the most appeals, who openly boasted that he never allowed one person into the country, and who is paid for this, has been allowed to withdraw on health grounds in the middle of an action by somebody who said they did not want their case to be heard by this person because he had never allowed somebody through.  I am calling for an immediate examination of this matter by way of an inquiry into the refugee appeals system.  What rights do the dozens or hundreds of people have who were denied access by this man, who was clearly unfit?  What will happen to them?  Will their cases be reopened?  How are those working in the refugee appeals system selected, what are their qualifications and why are they not accountable when they behave in this way?  The whole system is rotten.</P>
        <P>I have already raised in this House the case of a man whom I know personally and who is completely blameless and without a stain on his character.  He has been blackguarded by some little squirt in the police service, and a black mark was put on his record thus denying him citizenship of this country.  He was told his application had been denied and that he could appeal, but that in doing so he must quote the reasons for the initial rejection.  However, when he applied for the reasons for the rejection, he was refused access to them.  This is madness.  What is happening in this area?  It is a shambles and an abuse of human rights.  We should have a firm examination of the matter.  I am calling for an inquiry into the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which is a shame to citizens of this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Harris.  The debate should be widened, however, to include the number of admissions of young people, particularly adolescents, to psychiatric units with drug induced psychosis and other effects of drug taking.  It is another sad aspect of the drug scourge, which has been going on for quite some time.</P>
        <P>I am also seeking a debate on the number of American companies located in Ireland.  Has their stability been affected by the current downturn as well as the dollar-euro exchange rate?  My concern stems from the decision by Abbott to relocate to the Middle East.  In percentage terms, what is our dependency on American companies on both a regional and national basis?  I would be pleased if the Leader would allow a debate on that issue.</P>

Clearly, the system facilitates fraud.  Senator Cecilia Keaveney mentioned the sting-ray system.  This is a total scata bull&aacute;n of a system which must be immediately replaced.  It is shocking for people in authority to stand over it.  I hope the matter will be addressed immediately.  Will the Leader outline the sitting arrangements for next week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I was struck by an issue raised by Senators Alex White and Hannigan.  It is a serious issue not because of the detail but because of the principle.  I refer to what is happening on the M50 today.  Senator Alex White pointed out that the National Roads Authority is holding some kind of hearing and that an appeal is going through.  I thought that battle had been won and that the State had bought out National Toll Roads for &euro;600 million, &euro;50 million per year until 2020.  I thought it had done so in order to let the traffic flow freely but what has happened is that it has bought out NTR so that the motorist, having been screwed by one monopoly, will now be screwed by the State in an even more crucial and acute way.  That is a serious situation for which the Minister for Transport must answer.</P>
        <P>The State is increasing the toll by approximately 60%, which is unacceptable.  There is no alternative for people because one of the most extraordinary aspects of this toll is that it is not spread around the M50.  One can travel on the M50 from one point to another without paying anything.  One must only go through one point at the Westlink to pay.  It is an extraordinary anomaly which the State is exploiting.  Senator Hannigan is right in that it should be completely toll free or that the approach roads should be tolled.  It is not an easy thing for a politician to say but it is a time in the electoral period when that position could be taken.</P>
        <P>One cannot take the M50 in isolation and toll it to get money to pay for the upkeep of the road.  This is systematic of an appalling transport problem.  Why do we not consider letting people travel free on public transport in the Dublin area or further afield to get them off the roads, as suggested by the Labour Party?  Instead of the State doing that, it is keeping people on the roads and screwing them for money in the way NTR did in the past.  What is happening is wrong and the Minister should come to the House to tell us a little more about transport policy in the context of what is happening today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey and many other Senators again expressed their concerns about the abuse of cocaine.  As I said yesterday, this issue will be debated in Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time next Wednesday.  I invite those Members from the legal profession and with health expertise to a meeting in my office at 2.30 p.m. today to assist in framing next Wednesday&rsquo;s motion.  It is an unusual departure <Col N="80"/>for the Leader to take but 21 Senators raised this issue yesterday.  I acknowledge Senators have expertise in many areas, so I am holding this meeting for those who are genuinely interested in addressing how we will deal with this debate.</P>
        <P>While the debate will be held in Private Members&rsquo; time, which is normally from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., I have an open mind in regard to extending it.  We may adjourn the debate because many people are learning new things and we want to be able to assist the Government and the Minister in facing the challenge.  Many different genuine views have been expressed in the House and to accommodate all those views, I would like the assistance of those with expertise in the framing of the motion.  It will be an all-party motion, although it will be taken in Fianna F&aacute;il time.  I would like to meet the leaders of the groups immediately after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked about Leas Cross and I will have inquiries made with the Garda Commissioner on the up-to-date position.  Senators Joe O&rsquo;Toole, Cecilia Keaveney, Paschal Donohoe and Paul Coghlan raised the issue of false insurance numbers to obtain car tax and uninsured vehicles.  We all know 10% of vehicles are uninsured.  Even if one has a no claims bonus for 30 years, one must still pay 10% for the 10% of people who are uninsured.  There is a challenge ahead in this regard.  As I stated on the last occasion this was raised on the Order of Business, much research has emerged as a result of the good work done by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the last D&aacute;il.  We will have a debate on this issue after the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, Dominic Hannigan and Shane Ross expressed grave concerns about the difficulties being experienced on the M50.  As we all know, a huge amount of work is being carried out on the M50 and it is due to be completed next year.  There will be a third lane on the M50.  Those of us who use the N4 and the N3 every morning will see Operation Freeflow in action.  This morning I travelled from Castlepollard to the House in one hour and 17 minutes which would have been unheard of 12 months ago.</P>

We must be realistic.  The Celtic tiger part 1 and part 2 will present challenges for us all.  We will have the Celtic tiger part 3 during the lifetime of this Government.</P>

	<P>The younger Members will realise that in time.  Having said that, I have no difficulty leaving time aside for a debate on progress on the M50.  What is needed is another ring-road to Kilcock and Navan.  If one goes to Beijing or Shanghai, one sees all the activity as a result of a buoyant economy like Ireland&rsquo;s.  We must take examples from how they deal with this.</P>
        <P>Senators Paschal Donohoe, Dominic Hannigan and John Hanafin expressed various views on Russia and what is happening there.  They also called for statements on the new EU accession states.  I have no difficulty leaving time aside for such a debate.  Senator Buttimer called for a debate on bullying and on the unfortunate incident he outlined to the House.  I can also set aside time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty and others called for a debate on education.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on a very good proposal in respect of the children&rsquo;s plan, which was published yesterday in the UK.  As he pointed out, parents bring up children, not governments.  There was never a truer saying than that expressed by the Senator in the House this morning.  He contends that families which eat together stay together.  I used to hear years ago that the family which prays together stays together.  I will totally support whatever it takes to keep families together and on the straight and narrow and to give them a foundation.  I will set aside time for a debate on this soon after the Christmas recession, sorry, recess.</P>

He also raised the issue of the policy document on the islands and <Col N="82"/>called for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come to the House for a debate.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time for this.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and Callely called for a debate on the budget.  I thought that very many colleagues would mention the budget last week and congratulate the Minister on allocating another &euro;1.7 billion for capital funding.  I have no difficulty with having the Minister come to the House.  I am sure he will be pleased to come here and update the House on his new budget, which is the first in the new D&aacute;il and Seanad session.  If it is as good as what has happened over the past ten years, let it happen again.</P>
        <P>In respect of Senators&rsquo; concerns about the budget deficit, it is fair to say that we are the second strongest economy in Europe.  We have left aside substantial amounts of money in each budget for pension funds.  As Members are aware, 50% of the population was under the age of 28 ten years ago.  Now 50% are under the age of 34 and this is increasing.  Hopefully, everyone will live a little longer, therefore, we must leave funds aside for pensions.</P>
        <P>All fair-minded people would have to say that it was an honest and genuine effort by a caring Minister who brought in a reasonably good budget last week, one with which many people were satisfied under current constraints due to the price of oil and the uncertainty in the US and other destinations.  We can look forward to a debate on the budget with confidence.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for a debate on child care, for which I can set aside time.  Senator Corrigan called for a debate on the report yesterday on the school and residential centre run by the Brothers of Charity.  I can also set aside time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty called for a debate on what can be done in respect of national resources and their benefits.  We are always learning from this.

As the Senator is aware, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, will be in the House today to outline matters to the House.

    <Title>European Union Reform Treaty: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On the eve of the signing of the European Union reform treaty, it is entirely appropriate that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should consider this issue.  We are at a very important moment in the life of the EU.  The reform treaty will, first of all, allow the EU to move away from the stasis of the past six or seven years when we have been looking internally and really achieving very little.  It will allow the European Union to move forward to a more outward-looking, concrete and tangible agenda.  It will also allow the European Union to better address global problems.  These are problems which cannot be solved by any individual member state, such as climate change, energy security, the challenges of globalisation and other problems like international terrorism, which are way beyond the control of any individual state, large or small.</P>
        <P>To do this in an effective way the European Union needs the new reform treaty.  One of the most frequently asked questions is why Europe needs a reform treaty.  The answer is straightforward.  The institutions, arrangements and structures designed 50 years ago for a European Economic Community of just six member states were stretched by the time the Union reached 12 member states, were already under pressure <Col N="84"/>when that number rose to 15 and were stretched beyond breaking point in a Union of 27.  One of the world&rsquo;s most important economic and trading blocks requires an effective treaty arrangement if it is to be effective.  Recognising the reality, the member states have reflected for well over six years on how the EU works and in this treaty, have put forward improvements which will help us and which will be in all of our interests.</P>
        <P>At the outset, it is important to note that this treaty had a completely different genesis from that of any of the previous treaties.  It differs from the Maastricht, Nice or the Amsterdam treaties.  It was not produced by unelected officials or the mythical faceless bureaucrats closeted behind closed doors away from public scrutiny &mdash; a criticism we heard in respect of all the earlier treaties.  This treaty&rsquo;s substance has its roots and essence in the Convention on the Future of Europe &mdash; a body of more than 200 public representatives from the member states, civil society and the EU institutions, which met throughout 2003.</P>
        <P>That convention, of which I had the significant honour of being a member, was a forum for full-blooded, regular and open debate.  Sometimes the debate was calm, sometimes it was heated and occasionally it was infuriating but the convention shaped this treaty and the future for the Union.  When the convention completed its deliberations member states negotiated further on the outcome document.  Those negotiations produced the draft EU constitutional treaty.</P>
        <P>Final agreement between the member states came on a memorable night in June 2004, the crowning achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency.  As a small nation we can take some pride that the draft constitution and its daughter, the reform treaty that will be signed in Lisbon tomorrow, owe much to Irish ingenuity in drafting, tenacity in negotiation and political patience.  I recall that night well, it is a moment for memoirs.  After a long hard day, tired and emotional Heads of State were beaten into an agreement we could all celebrate.  People refer to small nations and this was a wonderful example of how small nations in Europe can make a difference and show leadership.  I hope the people of this small nation show leadership and show Europe the way ahead when they record their views on the reform treaty at the ballot box.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, the draft constitution was not accepted by the French and Dutch electorates and a revised document built very firmly on the constitutional treaty and protecting all of its strong points was forged in yet more discussions.  In October member states reached an agreement on that new document, the reform treaty.  It is worth recalling the genesis of this treaty primarily to underline the fact that in it we have a document that has its origins in open and democratic debate.  The treaty is decidedly not the product of a secretive and elitist process.  Rather, it is the fruit of the labour of hundreds of men and <Col N="85"/>women democratically elected to parliaments and governments by the people of our Union.</P>
        <P>The treaty includes many improvements.  I will outline five reasons we can ask the Irish people to vote yes in the forthcoming referendum.  It will make the Union significantly more democratic.  The treaty provides an enhanced role for the European Parliament and a greater role for national parliaments.  For the first time, the treaty also provides for a European citizens initiative that will put more power into the hands of the citizen.  People will be able to have a more direct say on European matters.  A petition with at least one million signatures obtained from a number of member states can be sent to the European Commission inviting it to take a legislative initiative.  These are major democratic breakthroughs and will strengthen the democratic character of EU legislation.</P>
        <P>The treaty increases the number of areas in which the European Parliament, the physical expression of the democratic choice of the people of Europe, becomes the co-legislator with the Council.  Perversely, some who have spoken critically of a democratic deficit in the past are now complaining about this democratic step forward.  The Parliament&rsquo;s budgetary role is also strengthened.  The progression of parliamentary democracy within the Union structure has been remarkable.  Any historian or student of the spread of parliamentary democracy must examine Europe and see what has happened since 1979 as a model for movement.</P>
        <P>Even a quick glance at the Parliament&rsquo;s history demonstrates just how positive that evolution has been.  When it was first elected in 1979, the Parliament&rsquo;s involvement in co-decision making was minuscule, in single figures when expressed as a percentage.  The reform treaty will ensure that the Parliament will be involved in virtually all areas in which the Union legislates, an important democratic step.</P>
        <P>The greater role for national parliaments is also a significant added dimension of democratic oversight.  For the first time our national parliaments will have a direct input into the evolution of European legislation.  The reform treaty will provide for national parliaments to bring to bear their influence by offering reasoned opinions on the appropriateness of EU Commission proposals.  This is a vital recognition of the role of national parliamentarians and, by extension, their constituents.  It is noteworthy that Jaime Gama, the former Portuguese foreign minister, who is now speaker of the Portuguese Parliament, saw national parliaments as the greatest winners of this new treaty.</P>
        <P>Enhanced co-decision and greater involvement by national parliaments creates greater transparency by its nature.  If the elected representatives of the 27 member states and those who reflect democracy in the European Parliament are involved in the process of legislation, democracy is well served.  This demolishes one of the <Col N="86"/>criticisms that has been made time and again about the democratic deficit.  When this treaty is enacted the democratic landscape of the Union will be improved in a way and to a degree that could hardly be imagined a few years ago.  That is something all democrats will welcome.</P>
        <P>This treaty gives the Union a better decision-making system.  The new system of double-majority voting will give proportionate weight to population while protecting the interests of small and medium sized member states.  The double majority system will require specific majorities of people and nations.  A qualified majority will require 55% of the member states and 65% of the Union&rsquo;s population.  This should be welcomed.  Only those measures that truly attract majority support can be adopted at EU level.  The new voting system is, in addition, more straightforward, more logical and more effective than the current one.</P>
        <P>On the matter of voting the majority of Council decisions, close to 90%, are still taken without a vote and agreed by consensus.  Those who try to conjure up images of the big member states outvoting the smaller ones are not describing reality.  Under this treaty, even if all of the member states were to conspire together, which is highly unlikely, they would still need the support of a significant number of smaller member states to push forward a policy.  Such circumstances never have and never will operate.</P>
        <P>On most occasions, Ministers do not bring issues to a vote.  As a Union where member states respect and treat each other as equals, compromise is sought in order that a balanced outcome can be reached when decisions have to be made.  The view that the Union operates as some form of zero sum game where Ministers are sent empty-handed from Council meetings is a false one.  It was never a true picture and, if it were, the Union&rsquo;s very <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> would cease to exist.</P>
        <P>The third reason why we can confidently speak to the Irish people on the strength of the treaty and why they should vote for it is that the treaty makes the EU more accountable by strengthening protection for human rights in the work of the Union.  A new treaty article will explicitly state that the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty will confer legally binding treaty status on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I urge Members to read the charter, an uplifting statement of all that is good in the democracies of Europe.  It condenses the protection of human rights on which all of our democratic states are based.  The treaty marks a significant development in this area because the charter was only a political declaration when it was initially agreed in 2000.  By conferring legal status on the charter, we are giving practical effect to some of our most cherished values, the values at <Col N="87"/>the heart of democracy, espoused and upheld by the Irish people.  The aim of the charter is to consolidate existing fundamental rights and make them more visible.  The rights listed in the charter are derived from existing international conventions, Union law, or the common constitutional traditions of the member states.</P>
        <P>Another reason is the institutional change this treaty makes to strengthen the coherence of the EU and give it a clearer voice on the world stage.  Up to now, Europe has been an economic giant but, in world affairs, a minnow.</P>
        <P>There will be a new full-time President of the European Council who will co-ordinate its work.  As the Union&rsquo;s highest-level forum, the European Council will benefit from a dedicated chair who will be in a position to facilitate and steer its discussions and provide valuable continuity.  The latter is not present in the existing system.</P>
        <P>The new post of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy will increase the visibility and influence of the European Union in international affairs.  This will provide a better platform to project the priorities of Ireland and Europe in areas such as development assistance, human rights, peacekeeping, disarmament and all other issues of global interest.</P>
        <P>Some critics have complained that the creation of these two posts is a centralising move which will deprive member states of influence.  I would counter that by saying the people who fill these roles will be appointed with the agreement of the member states and they will take into account the balance of member states&rsquo; interests.  It is also important to note that the wider world will hear a common voice from the Union on vital global issues.  The latter can be only positive for small countries.</P>
        <P>From my previous experience as a student of the European Union, as an academic who lectured on its structures and, in more recent years, as someone who participated in the decision-making process, I am in a position to state that the manner in which it works is the very essence of democracy.  However, it is not often described as such.  It is critical that the Union should have a coherent say in respect of matters such as global warming, energy security, international terrorism, the trafficking of human beings, drugs and international crime.  All of the issues in respect of which coherence is needed can be dealt with more appropriately under the new structures.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased the reform treaty provides for member states to retain the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.  We will operate in teams of three member states working together over an 18-month Presidency.  This is a much more logical system than that which obtains at present and reflects the Troika arrangements in many ways.  The Presidency provides a great opportunity &mdash; albeit an onerous one &mdash; for each member state to guide the Union.  At the same time, it gives a member state an opportunity to bring home to its <Col N="88"/>people the sometimes hidden importance of the Union to their daily lives.</P>
        <P>We live in a world where the challenges are immense.  I refer here to climate change, energy security, international terrorism and providing development assistance to the poorest countries.  Committed members of the international community must act together to address these challenges.  This treaty gives the member states of the European Union the opportunity to work in concert, speak with a common voice and be truly effective.</P>
        <P>The fifth reason to which I wish to refer &mdash; I said I would deal with only five reasons but there are many others &mdash; is that the treaty will better protect the interests of smaller states.  We live in a world where commentators often speak of the disproportionate power of a small number of large countries.  The Union already recognises the rights and interests of small member states which, after all, make up its majority.  The treaty will give greater effect to the equality between all of the Union&rsquo;s member states.  Many of the issues that specifically relate to the expression of equality arise out of arguments put forward by the Irish during the debate at the convention and the subsequent drafting process.</P>
        <P>All member states will, as is the case at present, have equal access to membership of the European Commission.  There will be one Commissioner from each member state until 2014.  The treaty will protect the equality of member states because, from 2014 onward, membership of the Commission will rotate on an exactly equal basis.  A national from each member state &mdash; regardless of whether it is Germany, Malta, Luxembourg or Ireland &mdash; will sit on two Commissions out of three on the basis of strictly equal rotation.  This principle of equality between member states, regardless of their size or population, is vital and it is an important achievement for countries such as ours that this is being firmly enshrined in the reform treaty.</P>
        <P>When the issue of a smaller Commission first came up for discussion, it was suggested that each of the larger member states would have only one commissioner and that the balance of posts would be shared among the smaller member states.  The latter informed the convention that this was not acceptable.  Ireland was very much to the fore in that regard and all of the states eventually recognised that it was not acceptable.  This proved to be a singular victory for the smaller member states.</P>
        <P>A strong and cohesive Commission is essential to Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  The Commission is obliged to take into account the balance of interests of all member states.  This is why it is important for small member states such as Ireland to have a strong Commission in place.  A smaller group of Commissioners &mdash; but based on strict equality &mdash; is more likely to be effective than a very large one, which would be more difficult to manage and would have a weaker sense of collegiality.  Questions are already arising in respect of this <Col N="89"/>matter, particularly in light of some of the portfolios that have come into being at the 27-member Commission.  In circumstances such as those I have outlined, it is likely that a two-tier Commission could have become a reality.  The smaller member states rejected this scenario, which will, once and for all, be ruled out by the treaty.</P>
        <P>In the referendum campaign that lies ahead, for which I know there is strong support among Members of the House, the Government will focus on the positive.  In line with what I have been saying, we will make the case for the treaty based on a realistic assessment of where the balance of benefits lies for Ireland.  We have no doubt whatsoever that it is good for Ireland and its people.  However, we will be also obliged to the points that will be made against the treaty and the Union.  We must do so in a way which respects the fact that other people take a different view.  I do not think the Irish people will be easily persuaded to vote yes if they are bullied and hectored.  However, they will vote yes if we have an open, informed, courteous and respectful debate.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach pointed out on Monday last, one of the most striking things about the series of EU referenda held in this country during the past 35 years is how the negative arguments remain the same.  It is a case of ignoring the facts and putting forward the same old arguments.  The portrayal of the European Union as an evolving military superstate which will deprive Ireland of its non-aligned status is a recurring scare tactic.  I already heard this point being made on several occasions in the past two weeks.  This argument has been made in some guise or other from the outset of our European Union membership.  Members will recall that this was one of the big arguments put forward in 1972 and the basis of it was that Ireland would be forced to join NATO and would lose its neutral status as a result.  This argument was not true then and it remains untrue today.  There is nothing in the treaty that undermines Ireland&rsquo;s neutral status.</P>
        <P>Let us consider how perverse is the argument regarding the militarisation of Europe.  The EU&rsquo;s humanitarian and peacekeeping work in Aceh after the tsunami and its painstaking efforts in the western Balkans represent a much more accurate representation of the Union&rsquo;s ambition in this area.  The proposed EU-led mission in Chad is another example of the good work the Union can do in a troubled world.  These missions also reflect the principles and interests underlying Ireland&rsquo;s national instincts.  Nothing in the treaty can change our neutrality.  The latter remains a matter for the Irish people alone to decide upon.</P>
        <P>In addition to preserving unanimity in the area of defence, we are happy that there was no attempt to press for changes in taxation during the agreement on the reform treaty.  This was one of the red-line matters I brought to the negotiations at the convention.  I was supported in that regard by Members from all sides from both <Col N="90"/>Houses.  The treaty will not change anything in the area of taxation.</P>
        <P>In engaging in a positive campaign, the Government will challenge the treaty&rsquo;s opponents to spell out why the balance of it is against Ireland&rsquo;s interests and why voting against it could be possibly in Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  We will also challenge those who have consistently opposed the Union to explain how Ireland would be better off without it.</P>
        <P>We will make the case that we should judge our relationship with the Union in its totality.  We should measure its benefits in the aggregate and, despite the sometimes understandable temptation to allow individual policy setbacks to colour our view, we should bear in mind the widest sense of Ireland&rsquo;s interests.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government will engage in a vigorous information campaign.  An explanatory pamphlet &mdash; a very small document &mdash; will be published tomorrow to coincide with the signing of the treaty.  The reform treaty website, which has been established and is accessible to the public, will go live today.  A consolidated version of all EU treaties to date, including the reform treaty, will be available from tomorrow, as will a link to the consolidated version on the reform treaty website.  A more detailed information booklet in plain, simple, unadorned language will be available in late January and a White Paper, which will follow the more traditional format which usually is not read, will be published shortly afterwards and shortly before the introduction of a referendum Bill.</P>
        <P>I recognise and record the support for the reform treaty, especially from Fine Gael and the Labour Party and from across the political spectrum in the other House with only one party officially being against it.  Separate from the political parties&rsquo; campaigns the Forum on Europe will undertake a series of meetings throughout the country which will provide the public with information and a forum for debate on the treaty.  This was done very successfully on the previous occasion.  The former Senator Maurice Hayes and the Forum on Europe are building on the model used on the previous occasion.  I saw the list of their intended town hall meetings yesterday and, to put it mildly, it is impressive.  There will be no part of this country where there will not be a debate on the facts and realities of this treaty.  When the referendum Bill is published, a properly resourced referendum commission will be established to provide information on the treaty to the public and to encourage the electorate to vote.</P>
        <P>Our experience in the Union shows that small countries can prosper and that we can have our voice heard.  By pooling our sovereignty we have joined others to strengthen our case on many issues of national importance, namely, agriculture, foreign policy and economic policy.  Standing alone would not allow us to project or protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests or the interests of the <Col N="91"/>Irish people to the same effect.  Acting collectively has allowed this small nation to achieve far more than we could ever have hoped to achieve alone.</P>
        <P>The Union has proved a welcoming place for small nations such as Ireland to prove their worth.  It certainly has given us the opportunity to prove our capacities.  Some of our presidencies have witnessed historic European moments such as the reunification of Germany in 1990 and the enlargement of the Union in 2004.  One of the memories I will always carry with me in politics and beyond is that extraordinary moment in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in when the leaders of ten member states came out of the clouds and walked into the sunshine.</P>
        <P>We have reason to be proud of Ireland&rsquo;s role in Europe.  We have not just taken from Europe, which is often a mistake that is made in the debate on Europe.  The debate is often about what we get out of Europe, namely, how many euro, but our contribution has been much greater than that.  As a small nation, we have always punched way above our weight.  We have been generous with our time and efforts.  Through different Governments in different presidencies, we have made a real difference.  Irish Commissioners have brought something very special in the past.  I am thinking of the former Commissioner and President, Paddy Hillery, the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.  I ask Members to reflect on the good that was done from Irish thoughts that were brought to the table.  Ireland has given to Europe as well as taken.  Irish citizens have thrived at the heart of the European Union&rsquo;s institutions, proving again that small countries can play a central role.</P>
        <P>It is often asked what influence a small country can have?  I remember at one moment during the Irish Presidency answering questions in the European Parliament and the man sitting behind me as President of the Parliament was Pat Cox, a man who brought extraordinary distinction to that office.  Sitting across from me was an Irish Commissioner and, more importantly, the persons who were sitting beside the senior officials from the Commission were Irish, as is the case today.  Therefore, Ireland not only has punched above its weight but has used its membership efficiently, effectively and with purpose.</P>
        <P>It is not too much of a clich&eacute; to say that Europe&rsquo;s success is Ireland&rsquo;s success and that Ireland&rsquo;s success is Europe&rsquo;s success.  It is in all our interests, including Ireland&rsquo;s, for Europe&rsquo;s political, economic and social progress to take even deeper root across the Continent.  This reform treaty will assist this ongoing process.</P>
        <P>Similarly, it has been in Europe&rsquo;s interest to see Ireland develop from our relatively isolated and underdeveloped circumstances of 35 years ago.  The contribution of the Union to our progress has been immense and it would be less than generous <Col N="92"/>if we as a nation did not recognise that.  We have moved from a position where in 1973 Irish citizens had an income that was not that much more than half the European Union average to one that is now above the average.  Employment has doubled from 1 million to more than 2 million in that period.  The European Union has stood firmly behind Ireland and Britain in the search for peace in Northern Ireland.  It has been supportive and generous in political and financial terms.</P>
        <P>The historic economic and political developments in Ireland during our membership of the EU represent a European success story as well as an obvious Irish success story.  The Union&rsquo;s member states are rightly proud to point to the part they have played and we are right to acknowledge their contribution.  The reform treaty will continue to underpin this mutually reinforcing and positive relationship that exists between European countries.  It will continue to allow Europe to strengthen its internal bonds and to reach out more effectively to the wider world.  The evidence in favour of the Union and of this treaty is incontrovertible.  The treaty deserves our support and I hope support for it will be forthcoming when the Irish people pass their judgment in the referendum on the reform treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share my time with Senator Regan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and assure him that Fine Gael will be fully supportive of this treaty.  We intend to mount a vigorous campaign in favour of this treaty, as we have done in most referendums.</P>
        <P>The European reform treaty will make Europe work more efficiently and effectively, as the Minister of State said, by speeding up decision making in Brussels.  This is crucial now there are 27 member states, 12 more than there were five years ago.  It will also make Europe more democratic by strengthening the role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the European Parliament, both of which are elected directly by the Irish people.  The treaty also aims to enhance the role of Europe on the world stage, giving European member states a greater say in world affairs, for example, in the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation negotiations.</P>
        <P>The size of the European Parliament has become unwieldy since the two most recent rounds of enlargement.  It has been agreed, therefore, that the number of seats in Parliament will be capped at 750.  This should ensure the work of the Parliament can proceed in an efficient manner.  Each member state, no matter how small, is guaranteed a minimum of six seats, with the maximum number for any one country capped at 96 MEPs.  The upper limit will affect Germany, <Col N="93"/>which will have far fewer MEPs <i>per capita</i> than Ireland.  We will have 12 MEPs in total, which amounts to the loss of one MEP.</P>
        <P>The treaty will also reduce the size of the European Commission.  Each member state has one full Commissioner, which is unworkable, as the Minister of State said, with 27 departments operating at present.  If the reform treaty is adopted, the Commission will remain like this until 2014, at which point the size will be reduced.  From that point on, each member state will have a seat on two out of every three Commissions, with strictly equal rotation.  This new situation will apply to each member state, irrespective of its size.  Malta, for instance, the smallest member state, thus will have the same level of representation as Germany, the largest member state.</P>
        <P>It is widely accepted that the various institutions of European Union are somewhat incoherent and require greater co-ordination.  To address this weakness a new full-time President of the European Council will be elected by member states for a maximum of five years.  At present the President of the European Council rotates every six months, along with the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.  This longer term will provide much greater synchronisation within the EU.  Furthermore, the traditional so-called travelling circus of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which rotates from country to country every six months, will now occur over an 18-month period and will be hosted by a team of three member states working together at one time.  Ireland is to be teamed with Greece and Lithuania and will take on the Presidency in 2013.</P>
        <P>Henry Kissinger famously said, &ldquo;When I want to call Europe, who do I call?&rdquo;  The EU has long been at a disadvantage on the world stage because there was no one single voice representing our common position.  The EU is currently represented abroad by the Council&rsquo;s high representative for common foreign and security policy and the Commissioner for External Affairs.  In order to streamline these positions, the reform treaty proposes the creation of a single position of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.  This person will become Vice President of the Commission and will chair the Foreign Affairs Council of Ministers.  He will be supported by a European external action service and will be charged with enhancing the co-ordination of EU activity abroad.</P>
        <P>The use of majority voting in the Council, where just one member state could veto any proposal, was becoming unworkable due to the enlarged size of the Union.  Therefore, the introduction of majority voting in a variety of areas is a welcome change, which will make decision making much easier.  If the treaty is passed, double majority voting will come into force in 2014.  This means that a majority of 55% of the member states will be required, in addition to 65% of the Union&rsquo;s population.  This ensures that no bloc &mdash; either the small member states or the large ones <Col N="94"/>&mdash; can gang up on another.  It is the fairest possible form of majority voting.</P>
        <P>The role of national Parliaments is to be strengthened under the treaty, with each member state having two votes.  In Ireland, both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will have a vote each.  National Parliaments will have an eight week period to offer a reasoned opinion on whether a Commission proposal is overstepping the mark.  If at least one third of the votes of national Parliaments require it, the proposal must be reviewed.  If a Commission proposal for EU legislation is opposed by more than half of the votes allocated to national Parliaments, the Commission must justify its proposal in a reasoned opinion and it may be blocked by the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>In order to enhance co-operation between member states on legal and security issues, majority voting will now apply in this area, so that one country may not stop the progress of all others by exercising a veto.  The areas affected include terrorism, human trafficking, drugs trafficking, corruption, money laundering, counterfeiting, computer crime and organised crime.  Ireland has chosen to opt out of these provisions, along with the UK, but with an option to opt in on a case by case basis.  These arrangements are to be reviewed within three years of the treaty entering into force.</P>
        <P>A new article will state that the European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights of persons belonging to minorities.  The treaty will also make the European Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding for the first time.  The charter consolidates and reflects the human rights which are already set down in European and Irish law.</P>
        <P>The date agreed for ratification by the Lisbon Council is January 1st 2009.  Most member states are expected to ratify the treaty by parliamentary means, but we will have a referendum.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate the likely date for such a referendum.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will campaign vigorously for this treaty to be passed in any referendum.  We believe it will ensure more democracy, faster decision making, greater influence on the world stage, greater clout in WTO negotiations, that it will enhance our human rights and will provide a greater role in peace keeping missions.  I hope that Commissioner McCreevy&rsquo;s fear that the Irish people would use this referendum as a means of voting against a very unpopular Government will prove to be unfounded.  I also hope that we all work vigorously to ensure this referendum will pass and I wish the Minister of State well in his negotiations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been involved in European affairs since 1974, and my own personal experience is that Europe has been good <Col N="95"/>for this country.  We have found our way in Europe, we can work within the system and it has benefited the country enormously.  Fine Gael was unique in embracing integration and has been at all times a consistent supporter of European integration.  I pay tribute to people from Fine Gael such as Garret FitzGerald, Peter Sutherland and John Bruton, who continue to play a role in fostering European integration.  Europe has been good for us in every sphere of activity, be it the economy, environmental policy and social rights.  It also strengthened Ireland as a small country on the international stage, whether it has been through trade agreements, fostering climate change agreements and other environmental issues.</P>
        <P>This treaty is a consolidation of the treaties that are currently in operation.  Its objectives are to create an area of freedom, security, justice and peace in Europe and internationally, as well as the protection of human rights.  They are noble objectives and I do not think anybody can fail to subscribe to them.  The treaty is particularly designed to improve its workability, with 27 member states in the EU at the moment.  In many ways it is more democratic and it provides for a greater involvement of national Parliaments.  Two of its major selling points are the increased role of Europe in the fight against international crime, as well as the codification in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the rights which have been implicit in the treaty and in the jurisprudence of the European courts to date.  I fully support this treaty.</P>
        <P>Before the date for a referendum is announced, advice has been given on whether the referendum is legally required.  I question whether it is legally required.  We all support the holding of a referendum, because it has worked to involve people in the process of European integration.  However, just because we are having a referendum, it does not follow that it is legally required.  In the Crotty judgment, many changes on Europe were permitted.  The changes that are envisaged in this treaty are simply improvements in natural developments from the treaty.</P>
        <P>We will also have to overcome a number of problems which inevitably will emerge in the referendum campaign.  There has been a failure, in the five years since the Nice Treaty, to fulfil a promise to scrutinise EU legislation and to involve the Oireachtas intimately in such scrutiny.  The recent decision of the Government to opt out from policing and criminal law matters has created a doubt on whether co-operation in that area is beneficial for this country, when I believe it is a selling point of this treaty that Europe can enhance our efforts at national level to combat organised crime.</P>
        <P>A more fundamental issue arises at this point that voters will find difficult to ignore.  The main proponent of this treaty, the current Taoiseach, cannot be trusted to tell the truth even when he <Col N="96"/>is giving evidence on oath.  There has been a cover-up about payments received by him in 1994 and 1995 and the entire Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party and the Government are complicit in that.  This is an issue of confidence and trust in politics.  It cannot be avoided and it will emerge on the doorsteps.  I ask the Minister of State to address these problems and explain how he proposes to overcome them, especially the latter, which will be a fundamental problem in the referendum campaign.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I must rebut the constant allegations being made by Senator Regan in connection with the Mahon tribunal.  That tribunal is currently underway and it will report in due course.  I believe the Taoiseach&rsquo;s evidence will be vindicated.  When Senator Regan makes those comments he should refer to his former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, who contradicted his evidence to the Mahon tribunal.  One could not get a stronger admission of responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is not but the Leas-Chathaoirleach allowed Senator Regan to make allegations against our Taoiseach.  I am rebutting those comments in the name of fairness and balance, separate from today&rsquo;s debate.  When it is allowed on one side it is fair to allow it on the other side.  I make no reflection on Mr. Bruton, who is an honourable man, as is our current Taoiseach.  Whatever events take place in the Mahon tribunal are a matter for that tribunal.</P>
        <P>I would like to return to the beginning of our membership of the European Union.  The application was made by the late, great Mr. Se&aacute;n Lemass, as Taoiseach in the early 1960s.  Ireland was the first country outside the original six to apply for membership, and that is relevant.  It indicates Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s forward-looking approach to the EU.  The late Mr. Jack Lynch and former President Dr. Paddy Hillary were involved in the negotiations, and our membership was acceptable to the Irish people.  I need not emphasise how important involvement in the EU has become for Ireland.  The reform treaty is crucial to continuing and developing that involvement and Ireland is in the unique position of holding a referendum on the ratification of the treaty.  The Attorney General will confirm that it is necessary for us to hold the referendum to ratify this important treaty.</P>
        <P>It is vital that the public be fully informed of the implications of this long and complex document.  Only then can we have an honest and informed debate on the question which will be put to the people in the forthcoming referendum.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, has discussed a public awareness and information campaign and I hope <Col N="97"/>to see a genuine debate in the media and the public arena.  The Chairman will announce this in a press conference tomorrow to begin the campaign from the committee&rsquo;s point of view.</P>
        <P>On institutional reform, the principal proposals of the treaty include a double majority voting system whereby a qualified majority will require 55% of the member states and 65% of the EU&rsquo;s population.  Membership of the European Commission will be rotational and each member state will appoint a commissioner for ten out of every 15 years.  This will reduce our influence on European policy formulation on occasions but is probably necessary for the efficient working of an ever expanding organisation.  The rotations will be strictly equal between all states, large and small.  I commend the tremendous contribution of Ireland&rsquo;s European Commission appointments to the increased successes of the European Union, most notable recently in the great respect in which Commissioner Charlie McCreevy is held throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>The post of President of the European Council will be better defined and elected on a more permanent basis than the current six month rotation.  This will give more stability and direction to the role and therefore to the European Council.  We have been fortunate in the appointments of all governments to the Commission.  This country has been well served by all the Commissioners, although they are also serving Europe.</P>
        <P>There will be increased co-operation between states in justice and home affairs.  Ireland has secured the right to elect whether to opt in to these proposals on a case by case basis.  This decision by Ireland will be reviewed in three years&rsquo; time and in the meanwhile we will seek to participate to the maximum possible extent in all co-operation in judicial and police criminal matters, co-operation which is likely to become increasingly necessary due to the borderless nature of modern day crime.  We have secured the best possible arrangements for Ireland in this area by leaving the door open to necessary co-operation without compromising our legal system.  I compliment Deputy Roche on his work on this.</P>
        <P>The treaty will give a formal direct role to national parliaments for the first time in the history of European institutions.  This will mean all EU legislative proposals will be forwarded to national parliaments for scrutiny and comment.  This will formalise the already increasing role that these Houses play in discussing European matters.  The Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, of which I am a member, is dealing with an enormous backlog of legislation which we are trying to clear as much as possible.  It gives our Parliament a great opportunity to discuss European legislation and is a democratic approach to European affairs.  It gets little coverage, nevertheless it is happening.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights will be given legal status under the reform treaty and it <Col N="98"/>will formalise targets to combat climate change, something with which very few people will disagree.  Ireland has been an enthusiastic member of Europe.  We have benefited immensely from our involvement in the EU and are seen by new member states as a case study in the transformation of an economy.  Irish people are well informed about Europe and I have no doubt they will choose wisely.  I suspect people will embrace the new treaty, provided they are given full, cast-iron assurances that certain elements of our sovereignty will be untouched.  The low rate of corporation tax of 12.5% was a key factor in our recent economic success and the ability to set our own tax rates in the future is sacrosanct and must remain so.  One of the declared aims of the EU is to facilitate and encourage competition in all sectors and the forced harmonisation of tax rates and interference with Ireland&rsquo;s competitive rates would be surely anti-competitive.  The Minister will play an important role, as he did in the second Nice treaty referendum, where he secured a majority vote.  It is vital that this be part of his campaign and that our ability to set competitive tax rates be copper-fastened.  People will consider this issue more than most when they vote in the referendum.</P>
        <P>Our tradition of neutrality is also crucial.  While I suspect the Irish Defence Forces would relish the opportunity to work with their European counterparts, as the Irish Army will soon be doing in Chad, it is vital that any such joint EU operations, which receive broad support, do not bypass the triple-lock mechanism by which the Irish Defence Forces require the approval of the UN, the Irish Government and the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern will sign this treaty tomorrow in Lisbon.  I understand the Minister of State will accompany The Taoiseach to that historic event.  Although a date for the referendum has not yet been set it is never too early to encourage public debate on the treaty.  Because we will hold a referendum on the treaty, 4 million people in Ireland will decide the future of an institution with an overall population of 490 million people.  That is a significant opportunity and responsibility.  Every vote will count.  All of us in this democracy are equally entitled to express our concerns and vote for what we feel is in the best interests of this State, ourselves, our families, our communities and Europe.</P>
        <P>There must be a fully informed debate on all the proposals of the treaty.  While I commend the work of the Government, particularly the senior statesman of Europe, The Taoiseach Deputy Bertie Ahern, in negotiating the treaty, and I intend to fully and strongly support the ratification of the treaty by the people of Ireland, I accept there may be legitimate reasons for opposing the reforms and this must be fully discussed.  We are on the threshold of a major step forward for Europe and Ireland has a crucial role as a country to which new member states and aspiring member states look for economic inspiration and <Col N="99"/>as the only country in which the citizens will have direct role in shaping the future of Europe.  We have no shortage of experience in European referenda.  A disappointing turnout in the first of the Nice treaty referenda was the likely reason for the treaty being rejected by a small margin, with 54% voting no.  This decision was convincingly overturned by the people in the second referendum with a more representative turnout and a 63% yes vote.  I therefore urge all voters to inform themselves of the proposals of this treaty, to consider the implications and to vote on the treaty when the referendum is held.  It represents a step forward for Europe and for Ireland.  Whether we vote yes or no, there will be no second opportunity and people must not be complacent.  The treaty has been fully negotiated and 27 member states have agreed to it.  Some 26 Parliaments will vote for it because they have already negotiated a treaty.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to go back to the drawing board, review the decision and say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I urge everyone to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the day of the referendum as it is in the best interests of the country.  Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s experience, especially as regards his efforts during the second Nice Treaty and the manner in which he worked that campaign, his input is vital to the success of the referendum, in explaining the role of this treaty on the lives and future of the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish to concur with the words Senator Leyden has just used, about Deputy Roche&rsquo;s enthusiasm, which is great to hear.  I experienced such enthusiasm first in 1958 when the Minister of State was perhaps only a baby.  Going to Brussels and later France and spending winter in that part of the world was like going to Australia or New Zealand nowadays.  It was an adventure.  For the first time I experienced being a European.  I had grown up in a family that was strongly nationalistic and republican and which had been involved in the War of Independence.  Therefore, to sacrifice the independence of Ireland to become a European was not easy.  What convinced me at the time was the European Economic Community.</P>
        <P>I have heard sounds of concern in recent days as regards the reform treaty, however, to the effect that we are moving away from being a European Economic Community and more towards a European federal united states model.  These are the concerns we must face.  There is a certain concern among Irish people who are very strongly European but who are apprehensive as regards the empire building that is occurring.  I shall take one instance.  One of the issues that cropped up was the difference between economic and all the other factors with which we are involved within Europe, one of which is the European Social Fund.  I have a lovely booklet here, which perhaps we all got yesterday.  It is about <Col N="100"/>the Potsdam Conference on the European Social Fund, the 50th anniversary of which took place this year.  There are 16 photographs of the Commissioner in it.  It is a very expensive book but it did not cost me anything.  We are in danger of being complacent and of assuming that because people are pro-Europe, they will also agree to this treaty simply because the Minister of State has explained it.</P>
        <P>In starting to consider the reform treaty we should return to first principles, and that is what I have done.  To see those first principles we need to look at the 2001 Laeken Declaration that started off the whole process as regards drafting the constitutional treaty.  I recall thinking at the time that the Laeken Declaration was like a breath of fresh air.  I have always been a fan of Europe, but over the years I have become depressed by the extent to which the European institutions failed to engage successfully with the various peoples of the member states.  As the years went on, the process seemed to get worse rather than better, and that is my concern at the moment.  I was therefore delighted when the Laeken Declaration grasped this nettle by the roots.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Within the Union, the European institutions must be brought closer to its citizens.  Citizens undoubtedly support the Union&rsquo;s broad aims, but they do not always see a connection between those goals and the Union&rsquo;s everyday action.  They want the European institutions to be less unwieldy and rigid and, above all, more efficient and open.  Many also feel that the Union should involve itself more with their particular concerns, instead of intervening, in every detail, in matters by their nature better left to Member States&rsquo; and regions&rsquo; elected representatives.  This is even perceived by some as a threat to their identify.  More importantly, however, they feel that deals are all too often cut out of their sight and they want better democratic scrutiny.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One of the things that excited those of us who wanted to see an Ireland that was still strong and independent was this subsidiarity.  I have a concern, and it is being expressed publicly more and more, namely, that decisions are being made more frequently at the top, by Brussels, rather than closer to where the citizens are.</P>
        <P>The Laeken Declaration also spelt out an exciting role for the European Union in the new globalised world that was beginning to emerge.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The role it has to play is that of a power resolutely doing battle against all violence, all terror and all fanaticism, but which also does not turn a blind eye to the world&rsquo;s heart-rending injustices.  In short, a power wanting to change the course of world affairs in such a way as to benefit not just the rich countries but also the poorest.  A power seeking to set globalisation <Col N="101"/>within a moral framework, in other words to anchor it in solidarity and sustainable development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is heady stuff and it is, perhaps, somewhat strange to look back today and recognise it as the start of a long and tortuous process that has led us to where we are as regards the reform treaty.  Can the Minister of State say whether it is to be known as the Lisbon Treaty or the Reform Treaty?  I understood it was the Reform Treaty until last week, and perhaps he can confirm what it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is called the reform treaty.  It could, however, have been called the Dublin treaty, rather than being called after any other city in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  On the basis of returning to first principles, I pose the question, does the result we now have to consider in the form of the Lisbon Reform Treaty live up to the aspirations set out so clearly in the Laeken Declaration?  Along that road, have the lawyers and the bureaucrats taken over the process so that instead of a new beginning we are being presented with more of the same?  I do not wish to prejudge the issue but I want to urge the House to consider the question. </P>
        <P Just="Left">We can, and indeed should scrutinise the reform treaty from the viewpoint of Irish interests.  The Minister of State had done that today, in taking us through his five points.  We should ask ourselves carefully whether the benefits to Ireland exceed the undoubted costs of going along with the treaty.  We owe the people of Ireland a duty to carry out that scrutiny, and to do it diligently.  Surely we have another responsibility as well, one we embrace not just as Irish people, but as Europeans.  We are in the process of building a supranational structure under which our children and grandchildren will have to live.  In this reform treaty we are taking a decisive leap towards shaping the Europe of the future.  It is incumbent on us to ask ourselves solemnly whether this is really the way we want to go and if the treaty lives up to the Laeken Declaration or does it undermine those fine principles and aspirations on which the reform project was launched?</P>
        <P>If we have any doubts, now is the time to voice them, as the Minister of State said, while we still have an opportunity to affect the course the future Europe will take.  If we stay silent over the next few months, we are agreeing in effect to one particular way forward for Europe and turning our back on any other.  I believe the forthcoming referendum will pose some of the most important and fundamental questions ever put to the Irish people.  In preparing for that referendum we must treat this issue with all the seriousness it deserves.  The Irish people will not be bullied and there were some sounds of that from the Taoiseach last week.  Neither will they be blackmailed into giv<Col N="102"/>ing one particular answer or the other.  They demand a reasoned response and my hope is that they will get.  I urge the Minister of State to recognise that the many Irish people who are enthusiastic Europeans are concerned about the drift towards a federal states model, away from subsidiarity and towards losing some of the fervour they had for a united Europe, because we are getting involved in so many areas that are not just about the European Economic Community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I am proud that Deputy Roche will lead the campaign for this referendum.   He is very knowledgeable and has had the experience of being involved in the intergovernmental convention.  His worldview in this area is extensive and he has a great feel for the subject.  I have no doubt that with the Minister of State leading the referendum, the outcome will be successful. </P>
        <P Just="Left">As many of the speakers have indicated, however, there are problems.  I was interested to hear Senator Quinn speculating as to whether it should be called the reform treaty or the Lisbon Treaty.  I had the same problem, and I am glad that it will now be known as the Reform Treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union needs this reform treaty so it can meet internal and external upcoming challenges.  The EU must function efficiently and effectively to promote peace and prosperity.  We must also ensure the EU can act in a manner commensurate with its economic weight and contribute to global issues such as the fight against poverty, climate change and underdevelopment.  The reform treaty will provide the EU with the means to meet these challenges.  It will bring to an end the debate on institutional reform which has dogged the EU for so long and allow it to focus on being efficiently and effectively at the service of its citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is pleased with the mandate for the reform treaty which was agreed in June and has been signed in Lisbon.  Our aim is to protect the substance of the 2004 constitution and we have succeeded in doing so.  Only relatively modest changes have taken place.  The structure has changed and we no longer have a single text but an extensive series of amendments to the existing EU treaties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A new reform treaty provision will deal with the need to combat climate change.  I am glad this was introduced at Ireland&rsquo;s behest.  This is the first time this issue will be covered in an EU treaty.  We are entering the final stages of the intergovernmental conference and member states have respected the mandate agreed by the European Council in June.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased the institutional package with regard to voting rights was agreed.  The new system of double majority voting will give proportionate weight to population while protecting the interests of small and medium sized member states.  We have also succeeded in ensuring that all member states will have equal access <Col N="103"/>to membership of the EU Commission.  The enhanced role for the European Parliament will further strengthen the democratic character of EU legislation.</P>
        <P>I would like further clarification on these points because while I might understand it I wonder whether the public will understand the significance of this change and how it will impact on smaller member states.  This is an important issue but people do not debate it.  People will be happy to debate other issues with which they are at ease but I do not believe people will understand this issue.  How will we be able to remove the jargon and bring it down to what it will mean for smaller states?  I understand it and it is a good move.  However, during the referendum campaign we must explain this to the public in ordinary everyday language.</P>
        <P>We are satisfied the legal standing of the charter of fundamental rights has been confirmed and a treaty article will assert its legal status.  Ireland strongly supports the charter as an important statement of our values as a Union and of the rights of our citizens in their dealings with the EU.  We examined the UK protocol on the charter but we should not adhere to it as we have a strong commitment to the charter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reform treaty provides for a strengthened &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; for national Parliaments with regard to draft legislation.  It extends the period during which national Parliaments can respond to a Commission proposal and puts a greater onus on the Commission to take on board the views of national Parliaments.  This will strengthen the role of national Parliaments in the EU without distorting the agreed institutional balance.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to what Senator Quinn stated on the role of subsidiarity and proportionality.  These are horrible words.  I remember I found the jargon too much for me when discussing these matters at meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and this is another aspect of the matter.</P>
        <P>The subsidiarity clause is excellent because it gives national Parliaments the space to decide what they want for their countries and how they will make their decisions.  Only when it must be moved on to the European Parliament will it do so.  Proportionality means the European Commission should not interfere with how we regulate our affairs.  This must be driven home.  A fear exists that Europe has taken over and that we are becoming subservient to the European Union.  This worries me and it is a key issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also referred to this matter which we discussed at length in a recent session of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs when the intergovernmental convention was on the agenda.  The Minister of State was well aware of this and these clauses were inserted so Ireland will hold on to control of its own affairs.  It is extremely important to include pro<Col N="104"/>portionality and subsidiarity as I would hate to think we are building a federation.</P>
        <P>The referendum is the next stage and we must decide on it when the date has been set.  We have long experience of ratifying European treaties by referendum and our track record is good.  However, the first referendum on the Nice Treaty taught us a salutary lesson, namely, that we have no room for complacency.  This treaty is highly complex and will take a great deal of explaining to the electorate.  The public appreciates Europe&rsquo;s importance to Ireland and the role Ireland plays within the EU.  This is reflected in the results of Eurobarometer surveys in which the Irish public is consistently among the most positive in Europe with regard to the advantages of EU membership.</P>
        <P>We must play a role in this and get out and link in with the public.  We have a fine record within the EU and we must deliver this treaty to the public and have another successful referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to kick off this debate on the Reform Treaty or Lisbon treaty.  I saw Manuel Barroso interviewed on television last night and he called it the &ldquo;Lisbon&rdquo; treaty, perhaps for national reasons.  We shall see what it ends up being called.</P>
        <P>There is no question that our experience of EU membership has been of major benefit to the country.  Perhaps this goes with out saying but it ought not to as it is an important bedrock for this debate.  The EU has contributed enormously to the modernisation and industrialisation of our country, which was one of endemic emigration and unemployment and which has become one of high employment attracting large-scale migration from the new member states of eastern Europe.</P>
        <P>The new treaty contains a strong social dimension which is the area I wish to emphasise.  This social dimension contains a legally binding commitment to an extremely wide range of citizens&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; rights.  In no small part, the treaty reflects the ethos of the Labour Party and the socialist movement throughout Europe.  For this reason, the Labour Party will enthusiastically support the treaty and will campaign for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>Other Senators referred to major questions such as climate change and world poverty.  These are great preoccupations of all political parties, including mine and they are also reflected in initiatives in the treaty.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest and agreement to what Senator Ormonde stated with regard to institutional reform.  It is undoubtedly true that institutional reform is necessary if for no other reason than so many new states are joining and to ensure the existing institutions work effectively they must be reformed.  In the attempt to persuade people on issues of institutional reform we will run up against the obstacle that people do not get much of an opportunity during their daily lives to wrestle with questions of institutions, represen<Col N="105"/>tation and democratic deficit.  They may feel the effects of democratic deficit but not everybody has the luxury of time or opportunity to debate what this means.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to stray into a partisan political debate, much as I am tempted to do so.However, question marks hang over the effectiveness and relative value of many of our institutions.  If we have these doubts about domestic institutions, how much more difficult will it be for us to engage in a debate about institutions that are even more remote or to ask citizens to support and be enthusiastic about reforms of the European Parliament or other EU bodies?  I do not make this point to diminish the importance of debating or discussing the issue but to emphasise the difficulty we face.</P>
        <P>This brings me to an issue the Minister of State and other speakers touched on, namely, the type of debate we will have in the coming months.  It is important to pause and consider what should be the content and tone of the debate.  The Minister of State correctly noted that people will not be bullied or respond positively to being hectored.  The treaty will not be passed by telling people they have no choice but to vote for it or that they should vote based on the benefits we have enjoyed as a result of membership of the European Union.  Unfortunately, Commissioner McCreevy last week used words to the effect that people who do not vote in favour of the treaty will need their heads examined.  While the Commissioner and others may believe this to be the case, the quality of debate suffers when one tells people they have no choice but to vote in a certain way.  Moreover, our sophisticated electorate will respond negatively to this type of argument, as was the case in a previous referendum.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and his colleagues who are promoting the treaty should be aware that hectoring can sometimes be unintentional.  One should not dismiss an argument by announcing that one has demolished it in a short few sentences.  This is not meant as a personal criticism of the Minister of State.  Rather than believing we have given all the correct answers, have made devastating points on the importance of Europe and no one else could possibly hold a candle to us in terms of the strength of our arguments, perhaps a little more humility is needed.  Perhaps listening to and addressing genuine concerns in an intelligent manner would contribute much more to enabling others to recognise that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is appropriate than would telling people which way to vote.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated last week that the same people will make the same old arguments in the treaty debate.  Even if this proves to be the case, it is important that these arguments are addressed.  If someone has made the same arguments during every treaty debate for the past 20 or 30 years, it does not mean it is any less legitimate or important to address them in a fair-minded manner.  While the Taoiseach and others <Col N="106"/>may be frustrated, they should respond to rather than dismiss argument.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the impact of differences in the arguments being made in support of the treaty in different countries.  French and British proponents of the treaty, for example, use different arguments in its favour, as I noted while attending the British Labour Party conference this autumn as a representative of the Labour Party.  On the one hand, treaty supporters in France have argued that the agreement is essentially the same as the proposed European constitution, while on the other, the British Government argues that the treaty and proposed constitution are much different propositions and the latter has been dropped in favour of a pared-down treaty.  Differences in the arguments employed in favour of the treaty in different countries will be reflected in the debate in this country because people are not stupid and see beyond their noses.  They will not be taken for fools.</P>
        <P>It is fine for different political organisations to have different reasons for supporting the treaty.  My approach from the left may differ from the approach of other political parties.  Let us acknowledge that despite our political differences, we can, for different reasons, advocate the same outcome.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made five key arguments in favour of supporting the treaty.  The third of these was protection of human rights and inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  As I indicated, we all have different approaches to the treaty.  I believe the protection of human rights is the foremost argument in favour of the treaty because, as the Minister of State correctly noted, the charter and the solemn guarantees it sets out are vital.  The precise means by which these guarantees can be enforced in Irish law is the subject of some controversy and has not yet been resolved.  Nevertheless, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a great and historic international statement of important principles.</P>
        <P>In terms of the achievements of the European Union in social and employment protection legislation, an area in which I have a strong interest, the gains have been immense.  The aspirations of the charter elevates this area to a higher plain and sets a major objective for the Community as a whole.  The treaty is worth supporting for no other reason that the centrality given to the charter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House.  I am grateful for an opportunity to comment on the reform or Lisbon treaty &mdash; I have not yet decided which title I will use.  The signing of the treaty tomorrow will put an end to approximately two years of what was described as a period of reflection but which was, in truth, a period of great uncertainty or, as some described it, crisis in the European Union arising from the rejection by the <Col N="107"/>French and Dutch electorates of the proposed constitutional treaty.</P>
        <P>Ireland will be in a unique position of holding a popular referendum on the treaty which will be preceded by a national debate.  Considerable European and international interest will be generated in the content and conduct of this debate.  Senators referred to the importance of the tone with which it is conducted.  It is incumbent on us to show to those who observe the debate that we can discuss the treaty and Europe in an honest, balanced and respectful manner.  Having been involved in many European treaty and referendum campaigns, unfortunately they are characterised often by a negative, polarised, adversarial tone which is off-putting to the public at large.  At a time when people seek information about the European project, from which many feel remote and the workings of whose institutions many do not understand, the last thing they want to hear is politicians attacking each other and conducting a debate in an emotional and adversarial manner rather than presenting facts and arguments persuasively and coherently.  I hope for this reason the debate will be characterised by balance and honesty.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Unfortunately, two camps have emerged in many of the debates on previous European treaties.  The first consists of those who are so enthusiastic about the treaty in question and so committed to having it ratified that they are unwilling to be critical even slightly of any aspect of it or to admit that any part of it may be less than wholly satisfactory.  The second camp consists of treaty opponents who refuse to see anything good in it, produce negative propaganda and are often accused of scaremongering. I hope we will be able to conduct the debate in a balanced and honest way, recognising the strengths and weaknesses of the treaty and whether overall it is in Ireland&rsquo;s interest to support it.  The Green Party is holding its internal debate at a special convention on 19 January where members will be allowed to debate the pros and cons of the treaty and vote on what position they wish the party to take in the referendum campaign.</P>
        <P>There are two main elements to the treaty.  Many of its provisions concern reform of the internal workings and the decision-making processes of the EU while others are concerned with strengthening the external identity and the capacity for external action of the EU.  It is often difficult to get people exercised or interested in the internal reform process and reform of the institutions, but people would be aware that with the process of enlargement and many new countries joining, decision making becomes more complex and challenging.</P>
        <P>In this reform treaty we have seen the shift from unanimity to qualified majority voting in quite a number of policy areas.  That points to the fact that member states are more confident they <Col N="108"/>can work with others and do not need to hold on to the veto or the unanimity requirement.  The latter stance is often a reflection of the fact that member states have to protect their national interests and can only see themselves doing so by means of a veto.  The shift to qualified majority voting suggests much greater confidence in the decision-making processes.</P>
        <P>There is also a new system of qualified majority voting or, as it is referred to, a double majority system which means there will have to be a majority of states, 55%, representing 65% of the population to achieve this qualified majority status.  It means that the new voting system under this treaty will be based more on population.  It is a system that will favour larger countries over smaller countries.  That smaller countries are prepared to sign up to it is an indication of the increasing confidence of smaller countries that they can operate and achieve the outcomes they seek within a system that is more population-based.</P>
        <P>We see also in the treaty an extension of co-decision which is very important.  Many have spoken about the weak role of the European Parliament with regard to the other two European institutions.  It is good to see the powers of the European Parliament being strengthened and having a more equal role with the Council of Ministers in the overall law-making process.  There will be a streamlining of the Commission in the future.  It will mean that all member states will not have a commissioner for a period of five years out of every 15.  That will be done on the basis of equality of rotation and Ireland will be no different from any larger or smaller member state.  There is a cap on the number of parliamentarians in the European Parliament where a maximum and a minimum number has been set.  That will be interesting, depending on the extent to which the EU enlarges in the future.</P>
        <P>There is a welcome new role for national parliaments.  One of the positive elements of the treaty is that it recognises the right of national parliaments to intervene and object to legislation or at least to make their concerns known about it if they consider it will breach the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
        <P>The hope of many is that the EU will evolve into a multi-level system of governance where there is not a centralised power in Brussels and directives coming from there that render national, regional, and local government relatively redundant or ineffective and rather that there is an active role for each level of government in the overall governance and decision making in the EU.</P>
        <P>The strengthening of the external identity of the EU obviously is very important.  We all recognise the real need for global leadership and the EU is providing that leadership in the area of climate change, energy security, human rights, development aid and so on.  There is the role of President of the European Council which will be <Col N="109"/>renewable for a term of five years.  We have a high representative for foreign policy and security.  Also contained within the treaty is a provision for the Vice President of the Commission.  There is a European external action service and also a legal personality conferred on the EU which will allow it to sign up to international treaties.</P>
        <P>While there are many positive elements in the treaty, there are also issues that would be of extreme concern to the Green Party, which I will mention briefly.  The strengthening of the military dimension of the EU is a matter of concern.  The EU to date has used its soft power around the globe in a very effective way, using forms of economic and political co-operation as opposed to the traditional resort to hard military power.  The Green Party certainly would not wish to see that change.  The shift in terms of strengthening the military capacity of the EU raises specific concerns.</P>
        <P>Another issue is the EURATOM Treaty which gives preferential treatment to and promotes nuclear energy within the EU.  We are concerned that is attached by means a protocol to the treaty and has not been revised in any way.  I hope the Minister of State will have something to say about that and the plans for the future of the EURATOM Treaty.</P>
        <P>I hope the debate in this House, in which the Minister of State, Deputy Roche will play a central role, will be characterised by honesty, balance and respect for other points of view.  If that happens we will end up educating the Irish public and gaining a positive outcome by the time the vote on the treaty takes place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The electorate of the Twenty-six Counties will vote next year on the Lisbon or reform treaty.  We may be the only EU citizens to do so.  This places an enormous responsibility on our shoulders to ensure before we vote that we fully understand the content and implications of the treaty.</P>
        <P>I have listened carefully to comments from Charlie McCreevy when he said that Ireland would be &ldquo;the laughing stock of Europe&rdquo; if we rejected the treaty.  This is complete nonsense.  The people of France and the Netherlands had no such inferiority complex and were able to conduct a mature debate.  The people of Ireland should be able to do the same.</P>
        <P>The need for Ireland to have its place at the EU table is obvious.  However, we must use that place positively.  Our international reputation is not so brittle that we must always act as yes men to preserve it, even when the best course of action is to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to address two key issues of concern: democracy and neutrality.  The Lisbon treaty contains the most substantial transfer of powers from member states to the European Council and Commission to date and it does not propose to return a single power to parliaments in member states.  This involves 105 new competencies to be <Col N="110"/>given to the EU in the Lisbon treaty and a further 68 areas which will move from consensus decision making at the European Council to majority voting.  Among the areas where the EU will have control are immigration, Structural Funds, judicial and police co-operation, economic policy guidelines for eurozone members and initiatives of the new Foreign Minister.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is deeply concerned at the scale and range of this proposed transfer of powers.  To make some comparison, there was a loss of veto in 46 areas in the Treaty of Nice, 24 areas in the Treaty of Amsterdam, 30 areas in the Treaty of Maastricht and the 12 areas in the Single European Act.  Even the Treaty of Rome, the EU&rsquo;s foundation treaty, contained only 38 areas.</P>
        <P>Possibly more significant and troubling than the large-scale transfer of powers is the inclusion of eight passerelle clauses in the Lisbon treaty.  Passerelle is French for &ldquo;footbridge&rdquo; or &ldquo;escalator&rdquo;.  These passerelle or escalator clauses would give the Commission significant scope to acquire more powers in the future while bypassing the need for consent in member states.  Next year could be our last opportunity to have a direct vote on the direction of the EU.</P>
        <P>While parliaments in member states are to be given some new powers, they are very limited and are insignificant in comparison with the powers transferred to the EU.  The role of the only elected EU forum &mdash; the Parliament &mdash; continues to be limited.  The Parliament will not have the power to initiate legislation or to amend it.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty will have huge consequences for this country.  Let us look at what is happening already.  For example, when Sinn F&eacute;in and the whole of the farming industry demanded that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, ban Brazilian beef as it does not comply with EU standards, she said the banning of Brazilian beef is a matter for the European Commission.  There was a similar response from the Taoiseach when it come to protecting jobs in Irish Ferries.  This should alert us to the dangers and consequences when we hand over decision-making powers to the EU.</P>
        <P>With regard to neutrality, the militarisation of foreign and defence policies in the past decade is there for all to see at EU level through the development of the Rapid Reaction Force, EU battle groups and common security policies, and in Ireland through the use of Shannon airport by US troops on their way to wage war in Iraq.  I find it very telling that the Government did not even try to secure a specific article in the Lisbon Treaty explicitly recognising the rights and duties of neutral states within the Union.  Its lip service to neutrality over the years has undermined our reputation abroad in regard to an independent foreign policy and peacekeeping.  The EU&rsquo;s military ambitions are set out clearly in the Lisbon Treaty and include a common foreign and security policy and improved military capabilities. <Col N="111"/> This is something to which the majority of people in this country are opposed.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon Treaty is not in Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  It involves a massive transfer of power to the EU.  It significantly accelerates the militarisation of the EU and advances an economic agenda based on a race to the bottom for wages and workers&rsquo; rights.  I call on everyone in this Chamber who shares these concerns to oppose this treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions.  It was asked whether we need a referendum.  The legal advice is that we do need it, and there is an expectation in this regard.</P>
        <P>To put it mildly, I was disappointed by Senator Regan&rsquo;s decision to accuse the Taoiseach of perjury within the four walls of this House.  As I have said on many occasions, including when I was responsible for the tribunal, it should be allowed in peace and calm to continue its work to a conclusion.  For a Member of the House to attempt to influence the work of the tribunal in a politically partisan and prejudicial way is unworthy.  I am disappointed to say this to Senator Regan, for whom I have great personal respect and regard.  As Senator Leyden said, one could hurl accusations at those who gave different contributions to the tribunal.  My long-held view is that it is better to let the tribunals do their work without assistance from anyone in the Houses.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn, in a thought-provoking contribution, outlined his concerns about creeping federalism.  It is a fact that a contribution I made at the Convention on the Future of Europe meant any reference to the F-word was withdrawn from the convention, which only happened because people did not want the word &ldquo;federal&rdquo; to appear.  This was not to disguise the reality that it is a fundamental mistake to try to characterise the European Union in the old political way as a federal unitary state because such a characterisation does not apply.  The EU is unique in that it is a space in which member states have decided voluntarily to pool certain amounts of sovereignty in order to achieve something greater.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point that this is an issue that will creep into the debate.  We must simply point out the truth.  Nobody forced us in and nobody forces us to stay in.  We choose to be in the EU because we believe this is a better way to deal with the issues.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate Senator Quinn is no longer present.  I intended to point out to him that while I picked out five areas of the treaty, I could have added a sixth, namely, the reference to conferral and subsidiarity.  Subsidiarity, on which Senator de B&uacute;rca touched, has always been a reality in the Union but it gets specific legal recognition in this treaty.  What is even more important is the reference to conferral.  The conferral clause makes it clear there are no powers other than <Col N="112"/>those powers conferred willingly by member states.  This deals specifically with Senator Doherty&rsquo;s final points on the transfer of powers to Brussels.  When powers are transferred to Brussels, those powers are not transferred to anything other than to a group of Ministers in Council to make decisions.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn correctly made the point that one of the most important issues in the Laaken Declaration was that of communication between Europe and the citizens of the Union.  This issue was very much to the fore during our Presidency, when we launched the Communicating Europe campaign.  It is still a reality within the Union but I accept it is an area that needs much greater strength and focus than it has to date received.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden referred to concerns on CCCTB, the consolidated tax base issue.  There is no change whatsoever on the issue of tax in this treaty.  Tax will still be a matter for unanimity so a veto will exist.  There have been discussions on CCCTB but nobody foresees these proposals moving forward.  The view increasingly held is that the only enthusiasm that remains is in Commissioner Kov&aacute;cs&rsquo;s quarters.  There is increasing awareness among member states that this is not the way forward and Commission President Barroso has made useful points in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White and other Senators referred to the nature of the debate.  I agree the debate should be respectful, although it should not be neutered.  While some have been saying since 1972 that if we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in this or that treaty, we will find ourselves in NATO or lose or neutrality, this is patently untrue.  It is important, therefore, that we would cut through such untruths and highlight them.  During the last referendum campaign on the Nice Treaty, disgraceful posters were put up in this city and in towns throughout the country stating that if people voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the treaty, they would find themselves in NATO.  It was untrue then and has always been untrue.  Our position, as a nation that takes a particular view, will not be changed.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made an interesting point on differentiated arguments, which, I agree, will confuse the debate.  It needs to be explained that different member states are moving at a different pace.  For example, when the British Government states that this treaty is fundamentally different to the constitutional treaty, that is not untrue because, of course, Britain is opting out of justice and home affairs, which is a huge area, and is taking its own view on the charter, which surprises me.</P>
        <P>I believe the charter is the most uplifting part of this treaty.  It is the aspect on which we should tell the Irish people to concentrate.  Is there any democrat on this island who would disagree with its principles?  They are uplifting, as is the language of the charter.  I would have preferred if the charter was central within the treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It will outline its view in due course &mdash; I will have a view on that also.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca and other Senators referred to the treaty&rsquo;s title and whether it was to be the Lisbon Treaty or the Reform Treaty.  I remind the House that a rose by any other name smells just as sweet.  The reality is we should judge this treaty by its content, which is good, positive, progressive and allows Europe to do good things, not just internally but externally.</P>
        <P>I will not go down the same path as Senator Doherty, who has left the House, but it does a disservice to us all to characterise, for example, Europe&rsquo;s involvement in Chad, Aceh or the Balkans, where we witnessed the recent horrors, as militarisation.  They are civilised, positive, humanitarian interventions in support of democracy in fledgling democracies.  I do not understand how any political party can object to this, although I accept the Senator takes a different view on democracy and militarisation than myself.  I have always had a horror of the gun and believe it has no place in politics.  I welcome that Senator Doherty is engaged in the debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Ormonde, de B&uacute;rca, Alex White and Doherty, among others, noted that the Irish people will be in a unique position &mdash; I believe it is a wonderful position to be in.  All of us will have the opportunity as citizens to inform ourselves to the best extent possible and to then make an informed judgment on this treaty.</P>
        <P>I disagree with the suggestion that a huge spread of competencies is supposed to be growing.  That is a British red-top description of the treaty, which is a rather self-serving and negative approach.  If the European Union decides to promote tourism, how in the name of God is that a bad thing?  For the life of me, I cannot see how it is a bad thing.  If we are going to support European culture, for example, is that a bad thing?  It is not.  If the European Union decides to take much more concerted action on climate change, is that a bad thing?  How could anybody disagree with that?  The reality is that we cannot solve climate change alone because Europe accounts for about 16% of global emissions, but the EU can be a positive concerted force in this regard.  Sharing competencies therefore aims to increase our capacity to act, for example, on issues including the environment, global terrorism and human trafficking.  How can any Member of the House suggest that deciding to take concerted action on such matters is a bad thing?</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their contributions.  I look forward to the debate and agree with Members that it must be respectful, focused and, above all else, truthful.  Otherwise, it would be a disservice to the Irish people and to democracy.  In the past, the Irish people have shown &mdash; and they certainly showed it in the second Nice Treaty referendum &mdash; that when we carried on the discussion in a <Col N="114"/>way that respected different views and concerns, and were truthful and focused on the facts, they could make their judgment.  My judgment is that if we put all our efforts into it and leave aside political partisanship, we will be doing a considerable service not just for Europe but also for this nation.  I thank Senators for this opportunity to address the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be as frank as possible with the Senator.  First, a decision has not been made on the date.  If it had been, I am not sure that I would be saying so at this point.  Second, a judgment will have to be made as to whether we will have one referendum or two referenda on the same day.  I would like to focus on an issue, such as this referendum, which I think is important but the Government has promised a referendum on children.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday in the D&aacute;il, the Government is anxious to fulfil that undertaking.  The date will be in summertime and I hope it will be in the early part of the summer because we do not want to clash with the leaving certificate examinations or the holidays.  None of us wants to be out knocking on doors in the dark days of autumn or winter.  The treaty must be ratified by Ireland in 2008.  My instinct and wish is that it would be sooner rather than later, and that it will be in the early part of the summer.  I cannot be more forthcoming than that, however.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a possibility of European Commission President Barroso confirming the situation regarding tax?  It is purely to eliminate the possibility of a red herring being consistently raised by the Opposition, so that once and for all we can get a definitive answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>First, nothing in this treaty changes the current position about unanimity on tax.  I welcome the opportunity to clarify that point again.  Second, I have been discussing the question of CCCTB actively with other member states, but I see little enthusiasm for it.  President Barroso made a forthright statement recently when he was dealing mainly with tax rates.  He pointed out the huge advantage of competition in tax rates.  There is no advantage to the idea that one can have some sort of more bureaucratic arrangement.</P>
        <P>There is an increasing awareness within the European Union that the Italian propositions, <Col N="115"/>which are being worked on, present serious difficulties.  I have discussed this matter with a significant number of my EU counterparts.  If there was ever any enthusiasm for it, it is now on the wane.  There is significant opposition, so I believe it is dead in the water.  The Senator is right in saying that it would be helpful to have confirmation of the situation.  It would be helpful if the European Commission, which reports back to the commissioners and the Berlaymont, decided that this dead duck is left where it is.  The most significant and important point, however, is that there nothing in this treaty that changes the unanimity rule on tax.</P>

    <Title>Small and Medium Enterprises: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to discuss the issues in regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, an area in which I am especially interested.  When I look at the membership of the Seanad, however, I wonder why I was invited, particularly when one focuses on competitiveness in the economy.  There is an array of talent here which I am sure could make a great contribution to such a debate.  One could take as an example Senator Shane Ross, from whose column in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> I have learned all I know about Irish business.  Indeed, I have learned even more about competing because Senator Shane Ross has competed against the best, pulling the tails of commercial lions to the point that I wonder how he can dare enter a bank, sell a share, buy a house or use an airline.  I admire his approach, however, and it is welcome that he takes on all the vested interests.</P>
        <P>When one looks at competitiveness, I think of Senator Donie Cassidy and Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  Perhaps they could come to the House to share their thoughts, or at least those thoughts which would not invite immediate removal from the Chamber.  They are both experts on competition, branding and market share, masters in the art of dissemination and obfuscation and specialists in defining borders and crossing them.  They know that competition is about a smile, a warm embrace and the sharp pulling of the rug from under the feet of one&rsquo;s competitors.  In the presence of the truly great, who am I to speak?  Speaking about competitiveness in Leinster House is like giving Tarzan lessons in crocodile wrestling &mdash; exciting but ultimately fatal.</P>
        <P>Given all that, I am happy to be here and I acknowledge the presence of my constituency colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan, the Fine Gael spokesperson on enterprise.  I am especially interested in the SME sector and the microbus<Col N="116"/>inesses carried on under that heading because I come from that sector.  I spent many years in business and know the ups and downs of it.  I know how it affects people and families.  I understand, therefore, the need for cost effective, light regulation and legislation in that regard to allow that micro element of the SME sector to develop and prosper.</P>
        <P>We are reaching a point in our economy when the SME sector is about to come centre stage more than ever before.  We have seen outside investment and money brought into this economy by companies which have set up here and provided long-term jobs.  Such companies continue to be welcome here.  We have seen the work of Enterprise Ireland and of all these small to medium-sized businesses at county level.  They will be centre stage from here on in.  The future of the economy will centre around their activity.  The creation of new jobs, research and development and innovation will stem from their activity within the economy.  We must focus very much on these businesses.</P>
        <P>More than 250,000 small businesses operate in our economy and they employ almost 800,000 people.  We will only be able to foster the emergence of such enterprise if the operating environment for business, particularly small business, is supportive.  This has been a key focus of Government policy.  We have put in place policies and programmes which encourage the emergence of new business creations and facilitate long-term business survival.  Examples of the actions we have taken include the positioning of our tax system as one of the most supportive of business in the world; the development of Ireland as a knowledge-based economy through the dedication of significant Exchequer resources to the promotion of research and development and especially innovation in the very important services sector; the introduction of the Better Regulation programme to tackle regulatory burdens, especially those faced by the business community; and the adoption of new strategies to support the enterprise sector, including small business, based on the reports of the Enterprise Strategy Group and the Small Business Forum.</P>
        <P>The amalgamation of the existing Acts into a consolidation Bill will need to focus on, and understand, the SME sector.  In the drafting of that Bill, there will need to be an awareness that one size does not fit all.  We must be conscious that there are microbusinesses, small to medium-sized enterprises and large companies.  The legislation, which is due in 2008, must focus very much on that area and understand the needs of business, particularly in regard to regulation.</P>
        <P>The role of the county enterprise boards is very important.  The 35 county and city enterprise boards were established in 1993 and are located throughout the country.  The role of the CEBs is to provide support for microenterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous microenterprise potential and <Col N="117"/>to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs can support individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.</P>
        <P>The CEBs deliver a series of programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include capital grants, employment grants and feasibility study grants.</P>
        <P>The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes and e-business training initiatives.  The county enterprise boards have been successful in developing a structure capable of both generating and tapping into enterprise at local level.  County enterprise boards have been particularly effective in their ability to respond at local level to the needs of micro-enterprise.  Through their involvement in a wide range of national programmes, county enterprise boards have assisted in transforming Ireland&rsquo;s economic landscape by providing a unique enterprise focus at local level through developing and stimulating indigenous enterprise potential.  In 2006, county enterprise boards issued grant approvals totalling &euro;14.4 million to the micro-enterprise sector and issued grant payments totalling over &euro;10.6 million.  A total of 894 projects were approved for financial assistance from the county enterprise boards while a total of 892 projects received grant aid.  Over 2,000 net jobs were created in county enterprise board-assisted enterprises.  Over 19,800 people participated on the various management training and development courses offered by the county enterprise boards.</P>
        <P>In respect of the county enterprise boards in the south east, I recently launched their week focusing on entrepreneurial spirit and encouraging micro-enterprises to participate with county enterprise boards.  It was a hugely successful week which was the first in the country.  It should be mimicked by other regions to ensure that there is greater focus on each region relative to its strengths and weaknesses.  In turn, it is my intention within the Department to continue to focus on county enterprise boards to ensure that the burden of bureaucracy is lifted from them, that they achieve the agenda they set out in the beginning, that they become easy to deal with and flexible in their approach and that we ensure best practice in the context of county enterprise boards as the model used across the country.</P>
        <P>In the context of how we look at alternative energies, county enterprise boards are an area where we can focus on development in this area, ensure there is a growth of jobs assisting that sector and the new developments that are taking place and achieving what we wish to achieve in respect of our carbon footprint and greenhouse <Col N="118"/>gas emissions.  All of that can be achieved by including micro-businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises.  In the context of county enterprise boards, there is also a need to focus on the growth of those companies into Enterprise Ireland clients.  This is essential.  There are far too many companies with less than 100 employees.  This is the growth area.  We need to focus on growing those numbers to become Enterprise Ireland clients and, thereafter, ensuring that they export and concentrate on that indigenous sector that could employ 100 or more people.  In that context and relative to my own region in the south east, with which I am very familiar, there is a need to grow and expand that knowledge economy, based around our institutes of technology and moving on to have a university for the southeast.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>This is essential and could be easily piloted in that region so that we can experience at first hand what it is like to grow into an Enterprise Ireland client, grow from there into a bigger company, use the technology and educational infrastructure and ensure we are ready for the next curve within our economic development.  We must be ahead of that curve and the only way we can do it is to invest in that type of third-level facility in collaboration, not just with the other educational operators, but with those in business in ensuring that we have that cross-support from business and commerce in the educational sector.   </P>
        <P>The report of the Small Business Forum has underlined for us all the extraordinary contribution that the small business sector is making to our economic prosperity.  Research carried out on behalf of the forum showed that in 2002, small businesses paid 11% of corporation taxes, or around &euro;520 million, 37% of income taxes, or almost &euro;4 billion, and 50% of VAT in the services sector or over &euro;4 billion.  The report contains a detailed analysis of the factors that drive the small business sector and has provided us with a blueprint for the further development of the sector.  The Government has already made considerable progress on the implementation of the report&rsquo;s findings.  Examples taken to date include the fact that the threshold for the exemption from the requirement that companies have their accounts audited has been increased from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;7.3 million.</P>
        <P>The budget in December 2006 included a package of measures designed to help the small business sector, including the extension and radical improvement of the business expansion and seed capital schemes up to 2013.  European Commission approval for the extension of the business expansion and seed capital schemes up to 2013 was received in late August 2007.  In announcing budget 2008 on 5 December 2007, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance announced that the <Col N="119"/>requirement that recycling companies must have received grant assistance before availing of the business expansion scheme is to be replaced by a requirement that their business proposals be certified by an industrial development agency or county enterprise board before they avail of the scheme.  As the business expansion scheme is an approved State aid, it will be necessary to advise the European Commission of this proposed change.</P>
        <P>In his Budget Statement in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday 5 December, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced the following initiatives aimed at reducing administrative reporting burdens on small and medium employers.  With effect from 1 March 2007, VAT registration thresholds for small businesses were increased from &euro;27,500 to &euro;35,000 in the case of services and from &euro;55,000 to &euro;70,000 in the case of goods.  These thresholds are being further increased from 1 May 2008 to &euro;37,500 for services, and to &euro;75,000 for goods, respectively.  The measure will take about 2,700 businesses out of the VAT system.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2007 confirmed the changes to the preliminary tax obligations of certain companies, as recommended by the Small Business Forum.  Small companies are now permitted to calculate their preliminary tax payments based on 100% of the prior-period tax liability if their tax liability for the prior period did not exceed a certain threshold.  The Act increased that threshold from &euro;50,000 to &euro;150,000.  This threshold was further increased to &euro;200,000 as part of budget 2008.  This will be effective for preliminary tax payment dates arising after 5 December 2007.  New companies which do not expect their tax liability for the first year to exceed &euro;150,000 are no longer obliged to pay preliminary tax in that first year.  This threshold was further increased to &euro;200,000 as part of budget 2008.  This will be effective for preliminary tax payment dates arising after 5 December 2007.</P>
        <P>The innovation voucher scheme was launched in March.  This scheme provides an incentive to small businesses to explore new ideas within their businesses and should help drive levels of innovation within the sector.  A total of 350 companies were awarded vouchers of &euro;5,000 each up to the end of September 2007.  I understand that Enterprise Ireland has received a further 156 applications, which are currently being processed.</P>
        <P>As part of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s science, technology and innovation strategy, Enterprise Ireland has been working on developing a suite of supports specially designed for the particular needs of manufacturing and internationally traded service companies.  This includes an R&amp;D stimulation grant to encourage companies that have not carried out research and development in the past or which have done so on a sporadic basis to develop the establishment of a sustainable research and development <Col N="120"/>activity.  Within the context of the new R&amp;D stimulation grant programme, Enterprise Ireland will deliver the knowledge acquisition grants scheme, which will allow grants of up to &euro;50,000 to be paid on a once-off basis for projects up to one year.</P>
        <P>There is huge scope in the area of research and development for job creation, particularly in the food sector.  One thinks of many of the giants, such as Glanbia with its research and development, heading up what is best practice throughout the world and engaging with huge multiples so that they feed what is desirable in the context of the food industry back into those companies.  Supported by the Government, they are able to bring about innovation and research and development and fulfil the market desires of the companies dealing directly with the end client.  We must continue to support this area and establish our niche market in the context of that knowledge-based economy to ensure there is continuing investment so that job creation in this area will be to such an extent that we will become the world leaders in a necessary area of development relative to the food chain and the demands of such new economies as China and India.  We must constantly focus on this area to ensure that the small and medium-sized enterprise area is heavily plugged into what is happening on the world stage so that it can also play the important role we need it to play to create sustainable jobs into the future.</P>
        <P>In respect of reducing the regulatory burden on business, a high-level group on business regulation was established comprising representatives of Departments and agencies, the business sector and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The group will seek ways to reduce and simplify administrative burdens, particularly those affecting small and medium enterprises.  The group is focusing on actions in the five priority areas identified by the business regulation forum.  To date, it has addressed concrete measures such as tax clearance certificates, waste licences, audit exemption thresholds, work permits, redundancy payments, etc.</P>
        <P>This process is best served to address the recommendation and believes that a strong input from business as to which regulatory requirements are causing the biggest burdens is critical.  Departments must understand the regulatory burden with which business must comply.  Forms from the CSO must be revised and we must understand who these forms target.  It can take much energy for a micro, small or medium sized business to complete the forms.  I come from that sector and know that people tick boxes simply to comply.  The analysis carried out of these forms cannot be accurate because compliance drives form-filling.</P>
        <P>The regulatory burden on micro-business should be reviewed to determine if it is needed or if it should be reduced to once per year.  For <Col N="121"/>small and medium enterprises, the forms should be simplified and made more relevant to the business.  These minor wins would give comfort to business, knowing that business is being acknowledged, there is space for it, that it can develop and someone is listening.  We hear the cases for this being made during budget time but there is no ongoing engagement with the SME sector to give it confidence and help it understand that we are in partnership together.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are the best example in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>They are responsive, they have the technology and a willingness and expertise to engage with the SME sector and business across the board.  They are successful, not in catching people out but in assisting business to meet its obligations.  If one is meeting obligations, one does not look on the Revenue Commissioners as a great scourge, as one may have done many years ago.  The system is changing due to coaxing, cajoling, an understanding of the sector and a mix of technology.</P>
        <P>The tech-check programme provides small businesses with the opportunity to access a highly subsidised independent technology check-up and help them to identify ways to boost productivity and profitability through the better use of technology.  This programme is being delivered by the county and city enterprise boards.  Projections to year-end indicate that 790 checks will be completed countrywide, as the programme becomes more fully embedded at national and regional level.  After that assessment is made, we need to consider what is required by small businesses in terms of information technology.  What is required may be beyond the financial capability of the company and more assistance may be required to such companies.  The county enterprise boards and the Departments must be more flexible and we must respond to queries in real time so that business decisions can be supported in a way that is focussed, directed and supportive of the SME sector.</P>
        <P>The Management Development Council has been established to drive levels of managerial capability within the enterprise sector.  The council will benchmark Ireland&rsquo;s current management development provision while also developing a co-ordinated approach to building appreciation in the SME sector for the value and need of leadership and management skills.  Two meetings of the council have been held to date.</P>
        <P>The first Small Business in Ireland report was published by the CSO on 30 May 2007.  This publication brings together for the first time a comprehensive set of statistics that clearly demonstrates the importance of the small business sector to our economy and has been widely welcomed by the business community and the Government.  It gives a basis for direction and an <Col N="122"/>understanding of the issues to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P>Reflecting the concerns of the forum, new guidelines to local authorities on the implementation of development contribution schemes under the Planning and Development Act 2000, issued by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government in May of this year, have emphasised the need for the impact of such schemes on our competitiveness to be taken into account.  As we encourage micro-enterprises and the SME sector to develop we must understand what they face in requesting planning permission, fulfilling fees and meeting the contribution scheme.  If we understand this development, a more even balance can be reached between counties so that we have a more similar system across the country.</P>
        <P>The same point applies to rates.  People have complained about the lack of uniform application of rates across counties.  Businesses need to know where they are going and the costs involved.  We need to spell out those costs so that they can be factored into business decisions.  The burden of that cost would be lightened if it was done in this fashion.  Decisions could then be taken more easily and the employment growth trend would be different.</P>
        <P>To meet the economic challenges ahead we must sustain a high level of entrepreneurial activity in general and maximise the number of new businesses that are innovative, and that aspire to and are capable of significant growth.  The environment in Ireland is highly conducive to entrepreneurial activity at present.  The culture is also highly supportive of entrepreneurs and their activity.  The economy remains strong, with buoyant consumer demand.  There is general agreement that Ireland is characterised by a pro-business policy, which has been in place for many years and is supported by all the main political parties.  The positive contribution of private sector initiatives and the enterprise development agencies in fostering and supporting a spirit of entrepreneurship is also generally acknowledged.  Moreover, the sophisticated foreign direct investment sector provides a potential customer base for new entrepreneurs and a means of achieving indirect exports.</P>
        <P>Based on various indicators, Ireland is only just behind the elite group of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world.  Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research indicates that, in 2006, the equivalent of 80,000 individuals in the adult population in Ireland reported that they had set up a new business in the past three and a half years. When this figure is combined with those that indicated that they were actively attempting to do so, over 200,000 individuals or 7.35% of the adult population were new business owners or entrepreneurs engaged in planning a new business.  This level of relative early stage entrepreneurial activity placed Ireland seventh within the OECD.</P><Col N="123"/>
        <P>The importance of entrepreneurship was recognised by the Small Business Forum.  The forum recommended that there should be a particular focus on the stimulation of latent entrepreneurial potential, particularly among women and ethnic groupings.  If we are to be successful in meeting these challenges, we need to ensure that the spirit of entrepreneurship that appears to be flourishing becomes embedded in the consciousness of our people.  The education and training sector will play a critical role both in developing entrepreneurial mindsets and in equipping current and future entrepreneurs with the skills necessary to strategically position new enterprises and then manage their subsequent development and growth.  However, if we are to build a much greater number of competitive and innovative companies in Ireland, we must see many new businesses being created now and in the years ahead.  The challenge is not only to generate a high level of new businesses but also to maximise the number of innovative businesses among them that subsequently develop to achieve high growth.</P>
        <P>As a follow-up to one of the Small Business Forum&rsquo;s recommendations, Forf&aacute;s published its report entitled Towards Developing an Entrepreneurship Policy for Ireland on 24 October 2007.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently working on the drafting of this policy statement with a view to submitting it to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  I acknowledge their valuable work on behalf of this country.  IDA Ireland attracts businesses to Ireland and ensures those that are established continue to flourish and grow.  I have been on a number of trade missions with Enterprise Ireland since my appointment in July and I am impressed by the level of entrepreneurial activity interfacing with the biggest names in commerce throughout the world.  Small companies from Ireland are doing business on the world stage, winning contracts that make one wonder how it was achieved.  They succeed on the basis of risk, establishing companies in the market and gaining respect in these markets, a key factor of their success.  I have seen businesses in Dubai, Moscow and Canada.  The Irish in business are to the fore and every contract they win feeds into the Irish economy, creating and sustaining jobs.  It also ensures that big companies will defer to the Irish involved in commerce on matters such as supplying secure banking technology for branches throughout the world.  We need to build on that enterprise and we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.  We must examine the synergies among IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and others actively involved in promoting Ireland and the activities of business interests within it to ensure we capitalise on what is happening in the marketplace.</P><Col N="124"/>
        <P>There is perhaps a need for Enterprise Ireland to reach out to the members of the Irish diaspora who are embedded in the economic systems of other countries, who are respected for what they do and who hold key positions.  Attracting these people into becoming actively involved with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland may help us to open up new opportunities that will yield further success in the context of job creation in this country.</P>
        <P>We cannot ignore the changes taking place in the world.  We cannot continue to complain about matters that are not within our control.  We must consider those aspects over which we have control and change the way we operate in terms of altering our focus and starting to react in real time.  We must work in partnership with the companies involved and ensure the contracts which are badly needed to underpin the development of the SME sector and of the businesses within it are won.</P>
        <P>As stated earlier, small and medium enterprises and microenterprises, which I will never forget to mention, are coming centre stage.  We need to reach out to them and ensure they grow.  We must also support them with our policies.  I accept that such policies may have to change, perhaps overnight.  In addition, they must take cognisance of the way small businesses operate in order that the latter, which are now central to our economy, continue to flourish.</P>
        <P>Irish people have a great entrepreneurial spirit.  They passionately believe they can make a difference and can create employment and businesses for themselves.  We should build on their enthusiasm and work with them as we move into the future.</P>
        <P>There is a need for Enterprise Ireland to continue to focus on change.  There are two constants in business, namely, change and risk.  We need, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to take risks with the business interests to which I refer.  I accept we are dealing with taxpayers&rsquo; money and that we must obtain value for such money.  However, we must also take risks.  If we are working in true partnership, then people must recognise that those on the other side of the equation in this regard are taking risks, not only with their own assets but also in the context that they might fail.  Irish people often consider failure as being the end.  A failure is merely something that happens on the way to being successful.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>We must change how people view this matter.  I was involved in business and I started out in difficult times when people were obliged to pay interest rates of 20%.  When one approached one&rsquo;s bank manager in the 1980s, one was seen as a chancer.  Now, because the scene has changed, one is viewed as an entrepreneur and one may sometimes be in a position to extract even more money from banks <Col N="125"/>to support one&rsquo;s initiative.  The Department needs to recognise and understand what is happening and to move very quickly.</P>
        <P>I was somewhat disappointed with the debate relating to competitiveness in the economy that took place in the D&aacute;il last week.  While I accept there are issues of concern, the debate focused on failure within the SME sector and on the part of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The sector is extremely vibrant and dynamic and merely needs to be partnered by the Government, in an ongoing and real way through the adoption of policies and the provision of support.</P>
        <P>Whatever we say in these Houses in respect of business, our words are analysed by newspapers and other media outlets across the globe.  When I met representatives of Dell recently, one of the comments directed to me related to what is written about our economy.  In contrast, there are 20 Irish companies operating in Moscow which are very comfortable with and confident about doing business in a foreign market.  As already stated, Members would be surprised about the way in which these companies win contracts.  They win them not only in their own interests but also in the context of representing Ireland Inc.  They need to be supported in this regard.  As public representatives, we must support them.  None of this takes away from the Opposition the opportunity to inform us where we are going wrong.</P>
        <P>I would be the first to acknowledge that mistakes were made.  I also acknowledge that mistakes were made in my business.  I was big enough to correct those mistakes, however, and proceed to do business again.  That is how we must operate.  We need to focus on the can-do attitude prevalent among young Irish entrepreneurs.  We must continue to encourage them.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the facts, figures and statistics and it is clear the Government recognises the great importance of SMEs to the economy.  It will continue to do all in its power to aid the creation of new companies and support the efforts of existing interests to continue to grow and succeed.  We must also give careful consideration, however, to the foundations upon which we are relying in building a knowledge economy, two words which, incidentally, sit uneasily together.  The importance of our education system and standards to that foundation, and to our ambitions, cannot be overstated.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a well-educated nation by international standards.  However, that is not enough.  If we are to offer graduates to the world, they must be the products of an education system which, at all levels, is world class, producing at the top end degrees and doctorates that are internationally recognised as hallmarks of academic excellence.</P>
        <P>I sometimes think that in today&rsquo;s politically correct world, exceptionality is being discriminated against.  We must encourage our brightest and provide them with the support they need to <Col N="126"/>develop their full potential.  We need to recognise and reward them, thereby creating role models for others to emulate.  There surely must be ways of bringing on the weak and encouraging the average and good without retarding the progress of the exceptional.  If we do not find those ways, the certain outcome will be mediocrity.</P>
        <P>There is also a danger that education could become a commercial product.  I watch the jargon and buzzwords of commerce slipping past the portals of academia and I wonder where all this will lead.  We do not want degrees delivered on a conveyor belt, replacing quality with quantity.  Neither should education be about speed or commerce.  It should be about the creation of a rounded, civilised individual who will make a positive contribution to the world as well as to his or her work.</P>
        <P>While understanding the need for it, I am concerned about specialisation.  As stated in the D&aacute;il recently and reiterated earlier in this House, I would like to see us produce more rounded graduates than currently seems to be the case.  I would like to see Pythagoras and Picasso &mdash; the right angle and the curve &mdash; having at least a conversation at the crossroads that benefits both before they go their separate ways.  How can that be achieved without undermining concentration on the desired degree?  I do not know but such a development would be good for graduates and for society.  For the same reason, I would like civics or, better still, philosophy taught at all levels in our schools.  We must give time to the spiritual well-being of the individual as well as the economic well-being of the nation.  If we do not, both will ultimately suffer.</P>
        <P>In considering what I was going to say about education, it occurred to me that I have not heard any strong voices emanating from within academia nor have I heard those involved in the sector promoting any grand vision.  Have these voices been drowned out by the roar of the Celtic tiger?  We need to hear from our academics because they also have a duty to speak out and make a contribution.</P>
        <P>Competition is a fact of life but it far from being life.  It is no harm to remind ourselves of that.  As a small, open economy, Ireland must fight for its share in an aggressive global marketplace.  We should not lose sight of our values, however, or the fact that by concentrating absolutely on quality, especially in education, we might be able to serve very profitably both the market and society.  There are down-sides to competitiveness.  For example, standards can slip, social responsibilities can be ignored and those who cannot or will not join the race can suffer.  We could end up being a nation that knows the price of everything and the worth of nothing, confused and aimless with the vain and vacuous strutting their stuff.  Success comes at a price.  Sometimes that price is too high.  It is the responsibility of politicians, teachers and academics to set the standard and ensure we do not pay too much.</P><Col N="127"/>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to make my maiden contribution in the House.  I look forward with interest to the contributions of Members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I was not sure whether it was his maiden contribution in the House.  He stated that he looks forward to Members making interesting contributions but he certainly made such a contribution himself.  I agree by and large with most of what he said.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s words were thought provoking.  In my six years as a Senator, I have not heard Pythagoras, Picasso, philosophy and Tarzan mentioned in the same contribution.  I am not sure whether Tarzan wrestled many crocodiles.  As I understand it, he wrestled mainly with apes.  There are a few apes in the path of the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.  Perhaps the Minister of State is the Tarzan-figure to wrestle with those.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister of State the very best in the task he faces.  He brings a freshness to dealing with this area.  Even in his contribution, he did not stick purely to the script.  It is good to see someone who is willing and able to speak off the cuff on a issue about which the Minister of State has some knowledge. </P>
        <P>I acknowledge, as outlined by the Minister of State, that a number of changes introduced in the budget will have a positive impact on small businesses.  The raising of the audit threshold and the changes in research and development funding are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I agree with what the Minister of State said about the provision of a university for the south east.  This does not specifically relate to this debate but the provision of a university is important to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in my region.  I concur with the Minister of State&rsquo;s sentiments that a university needs to be developed in the south east region as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I wish to pick up on a number of points made by the Minister of State.  One aspect of his contribution was a little disappointing in that he did not outline sufficiently the direction in which the Government is moving to introduce reform to address the difficulties  faced by small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned a number of points I wish to address.  He made an interesting comment about academia.  He asked have the voices of academia been drowned out by the roar of the Celtic tiger.  I believe he is right in that many voices were drowned out by the roar of the Celtic tiger.  Many younger people in particular entered the workforce before they had finished their education.  We had a good debate on upskil<Col N="128"/>ling a few weeks ago.  I was disappointed the Minister for Finance did not refer specifically to that area in the budget because it is of vital importance.  Many voices were drowned out when the Celtic tiger economy was strong.  Now that its gallop has been halted somewhat people are exploring other alternatives.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks about the new guidelines to local authorities on development contribution schemes.  I agree with what he said about local authorities putting high development charges on new developments, which will have an effect on our competitiveness.  That cannot be divorced from the fact that local authorities are forced into that position because their funding is not being supplied from central funds to the level it was previously.  That is the bottom line.  Local authorities are exploring other areas to secure funding, whether it be development charges or rates.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks about rates and the calculation of rates across the country.  The calculation of rates by local authority areas is very much hit and miss as a result of a lack of consistent and sufficient funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to support local authorities.  The Minister of State cannot criticise the calculation of rates on one hand and not accept some of the blame for that on the other.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the action the Government has or is considering taking to create a favourable atmosphere for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.  He referred to the tax system and how we have positioned our tax system to be supportive of business.  That is correct and it has been hugely beneficial in the past 15 years.  The development of Ireland as a knowledge-based economy will be through the dedication of sufficient Exchequer resources to the promotion of research and development.  Following the discussion in this House with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, a number of weeks ago, I was disappointed sufficient emphasis was not placed in the budget on the area of upskilling and further education.  Changes were announced in regard to research and development but if we are serious about ensuring the continued development of the economy into the future, we need to invest huge resources in the area of further education and adult education.  That must be done sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that the introduction of a better regulation programme to tackle regulatory burdens, particularly those faced by the business community, was a priority.  I wholeheartedly agree with that, as I am sure would everybody concerned.  Up to this point the Government has failed miserably in this area.  It has put more regulation in the face of small businesses in recent years, a problem that must be addressed in the near future.  The Minister of State mentioned that a committee, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, has been <Col N="129"/>established and that legislation will be soon be introduced.  I welcome that and that this problem will be addressed, although it should have happened a while ago.</P>
        <P>I recently spoke to a number of people in my area who are engaged in small business ventures and asked them what they considered to be the major issues affecting small and medium-sized enterprises into the future.  They gave me four headings on which I will briefly speak.  They mentioned inflation as a continuous problem facing small business; regulation, which the Minster of State mentioned; the efficiency of public services; and infrastructural problems.  The Government has contributed significantly to the problem of inflation that has existed in the past few years in particular.  The inflation rate has been in excess of 4% for a large part of the last year and a half, which is having a detrimental effect on small and medium-sized enterprises.  It is estimated that the effects of the changes announced in the budget would add about almost a half of 1% to the inflation rate, and that is something in which the Government has a direct role in implementing.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the role of the local authorities in terms of the costs small businesses face, with which I agree.  I mentioned rates and development changes.  The area of regulation is in many respects probably the single biggest impediment many small businesses face.  Many people staring their own business face over-regulation and strangling red tape.  I am glad the Minister of State intends to introduce legislation to reform some of the needless bureaucracy that exists in this area.  As he comes from a small business background, he will have a particular interest in this area.</P>
        <P>With regard to efficiency in the public services, in a number of recent surveys carried out by different groups small and medium-sized enterprises were asked to identify the key problems they face into the future.  The key problem identified in the most recent survey by BT Ireland was the lack of efficiency in public services.  Only 10% of those surveyed said that public services had improved since the benchmarking process was initiated.  Some 50% of those surveyed said that it had stagnated and 40% said that there had been a disimprovement in terms of the public services they use and need to carry out their business.  That is a startling statistic.  This key problem must be addressed across the board and not only for small business.  A serious problem exists in the lack of efficiency and delivery of service by certain sectors of the public service.  The Minister of State has a difficult job in this regard, but it is essential it is addressed if small businesses are to progress in coming years.</P>
        <P>I agree with the view of those surveyed recently by BT Ireland that VAT should have been addressed in the budget.  Regrettably action was not taken.  Some 26% of respondents in the survey said it was the most important issue they wished to see addressed in the budget.  The only <Col N="130"/>change in VAT in the six years I have been a Member of this House has been the increase in the rate in the immediate aftermath of the 2002 general election.  It is a crippling cost on small businesses and it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>The final issue affecting people in this sector was mentioned to me is infrastructure.  There is no doubt significant developments have occurred in our road infrastructure and the ongoing developments will result in significant improvements across the country.  However, there is much more to infrastructure than the road network, although some road blackspots have not been rectified.  I refer in particular to broadband.  We are debating the issue of broadband roll-out later tonight and I hope to speak on that issue.  The Minister of State, being from my own county, will be familiar with the difficulties that people with small businesses in rural areas have in trying to get a high-speed Internet connection.  These broadband connections are essential for the development of such businesses, especially if they are operating in a global context.  It is a disgrace that they are not in place.  If the Minister of State did nothing in his five years in office except to ensure that we get adequate broadband provision across the country, then he will have done a good job.  I will do anything possible to assist.</P>
        <P>We have seen increases in funding for the provision of rail services and carriages and I welcome that.  However, there is a strong case for opening old lines that still exist and that have not been built on.  New Ross has been put to the end of the queue in waiting for the new bypass, even though it is the biggest traffic blackspot in the south east and possibly in the whole country.  There are six and seven mile tail backs every evening on the Waterford approach into New Ross.  There is an existing rail line from New Ross to Waterford, even though it would need a major upgrade, yet no effort has been made to re-open it.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his new job.  He has the necessary drive to tackle some of the big issues that face small and medium enterprises in the future.</P>

	<P>I do not.  Do not mind Senator Alex White.  He is jealous.  I would like to see more business people in politics, because in his speech the Minster of State showed us that he understands how business and companies work and develop.  If everybody was working in <Col N="131"/>the non-trading sector, there would be poor days ahead for us.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economic transformation in the past decade has been remarkable.  Our nation is envied and studied by many other developed and developing countries around the world.  In January 1988, <i>The Economist</i> published a picture of a woman and a child begging on the street in Dublin, with a headline &ldquo;The poorest of the rich&rdquo;.  Ireland was presented like this all over the world.  It was a bad image.  Much has changed since then.  At that time, we were the basket case of Europe and all the young people in the audience know that a transformation has occurred in our country.  Many reasons abound on how we have become so successful.  Other countries in eastern Europe, South America and even individual states of the US have visited to see what has been going on.  Hillary Clinton came here to see how she could spread regional development through the state of New York.</P>
        <P>I am going to look at the individual entrepreneurs and how the Government was entrepreneurial in its decisions on developing businesses.  Far-sighted policy decisions taken by the Government over a number of years created the conditions in which economic activity could thrive.  When global economic conditions were ripe, we were able to take full advantage.  Economic and enterprise policy is constantly evolving and like a good business, the Government must constantly evolve its policies.  It will not continue to grow business unless it changes because circumstances are changing.</P>
        <P>At present there are difficult trading conditions around the world for companies.  I was in the US a month ago, where my nephew works with Merrill Lynch.  He said that there is fear throughout the company about the state of the stock market there.  Competition for overseas markets is intense and there is also intense competition for foreign direct investment into Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s current policy is driven in part by a long-term view, which is a vision of what home-grown internationally focused companies can achieve if constraints and barriers to growth are removed and appropriate supports are provided.  These are the wealth-generating companies and they are located throughout the State.  Their success will have profound implications for the local and regional economies in which they are based.</P>
        <P>In 1987, Connie Doody and myself started Lir Chocolates.  This was at a time when unemployment was at 18%.  I started the business not to make money, but to lower the unemployment levels here.  We brought jobs to East Wall and the local parish priest came to us for our first Christmas and thanked us for providing extra temporary employment at that period.  He said that there would be food and presents on the table in many houses in East Wall because of the jobs we provided.  I speak from personal experi<Col N="132"/>ence when I say that creating and providing jobs can help local economies.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Irish owned internationally trading services companies spend around &euro;17 billion in the Irish economy on wages, raw materials and service.  This spend multiplies throughout the economy.  It is seldom recognised that the contribution is similar to that of the foreign owned enterprises here.  People do not realise the contribution that is made and its value to the economy.  To build and maintain strong growth in an ever more competitive and interconnected world requires creativity and imagination.  In order to sustain an economy, we need creative ideas, new and better ways of working, and innovative products and services.  These will be the main drivers of future success.  Even as a small company, we knew that survival was about innovation and creativity.  We spent five years in developing our Bailey&rsquo;s chocolates, with three people devoted to the task.  It was a small company at the time, but we are not so small now as we have 140 people employed.  The key was to make Bailey&rsquo;s chocolate that would last six months, but at the start we were only able to make a kind that would last two weeks.  It took us five years to do it.</P>

	<P>The Senators all know they will get a bar.</P>
        <P>I would like to talk about the enterprise agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.I had the honour of being appointed by Mr. Frank Feely, then Dublin city manager, to the evaluation committee of the first Dublin City Enterprise Board and I spent five years on that.  I agree with the Minister that there is a tremendous opportunity all over the country for these enterprise boards to give the start and unleash further entrepreneurial spirit for the country.  Competition has intensified around the world and we are threatened by China and India.  The Indian government competes with us with intensity and passion.  Senator Quinn may find it difficult to believe that it is more difficult to develop indigenous companies than to get foreign direct investment into the country.  Getting Irish companies to grow and develop is more difficult.  I congratulate Enterprise Ireland, the county enterprise boards, F&Aacute;S and Bord Bia and would like to mention my experience during six years on the board of Bord Bia.  Former Deputy Joe Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, had the vision to see the need for Bord Bia, which would drive Irish food and drink products and market them around the world.  He was a tremendous Minister for Agriculture and Food.  He handled the foot and mouth disease outbreak on a weekly basis.  When I see the trivial matters that cause hardship in Leinster House I realise how <Col N="133"/>remarkable was his achievement in getting us to fight off foot and mouth disease.</P>
        <P>I would like to give three examples of successful Irish companies.  Mr. Frank Ryan, CEO of Enterprise Ireland, is one of the most enterprising people I have met.  I have known him for approximately 30 years.  He was a missionary and zealot for getting foreign direct investment into Ireland.  Morning, noon and night he intensified his work on that.  I was aware of this because my husband was chief executive of the IDA.  It is fantastic that Mr. Ryan is driving Enterprise Ireland.  Irish companies are competing and winning.  Mantis Cranes of County Donegal is the only manufacturer of self-erecting cranes outside continental Europe and supplies the US market to an estimated value of &euro;700 million per annum.  Selatra is a small, Irish-owned software company that has made a significant breakthrough in the Russian mobile telephone market.  Prodieco has made considerable gains in the German engineering market.  Can Members imagine an Irish company competing with German engineering companies?</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn was not here when I held up a copy of the cover of <i>The Economist </i>from January 1988, which named Ireland &ldquo;the poorest of the rich&rdquo; and portrayed us as the basket case of Europe.  However in 1999 <i>The Economist</i> called us the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; and the &ldquo;shining light of Europe&rdquo;.  The cover illustration shows a glow coming from Ireland on the map of Europe.  The seeds had been sown over many years by Government and the enterprise agencies.  I have several copies and Members may keep them as icons.  The first cover showed poor people begging on the street and it went around the world.</P>

	<P>Ten years later we were described around the world as the shining light of Europe.  I wish the Minister every success.  I am delighted to see a business man as Minister.  The world is his oyster; it is there for him to achieve.  I also thank him for everything at a personal level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for this opportunity and for allowing me to follow Senator Mary White&rsquo;s interesting speech.  With the young people in the Visitors Gallery, I read and listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech and listened to Senator Mary White and others.  What impressed me was the fact that the Minister is talking about innovation and entrepreneurship.  When I left school many years ago I was the only person in my class of 48 people who planned to go into business, perhaps because I came from a business background.  In those days the majority of people had the objective and ambition of getting a secure job in the Civil Service or somewhere similar.  I mention this for the young visitors because Ireland has changed, <Col N="134"/>and Senator Mary White has talked about that, particularly in the past 20 years.  Senator Mary White was helpful to me last year when I was asked to speak in Argentina and Brazil about entrepreneurship and the Irish success story.  I read the book by her husband, Mr. Padraic White and Mr. Ray MacSharry about the Celtic tiger and, as the Minister said, it is like reading an exciting novel to see what happened and find out about the success.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mention this because of the importance of education, which the Minister of State touched on in his speech.  I would love young people growing up to see entrepreneurship as a real opportunity for them, to create their own jobs rather than have somebody else create jobs for them.  Education is changing.  Yesterday I spoke to the vocational education committees about looking for the customer.  The question used to be whether the customer of a school is the student or the parents.  Whatever about the past, the customer of a school is the student.  In the past we educated people to the age of 19 and told them they had enough education to get a job.  Now we have lifelong learning and our job in education is to teach students how to learn because they will have to learn again and again, will probably have four or five jobs in their lifetimes or better still establish their own businesses and achieve five or six different jobs in their lifetimes.</P>
        <P>A few years ago I wrote a book that was published in 11 countries and did well in Japan.  I have been to Japan several times and got to know Mr. Masatoshi Ito, a Japanese retailer.  He visited me a couple of years ago and we toured supermarkets.  As we left my Lucan supermarket to return to my home in Howth he asked me when I started in business and how many shops I had at the time.  We had 18 shops at that time and I started in 1960 with one shop.  He replied that he started in 1952 and that in 1960 he, too, had one shop.  I asked how many shops he had now, and after checking with his interpreter he worked out that he had 14,600.  He owned a company in the United States called 7-Eleven, among others.  I asked Mr. Ito what made him different from all the other retailers who had one shop in 1960.  He asked me to let him think about it.  Half an hour later as we got out of the car he answered, &ldquo;Whether you believe you can, or you cannot, you are right.&rdquo;  He told me he plays tennis and if he approaches a game thinking he has no chance, he is right, he has no chance.  If he goes into the game believing he can beat his opponent, he is also right.  That change of attitude has happened and Ireland has gained confidence.  There is even a danger we have become complacent about it in recent years.  The ability to train and educate for entrepreneurship is essential if we are to create success in the medium and small enterprises and enable them to grow.</P>
        <P>In the past few years the Minister for Education and Science asked me to chair the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment commit<Col N="135"/>tee that introduced the leaving certificate applied curriculum.  What an interesting development that was.  Until then the only way one could do the leaving certificate was, after two years of study, to go into a room for three hours and write down everything one knew about a particular subject.  The leaving certificate applied was different.  It said there are other intelligences, not just the ones of communication in written form.  Spoken communication is just one example.  Professor Howard Gardner of the Harvard Graduate School of Education noted the other intelligences that are not being measured.  The leaving certificate applied measured only in written form in those days.  I learned that there are bright, intelligent, active young people who are at the back of the class because they were regarded as poor at writing, reading and, perhaps, sums.  They were put at the back of the class at seven, ten or 13 years of age, and stayed there.</P>
        <P>The leaving certificate applied ensured there would be continuous assessment so that there was an opportunity to judge such children on other types of intelligence rather than just their ability to pass written examinations.  One could see people grow and develop and those formerly regarded as failures at the back of the class suddenly became much better.  I was very pleased with the Minister of State&rsquo;s words when he talked about small businesses and enterprises in terms of how they interact with those people who believe they have no chance of succeeding without becoming much bigger.  The best ideas sometimes come from very small companies that nurture and develop little ideas.</P>
        <P>I am patron of the Irish Association of Supported Employment and one of the things it is interested in is the O2 ability awards that Aisling Foundation produce.  Last year, a man called Gar Holohan won the award with his company Aura Sports and Leisure.  He identified a need for swimming pools for people with disabilities.  It was a wonderful success story.  There are a number of these fitness centres, and they are not only for people who are disabled.  Mr. Holohan was able to include people with varying levels of ability, and they were able to succeed.  That came about from the spark of an idea through someone who was innovative and seized the opportunity.  We have to encourage everyone to develop confidence in generating and developing new ideas, and show them it is possible regardless of the size of enterprise.  The Minister of State is right in his belief that it is only a question of whether one believes one can.  If we can instil in people&rsquo;s minds that they can do it, they will achieve far more.</P>
        <P>I was on the board of North Dublin Partnership when I was elected to the Seanad and I learned something from the experience.  I was disappointed I could not remain with the partnership as an elected Member of the Oireachtas.  It was set up in the 1980s to create jobs in Finglas.  One <Col N="136"/>of the difficulties, I found, was that there was always an assumption when people in different parts of the country came together to form an association to promote job creation.  They would form a committee and then the first thing they did was to send someone to the Government in Dublin to help them develop the enterprise, instead of doing it themselves.  I was delighted to find in the North Dublin Partnership a level of enthusiasm which ensured the people there did something for themselves rather than asking somebody else to come in to do it.</P>
        <P>One of the points Senator Mary White dealt with concerned the difficulties sometimes encountered in setting up a small business compared to pursuing an initiative to invite in foreign direct investment.  I sat on the committee for better regulation and was very impressed that the Government&rsquo;s aim and ambition was to reduce the regulations that stifle business.  Approximately ten or 12 years ago a person who was planning to set up business in Ireland contacted me.  He did not come to Ireland in the end because he was made more welcome in other countries through the reduction in bureaucracy.  In the event, I believe he set up in Scotland instead because at that stage the Scots had decided they wanted these jobs to go to them rather than Ireland.  We must always ensure that while our regulations may be in place for the best of purposes, they should not stifle initiative.</P>
        <P>One law that affects small and medium businesses concerns me.  It was passed by this House, and I had not noticed it until later.  It is the Consumer Protection Act 2007, section 48(4)(<i>a</i>), which is concerned with the National Consumer Agency.  I remember it going through and I had not noticed, but it gave the Minister the right &mdash; although he has yet to empower it &mdash; to say that if a customer pays by credit card he or she cannot be charged extra for using a credit card as against using cash.  That seemed very sensible as it went through the Oireachtas.  However, if the Minister introduces this it means a vendor cannot differentiate in favour of a cash customer.  If somebody offers to pay for a product in a small shop by credit card and the shopowner asks for cash instead, he or she will not be able, in the event, to offer a discount for cash &mdash; even though the credit card company will take a percentage off the price paid to the retailer.  I mention this because it is part of the onus on legislators to use impact analysis on every aspect of legislation.  Things we tend to do very well sometimes hinder the opportunity to achieve success in other ways.</P>
        <P>I shall leave one thought with Members, because it is something that frequently crops up.  Sometimes people make the mistake of trying to win new business all the time instead of looking after their existing enterprise, and this frustrates me.  If we could only get it across to people to look after their customers rather than spending time trying to get new clients, that would be worthwhile.  Last year I had an experience where <Col N="137"/>my wife told me that a young woman with an English accent had been phoning me, at home.  My wife trusts me a great deal, and she was letting me know that this woman had phoned three times and would not tell her what it was all about.  Next time I was home, the phone rang and this young woman from England said she represented <i>The Economist</i> newspaper, my subscription was running out, and she invited me to renew it.  I was happy to renew it and had seen there was a 35% reduction.  She said that did not apply to existing customers, only new ones.  She said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me.  I am actually only doing my job&rdquo;.  I no longer get <i>The Economist</i>.  My wife takes it, which solved the problem in that way.  I mention this because part of the task we have is to persuade people not to expect the Government to do everything.  They can ensure the Government opens the doors but must do the work themselves.</P>

	<P>It is nice to see the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ann Ormonde in the Chair.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, on his new portfolio and wish him well.  I look forward to working with him over the next five years.  It is great to see someone who has come with such a wealth of experience, enormous ability, and a large amount of energy.  I look forward to very many positive new changes in the portfolio held under Deputy McGuinness as Minister of State.  I have been a friend of his for a long time and it is great to see someone holding office who has come up the hard way, a man who was self-employed and made it for himself.  Given such a background he has a great chance of making it for the nation. </P>
        <P>It is stimulating, too, to be in the presence of Senator Mary White, a very successful entrepreneur in her own right, as well as Senator Feargal Quinn, who is a national figure.  I took Val Doonican&rsquo;s one-liner, &ldquo;Do what you do, do well&rdquo;, to heart when Senator Quinn advised business people to look after their customers.  I bow to what he had to say in that regard.  The thought for the week, however, is something I gleaned from the Minister of State today, when he said that failure was only something that happened on the way to success.  There never was a truer word.  I congratulate the Minister of State on an excellent presentation to the House.  It was very uplifting and stimulating.  I had looked forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s visit to the Seanad, as had every Member who is here, to hear his contribution and learn of his enthusiasm for his portfolio.  It was uplifting.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s assertion that we Irish should be, as we always have been, even through very bad times, a nation and people of &ldquo;can do&rdquo;, rather than anything else.  We are a very positive nation, which has achieved an incredible success story, particularly over the last 20 years, without any help from the media.  The Irish people did it their way and owe nothing to the media.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always asked whether there is a paper that will give us half a page of good news per day or a radio station that will give 15 minutes, or a television channel, with the exception of the programme &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo;, which we see on our screens three times a week, to tell the success story of the real Ireland and the transformation that has come about.  The Taoiseach, when he leaves Ireland, is admired abroad for what he has done over the last ten years as is Ireland for its achievements, over the last 20 years.  Everyone comes here to see how the Irish have done it.  I do not know whether there is an agenda, and I often tell my friends I do not know one wealthy journalist.  I knew one, the late John Healy, but no one else.  God rest him, he has gone on to his eternal reward.  If one cannot do it for oneself, how can one tell others to do it?  If one has the will and determination, it is bound to happen if one lives in Ireland as one&rsquo;s turn will come.</P>
        <P>With regard to the past 20 years, I pay tribute to Ray MacSharry, the late Charles J. Haughey and Michael Mullen because they gave us the national understanding in 1987 which stopped all the strikes.  Those of us who were Members of the Oireachtas in those days know that every Wednesday we had strike after strike.  Everyone was up in arms over the lower rate of income tax of 35%, a higher rate of 65% and a 2% health levy.  No one could survive.  Is it any wonder we had the black economy.  Anyone who kept a business going in that time deserves a gold medal for endeavour.  We did it and we are where we are today with a tremendous success story.  It has been discussed from the high heavens and I wanted to state it today.</P>
        <P>As the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business who held the post for the previous five years, I visited many places throughout the world.  I was uplifted with what Enterprise Ireland did under the stewardship of Frank Ryan, its chief executive and one of the finest men I ever met who was associated with a Government agency.  If the Minister of State listens to Frank Ryan and goes with Enterprise Ireland to South Africa, Canada, the United States, India, China, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Riyadh, he will see the challenges facing Ireland.  I visited all of these places as Chairman of the committee.</P>
        <P>I salute the teaching profession and those teachers who gave of their time over generations and decades to give us the vibrant economy we have today.  It was transformed through education, free travel and third level institutes.  It is on this subject I wish to speak.  Ireland&rsquo;s future over the next 20 years relies on the success of third level institutes such as those in Letterkenny, Sligo, Athlone and Carlow.  The poor man&rsquo;s child and middle to lower income earners&rsquo; sons and daughters got to where they are today because of <Col N="139"/>third level institutes.  The institute of technology in Athlone has 6,500 students and is thriving.  Long may it continue.</P>
        <P>I visited Waterloo University, approximately 20 miles outside Toronto in Canada.  This is where BlackBerry technology was created.  I met two of the three young men who created it and one of their fathers given them a loan of 100,000 Canadian dollars.  The area in Waterloo to which they went is now Waterloo University.  They reversed the policy of universities in other parts of the world, including Ireland and Europe, whereby one signs over one&rsquo;s rights as a scientific innovator and if one creates something, one gets a percentage back.  In Waterloo University, if one creates something, one owns the intellectual property in perpetuity and leases back a portion of it to the university.</P>
        <P>If the institutes of technology were to adopt this policy, not alone would we attract the best brains in Ireland who want to own their intellectual property but also the best brains of Europe.  The greatest success in the United States and Canada is at Waterloo University where one can own one&rsquo;s intellectual property.  This is where the future of Ireland lies with regard to research and development and intellectual property.</P>
        <P>The Government should consider increasing the points system for mathematics and science to encourage students into these areas because it is where future jobs lie.  Perhaps the Minister of State would intervene to persuade the Minister for Education and Science to examine this.  It was stated at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party that this is an important area into which students should be encouraged.  Multinationals will locate where the student brain pool exists and this is how Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the Department will persuade people to stay.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State all the luck in the world and I look forward to his many future visits to the Seanad.  I hope to participate in future debates.  We will help in any way we can with our experience which cannot be bought.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true major developments have occurred over the past decade and we all rejoice in the economic success of the country and participated in it.  Various Members have come at this debate from various perspec<Col N="140"/>tives.  The Minister of State, whom I welcome to the House, approaches it having a strong background in business as do Senators Quinn and Mary White.</P>
        <P>As we are ticking the boxes on where we come from and what experience we have, my experience of dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises is as a practitioner in the non-trade sector, to which Senator Mary White referred, dealing with small business facing employment law issues.  This is an area of regulation worth considering.  Small businesses often find themselves up against it when they run into an issue, whether it is dismissing someone or facing a discrimination case.  I am conscious of the frustration many businesses have.  They do not necessarily believe the laws are bad or wrong, although some may hold this view.  There is a lack of immediate support and guidance for dealing with these crises which can suddenly arise in the course of business, especially for a small business in the early stages of its development.</P>
        <P>I often have seen people with fantastic energy who came together with a good idea in the information technology sector but they experienced a people management problem in the first six months or first year which caused difficulties.  The representative bodies for employers do good work in assisting people in this situation.  When we discuss regulation we tend to concentrate on financial matters such as those touched on by Senator Quinn.  We should also consider the question of how we can better support small businesses and enterprises in the context of developing the laws by which they are bound, particularly employment law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can have vibrant and robust business together with strong protection of employment rights.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  Employment law has expanded in a piecemeal manner in recent years.  European directives have been introduced which deal with part-time work and fixed-term contracts.  These are minefields to navigate for small businesses run by one or two people.  They want to look after existing customers and perhaps look to the future and new business.  However, they see new regulations introduced weekly or monthly covering holidays, working time or equal treatment.  We should consider streamlining some of this.  Some of it is dealt with by the Labour Court and more is dealt with by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  One tries to explain to people that not all cases are brought before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Some cases must go before the Labour Court while others go to the Rights Commissioner and then, in the event of an appeal, to the Labour Court.  The different bodies have interlocking jurisdictions.  Although the Department has given the matter some consideration, it would be productive to consider rationalising which types of cases should go before which tribunals.  Such an analysis could help employers make sense of their responsibilities.</P><Col N="141"/>
        <P>In respect of the wider question of regulation, the Labour Party acknowledges that we have achieved substantial progress through regulation, a word that tends to be accompanied by the word &ldquo;burden&rdquo;.  While regulation is frequently a burden for the person who must deal with it, it generally delivers a gain for wider society.  For example, having equal treatment in the workplace, basic minimum holiday entitlements, regulations to prevent abuse of employment contracts and so forth provides a social gain which improves the quality of life.  Once, during a debate with a person who reads <i>The Economist</i> more enthusiastically than I do, I responded to my opponent&rsquo;s repeated use of the term &ldquo;burden of regulation&rdquo; by asking whether one could not make the case for describing regulation as an achievement.  There is a wider level of protection which we should defend.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s concerns relating to the manner of its implementation in individual businesses is shared by Senators.  Regulation should not be unnecessary or disproportionate to its objective and should be applied efficiently.</P>
        <P>Like Senator John Paul Phelan, I found much of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution to be very thoughtful.  It contained little with which I could disagree, especially regarding the education system.  He is correct that education should not focus solely on honing individual skills.  Having reading about this issue, it appears that even in countries such as the United States, employers seek to employ rounded individuals with an ability to make decisions and analyse problems.  While individual skills are important, especially in a technical field, we need to have strong, innovative individuals with analytical and problem-solving skills employed in businesses across the private and public sectors.  Innovation may be a skill with which one is born but it can also be developed.  An education system that is strong at all levels encourages people to seek to solve problems as opposed to merely fitting in as cogs in the system.</P>
        <P>The Minister was also correct that academics must play a greater role in this debate.  I do not quite need to declare an interest in this regard but I am married to an academic.  On a more serious note, the Minister of State makes a fair point that we want public intellectuals and experts, for instance, those teaching science or business at university, to contribute their ideas to this debate.  Dr. Edward Walsh, formerly of the University of Limerick, springs to mind as a person who played this type of role.  While I did not always agree with his positions, which were sometimes a little too far to the right for my liking, he made a strong contribution to public debate by becoming genuinely engaged with these issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to various public bodies such as the IDA, Forf&aacute;s and Enterprise Ireland and singled out the Revenue Commissioners as an organisation which has developed many of its procedures to a high standard.  We <Col N="142"/>should do more than pay lip service to the important role of these organisations and the public service in general.  We should also realise that while the public service must become more efficient in certain areas, it is at the heart of what we need to do because it must implement the new and changing policies, initiatives and ideas we develop.  Senators had a little crack at the Minister of State on account of certain remarks he made about inefficiencies in the public service and in this context he is correct that inefficiencies exist here and there.  However, this debate must not stray to the extent that we fail to recognise the vital role of the public sector in advancing the issues and demands under discussion.  It has the skills needed for this purpose and is well equipped for the task.  It is not enough to say, as the Minister of State did, that a partnership is needed.  We must support the public service.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We served together on the Committee of Public Accounts for five years, during which we learned the value of spending public money wisely.  While this is a virtue in the running of any business, unfortunately it is not always properly recognised in the expenditure of public moneys.  I represent the Green Party which, through political discourse, has allowed itself to be portrayed as lacking knowledge of economics and failing to engage in economic debate.  As my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on finance, I believe I have helped dispel this myth.</P>
        <P>Another challenge for my party is to counter the view that the Green Party has little interaction or involvement with industry, especially small business.  My party leader, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, ran a successful language school, an important service industry.  Our deputy leader is still involved in running a chain of bookstores, while the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, ran a successful cycle tourism business.</P>
        <P>I place myself in the same pantheon.  To contest the industrial and commercial panel in the Seanad elections of 1997, I had to justify to the Clerk of the Seanad, who was a hard woman to convince in these matters, that I had a direct involvement in industry and commerce.  I am a director of several companies involved in arts and environmental protection, which are limited by guarantee which means they are not trading entities.  I was also a director of a charity shop for the Earthwatch organisation.  This was a strange contradiction in terms in the sense that it provided low price goods to raise funds for a charity and did not make a profit.  While it did not qualify as a business activity, the Clerk of the Seanad was somewhat lenient in accepting my nomination.</P>
        <P>I raise these matters because I have gone on record since in other political and economic debates as a strong supporter of the teachings of <Col N="143"/>Adam Smith who has been adopted as a guru by other political parties, especially those of the right.  Adam Smith&rsquo;s writings contained strong warnings against the emergence of monopoly capitalism.  The type of economic model he tried to promote was based on multiple small-scale businesses operating in the most local base possible.  This is the essence of Green Party economic policy and sums up the type of economy we should strive to achieve.</P>
        <P>The economy should have an appropriate level of foreign direct investment.  It should not be so reliant on FDI that it is left open to what has been described in terms of currency fluctuations as an &ldquo;asymmetric shock&rdquo;.  The world economy is at a crossroads and we must ensure we have a strong indigenous economy that will survive with the least possible damage the impact of probable changes in the global economy.  I would like to think measures are in place that help us deal with this.  The contributions to this debate already, have talked about the need to foster the ethic of small businesses and to encourage as many practitioners as possible.  Part of that debate has been the role of regulation, as mentioned by Senator Alex White.  I would be supportive of the need for regulation and the protection of consumer interests.</P>
        <P>In establishing and encouraging new businesses we must strike a balance between the extent to which people with innovative and entrepreneurial ability should go towards making sure their businesses take hold and the extent to which they should be seen to be agents of the State.  Many people establishing new companies are frustrated that the balance in that regard does not weigh in their favour.  There is a great deal of paperwork and regulations to which people must adhere before setting up a business and, as legislators, we must ensure the balance is weighted as far as possible in favour of those trying to establish businesses.  Some improvements have been made in that area.  For example, the VAT registration threshold has been raised a number of times in recent years.</P>
        <P>One amendment to a Finance Bill I managed to achieve in my five years as an Opposition spokesperson was when Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance, and that was to get rid of a lower threshold for research and development.  I made the argument that if we were to get future economic success from research and development we were as likely to get it from single or two person operations operating out of a garage as from somebody working in the highest tech laboratory possible.  I listened with interest to what the Minister said in this regard.</P>
        <P>The European Commissioner with responsibility for science and research spoke recently to the forum on Europe.  One of the arguments I made to him was the need for a proper balance in terms of allowing research to take place for research sake, for a scientist to operate in a <Col N="144"/>situation where he or she is not wholly concerned with commercial matters because much research and development is sponsored by commercial interests.  By the same token we have to ensure that research and development money which is provided by the State does not all go through our educational institutions.  It is here that we are possibly getting the balance wrong.  Money is being absorbed into our third level education system that might be better directed in research and development terms at people establishing small businesses to help them with innovation and marketing needs.  It is a balancing act in terms of regulation and State intervention.</P>
        <P>I get a sense of cross party acceptance that the need is to ensure the balance should be weighted in a particular direction.  If that can be achieved the uncertainty that exists at a global level in terms of the world economy can be overcome.  I am confident the measures in place will help us do that.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I have no doubt he has a good grasp of the small and medium size business sector.  It was refreshing to hear him speak on the matter.  I shall confine my contribution to a few questions to the Minister of State.  </P>
        <P>We have lost our textile industry and our indigenous craft industry.  During the past ten years we have witnessed a massive explosion in the retail service industry.  My town of Castlebar has more than doubled in size during the past seven or eight years, yet no manufacturing jobs have been created.  All the jobs created are mainly in the service and retail sectors which is worrying from an economy point of view.  I presume the position is similar in towns throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Some the stores are massive, probably with massive overheads in rates and development charges.  Given that the Minister of State mentioned development charges, these can be quite severe on a person starting up a business.  The Minister of State appeared to suggest that the new report made recommendations to county managers to adjust development charges.  Does this apply to the retail and the service sector also, as some of the units are quite small, or is the Minister of State speaking specifically about industrial zones?   Senator Cassidy is right in saying the third level institutions linked to small indigenous businesses in the local area is important and is the way forward.  The same applies to research and development.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>I attended a launch in Castlebar of Baxter Healthcare and congratulate the company, the IDA and the Government on an investment of &euro;75 million.  That no new jobs will be created means there is a change in IDA funding policy.   Do county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland refund companies where jobs are maintained rather than create new jobs?  This appears to be a change in IDA policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Keep the jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate if the Minister of State would comment on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no denying that the State has made remarkable economic progress during the past 15 years and the small and medium enterprises have benefited somewhat.  There are a number of areas where we can help SMEs to develop.  There is an acknowledgement that SMEs are the best way to produce new jobs and certainly the best way forward for the regions.  I stand here as one who is an employer but not in enterprise.  I come from an area that has been hammered by job losses, many of which have been foreign direct investments, where family members and friends have been left unemployed as a result.  </P>
        <P>There is no doubt the Government has committed endless studies, plans, documents and explanations on the way forward.  It appears there is always a one size fits all approach, what works in Dublin is supposed to work in the regions but it is not like that.  Speaking to SMEs there is a consensus about what needs to be done.  There is a need for a marketing service to help them market their products, for administrative supports to reduce the paperwork burden, for technical supports for software communication, Internet business, opportunity and customer management systems, and a business school expertise in managing growth and cash flow problems.  While there are many other issues I do not have the time to dwell on them.</P>
        <P>In regard to the national training fund, to which businesses contribute, there is an appreciation that the upskilling of employees does not meet the needs of the industries that require it.  There are also other issues in terms of the all-Ireland development and the difficulties SMEs experience with legislation, particularly in the Border counties which is day-to-day problem.  There is also the issue of the demand for an increase in the minimum wage.  While we appreciate that the rise in costs, particularly wages, has a large impact on SMEs they must accept that the cost of living in the State requires a certain wage to be paid to people to survive.  What is pushing up those wages can be tackled and it can help relieve the burden on SMEs.  Housing, healthcare and child care are just three areas where costs have risen beyond all reasonable expectations.  To meet these costs people need a fair wage.  If the <Col N="146"/>Government progressively intervened in these areas some of the pressures would be taken off the public and the business world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate.  It is an opportunity for me to listen to all parties and what they have to say on the SME sector and the State agencies that guide us through this process to sustain jobs and win new contracts, be they IDA or Enterprise Ireland. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators John Paul Phelan and Alex White referred to the public service, one with regard to its deficiencies and the other with regard to the need to acknowledge the good work being done.  In my contribution, I acknowledged it is undoubted that there are decent, hard-working people within the public service delivering policies on behalf of the Government.  The question is whether they have in place the appropriate dynamics or systems to deliver to an economy that is now very different and dynamic, and where demands change on a regular and immediate basis.</P>
        <P>My suggestion is that we need reform, and that we need to look at the elephant in the room as well as the changing of the old order.  We need to ensure the public service has the processes and systems in place to allow it to progress, while at the same time releasing the new energy and liberating public servants.  The unions and the Government need to work in partnership, with all in the political system, to make this happen.</P>
        <P>I constantly hear complaints about delivery within the public service.  I support the need for change and the need to confront the elephant in the room.  I will not stand back from this debate because it is one this country needs.  There is benchmarking for those employed in the public service but there is another side to the issue.  The private sector demands that if one is paid on one side, outturn and performance should be measured to ensure we are getting the best for our country.  The system in the public service does not allow this to happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened attentively in the D&aacute;il to Deputy Michael D. Higgins, a politician I greatly admire.  What he has to say is common sense and is usually part of an excellent contribution, regardless of the subject of the debate.  He commented on the morals of those in the world of commerce who have their snouts in the trough and are getting an enormous amount of money in salary and bonuses.  I suggest that, through the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; Senator Boyle referred to this point &mdash; we need to examine further the morals of those in the public sector, given that the members of the committee see evidence of millions of euro being spent incorrectly or lost to the economy because we simply do not have the systems in place to deal with the issues that have arisen.</P><Col N="147"/>
        <P>These are the questions we need to ask ourselves and it would be wrong of us, as public representatives, not to do so.  If we question the performance of the private sector and insist on best practice and regulation, with which I agree if it is not too heavy, we have an equal obligation as public representatives and legislators to ensure the best performance from the public sector and to ensure we give every public servant the opportunity to perform in a system that is modern, dynamic and can respond to the investment being made in it.</P>
        <P>Through the years, we gave that system nickels and dimes because we did not have funds available but we are now spending billions of euro.  Members should watch the Committee of Public Accounts and they will understand this change.  I worked with Senator Boyle on that committee and saw the change in spend.  When we focused on roads infrastructure and other projects, we achieved value for money and ensured that contracts came in on time.  This in turn serves the development of the economy because it is infrastructure that is most needed, as noted by Senator John Paul Phelan and others.</P>
        <P>I am in favour of and support those who work in the public service.  However, we need to demand the same from the public sector that we would from a normal modern business dealing in global markets.  The money collected with such diligence by the Revenue Commissioners needs to spent on behalf of the taxpayer with the same degree of diligence.  We should expect this from everyone, including politicians, who should be judged on their outturn.</P>
        <P>I disagree with the huge amounts paid in bonuses to individuals in the public sector.  Bonuses must be earned and must include a performance element.  If not, how will those public servants further down the pecking order view them?  As with the call to academics in terms of education, we need to call on those who serve the system.  Since I made my public remarks in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, a great number of people in the public system and the trade union system, and those working in and outside this country, have agreed that change is needed.  I would be wrong not to say this because it is what I believe, as much as I passionately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect the work done by the county enterprise boards.  I want to see them coming forward with initiatives on marketing their own areas.  Within the work they do is the answer to some of the queries that have been put to me in this debate, including Tech-Check in terms of technology and the support from the mentoring system, which is available for every company.  I was a member of the county enterprise board for many years and know that any professional intervention required by a company will be supported by these boards.  The questions I have been asked have already been answered by the investment made in them.</P>
        <P>With regard to upskilling, there is regular investment year on year, now more than ever.  Skillnets is a very successful programme delivering upskilling to every business one can imagine which wants to become engaged in the programme.  We must, however, build on this progress.  Such programmes are not a permanent answer but are simply what will serve our economy for the present.  I called earlier for us to be flexible in our approach to this issue.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with my constituency colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan, that this is about the blame game.  It is about every Member of the D&aacute;il and Seanad recognising the changes that must be made in the interests of the economy.  With regard to Enterprise Ireland, people must always benchmark themselves against somebody else to see whether they can make a difference in terms of what they do, and thereby achieve value for money for the investment being made.  The same can be said of the IDA.</P>
        <P>Profit is the measure of performance in the private sector.  Profit in the public sector is public satisfaction &mdash; it is about having people receive proper service from the public service and therefore not turn up to their public representative&rsquo;s clinic at weekends.  This is how it should be measured.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to broadband, which is fundamental to most businesses.  Everyone needs it and demands it.  It is up to companies like Eircom to unbundle the local loops, get involved in business and work with the Government to capitalise on the investment that has already been made in local area networks and municipal area networks.  The ESB has rolled out technology and fibre-optic cable across the country but others are afraid to take this, the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; &mdash; the <Col N="149"/>Americans are probably correct when they refer to bringing it the &ldquo;first mile&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is also a need for people, not just businesspeople, to demand a service.  We need to encourage by proper marketing the uptake of this service right to the individual&rsquo;s door.  We need to encourage Eircom in this regard.  I hoped when Babcock &amp; Brown acquired a major stake in Eircom that we would see a huge concentration on that market but it has not happened.  Public engagement on this issue is required.  The investment already made by the Government needs to be protected in terms of rolling out broadband at the required level.</P>
        <P>I have a firm belief with regard to local government charges and rates and I agree with Senator Paddy Burke that there is a need for focus in this area.  These charges affect the growth of business because people are afraid to move forward due to the hefty charges for planning fees and other contributions.  There is a knock-on effect given that, for example, a premises would be re-rated if the owner took the initiative to expand a business, which acts as a disincentive.</P>
        <P>I am not afraid to make this point.  It may not be the proper to do so in terms of Government but we need to acknowledge the problems that exist if we are to correct them.  To achieve this, we should work through the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance to find some equitable way of funding local government.</P>
        <P>My father was in local government from 1950 and I spent 25 years in local government.  During all of that time and since, there has been ongoing debate about the funding of local government.  There is a need to examine what is happening with regard to such charges.  The appropriate recommendations for change should be brought forward, if necessary, and I believe they are necessary.  It is only by having this open and frank discussion in the Oireachtas, however, that we can look these problems in the eye and act on behalf of Ireland plc.  If we do not do so, we are the ones who will suffer at the end of the day.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Education was mentioned a number of times in this debate.  I firmly believe in the role of the educational process in fostering budding entrepreneurs and, to this end, the engagement of county enterprise boards at secondary level is essential.  It must be explained to those who are interested in entrepreneurship and have the ability to achieve it, that business is not just for somebody else, it is for everybody.  It is up to high achievers with a passion for business to become involved and do it their way.  Irish people have that understanding of business, which I have seen in play on various trade missions.  I am impressed by what such business people can do.  The Government and its agencies need to keep up with the pace of such developments, as well as understanding their demands and working with them.  Entrepreneurs <Col N="150"/>should work with colleges and county enterprise boards in order to show how it can be done.  Such interaction must take place.</P>
        <P>We sometimes refer to job losses, particularly those linked to foreign direct investment.  However, when people are employed by a dynamic, foreign company they learn a lot and upskill.  A method should be found to acknowledge the credits one can build up as a result.  Inevitably, when someone leaves a dynamic and constructive company &mdash; and they are all dynamic in how they deal with staff and approach markets &mdash; such experience can place a person at the cutting edge of the development of indigenous business.  One leaves with a different culture and mind-set, so we should acknowledge by certification the process of upskilling that takes place within such companies.  In that way, workers can bring into the work place, and within their own families, the culture of &ldquo;can-do&rdquo;, along with methods of achievement which can be put into practice in one&rsquo;s own community.  That is what it is all about.  We should examine ongoing matters in a different way.  Business has to do it and so should we.</P>
        <P>I am passionate about the role I play within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In addition, I am hopeful for continued cross-political interaction on the issues of the day.  I hope that in some way, through that interaction, we will be able to bring about some form of constructive change for the SME sector and others that make up our economy.  I thank Senators for the opportunity to address the House.</P>

    <Title>Broadband Access: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann deplores the failure of the Government to ensure broadband access in every home and business in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, for being here.  This is very serious issue and I raise it for the second time in 13 months, which is most unusual.  Broadband is one of the ignored issues of the Oireachtas.  I am absolutely staggered by the lack of interest, alarm and drive of Members of the Oireachtas when confronting this problem.  There is no sense of urgency about it among them and it is no coincidence that this House is not particularly full.  Broadband may not be a sexy subject but it is a vital one.  The attitude of successive parliamentarians is that broadband is, for some extraordinary reason, an optional extra.  They regard it as something we may or may not need.  This is far from the case.</P>
        <P>Broadband is an absolutely essential part of the infrastructure of a modern state.  I contend &mdash; I do not believe the Minister will disagree &mdash; broadband is something we simply cannot do <Col N="151"/>without.  We should be able to take it for granted by now rather than see it as an area in which we regard ourselves as perhaps a little bit behind as a nation.</P>
        <P>An unlimited number of broadband tables are issued by the EU, the OECD and various bodies to prove one thing or another.  The only common trend in them is that Ireland&rsquo;s performance in broadband is lamentable.  In every European league table I have seen, we are very low which is extraordinary for a country which is debatably the most prosperous in Europe, or is certainly the second most prosperous one<i> per capita.</i>  In the latest figures I received only today from the US Chamber of Commerce, Ireland is 15th out of 15 countries in the domestic broadband league table, which is appalling.</P>
        <P>Apologists for various Governments and telecom companies say it does not really matter about the domestic sector and that they are doing a little better in the corporate sector and are looking after business.  That is a very short-sighted and wrong way to present things because business broadband and domestic broadband cannot be separated.  Let me explain why.</P>
        <P>Many employees, particularly in the United States, but also in other countries, now work at home.  It is a trend.  They work on their own computers at home and if they do not have broadband at home, they cannot do so.  Working from home is a growing trend here and overseas, particularly for employees of multinational companies.  This is a nation which claims it is the champion of the knowledge economy.  It is now becoming the nation with the knowledge economy but which cannot transmit the knowledge.  That may work in the short term but it will not work in the long term.  If people cannot get the knowledge in time, they will not be able to do the job and will not be able to work at home.  What will happen is that foreign direct investment will start to dry up.  That has not happened yet but there are straws in the wind that multinationals are looking at Ireland and asking about broadband.</P>
        <P>I was at a dinner in London the other night with some ordinary Irish people who live there.  They are not hi-tech, young or the modern generation but the first question I was asked after the dinner was why was broadband so bad in Ireland.  The message is going out to people that we are way behind in broadband.  That message will then go out to multinationals which will realise they cannot get people to work in various places because there is no broadband penetration.  The result will be that we are damaged, although not ruined, as a nation for foreign direct investment.  There is no doubt about that.  People will look elsewhere, as they are now doing for other reasons.</P>
        <P>Lest the Minister thinks I am being alarmist, I will quote Mr. John McElligott.  I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, is <Col N="152"/>aware of this but he is meeting the senior Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the next few days.  Mr. McElligott is the head of eBay in this country.  It is a very important company in terms of hi-tech, broadband and multinationals and Mr. McElligott has done something which chief executives of most multinationals in this area will not do.  He has put his head a bit above the parapet and has said some pretty alarming things in recent weeks.  He wrote to Deputy John Cregan, the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am writing to let you know that eBay is highly concerned about the current state of our broadband connectivity in this country.  Ireland is nowhere in terms of online application usage and innovation.  This is a major missed opportunity.  With our wealth, US links and English language, we should rightly be an online hotbed.  Instead, our connectivity is holding the country back in four important areas:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />Growth of domestic internet applications and entrepreneurship</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />Inwards investment &mdash; Ireland should be attracting FDI for online applications as an ideal &ldquo;EU test market&rdquo;.  Currently we primarily attract &rsquo;offshore&rsquo; service centres</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />Regional development &mdash; connectivity provides people with a real option to work from home, and to be based outside the cities</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />Take up of great new services that area enjoyed across the EU, such as eGovernment and VOIP</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>As someone working in the online space, I see firsthand the results of this disappointing situation.  I am embarrassed [This is the head of a multinational.] to tell my peers in other countries about Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity problems.  Simply put, we require a major leap in connectivity capabilities in terms of coverage, quality and speed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">He goes on to say that our broadband situation is affecting inward foreign direct investment and will continue to do so.  The rest of the letter is along the same lines.  We ignore that sort of warning from someone at the coalface at our peril.  If we ignore that, we will see that foreign direct investment will be reduced and companies might take fright at coming to Ireland.</P>
        <P>I also spoke to the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which does not regard it as something that has an immediate impact on decisions for those who are already here.  In other words, I do not think it will mean that any of those with headquarters here will actually exit Ireland.  However, it will act as some sort of deterrent in the future as the message goes out.  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland was worried <Col N="153"/>about the message going out in a broader sense, which, in many ways, is more dangerous.  This message was that Ireland is not, in the term said to me, &ldquo;e-savvy&rdquo;.  In other words, we are wonderful in terms of language and educated young people, are not great on infrastructure but are so far behind in respect of e-generation, broadband and high technology issues.  It is in respect of being e-savvy that people from abroad should look at Ireland in a different light.</P>
        <P>The Minister should listen to bodies like the Irish Internet Association and I do not understand why Ministers do not do so.  I recently attended one of its meetings in the Mansion House which was attended by 400 people.  They represented billions of euro in investment in Internet companies and other high-technology companies here.  However, they told me that they could not even get a proper audience with Ministers who just did not listen to them.  While these people are listening to representatives of IBEC and ICTU, who presumably have some role in this, although I am doubtful about it, they will not even listen to the people with the fire in their bellies who have led and are leading the economic boom.  That is what worries me so much.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a mindset in this House and among the Government and Civil Service that broadband somehow can be put on the back burner.  I wish the Minister of State would give us a commitment tonight that within a very short period of time, he will not blame Eircom for not unbundling the loop, because that is disgraceful, but make it unbundle it.  He should not blame someone else.  The buck stops with the Minister.  If Eircom is dragging its feet, let us get it to stop.  It is in the Minister of State&rsquo;s power to do exactly that.  This is a case for Government interference and subsidy, if necessary, and for the Government to insist that every house and business in Ireland automatically has access to broadband.  If it costs money, use it.  The Government spends enough money on roads, railways and air services.  This is just as vital.  Let the Minister of State give us a commitment that, within a very short period of time, every house and business in Ireland will clearly have the access to broadband which is essential if we are to be a modern and vibrant economy.      </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am pleased to be able to second the motion and congratulate Senator Ross for again raising this issue.  He has pushed the matter time and again, as have I, but we have made very little progress.  </P>
        <P>Where does one start with this?  I will start by saying that the Government amendment is quite appalling.  The fact that, with a straight face, the Government side is asking the Seanad to com<Col N="154"/>mend the Government on its work in this area and for its determination to deliver broadband to those areas of Ireland where it is currently uneconomic is appalling.  I do not know how any serious punter on that side of the House could have allowed this amendment to go through.</P>
        <P>That is the problem, because what Senator Ross says is right.  This issue is not being taken seriously.  We spend hours here talking about competitiveness and spent two hours discussing it here today.  Twenty minutes ago, I listened to a Minister of State who was sitting where the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is now sitting.  He said that every home in this country must have broadband.  I wonder if somebody should tell him that since we sold off Eircom, we will never get it.  The day it was sold off, I said here that I could never see us getting the information superhighway, as it was then called, down to Belmullet.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>We talk about competitiveness and productivity.  Not having access to broadband is like asking workers to work with one hand manacled to the other.  I remember a night maybe 15 years ago when I met a delegation from the capital town of the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.  The delegation was full of enthusiasm and energy and represented the leading technology town in Ireland.  Ennis was showing the way.  It has been left on the back burner ever since.  After the effort the people put in to get it there, it got them nowhere.</P>
        <P>I live maybe 16 or 17 miles from here, which is the centre of power.  I cannot get broadband at home.  I tried it again this evening just to check it out and make sure nothing had happened in the meantime.  I contacted the provider who told me that no products were available in my area because it was not within its line of site.  I could nearly see the place from here if I went up high enough.  It is 20 minutes up the road in County Dublin.  It is not the Black Valley in my native county of Kerry.  I asked it to try the card coverage to see whether it had improved and discovered that there was no card coverage.  I tried the DSL, checked the line because I have Eircom land lines at home and was told that the lines did not meet the required standard for broadband.  So it is not just about unbundling.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State is aware, I am a person who has used technology every day for about 16 or 17 years.  I use it all the time.  The Minister of State will be aware that I do a podcast in his local area every week.  I have a house in a small town in rural France.  It is easier for me to send a podcast to Counties Clare and Wexford or elsewhere from a holiday home in a rural area of France than it is from my main residence in County Dublin.  There is something daft about that.</P>
        <P>The amendment congratulates the private sector.  There is nothing there.  We have had this debate before.  Senator Ross will correct me if I am wrong but I believe it is our third time debating this issue.  On a previous occasion, another <Col N="155"/>motion was tabled by Senator Ross, while before that, there was a general debate on the area.  It is shameful that nobody seems to care about it.</P>
        <P>I saw the letter from John McElligott from eBay because it received wide coverage in business newspapers some while back.  This is as important as what is happening in Dublin Castle.  The Opposition should be hopping on the Government every week about the shameful way this issue is being handled.</P>
        <P>Most of the people here represent or live in rural parts of the country.  This is killing regional Ireland.  It is hitting education in regional Ireland.  Every year for the past four years, the Government has talked about rolling out broadband to every primary and post-primary school in the country.  Most people think it has been done.  It is same problem, namely, connectivity.  Schools are not connected so our children are being held back.</P>
        <P>Do people in Government recognise that our productivity in the future will be in intellectual add-on?  We will not be making bits and pieces in factories anymore.  They can do that more cheaply in any part of the world.  It is all about intellectual add-on and the knowledge economy, as referred to by Senator Ross.  We are at the bottom of the league when it comes to the knowledge that is coming down those pipes on what we used to call the information superhighway but which we now call the World Wide Web or Internet.  We used to be proud of our position on these matters but this is no longer the case.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State wore his previous hat, he had to deal with issues like the retraining of workforces and finding new employment for the people in Shannon or elsewhere.  A major part of that involves people doing courses via broadband in order that they can retrain, build on their knowledge and get better qualifications.  The involvement of outsourcing must be also considered.  I visited a Gaeltacht area in Mayo where people wanted to set up an interpretation facility for Gaeilge in Brussels.  They had to move the facility in order to get reception.</P>
        <P>Although it is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, who I hold in high regard, the fact this issue is not important enough for the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to remember to be present is appalling.  I wish to refer to studying and working in areas outside the main metro-polises and outsourcing.</P>
        <P>The day I heard about metropolitan area networks I knew it was the most stupid decision ever made.  What were we doing?  We do not want metropolitan area networks.  Every home in the country needs broadband.  The Government should lease satellite space and soak the country in broadband.  It should be available to everyone for a reasonable price.  That could be effected with one decision.  The idea of shooting down lines, fibre optics, cutting up roads and setting up <Col N="156"/>masts is not necessary anymore because technology has moved on.  We should recognise this.</P>
        <P>There will be a row about unbundling and the quality of lines.  Eircom will not bring the quality of its lines up to DSL level because someone else will lease the line to sell the service at a cheaper rate.  There is no incentive for Eircom to do this.  The only way to improve the situation is by satellite provision immediately to every part of the country.  The Government should lease the space, give us an option and a future and bring us into the new century.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>What was decided at the meeting?  The Minister of State should give us some good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer to engage with the points made by Senators Ross and O&rsquo;Toole but it would be more informative if I deliver the script that sets out the current position.</P>
        <P>A world-class electronic communications sector is critical to our continued economic and social prosperity.  As an economy we need to ensure we take full advantage of these technological developments to remain competitive.  As a society we need to ensure we do not allow the creation of a digital divide, either socially or regionally.</P>
        <P>The provision of broadband services is a major priority for the Government.  In this context, the primary role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  The broadband market in Ireland is fully liberalised and regulated, where appropriate, by ComReg, the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s growth in broadband penetration has continued to improve during 2007.  Today, there are almost 20 service providers in Ireland offering products to more than 85% of the population through a combination of DSL, fixed wireless, cable, fibre optic, and mobile technologies.  As a result the average cost of broadband continues to fall.  According to the latest figures from ComReg at the end of the second quarter of 2007, there were 698,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland.  I am hopeful this exceptional growth has been maintained into the next quarter and I would anticipate that the number of subscribers at the end of the third quarter will be closer to the 800,000 mark, equivalent to approximately 18% of the population.</P>
        <P>To put this in context, at the start of 2005 only 3% of population were broadband subscribers and the figure stood at 7% at the start of 2006.  To achieve 18% by end 2007 is significant progress by any measure.  Recent statistics from the OECD, from October 2007, show that we have the strongest per capita subscriber growth in the OECD.  This means Ireland is catching up with other regions despite the relatively late launch of affordable and competitive broadband services in <Col N="158"/>Ireland in the early 2000s.  Moreover, Ireland has narrowed the gap behind the EU average.  At the end of the second quarter of 2006 the EU 25 average was 14 subscribers per 100 of population and our rate was eight subscribers per 100.  At the end of the second quarter of 2007, the EU 25 average was 18.2 subscribers per 100 of population and our rate was 15.4.</P>
        <P>This growth in broadband has been facilitated by the regulatory regime the Government has put in place.  The powers of ComReg have been substantially strengthened by the enactment in April of the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2007.  The Act provides for the creation of new summary, indictable and continuing offences for breaches by operators of obligations imposed by ComReg.  The Act also confers competition law powers on ComReg, similar to those of the Competition Authority, that allow it to investigate and prosecute anti-competitive behaviour or abuse of dominance in the electronic communications sector.</P>
        <P>Local loop unbundling is a key requirement to stimulate more competition in Ireland&rsquo;s broadband market and to increase broadband take-up.  Experience in other countries suggests that unbundling is a key stimulant of broadband innovation and take up.  To date the benefits of local loop unbundling have not been felt in Ireland to the desired extent because of delays in the implementation of a variety of product requirements.  Following interventions by ComReg with Eircom, and discussions between industry, ComReg and Eircom beginning in May 2007, Eircom committed to resolving all of the identified issues.  Accordingly, a new iteration of unbundling was launched in September. There are now no material issues remaining that impair the use of this product and it is up to the industry to avail of unbundling.</P>
        <P>The State has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage where the market has clearly failed.  Direct funding has been already provided under the national development plan for the provision of backbone infrastructure and to upgrade local access infrastructure.  Also, in partnership with local and regional authorities, the Government is continuing to fund the construction of high speed, open access metropolitan area networks in towns and cities nationwide.  These wholesale networks enable private sector operators to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the group broadband scheme.  The scheme, which is technology-neutral, subsidised the implementation of 127 projects in rural areas.  This range of small to medium sized service providers has supported competition using a range of different technologies.  In addition, these service providers have made use of the private and State owned regional backhaul links.  These infrastructure interventions have helped grow competition in <Col N="159"/>the regions by facilitating the introduction of new service providers to areas where none existed a couple of years ago.</P>
        <P>There are still, however, some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  The failure of the market to bridge the digital divide in specific rural areas will be addressed through the Department&rsquo;s national broadband scheme, which will provide broadband services to areas that are not currently served and ensure all reasonable requests for broadband in such areas are met.  The first phase of the procurement process for the scheme, the pre-qualification questionnaire phase, is now complete and four candidates have qualified.  As the Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Limited Consortium, Eircom Limited, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Limited and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</P>
        <P>The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  The Department is anticipating that the national broadband scheme contract will be awarded in the second quarter of 2008, with roll-out of services as soon as possible thereafter.  The broadband product to be provided under the national broadband scheme will be broadly equivalent to the tariffs and products typically available on the Irish market.  The most appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim will be decided during the competitive dialogue process.</P>
        <P>The issue of broadband availability is now close to resolution.  We must now turn our attention to the new challenges facing the market, such as improving quality and speed and further reducing costs of broadband access.  We must ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s consumers have available the most up to date and innovative products and services that are available online.  For example, as Internet content and services improve, higher connectivity speeds are needed to benefit from the activities available on-line, such as, voice over Internet, video on demand, shopping and e-mailing family photo albums across the world in real time.  The increasing volume of digital data being carried on existing networks means higher bandwidth will be required in the future.</P>
        <P>A major challenge facing the sector is the evolution of next generation broadband.  Supply must be just ahead of demand and the Department&rsquo;s policies will encourage and facilitate this.  This is not an exact science and making predictions in the technology space is difficult.  Other countries are facing the same challenges and questions as we are and, while we can look to some for lessons such as the use of ducting in facilitating broadband roll-out, we must be innovative and creative and avail of the opportunities provided by the move to next generation networks.</P><Col N="160"/>
      
        <P>The Department is preparing a draft policy paper on next generation broadband, which will review current communications infrastructure policy and analyse future policy options in light of industry developments.  This will give guidance in respect of the optimum future role for Government in the planning and roll-out of broadband.  The Minister intends to establish a national advisory forum of experts to evaluate critically the policy options contained in the draft paper.  Following that, he plans to publish the paper early next year and we would welcome views in respect of it.  He expects it will be a guide on Government thinking on next generation broadband and where we see ourselves in this space.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We need to position Ireland so that it can remain at the forefront as an alternative destination for inward investment.  Next generation broadband will be a critical element in our continuing efforts to do that.  We must anticipate consumer needs, especially those of the enterprise sector, by providing the products and services integral to a knowledge economy.  Broadband has the potential to bring about profound changes in our society and to help tackle the challenge of moving to a more sustainable world.  We are well positioned to make this transition work for us.  The move to next generation broadband provides us with a great opportunity to innovate.  Perhaps the best way to predict the future is to invent it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  I congratulate my colleagues in the Independent group on tabling this important motion.  Broadband represents the future and the Independent Senators have done a worthwhile job in bringing forward the motion which merits serious consideration.</P>
        <P>There are a number of compelling reasons the availability and use of broadband are important.  Foreign direct investment into this country is critically affected by broadband availability.  Representatives of IDA Ireland and other agencies seeking such investment indicate that one of the first questions asked by potential investors relates to the availability of broadband.</P>
        <P>The availability of broadband is as critical today as was the availability of electricity when the rural electrification scheme was initiated.  Any efforts at regional development and trying to achieve equality of growth throughout the country are contingent on the availability of broadband.  If people wish to work at home and if we want to encourage small industries to develop, it is clearly necessary.  It is vital that broadband be available if we are to encourage larger industrial interests to transfer their operations from major population centres to the regions.</P>
        <P>We live in an information age and people want to access and disperse information quickly.  It is important for students and others to be able to gain immediate access to information.  The availability of broadband also has implications for <Col N="161"/>people&rsquo;s quality of life, which is an important aspect in addition to any considerations relating to industry and enterprise.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s household survey indicates that in the first quarter of 2007, 31% of households &mdash; three out of every ten &mdash; had a broadband connection.  That figure is appalling in one sense.  It is somewhat heartening in another sense, however, because it represents a doubling of the figure for the previous year.  Overall it gives rise to concern because we must ask why two thirds of households do not have a broadband connection.  According to the survey to which I refer, 65% of households have personal computers, PCs.  This is important and encouraging because it represents a first step on the road towards the use of broadband.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that we do not want the creation of a digital divide, either socially or regionally.  I am afraid that such a divide already exists.  Recent figures indicate that the uptake in respect of the use of broadband in counties Leitrim, Cavan, Roscommon, Longford and Wexford stands at approximately 10%.  This compares with rates of 32% in Dublin and 23.7% in Kildare.  I was disturbed to discover that the figure relating to uptake in County Cavan is 9.1%.  Ireland is at the lower end among OECD countries regarding uptake or use of broadband in the home, which is terrible.</P>
        <P>The uptake and use of broadband are affected by a number of issues.  The first issue that affects the degree to which people will take up and use broadband relates to availability.  Large numbers of our population live in dispersed rural communities, particularly in the counties to which I refer.  In many areas, broadband is not available.  People cannot avail of a service if it is not being provided.</P>
        <P>The second issue of critical importance in the context of uptake relates to cost.  While Ireland has the lowest figure for uptake among OECD countries, it is a sad fact and an indictment of our approach to broadband that the price relating to connection and the maintenance thereof is the fourth highest in the OECD.  In Bailieborough, County Cavan, it costs &euro;35 per month to maintain a broadband connection.  That is a high price for many people to pay and for others it is prohibitive.  Price is, therefore, a significant disincentive in the context of broadband use.  This is a matter to which the Government must give serious consideration.</P>
        <P>The third issue to which I wish to refer relates to the fact that the speed at which information can be transferred via broadband in this country is relatively low.  Anecdotal evidence and that provided by surveys indicates that another issue &mdash; it is difficult to quantify but it is critical &mdash; that requires examination is the lack of training or competence among large numbers of the population in respect of the use of broadband.  This is obviously a disincentive in respect of obtaining and using a broadband connection.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>Just as it is incumbent on the Government to address issues relating to availability and usage, it is equally incumbent upon it to address the matter of training.  There is no evidence that the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrats Government is serious about broadband.  A sum of &euro;10 million was recently diverted from information and communications technology, ICT, projects, mainly those relating to broadband, to renewable energy grants.  The Minister of State excused this on the grounds that the broadband scheme was not yet ready for such expenditure.</P>
        <P>There is need for a more aggressive marketing strategy to encourage the take-up of broadband.  There is no investment in the budget in respect of new generation broadband.  The Minister of State referred to new generation technology but all he said was that it is being studied and examined and that position papers are being adopted.  We should be investing hard cash because action, not examination, is required.  It is salutary to bear in mind that there is 100% connectivity in Northern Ireland while the level here remains very low.  High-speed broadband is essential to the entire country.  It is almost a right at this stage.</P>
        <P>Like the Independent Senators, I appeal to the Government to withdraw the amendment.  Those in Government should raise their hands and admit that not enough is being done and that serious action is required.  If they do so, this Administration might begin to gain credibility and we could then support its efforts to take action and deal with this matter.  However, while the Government maintains this position and persists with pushing this type of amendment that suggests all is well, it should not merit support.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Senators opposite to withdraw the amendment to the motion.  I commend the motion to the House.  I congratulate my colleagues on tabling it and on the manner in which they proposed and seconded it.</P>

        <P>There is much talk of infrastructure and Senator Ross, when moving the motion, referred to our road networks and investments in that area.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole used the phraseology &ldquo;information superhighway&rdquo;, which is now not in vogue.  It is clear to us, regardless of what terminology we use, that the Internet and computer networks will be an important component of business into the future.  Commercial life, public administration and everything that goes with run<Col N="163"/>ning an economy will become increasingly dependent on the quality of the network we have.</P>
        <P>Many of us welcomed the belated investment in the improvements in our road network, the standard of which lagged behind continental Europe and the neighbouring island for many decades.  We are beginning to get on a competitive equality level with them.  That is essential.  It is also essential in this area that we have the best possible service and connectivity to ensure efficiency in business and that companies can function competitively in what is now a global economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no convincing those who do not want to be convinced.</P>
        <P>We do not have anything like the level of service required but any fair-minded person would acknowledge significant progress has been made, particularly in the past 12 to 18 months.  The Minister of State outlined that 85% of the country has broadband coverage.  That is insufficient.  The aim should be 100% coverage.  In Britain coverage is at 99.9%.  Full coverage should be our objective.</P>
        <P>I note that the 653,000 broadband subscribers &mdash; mobile broadband subscribers can be excluded from the figures for comparative purposes &mdash;  represents 15.4% of the population.  While the gap in that regard with Europe has narrowed, we are comparing ourselves with the EU-27 member states, although I note the Minister of State referred to the EU-25, perhaps Romania and Bulgaria are excluded.  With that percentage of subscribers at the end of the second quarter of <Col N="164"/>2007, we still stand 4% behind the EU average.  I suspect that if we compared ourselves with the EU-15, we probably would be even further behind that EU average.  That signals the challenge we face, which we should recognise.</P>
        <P>The OECD has shown that Ireland is in first place with regard to the strongest <i>per capita </i> subscriber growth, namely, the catch-up to which the Minister of State referred.  Broadband subscriptions now account for 63% of all Internet subscriptions.  However, I signal a note of caution in regard to these comparisons.  Only two of the 30 countries, Ireland and Australia, that are members of the OECD, match fully national data sources.  The figures from the OECD appear to count significant number of connections that are below the broadband level we have here, which is the 256Kbps.</P>
        <P>It is also necessary to examine how the comparisons are made.  If every household in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU had  broadband connection, we would be ranked 18th place in terms of broadband penetration because of vagaries within the system.  They would include our unique demographics.  We have a smaller number of households than other member states, we tend to have larger families, we have a significant rural population and lower density housing.  When all these demographics are factored in, they tend to skew the comparisons.  That must be also recognised.</P>
        <P>I note what Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said about the cost of broadband connection in Cavan.  I would have thought we tend to pay more for the service here, as we do for many services.  There tends to be an add-on cost for various service subscribers across a range of services.  However, I was surprised to learn that broadband is widely available in this country at competitive rates of &euro;20 to &euro;30 per month, according to the Department&rsquo;s figures and I have no reason not to than accept that is the case.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the reason we are lagging behind in broadband connectivity and playing catch up.  I believe the privatisation of Eircom when it happened stood in the way of making progress in this area.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight.  If we could have foreseen those difficulties, we should have rolled out broadband before privatising that company.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the local loop unbundling and reference was made to satellite connections.  In this regard, I welcome the initiative by the Minister and the Department in the procurement process for the national broadband scheme.  I understand a group will be set up to ensure it is rolled out.</P>
        <P>We should acknowledge the scheme that was put in place in 2005 to provide broadband services to all our schools.  The roll out of that scheme has had a 98% success rate.  That is significant.  The coming generation will need the use of this modern technology to make an impact on <Col N="165"/>the development of Ireland incorporated into future decades.</P>
        <P>While broadband roll-out has been slow, in recent times there has been added emphasis and that must be maintained to improve and increase the roll out.  In preparing the draft policy paper, the Department, as a matter of urgency, should bring it to a conclusion as quickly as possible in order that the national advisory forum of experts can be put in place.  That could be a significant driver in terms of the shortcomings in the system.</P>
        <P>Speaking specifically on the motion, two years ago we had 208,000 broadband subscribers, we now have 698,000.  The figure has increased by a factor of 3.5.  That represents a significant growth within a two-year period, but we need to continue the emphasis that has been placed on broadband access.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and I compliment the independent Senators on putting down this motion.  The Internet has made a fundamental change to the way we live our lives.  I was an early adopter of the Internet when I started using it in 1993.  I could tell in a few short months that my world had changed forever.  When I had broadband installed in my house four years ago, I knew that this was a further step-change in the development of the Internet.  I could see the vast improvements that this new speed made to the way we live our lives and how we interact with people.  Many of us find it difficult to keep up with all the changes, which can be daunting.  As a country, we are failing to keep up with the challenges of changing technology.</P>
        <P>I would like to talk about how far we have come in the provision of broadband access, how we compare to other countries, and the work that remains to be done.  The communications regulator made the point last May that access to broadband was unequal throughout the country.  It referred especially to the fact that access was not great in rural areas.  Half of all businesses in rural areas do not have access to broadband, not because it is not wanted, but because it is just not available.  It is very frustrating for small businesses that want to use the Internet to grow but find that, because of geographical location, they cannot avail of broadband services.  Many people and businesses have moved into areas on the expectation that they can access broadband, only to find that it is impossible to get access to broadband.  It is not fair that we should discriminate against people or businesses in rural areas.  They need access to the Internet to compete and to live their daily lives.</P>
        <P>Some of the Minister&rsquo;s response beggars belief.  He states that 15% of the population does not have access to broadband, which means that, due to density, about 35% of the country is not covered.  He later states that the average number of subscribers per hundred in the EU is 18.2 and that we are at 15.4.  He is admitting that we are <Col N="166"/>below average yet he is asking us to commend him on it.  It is a sure sign we have a dial-up Minister in a broadband age.</P>
        <P>I am one of the Members of this Chamber who happens to own a business.  It would be impossible for me to run a business today using dial-up services.  We move megabytes of data around, and we just could not survive without access to broadband.  Many companies in those sectors where we want to see growth, such as new technologies, are totally dependent on broadband, yet they just do not have it in rural areas.  While we are lagging behind, other countries are steaming ahead both in availability of broadband and the technology being offered as well.  Technology continues to advance rapidly across the world.  While we are moving slowly to provide DSL access to people and businesses in Ireland, in other countries the talk is about ADSL2 or fibre optic broadband.  In Japan, 36% of subscribers are using fibre optics to get on to the broadband network.  As a result, Japan has the best and most advanced high-speed access to the Internet in the world.  The transfer rate in Japan is 100 megabytes per second, which compares to the best in Ireland of 5 megabytes per second.  That is a twentyfold increase in the speed available for businesses in Japan.  It is shockingly low in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh stated earlier that things were great, but we are now 28th in the European league table for speed.  While the number of DSL connections in Japan continues to decrease as people take up fibre optics, here we are struggling to make sure people have access to DSL.  No doubt some day in the distant future, a Minister will come into this House and state we have now got 100% access to DSL technology, but that is not good enough.  Otherwise, a smart Alec will say we have a DSL Minister in a fibre optic age.  I would not want to see that happening.</P>
        <P>Broadband must reach people in many rural areas, but also in areas that are close to Dublin.  Broadband was turned on only six weeks ago in Stamullen, which is a village only 20 miles up the road.  We have set aside money for the metropolitan area network projects, and it was asked earlier whether this has been value for money.  I agree with the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which stated that the money would be better spent in ensuring a roll out of broadband across the country, rather than focusing on a narrow geographical area.  Last year, I led a successful campaign to introduce broadband in Stamullen, County Meath.  We were told initially by Eircom it would not have made economic sense for the company to introduce broadband.  With the help of the villagers, I managed to show Eircom that there were sufficient numbers to put in place a service.  True to his word, the chairman of Eircom, Mr. Pierre Danon, admitted that we proved the business case and promised to install a service.  It was turned on only six weeks ago.  I got an email yesterday from <Col N="167"/>a lady called Barbara, who is from the village.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I now finally have it up and running and it is great that I can now work from home two days a week, which is two days off the M1 and two days off the M50.  In my mind, anything that gets me off the M50 has to be a good thing.</P>
        <P>Broadband is not just an economic equation about whether it is justifiable for Eircom.  It brings other social benefits.  It means less congestion, lower emissions, more time at home and stronger family lives.  That is how we need to look at broadband.  It is not just about whether people can get on to an Internet connection quicker than the dial-up system; it is also about providing an essential service to people in their homes.  It is like water and electricity.  Until we treat it like that, we will not realise the benefits of broadband to the nation.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Cannon for allowing me to do this, because I have another appointment to keep.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, but I am very disappointed with the amendment, particularly its wording.  It states that it commends the Government on its positive interventions and that it continues to improve.  It seems our aim is to come in 17th.  Can anybody picture us sending a team to the Olympics with an ambition to finish 17th?  I am stunned that the Government did not submit something more positive than this.  I do not believe the Minister even looked at the amendment, because we are a disgrace.</P>
        <P>The recent opposition party in Australia &mdash; which is now in power &mdash; was in no doubt that the tardy and incomplete roll out of broadband was a severe obstacle to that country&rsquo;s progress.  The outgoing Government suffered for it and it was one of many definite reasons it lost the election.  There is no adequate broadband coverage of any kind outside the main population areas in Australia, which is rather similar to ourselves.  However, this amendment seeks to commend the Government on its positive interventions such as supporting the construction of metropolitan area networks.  We have so far to go, yet we are not getting anywhere near the finish.</P>
        <P>I welcome the motion and I commend Senator Ross on bringing it forward.  As a long-time champion of broadband, I must admit that I did not expect the motion to produce anything more than another blast of hot air from the direction of the Government benches.  For those who still do not see the light of day about broadband, I suggest they consider the Australian experience. <Col N="168"/> Just like in this country, a know-it-all government enjoyed more than 11 years of unprecedented power, yet during those 11 years it failed to grasp the reality that its country would need an effective broadband network to equip itself adequately for the future.  At the end of the day, the Australian Government paid the price for its refusal to face up to the future and its demands.  It was swept ignominiously out of power, with even the Prime Minister himself losing his parliamentary seat.  I suggest the Taoiseach be reminded of this and that it was one of three reasons the outgoing Australian Government agreed it lost power.  Is that an omen for what is in store for this country if the Government continues to compound its failure on broadband?  I suggest it bears thinking about.  The Government has failed us miserably.  Ten years ago we talked here about the opportunity and ambition to become the technology hub of Europe as Singapore was the hub of the Far East.  Now we are rated 17th out of 27 for our broadband and we are asked to commend the Government on it.  This is a great motion to have before us and I hope it will be a wake-up call for the Government.  I have every confidence that Deputy Ryan will shake us up and do something about it.  He is the right person in the right position but we must see some action.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me and I welcome the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment to the motion is a joke.  I will not repeat the points made by my colleagues.  The amendment was not thought out, but just thrown out there.  I speak on this with some knowledge as before my election to the Seanad I looked after e-business for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I am aware of the broadband issue, especially as it affects the tourism industry where people are trying to develop enterprises because the online sphere is so important to tourism.  As we all know, broadband penetration in Ireland is a joke and a disgrace.  Hopefully with the Minister at the wheel we will change this.  However, if we are to achieve this we must scrap the plan and the investment projections in place.  We must prioritise broadband, give it more emphasis, change what we are doing and invest more resources in it.  Although we will invest approximately &euro;435 million in a broadband programme up until 2013, what we are putting in place will be well out of date by then.  Mr. Kevin Thompson, chief executive of Shannon Development, says we must put in place next generation networks and I agree wholeheartedly with him.  We must invest in that and prioritise it.  According to Mr. Thompson:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland should not be playing catch-up with other countries when it comes to advances in telecommunications.  We need to be leading future development and investing in infrastructure ahead of demand.  Next generation net<Col N="169"/>works are the future.  They will help Ireland be at the leading edge of the telecommunications industry and will mean faster, more efficient and cheaper access to a growing range of broadband applications.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the forward thinking we need.  If the Minister proposed a plan which made sense and showed the level of investment and type of networks required, he would get all-party support.  This is one of the most important infrastructure priorities facing the country.  It is as important as roads.</P>

	<P>This is the highway for Ireland.  It is the future for investment and the indigenous SMEs and IT companies.  A group of entrepreneurs is going to Silicon Valley looking for investment in this country.  They have been nicknamed the &ldquo;silicon Paddies&rdquo;.  We have the education levels to attract investment in IT and industries based on it, but we do not have the infrastructure or the investment incentives through tax breaks or otherwise.  The Government has a blind spot on technology.  I listened to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s speech and it was not even a good script, whoever wrote it.  I do not know what he was saying.  It was waffle.  With manufacturing declining this is the future, and we need to prioritise it accordingly.  When people consider investing in Ireland the first question they ask is about suitable employees.  The second question is on infrastructure and broadband is the priority.  The Government claims that 698,000 people is a success.  It is successful only by the Government&rsquo;s awful standards.  We have the third worst upload and download rate in Europe.  We are ranked 17th for penetration.  People are investing in broadband for schools and that is excellent.  My nephew has a new laptop for which his mother paid &euro;1,800.  However 60% of the children who leave school have no hope of using such a laptop because there is no broadband.  That is an indictment.</P>
        <P>This Government should subsidise broadband for the country in a meaningful way.</P>

	<P>The way to get broadband into rural Ireland is obviously through a wireless network.  There are various methods of doing this, which I will not detail.  If that were prioritised and the investment made, it would be an achievement for the Minister and he would be rewarded for it.  He would get all-party support for this.  To get investment into rural Ireland and allow people the network access they deserve we must get broadband to the rural areas of this country and not focus just on Metropolitan Area Networks, MANs, in urban areas.  That would show this Government has some interest in balanced regional development.  Based on what has hap<Col N="170"/>pened, it does not.  This is a serious indictment and I hope the Government will change it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the motion.  The motion is stark and simple and is difficult to argue against in its own terms.  I suggest the motion should not be taken in terms of the historical situation, because that is as it is.  We are below average and behind where we need to be, and we need to improve our game by putting in place the communication infrastructure that will allow us to have the most competitive economy and advanced educational society possible.  The motion should not be taken in terms of how we got here and whether the right decisions have been taken.  Policy decisions have been made that can and should be argued with.  The question is whether the commitment and competence exist to make up that difference and bring us to our goal.  I am glad the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is in the Chamber because that is the question we must address.  Is there a commitment at ministerial level, led by the Department, to ensuring the Government puts in place the necessary resources and proper policy initiatives to bring us to our target in broadband and a well-developed communications infrastructure?  I argue there is.</P>
        <P>Many wrong decisions have been made.  Many points were made in this debate about the piecemeal approach and the introduction of the MAN system, whether that was the right decision and has been effective.  Most people who are informed on this will answer that it was the wrong approach and mistakes were made.  We are also dealing with the reality of decisions that were made on the main telecommunications company, once a State institution, being privatised and the fact that it was done without providing the telecommunications infrastructure we needed for the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.  We can either revisit that debate or see how present policy initiatives can change the playing field.</P>
        <P>It could be argued that mobile telephone communication was reliant on a competition approach and the establishment of an infrastructure in which the State had little involvement.  However that has led to unnecessary duplication and while there is coverage for mobile telephone use in this country and we have a higher level of mobile telephone use than other countries, we must ask why open competition has not worked in the provision of a broadband infrastructure.  There must be structural problems that prevent the private sector alone from delivering such an infrastructure.  We can examine countries of similar size and population, or smaller, that have dealt with these problems in a more advanced way than we have.  Particularly good examples are Finland, Estonia and the Scandinavian and Baltic region in general.  If they can deal with similar scale and population problems there is no reason we cannot.  Perhaps in Finland the response was <Col N="171"/>inspired by the fact that a large scale mobile telecommunications company was important for their GNP.  We lack similar companies in Ireland and we fail to push that agenda.  However, Estonia has 1.5 million people and seems to be dedicated to an e-economy.  From the ground up, through its primary education system right through to third level and among the general population there is a coverage and use of broadband and computer technology that puts Ireland to shame.  The nature of tonight&rsquo;s debate should not be about where we are &mdash; engaging in the classic Irish arguments of begrudgery &mdash; but rather about where we need to be and how we are going to get there.  It should be concerned about whether there is a consensus on how we should get there and if there is collective confidence about this.</P>
        <P>I believe the approach being taken is the correct one and that the people steering it are the right people to do so.  Either we have that faith or we do not.  Ultimately we shall divide on the issue as to whether we agree on those questions.  I suspect, as is usual on Private Members&rsquo; time, there will be a division as there tends to be every week.  That said, it is important that the debate is being held.  I am glad the issue has been raised and put in such stark terms.  The nature of the dynamic between Government and Opposition is that the former must be constantly challenged as to whether its programme is effective and if it is going in the right direction in terms of achieving what needs to be done.  I welcome this motion because we are debating an important piece of infrastructure in terms of how the country develops into the future.  I would welcome the tabling of similar motions on a regular basis in Private Members&rsquo; time to ensure Government is kept up to speed in terms of its very real responsibility in delivering on this important piece of infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate Senator Ross and the other Independent Members on tabling this motion.  I agree with Senator Boyle that somehow the tone of the motion tends to dwell on the failures of the past rather than looking to the successes of the future.  For that reason I shall support the amendment to the motion. </P>
        <P>I have been very disappointed at the lack of a proper rolling out of broadband to all of Ireland in recent years.  We are very fortunate to have as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Deputy Eamon Ryan, a man who can effect the sweeping changes we need to roll out broadband in a systematic way across the country.  The Minister has been always a vocal advocate of the rolling out of broadband and we are fortunate he holds this position.  He will be a successful Minister in providing, not just EU class, but worldclass broadband infrastructure across Ireland.  The argument that we are somehow failing globally was crystallised for me by an <Col N="172"/>article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 2 December regarding Mr. John McElligot, the chief executive of eBay, which is one of the three top Internet companies in the world, along with Amazon and Google, perhaps.  When a senior member of its management highlights the failure of Ireland to keep up globally and says he is embarrassed to speak to his peers about what has been and remains to be achieved here, that crystallises the argument completely for me.  A particularly worrying aspect of what he said was that companies with which he is familiar in the US continue to look across the Atlantic to establish bases in the EU, and until recently would have considered Ireland as one of their options.  They are now saying, however, that given its poor broadband infrastructure, Ireland is becoming less and less of an option, and they are looking elsewhere within the EU and globally.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross highlighted the issue of people working from home.  Rolling out broadband to all rural areas provides the opportunity to take people off the M50 and the M6, and they can work from home in a productive manner.  A very high class research facility located in Galway city was opened by the then Minister about a year and a half ago.  The chief executive of that company said at the launch that while he was delighted his company&rsquo;s research and development facility had been located in Galway, he had serious concerns about the lack of proper broadband infrastructure nationally.  One of the deciding factors as to where the company would locate globally was whether workers could have the choice of working from home or from the company base.  While the concerns he had over broadband infrastructure ultimately did not lose Galway the commitment from this company, it went very close to doing so.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of education and broadband.  We have been successful in rolling out broadband to all the national schools around the country, but I would question the quality, and how effective it has been.  We are fortunate in our local national school in that the principal is very innovative in the use of technology and has installed a data projector and white screen in every classroom.  It means he can use the Internet and its facilities for the education of the children.  However, he constantly complains to me about the quality of the broadband available to him.  It is a satellite link-up, consistently breaks down and the download speeds are appalling.  Imagine the potential that exists to excite children and educate them in a whole new way, and we are not availing of it.  For example, if a teacher is discussing the Colosseum in Rome with, say, fourth class, he or she can bring up Google Earth and zoom in on a satellite photograph of the Colosseum <i>in situ</i>, in the context in which it is being discussed.  If the Niagara Falls is being discussed the teacher can bring up a live webcam and show the pupils a live picture of the falls, just as they are, that minute.  That potential <Col N="173"/>is really unfathomable and needs to be examined.  The connections exist, but the quality is appalling.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s response is to consistently compare our broadband coverage and speeds with those of other EU countries.  Again, Mr. McElligot of eBay says this is not the direction in which we should be heading.  We should not be comparing Ireland with other EU countries, but with what is being achieved globally.  Senator Kelly said earlier that by the time broadband coverage is achieved nationally, the standard may well be below what is being experienced in other countries, with which we are competing for foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly spoke about the effects of broadband access on rural Ireland.  He quite rightly pointed out that the electrification of rural Ireland and the roll out of broadband are similar as regards the potential for enormous change that exists in rural society if broadband were available everywhere.  If it can be achieved across the Border in Northern Ireland within a very short space of time, I fail to understand why it cannot happen here.</P>
        <P>I conclude by wishing the Minister the very best in his new role.  I am extremely confident that we are about to see sweeping changes in the provision of broadband in the country.  I am very much heartened by the national broadband scheme and the fact we now are down to four candidates pre-qualified for that process, who are about to engage in competitive dialogue.  I am hoping we will see sweeping changes in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I should like to share time with Senator Pearse Doherty and I shall take only a couple of minutes.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to the House and wish him the very best in his portfolio.  I have no doubt he is very interested in the present debate.  I compliment Senator Ross and the Independent Senators on tabling the motion.  Senator Ross made the point that a very similar motion had been tabled about 12 months ago, and this shows how little has been done since.  I am very disappointed at the Government&rsquo;s response to the motion.  It should withdraw the amendment because it is an insult to the motion tabled by the Independents since very little has been done in the past year as regards broadband. </P>
        <P>As a latecomer to the Internet, I see it as the new superhighway, the place where everyone has to be.  Parts of this country are at a major disadvantage from an industrial viewpoint, in terms of setting up enterprises.  They urgently need access to broadband.  Senator Walsh said that 85% of the people had broadband.  Yet the Minister of State, Deputy Terry Killeen, in his contribution claimed that only 18% were paid-up broadband customers.  Large gaps exists between what the Government states and what Government Senators state.  We are all aware of the reality of the poor take up of broadband.  The reasons for <Col N="174"/>the poor take up are that it is not available and it is expensive.  I agree with Senator Kelly that the Government should subsidise broadband.  Many people on low incomes could do with such a subsidy.  It is the new information superhighway and it is badly needed.</P>
        <P>Many places avail of conference calling to all parts of the world.  However, without broadband a large area of the country is at a major disadvantage.  People fly to hotels in Ireland to take up conference calls and one should be able to do this in every corner of the country.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister ask the Government Senators to withdraw the amendment?  I support my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, who stated that the only way forward is to go forward together and for the Government to withdraw its amendment.</P>
        <P>Northern Ireland has had major success in providing broadband throughout the length and breadth of the Six Counties.  This was done through its old post office structure.  The Minister should examine our post office system and use it or the old exchanges to bring broadband to the most rural parts of the country.  I have no doubt it can be done here in the same way as it was done in Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Paddy Burke as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  I commend the Independent Senators on bringing this motion before the House.  It is timely and apt to discuss this motion after having had a discussion on the supports necessary for small and medium enterprises to flourish in a modern Ireland.  A key element for any business to flourish and develop is the provision of broadband.  A number of years ago we would have considered the provision of broadband as a luxury.  Today, it is as necessary as running water or electricity to businesses and individuals.</P>
        <P>The Government has not taken this issue seriously.  An OECD report shows we are listed 22nd in terms of broadband penetration.  Other reports show broadband here is more expensive than in other countries and that the type of broadband we have available is of an inferior quality to that in neighbouring countries.  While we all seek our own slice of the pie in an expanding Europe, it is important that we are able to compete at an international level.</P>
        <P>Not only have we failed with regard to delivering broadband to the island of Ireland, we also have an east-west divide in terms of broadband penetration.  A report issued from AMAS shows the digital divide.  According to the 2006 census statistics, the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford and Cavan all have less than 10% broadband penetration.  This is not acceptable in the 21st century.  If we examine the statistics on poverty and unemployment, these counties also have the highest percentage of unemployment.  A direct connection exists between the provision of basic infrastructure such <Col N="175"/>as broadband and the fact that businesses are not able to survive or flourish in today&rsquo;s environment.</P>
        <P>Over a series of months, I was approached by three individuals in Donegal who wish to establish in their own homes businesses which would rely on communications through the broadband network.  They are hampered in doing so because the service does not exist.  It is available in some places but not in the areas in which people require it.  Working mothers who wish to work from home and come off the live register cannot do so because broadband is not available.</P>
        <P>An individual wishes to establish a company and employ people but he cannot access broadband in the location at which he wishes to establish his business.  A woman in west Donegal works with an American industry on the American clock.  She can provide the service from her home but because broadband is not available she must travel ten miles in the middle of the night and rent out accommodation in a town which costs her money.  We have not done enough.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Government parties to withdraw the amendment and to recognise that not enough has been done.  This boils down to the privatisation of Eircom.  We had it within our grasp to roll out broadband on a national basis but we decided to allow venture capitalists to make money on the back of Eircom instead of considering the national interest in providing a broadband backbone throughout the Twenty-six Counties.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to the Chamber.  I am delighted to see him here because, from a personal point of view, I have admired the new, fresh approach he has taken since his appointment when considering the issues of communications and energy.  He is like a breath of fresh air for the Department and I wish him luck.  He certainly has the support of this side of the House.</P>
        <P>I wish to put a number of points in context.  Four years ago, approximately 30,000 people in the country subscribed to broadband.  By the end of December, this figure will be 700,000.  In any<Col N="176"/>body&rsquo;s outlook, this is a major progressive leap and it must be welcomed.  It was stated that little was done during the past year but the facts do not reflect this.  The facts outline that during the first quarter of 2006, approximately 320,000 people subscribed to broadband nationally and in the final quarter of 2006, this figure was approximately 500,000.  The increase to 700,000 by the end of this year represents a jump of 200,000 in the space of one year.  This is not a lack of progress and neither does it outline that nothing has been done.  It is a clear indication that broadband reaches members of the public who wish to avail of the service.</P>
        <P>The facilitation of broadband coverage throughout the entire country is a key priority for the Government.  It is reflected in the programme for Government and has been discussed repeatedly by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Independent Senators tabled this motion because it gives us an opportunity to raise broadband issues in a favourable manner or to raise concerns.  Broadband must be central to the Government&rsquo;s priorities because it is important for driving the economy and providing world-class telecommunication infrastructure to homes in all parts of Ireland, whether it is used for small businesses or primary, secondary, third level or fourth level education.  It is important that we have these facilities readily available.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="8" />
        <P>Initially, the Government moved on the national group broadband scheme.  While this was welcome at the time, unfortunately the uptake was low.  There are probably a number of reasons for this, including the complicated, awkward nature of the scheme in the sense that the onus was on individual communities to come together, organise an application and work with providers and the Department.  I am pleased the Department moved quickly to address this problem by rolling out the national broadband scheme, which will deliver a broadband service to the remaining 10% to 15% of the country where broadband is not available.  The new scheme will assist many rural areas and I understand four companies have either tendered to roll it out or are being considered for this purpose.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.</P>
        <P>It is argued that the schemes should operate in parallel.  This would undermine the effectiveness of both schemes and lead to double subscriptions.  It is important, therefore, to proceed with the national broadband scheme.  Of the grant aid of &euro;5.9 million available under the first scheme, the group broadband scheme, only &euro;1.4 million has been drawn down to date.  It is a matter for providers to ensure their claims are submitted to the Department.</P>
        <P>Despite Government and private sector investment in broadband, the private sector is unable to fully justify the commercial provision of broadband in a number of areas.  The new broadband scheme will aim to provide broadband services to <Col N="177"/>areas without coverage.  Some counties, including County Donegal, are proceeding with an innovative scheme, which works on a cross-Border basis to provide wireless broadband to many areas.  Donegal County Council in association with the ERNACT network is progressing the scheme, which will cost between &euro;1.2 million and &euro;1.43 million and deliver broadband in the Border and maritime areas of the county, including Gweedore, Aranmore Island, Glencolmcille, Castlefinn, St. Johnston and Lifford, by the end of December.  Full co-operation from the Department has been forthcoming to ensure the scheme succeeds.  While teething problems have arisen, I understand the project is progressing and wireless broadband coverage will extend to 99% of the area covered by the scheme.  The cost is relatively low and there will be considerable advantages in terms of attracting inward investment to some of the most geographically isolated areas of the west.</P>
        <P>While I understand some of the concerns raised by Senators, we must work together to ensure the Minister and his Department are allowed to roll out the broadband scheme, as agreed in the programme for Government.  I have full confidence that this will be the case.</P>
        <P>The cost of broadband may concern consumers.  As Senators are aware, broadband services have become very affordable with prices to the consumer now below the European Union average.  Broadband is widely available at between &euro;20 and &euro;30 per month, as a combination of competition and regulation drives prices down.  Ireland&rsquo;s current low ranking in the take-up league table for broadband is the result of the launch of the DSL service by Eircom being delayed by approximately 18 months and the lack of competition from cable broadband.</P>
        <P>While I had major concerns about Eircom&rsquo;s ability to roll out broadband, the company appears to have woken up in the past six to months and its roll-out programme for providing broadband services in rural towns and villages is working in many areas.  Many small towns and villages have access to broadband because Eircom decided to roll out the service, for which it is ultimately responsible.  The Government has intervened to provide additional assistance where it is not economically feasible for a private company to deliver a service.</P>
        <P>The Minister should ensure there is competition in the market for all consumers in all areas in order that prices for broadband remain competitive and are not increased. When the national broadband scheme is rolled out, broadband services will be available and will help people in many rural areas to avail of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Henry McGarvey, an entrepreneur with Donegal links who was working for a large company in the United States contacted the IDA when he decided to establish a unit of his company&rsquo;s operations in County Donegal.  As a result of his initiative, almost 600 jobs were created in <Col N="178"/>the county.  Several weeks ago, Mr. McGarvey spoke at a breakfast conference in the Shelbourne Hotel, a diaspora project aimed at attracting people to return to County Donegal.  In his address he noted that the quality of the broadband service in areas of County Donegal, including Letterkenny and other towns, was better than that available in upstate New York.  I commend the Minister and his Department.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Ross.  I will respond to Senators for two or three minutes. </P>
        <P>The key point in the Government amendment is that the position in regard to broadband continues to improve.  It is difficult to believe someone would question that statement given the statistics available to us.  While I am aware that figures can be used in different ways, the bald statistics show that at the start of 2005, 3% of households had broadband.  At the start of 2006, the figure had increased to roughly 7% and, depending on the measure used, 15.5% of households had broadband access by mid-2007.  If one includes, mobile access, the figure is closer to 17%.  In recognising this improvement we must not rest on our laurels because further progress is necessary.</P>
        <P>I commend the authors of the motion on instigating this debate on crucial infrastructure for the social and economic development of the country.  The question for debate is how we will hasten ongoing improvement in broadband.  This is a complex area on which one cannot make snap or easy judgments.  It is a fast-changing sector in which a range of different technologies can be applied, including 3G, wireless and fixed line, the last of which includes a variety of methods for delivering service to customers.  One of the reasons Ireland lags behind other countries is the absence of competition in the market.  Following the sale of the State telephone company, the privatised company, for a variety of reasons, did not invest in its network and the development of broadband.  At the same time, the cable network was experiencing difficult times and little investment was made in the network.  Our poor performance was due to this lack of competition.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons for recent improvements is that we are entering a more competitive phase, which I welcome.  I will encourage, support and develop this process, not only with regard to the <Col N="179"/>cable company and incumbent telephone company &mdash; this would only create competition in urban areas where two thirds of the population live &mdash; but also with regard to wireless, 3G, satellite and other technologies to ensure the dispersed, less accessible rural population secures access to broadband services.  It is not easy to run a fibre to every single farmhouse in the country.  It is easier to do that in Japan as people live in apartments and one can run a fibre right up through a 20 storey building at much reduced costs.  We have different circumstances but we have the potential to deliver different solutions that provide higher speed.</P>
        <P>The issue is about percentage cover to the country but we have to move on from that.  Through the use of the national broadband scheme we cannot have a situation where any house in the country is left behind.  We must have ubiquitous all-round broadband approval.  I hope that is one of key improvements on which we are able to deliver in 2008.  We move then to the issue of bandwidth and the issue of price.  We must ensure we have a much higher bandwidth and lower costs.  The current position where many of us are paying a mobile phone bill, a fixed line rental bill and a broadband bill is intolerable.   We should ensure, through encouraging competition between those different operators, all of whom are very profitable and have large capital resources, they battle to get our services and in those circumstances bring the price down and the bandwidth up.  That is the key development.  I will not rule out any suggestion any wise Senator may have as to how we encourage that, be that State investment or by means of regulation.  We should recognise we are improving but we need to go much further.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government&rsquo;s amendment in that regard recognising the reality locally and recognising our aspirations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for putting in a pretty unorthodox performance.  I have never known two Ministers to address the House on any issue of Private Members&rsquo; Business but he is welcome to do so.</P>
        <P>I am not happy with the response.  The overwhelming flavour of the response was one of complacency.  What I find so extraordinary, not about the terms of the amendment because Governments do those sorts of things and consider they have to, is that the defence that has been put in has been one that we are improving.  Of course, we are improving.  One cannot do anything but improve if one has such a diabolical performance to begin with.  This time last year when we tabled a similar motion the figures were staggeringly bad.  I am sorry I did not research the Minister&rsquo;s reply of this time last year.  I read some of the debate but I did not read the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  Today the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, said:</P><Col N="180"/>
        <P LI="1">To put this in context, at the start of 2005 only 3% of the population were broadband subscribers and the figure stood at 7% at the start of 2006.  To achieve 18% by the end of 2007 is significant progress by any measure.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Of course it is progress.  It is a multiple of six but it is still a diabolical performance and it should be an awful lot better but it is not.  I will not quote the statistics the Minister&rsquo;s deputy quoted earlier but on every statistic we are lagging far behind virtually every modern economy in the world and we are congratulating ourselves on doing that because we are not lagging as far behind as we were previously.  This is playing the statistics in a way that is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The message has gone out and we are getting it back, not just from Mr. McElligott, head of eBay, who has been quoted widely because he was quoted in the newspapers, but on a quieter basis from multinationals around the world, especially US firms, that Ireland is not e-savvy, so to speak.  That is the most dangerous message that could possibly go out.  It is going out because it is justified, not because it is unjustified.  To say we have improved a little just clouds the issue of where we are in the stark statistics.  We were so bad previously and we are still very bad.  That is the reality.  We have not seen the sense of urgency I wanted to see in this debate.  Instead we have celebrated mediocrity.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of this and, to some extent, it is difficult for him because he is defending a regime which existed before him.  One cannot expect him in six months to have righted the wrongs of what went before.  I was disappointed that when he replied he gave us no facts, figures or targets.  The future, as he said, is what is important.  I was struck by what Senator Callanan said but he is caught in a hole.  He is on our side but he must vote the other way.  It is pretty obvious and it often happens and he is very skilful at doing it.  That is fine and let him vote the other way.</P>
        <P>What the Minister&rsquo;s reply lacked were facts, figures, targets and commitments.  This debate has been noteworthy, not just tonight but always, in that Government&rsquo;s replies have been aspirational.  The tenor is that we hope we will be able to do this, we should do the other and this is what we ought to do.  What I was hoping to hear from the Minister was a commitment that we will be in an all-Ireland situation, as mentioned by Senator Burke, by this time next year or at the end of 2009, that the funds and the political will will be in place to do that and that he will not come back to the House with the same story in two years&rsquo; time when I table this motion again.</P>
        <P>I am not quiet so enamoured of the commitments made about next generation broadband.  The Minister is right and he recognises the importance of it.  We have lost the last generation.  We have just lost that battle.  We are so far behind we are just playing catch-up and we will probably <Col N="181"/>never catch up properly.  Next generation is important but it is dangerous to say we are preparing a draft policy paper on that issue &mdash; it is too late to do that &mdash; and that we are setting up a national advisory forum of experts.  We have heard all this before.  I can do without the experts, the forums and the advisers.  Let us have decisions.  Let us simply get down to it and do it now.  That is what I had hoped to see in this <Col N="182"/>debate and that is why I will call for a vote.  That is why I find the attitude of Government and its members is not convincing.  It is apologetic.  I do not think they are convinced of it themselves.  At the end of the day we need commitments and we need to vote against the Government simply and solely to give it a reality check.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I appreciate the opportunity of raising this issue.  The Le Ch&eacute;ile Educate Together School was established six years ago on the grounds of Drogheda grammar school on Mornington Road, just outside Drogheda facing the River Boyne.  In recent years the school has grown to accommodate a student population of 325, which is 50% higher than that of Drogheda grammar school whose site it occu<Col N="182"/>pies.  During the past six years it has been housed in prefabricated buildings and still does not have a permanent structure.  I visited the school yesterday and although we are not yet in the depths of winter, all the staff still had their coats on because heat was escaping from non-insulated rooms.  In addition, damp patches were coming up through the floors.  In 2007, it is a bit much to ask teachers and children to put up with such conditions.  It is only because of the staff&rsquo;s dedication that the children&rsquo;s education is not suffering.</P>
        <P>Apart from the vast cost of renting 19 prefabricated units from a private company, the heating bills are excessive because of heat loss through non-insulated walls.  In addition, no economic analysis has been carried out to see whether or not it would be better to build a new school now and be done with it.  If we compared the cost of a new school to the cost of renting temporary buildings with heat loss, it would make more sense for the Minister to put a new school in place.  Earlier this year it was hoped that a new school would be built because, after much toing and froing, the Department managed to purchase the site.  At that time, all the parents and teachers <Col N="183"/>thought a permanent school was just around the corner, but nothing has happened since then.  Meanwhile, there has been a deafening silence from the Department.  The priorities for school buildings seem to have suddenly changed.  Priority now seems to be focused on schools around the Dublin region to the detriment of schools further outside the capital, such as the proposed permanent Le Ch&eacute;ile one.</P>
        <P>Years ago we had cutbacks and spending freezes, but now we have the Orwellian concept of changes to a school&rsquo;s priority banding.  That is how we get round the terminology.  As a result of those changes, however, children and teachers are losing out because they are causing more delays.  In this case, for example, it means some children will not be able to join their brothers and sisters there next autumn because no permanent school building is in place.  Some 197 children are already on the enrolment list for 56 places at that school.  Every place there is oversubscribed by four to one.  If that is not a priority, I do not know what is.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State two simple questions.  I know he is provided with a response that is probably three or four pages long and which possibly will not give me the answer, although I hope I am wrong about that.  My first question is when will the building work commence no the school?  Second, when will it be finished?  That is all I need to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Hannigan for raising this matter to which I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  It gives me an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the extent of the work which will be carried out under the school building and modernisation programme in the coming years and, in this context, the position with regard to the Le Ch&eacute;ile Educate Together School on Mornington Road, Drogheda.</P>
        <P>At the outset I want to say that modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under investment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme from just over &euro;90 million when we first came into office, to &euro;600 million this coming year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in <Col N="184"/>schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Next year alone, some &euro;600 million will be invested in large-scale building projects concentrated mainly on providing school accommodation in rapidly developing areas.  This level of funding will facilitate a phased roll-out to the construction of over 350 projects throughout 2008 and early 2009 that will, when complete, provide another 12,000 permanent places.  It will facilitate the completion of construction on up to 200 projects to provide over 8,000 additional school places.  It will also enable the purchase of sites for the smooth delivery of the school building programme, with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas, and the progression of further projects through the architectural planning and design stages.</P>
        <P>The &euro;4.5 billion being made available under the NDP will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State.  It will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where needed, as well as continuing to upgrade existing school facilities.  This investment will allow the Department to continue the acceleration of the school building programme, which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP when well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</P>
        <P>The Le Ch&eacute;ile Educate Together national school opened with provisional recognition in September 2001.  It was granted permanent recognition in September 2002.  The school is currently located in prefabricated classrooms on the grounds of Drogheda grammar school.  The long-term needs of the school have been assessed and agreed with the school authority.  It is proposed to build a 16-classroom school on a site recently purchased from the Drogheda grammar school.</P>
        <P>The project has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects and has been assigned a band 1 rating.  Further progress will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building programme, the focus of which is on developing areas, such as those in the east Meath area.  I will convey to the Minister for Education and Science the specific questions raised by Senator Hannigan.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House.  My concerns are based on building projects under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, and particularly Athlone Community College.  Those concerned with this fine school &mdash; including its pupils, parents, the CEO and committee of West<Col N="185"/>meath VEC, the board of management and staff &mdash; are seeking clarification on a starting date for the new school building.  It was promised well over a year ago and has a priority 1 rating.</P>
        <P>After the completion of a feasibility study in 2002, which was commissioned by Westmeath VEC at considerable cost, it was recommended that a new school should be built.  After lengthy discussions, Westmeath VEC purchased lands in Athlone for the new school.  The VEC was informed by the Department of Education and Science that the school would be built in record time, as design templates were in place for such projects.  The Department further encouraged parents, pupils and staff by engaging them in the design of the new facility.  Updates were sought and provided and until recently everything looked positive.  The VEC committee was led to believe that it was simply a matter of tendering for the design team.  The executive and the principal even had an information evening, including a powerpoint presentation, to outline the timescale, stages and procedures.  A PSD was also put in place to liaise and advise on how to appoint this said design team.</P>
        <P>However, the position is now less than clear.  Responses from the Department are infrequent and the impression is being given that this project may not be as important as others in Dublin, which Senator Dominic Hannigan also mentioned.  I hope this is not the case as provision of education facilities is fundamental to the growth of Athlone as a town in the midland gateway.</P>
        <P>For well over 12 months until July of this year, this project was on course.  Since July, only one month after the general election, communications have virtually ceased.  The communications which take place are mixed.  For example, in July, the chief executive officer of Westmeath Vocational Education Committee wrote to the school planning and building section in Tullamore responding to a letter that outlined the schedule of overall accommodation for the proposed new school.  In this letter, the CEO thanked the school planning and building section for the speed in progressing the project, as it had been very efficient up to this point.  The CEO observed that the total floor area of 8,168 sq. m was less than adequate for a school of 1,000 pupils and the space both externally and internally in terms of playing pitches and parking was inadequate.  There were not enough parking places for teachers, not to mention ancillary staff and pupils.  The floor space does not compare to other school projects recently completed around the country.  On a <i>pro rata </i>comparison, I understand the floor area should be of the order of 9,400 sq. m.</P>
        <P>After this letter had been sent, a meeting was requested by the CEO and the principal.  This meeting eventually took place after some time and was convened in the offices of the VEC in Mullingar.  The CEO and the principal had a very focused agenda but the officials from the planning and building section had a completely differ<Col N="186"/>ent one.  The new secondary school for Athlone Community College was not the issue.</P>
        <P>On behalf of those whose heart is set on this new school, I implore the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, to speak to the Minister for Education and Science and encourage her and the Department to proceed with this very worthwhile project.  I acknowledge the amount of money which has been spent on capital projects in Athlone.  The Our Lady&rsquo;s Bower secondary school is nearly completed and I acknowledge the &euro;600 million that has been allocated.  However, because Athlone Community College is a band 1 priority, it should also be included.</P>

	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  I thank Senator Nicky McFadden for raising this matter as it provides me the opportunity to outline to the House the broader actions being taken by the Department of Education and Science to identify and address the long-term educational needs of the Athlone area and the position in regard to the building project for Athlone Community College in particular.</P>
        <P>In regard to Athlone generally, the school planning section of the Department has identified the town as an area of rapid development and, consequently, it is currently examining its future educational infrastructural needs at both primary and post primary level.  The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process.  In this way, every effort is made to ensure there is adequate existing provision and that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.</P>
        <P>In addition, local authorities are obliged by statute to refer draft local area development plans to the Department for observation and comment so that lands can be zoned for future education use.  There are numerous sites reserved for education purposes, particularly in the rapidly developing areas, under this process to ensure that there will be sufficient land set aside and available for the future development of education infrastructure.  Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in regard to local authority draft area development plans, the Department of Education and Science has, in recent years, worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden may be aware that the programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a developing areas unit in the Department of Education and Science and I am pleased to inform her that this unit has now been <Col N="187"/>established.  It is located in Tullamore and forms part of the Department&rsquo;s planning and building division already based in that location.  The unit will be solely dedicated to progressing school planning in rapidly developing areas building on improvements that have already been made in school planning in recent years.  Staff in the unit will liaise with local authorities, identify where new schools are needed and ensure they are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the exercise being carried out for Athlone will be completed shortly and the outcome will be the blueprint for educational infrastructure in the area for the foreseeable future.  Naturally, the type of exercise referred to takes take time and there are immediate needs which have to be addressed in tandem.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>In this regard, a decision has already been taken to replace and expand the existing Athlone Community College.  The new building, when complete, will cater for 1,000 pupils.  The project has advanced to the point where schedules of accommodation have been drawn up.  These were issued for observations to the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee and its response in this regard is being considered in the Department.  Once the schedules are finalised the commencement of the architectural planning and design process will be considered under the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  I thank the Senator again for raising this matter.</P>
