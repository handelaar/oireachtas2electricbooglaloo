	<P>I have received notice from Senator MacSharry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure existing cancer care services at Sligo General Hospital are maintained and improved to include a satellite centre for radiotherapy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline if she intends publishing the independent report carried out on Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s application for university status and her views on its content and recommendations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Boyle of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to confirm that recent changes in Government policy have made incineration a diminished waste disposal method.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator McCarthy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to furnish a report on the up-to-date progress of the much promised and long overdue sewerage scheme in Skibbereen, County Cork; and when he expects the work to be completed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene in the case of a South African citizen, name supplied, who has applied for citizenship for himself, his <Col N="478"/>wife and his daughter each of whom are being processed inexplicably on a different timescale.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport and the Marine to discuss, with his ministerial counterpart in the Assembly, a direct Dublin to Derry train service and to outline the impediments, if any, that currently exist which would hinder such a service from being realised.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the action she is taking to ensure resources are being allocated to the ambulance services given the revelation that due to EMT and advanced paramedic staffing shortages, an embargo on recruitment and changes in the admittance levels to hospitals, ambulance personnel are working long hours.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators MacSharry, Coffey and Boyle and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators McCarthy, Norris, Keaveney and Kelly may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the national drugs strategy, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 11, motion re crime, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes.  Senators may share time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very enthusiastic Seanad today.  I am sure Members wish to mark the announcement by the Pope of his intention to appoint Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady, Primate of All Ireland, to the College of Cardinals.  I extend sincere congratulations to Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady.  It is a recognition of his stable leadership and his contribution to the peace process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Anne Enright on winning the Man Booker prize.  We are proud of her superb achievement.  While Ms Enright is celebrating a victory in literature, another woman, Ms Susie Long, is not with us.  Many Members saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night.  It was heartbreaking to see the husband, in his grief, hoping that what she exposed about the health service will make a difference and bring forward the debate on public and private health systems. <Col N="479"/> Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party must ask if they are 100% in support of the headlong rush into privatisation by the Progressive Democrats Minister for Health and Children.  The consequences were dramatically and poignantly illustrated in the case of Ms Long.</P>
        <P>We have already asked the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance to the House for a debate on budgetary matters.  In that regard, I note a disturbing, although not unexpected, development where a series of repossession orders for family homes have come before the High Court.  Several judges, somewhat unusually, have raised concerns about the way these cases have been dealt with by the banks and various mortgage lenders.  Several disturbing aspects of these cases have been reported.  It is, therefore, appropriate to repeat the request for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance to address the House prior to the budget on the economic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to be associated with the congratulations expressed to Anne Enright.  It was the first time in many years that the Booker Prize was not televised live.  I thought last night's RTE programme &ldquo;The View&rdquo; would have changed its format to show the ceremony but unfortunately it did not.</P>
        <P>It is certainly an honour to Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady to be elevated to Cardinal.  Some years ago, I recall meeting the then Bishop of Clogher, Bishop Francis McKiernan, when he was thinking of retiring.  To take over his diocese, he told me, he had pulled back from Rome, a bright young man, Se&aacute;n Brady, who knew his way around there.  Some years later, when Se&aacute;n Brady was moved to Armagh, Bishop McKiernan said the papal nuncio had robbed his best asset.  Se&aacute;n Brady has gone the full distance today.</P>
        <P>Last week I entertained some Members with my comments on food quality.  I want to give them another laugh today.  This is a serious issue and I call again for a debate on the matter.  I met the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with responsibility for food and horticulture, Deputy Sargent, who was enthusiastic to debate the matter in the House.  Apart from the issue of mutton which I raised last week, I want to know where we stand on Brazilian beef imports.  The farmers are right on this one and I want a debate on it.</P>
        <P>This week the Minister of State is at an exhibition in Frankfurt telling the world how good our food is, for which I wish him good luck.  I want a debate on pesticides and chemicals used in vegetable cultivation.  The country has a large mushroom industry with hundreds of thousands of tonnes sold domestically and exported every year.  However, the number of mushrooms tested annually to ensure quality assurance is a meagre ten.  In the case of leeks, one solitary specimen is tested for quality assurance.  To some this may seem unimportant but we are what we eat.  As we <Col N="480"/>want to be the granary and garden of Europe, it is necessary for a debate on the quality assurance of our foodstuffs.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explain to the House what he is doing with ainm an Daingin, Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is?  Cad t&aacute; ar si&uacute;l ag an Rialtas faoi seo?  Cheapas go raibh plean acu chun an ainm a athr&uacute; thar n-ais agus cearta daonna a thabhairt do mhuintir Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  Cad t&aacute; ar si&uacute;l acu?  Cad t&aacute; ar aigne acu ag an bpointe seo?  Ba mhaith liom freagra a chloisint.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was wonderful to see Anne Enright win the Man Booker prize for her novel, <i>The Gathering</i>, the second Irish author to win the prize in the past three years.  It shows again what a great nurturing ground we are for literary talent.  It is important not to forget the words of the former US President, Bill Clinton, that literacy is not a luxury but a right and a responsibility.  In some of our more disadvantaged areas, child illiteracy levels stand at 27%.  It is incumbent on us as a nation to tackle this.  The right to read campaign will hold a conference on this subject on Saturday which I encourage Senators to attend.  The campaign wants more funding to be allocated to ensure longer opening hours of libraries and more literacy campaigns.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to provide more funding for this important issue?</P>
        <P>Quarrying concerns many residents in the fast-growing urban areas of counties Louth, Meath, Kildare and Dublin.  All accept the need for quarries in feeding materials for the construction boom and their importance in being located close to sites where such materials are needed.  However, quarrying and quarries can have an impact on the lives of those who reside near them.  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that residents in Fettercairn outside Tallaght are concerned at the effect the quarry there is having on respiratory illnesses such as asthma and wheezing.  From talking to parents in Bellewstown, County Meath, I know they are concerned about trucks running past schools at all hours of the day.  My colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, has informed me there are problems in Naul, County Dublin, with trucks coming from quarries.</P>
        <P>I would like to see a complete review of section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  It was brought in seven years ago and has worked well in parts.  Its purpose is to register quarries and to lay down regulations on how they operate.  Perhaps the Minister might address the Seanad about reviewing the Act to see what has worked since it was introduced and what needs to be changed so that we might improve life for residents living near quarries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the words of congratulations to Cardi<Col N="481"/>nal-elect Se&aacute;n Brady on his accession and to Ms Anne Enright for winning the Man Booker prize.  Ms Enright&rsquo;s success, in particular, is notable, given that she is the third Irish author to win this prestigious award in a number of years.  The prescience of the Arts Council, too, is noteworthy for distributing copies of the book to Members of the Oireachtas in the last week.  It must have known something the rest of us did not.</P>
        <P>I have one suggestion for a possible debate.  Just an hour ago the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, launched the Green Paper on pensions and there is to be a consultation period which is to conclude in the middle of 2008.  It would be in order for this House to use that consultation period for a wide-ranging debate to help inform that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader say whether the House should draw any conclusions from the re-ordering of the positions of both the Privacy Bill and the Defamation Bill on the Order Paper?  Heretofore, the Privacy Bill tended to appear in preferential order to the Defamation Bill.  Is it intended to drop the Privacy Bill altogether from the Order  Paper?  When is it proposed to take one or the other of Bills or both of them?  Will the Leader clarify in what order the Government intends to proceed in that area and on the issue of the press council?</P>
        <P>I would like to support what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about Dingle, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, An Daingean.  We all understood a commitment was given in this regard.  The Official Languages (Amendment) Bill is No. 6 on the Order Paper.  The Government may have a plan and, in the event, we would like to hear what it is.  We believe this matter was in the process of being resolved.  It was raised yesterday in the D&aacute;il and I would like to hear about it from the Leader.</P>
        <P>Last week the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government pledged his support, in principle at least, for the electronic voting system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he did not.</P>

	<P>Was he not in favour of it, in principle?</P>

	<P>That is not what he said.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan on the Order of Business, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is that we have had a commission on electronic voting which came out rather strongly against it, as I recall, on the basis that here was no paper trail and further checks and safeguards were very much needed.  We are all aware of the &euro;52 million in capital costs and the enormous daily and weekly storage costs.  I would like to hear from the Leader whether it is intended to proceed with electronic voting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be in the debate if the Leader agrees to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>At a minimum, can we at least have a debate in the House on the subject?  I understood, perhaps wrongly, that the issue was being examined within the Department on the Minister&rsquo;s instruction.  I therefore call for a debate on the matter in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will reply to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to address the Seanad prior to legislation being introduced for the mandatory testing of people involved in accidents?  Alcohol is a contributory factor in many accidents but the main factor, which is beginning to emerge, is drugs.  Recreational drugs are becoming part of the problem.  Would it be possible to have a discussion with the Minister prior to the preparation of the legislation to ensure it covers drugs and also to debate the position on prescribed drugs which can have an adverse effect on people&rsquo;s driving habits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be one of the first times we have had two cardinals in Ireland.  To the best of my knowledge, this has not happened before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Three actually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry; I did not realise that.  I congratulate Cardinal Brady.</P>
        <P>I refer to Anne Enright&rsquo;s wonderful award and wish to correct Senator Boyle.  To the best of my knowledge, there have been four Irish winners of the prize, including John Banville, Roddy Doyle and, I understand, Iris Murdoch, who claimed to be Irish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I was talking about the last two years.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="483"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to correct Senator O&rsquo;Toole who mentioned the food fair in Frankfurt last week.  It was actually in Cologne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  I was at the opening ceremony on Friday night and on Saturday.  It was a huge fair and the Irish did so well and had such an impact.  It would be very worthwhile, therefore, to have a debate, not on agriculture but on food.  It is a reminder of the great food we produce and which is on display but also of the fierce competition in the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader consider a debate on parenting and marriage?  I mention this because recently I had the opportunity to visit a residential home for young people and was very impressed by the commitment and personal touch of those involved.  However, I was also startled by the figures we saw last week on the number of children under ten years of age who have been in residential homes for more than five years.  There is a great need to have regard to the benefit of home and family.  It would be worthwhile using the Iona Institute report produced this week which talked about the benefit of marriage, married life and the upbringing of children in a family home.</P>
        <P>This week there was a change of direction in the British Labour Party which said it now wished to consider the value of marriage because it was no longer politically correct to ignore it.  Perhaps we have something similar to do in this country, namely, consider the benefit to a child of having both parents committed to marriage and the benefit of bringing up children in a family home.  I mention it because the steps we have taken in recent years, although with the best objectives, have perhaps discouraged parents from feeling they can stay at home to mind children because the State has encouraged people to go out to work.  It has not been politically correct to do so in recent times but it would be worthwhile to have a debate on parenting and marriage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for an urgent debate on the proposal by Dublin City Council to abstract 470 million litres of water from Lough Ree.  This issue was raised on the Adjournment last week but a full debate is of vital interest.  The River Shannon is the artery of Ireland.  It is crucial and touches half the counties of Ireland.  It is essential we retain the water in Lough Ree and the River Shannon because it is very important to the development of the region.  The Oxford English Dictionary describes abstraction as dishonest removal, pilfering or purloining.  That is the case as far as I am concerned.  Dublin City Council is proposing to steal our water.  There is a row between the Palestinians and the Israelis about water.  Water is a crucial issue and a major debate should take place.  I know where the Leader&rsquo;s heart will be in this regard because <Col N="484"/>Westmeath County Council will have to make the decision on this proposal by Dublin City Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not get the opportunity last week to express my sympathy and horror at the brutal murder of Manuela Riedo in Galway city.  The people of Galway city and county are shocked.  It is a different murder in that it has an international dimension.  All murders are horrific but this was exceptional in that the young girl was in the country only two days.  I, as a Member of the Seanad, checked whether there was a book of condolences in the House.  We do not want to send out a message that crime of this nature is the norm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We normally do not discuss these types of incidents in the House.  If there are expressions of sympathy regarding a particular matter, they are normally initiated by the Leader.  If we were to discuss the specifics of every tragedy in Members&rsquo; areas, we would be discussing such matters every day.  The incident in question had great implications for the city of Galway and the country but I would prefer not to discuss it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chairman.  I compliment the garda&iacute; in Mill Street in Galway on the manner in which they have dealt with the tragedy.  They have presented a good picture of Ireland internationally.  As Members probably know, there are two German-speaking garda&iacute; in Mill Street and they have communicated daily with the victim&rsquo;s family to present a better picture of Ireland internationally.  I do not want to see us becoming immune to crime.  We will talk about this further today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will debate that tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole on the need for an urgent debate on Brazilian beef.  I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food be invited to the House to address the matter.  The real issue concerns the need for appropriate labelling of beef, in respect of which we have already enacted the necessary legislation.  It is a consumer issue and a matter of pubic health and we need to send out the message that the Brazilians are using EU-banned hormones, for example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can debate that if the Leader agrees to a debate on agriculture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House to have an urgent debate on the fact that our education system does not suit at least 20% of children at second level.  They are not being retained in the system and an ESRI report issued last week stated many are drifting by the age of 15.  The failure to retain pupils in the system has serious implications because they <Col N="485"/>do not have the necessary skills to cope when they enter society.  Consequently, they are attracted to low-level crime initially&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made her point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem has serious implications and follows on from what Senator Dominic Hannigan said about literacy and learning problems.  Appropriate educational provisions should be made available at second level to address them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader have an urgent debate on the withdrawal by pharmacists of the methadone service?  I have referred to the professionalism of pharmacists in the House on many occasions, and I have also referred to how well trained they are and the good service they provide.  However, I must point out today that most of their income is derived from the State.  In recent years they have prospered greatly and now hold and own very valuable assets.</P>
        <P>The withdrawal of the methadone service in such a concerted way by the pharmacists reeks of bully-boy tactics.  They are exceptionally well paid for what they are doing in respect of the service, which is based on a contract with the Health Service Executive and is different from all the other services they provide.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The withdrawal of the service is being used as a blunt negotiating tool with which to deal with the Health Service Executive.  This is a disgrace and the people most affected are vulnerable addicts who are trying to wean themselves off the terrible scourge of heroin, and also their families.  I call on the Leader to have a debate on this matter as early as possible.  It is about time the pharmacists knew they are not backed by the public in this matter.  I have stood with them in respect of other issues but am moving away from them because the people being affected are those we represent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Senators want to speak on the Order of Business.  Unfortunately so many have put up their hands that I may have missed some, but I will do the best I can to accommodate as many as possible.  To assist in this regard I ask Senators to be brief.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  I support what was said about the need for a debate on the future of the beef industry and the food industry as a whole.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the future of the pig industry as a matter of urgency?  Like many of my colleagues, I attended an IFA briefing session this morning at which we were given some stark statistics relating to the future of an industry that employs 7,000 people.  The pig industry is almost in meltdown due to problems with feedstuffs, country of origin label<Col N="486"/>ling and environmental issues, all of which need to be addressed by the Government.  It is important that the Leader should arrange at an early stage a debate on the future of this major sector of the agriculture industry, which employs 7,000 people and exports produce worth hundreds of millions of euro every year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As someone who comes from north Mayo, I join Senators in congratulating Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady on being appointed as a cardinal.  I would like to ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come to the House to tell us what he proposes to do about the decision of the National Library to stop the Chief Herald from making any further awards.  There are doubts about the Chief Herald&rsquo;s legal power to make such awards in the past.  It is embarrassing that there are questions about the validity of the awards which have been given to many important people by the Chief Herald.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Just as Eircom has to provide telephone lines throughout the country, An Post is required to deliver letters to all parts of the country.  I note that An Post intends to analyse how much that universal service obligation will cost the company.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, rural post offices have been constantly and quietly attacked in recent times.  Many of them have closed over the last ten years.  I am concerned that the terms of reference of studies like the An Post analysis to which I referred will be used to suggest that more closures can be justified.  Can the Leader ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come to the House to present his plans for the postal service?</P>

	<P>I join Senators in wishing my fellow Cavan man, Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady, the best of luck with his pending elevation to the College of Cardinals.  It is a great honour for Archbishop Brady, his family in County Cavan, the Bishop of Kilmore, the priests of the Kilmore diocese and those who serve in the Archdiocese of Armagh.  Archbishop Brady will do an excellent job when he is elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Benedict XVI in six weeks&rsquo; time.  I would like to take this opportunity to correct Senator O&rsquo;Toole, which is not something one gets many opportunities to do in this House.</P>

	<P>When I called two weeks ago for a debate on the opt-out from the EU structures for police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, the Leader kindly agreed to hold such a debate.  Unfortunately, the Government subsequently made a decision on the matter in the absence of debate in this House or the Lower House.  The D&aacute;il discussed the matter yesterday, albeit after the event, but we are none the wiser about why we need to exercise the opt-out.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform mentioned that there are concerns about the move to qualified majority voting in the context of the proposal to establish an office of the European public prosecutor.  As the proposed treaty provides that such an office can be established only if there is unanimous agreement on the part of member states, the issue of majority voting does not arise in that instance.  No specific example has been given of an area of law which might give rise to concerns of this nature.</P>
        <P>Some discussion took place on the exchange of evidence and the proposed European evidence warrant.  The Government has included in its legislative programme for this year a Bill to implement this framework decision.  Deputy Upton asked a question in the D&aacute;il about the exercise of an opt-out and whether Ireland has exercised an opt-out in the case of making it a criminal offence to employ illegal immigrants.  In reply to her question the Government informed her that we have three months in which to opt in and in that time we have neither opted in nor opted out since we can opt in at any time.  It seems then that we will never know when the Government has opted in or opted out because it will be an open question.</P>
        <P>The Minister should report to the House how Ireland has exercised the opt-out provisions in the Schengen part of the treaty as this would provide some guidance on how this will be operated in the future in the area of policing and criminal law matters.  It is important to have clarification on this matter.  A referendum is planned on this matter and many questions will be asked as to the precise implications of these provisions.  There needs to be clarity regarding Government action in the application of the Schengen opt-out.</P>

	<P>Many people look forward to Hallowe&rsquo;en at this time of year.  However, many older people shiver in their shoes.  I do not wish to be a kill-joy but many incidences regarding Hallowe&rsquo;en practices have been described in this House.  These practices do not sit well with our concern for the environment and are not conducive to a recognition that many, if not all people do not appreciate a firework being thrown in their door.  Every year at this time my local newspaper carries reports of serious injuries caused by fireworks.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House because of the serious environmental issues at stake.  Bonfires should only be allowed under licence and should be properly supervised and organised.</P>
        <P>I am aware that a manager of a local authority may seek legal advice on any given issue and can do so without incurring any cost to his or her self.  However, such a facility is not available to the elected member and this imbalance should be corrected because it is not conducive to democracy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that time is short but when I came into this House there were no such restrictions on speaking time and such restrictions weaken the democratic nature of our Parliament.  This is a great mistake and time allowed should be extended.  These issues of a guillotine on speaking time during the passage of Bills is not a good practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I join with those who celebrate the nomination of Archbishop Brady to the College of Cardinals.  This country has made a disproportionate contribution to the Roman Catholic Church over many centuries and it is appropriate this is recognised in the same way as Ireland has made a disproportionate contribution to the world of literature.  As a Trinity representative, I am extremely glad that one of our graduates, whom I remember in the English department, has won the Man Booker award.  Anne Enright is a wonderful, witty, unpretentious person and writes brilliantly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask for a debate on the question of confidentiality.  I am very worried, as other people must be, by revelations that a civil servant passed on information to his brother who used it for burglaries and other criminal activity.  The civil servant in question stated in evidence that he had browsed through other people&rsquo;s records and that this was a common practice in the Civil Service.  If it is a common practice in the Civil Service for people to look up, talk about and use in a malign way these records, something should be done about it under the Data Protection Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad the matter of Susie Long was raised.  I raised the matter a number of months ago and stated then as I do now that this was a woman sentenced to death for the crime of poverty.  Professor John Crown spoke on the wireless today.  He should come to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to give his ideas from the <Col N="489"/>coalface on how we can deliver an efficient health service to our people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also glad the methadone issue was raised.  I understand my colleague, Senator Ross, raised the matter of pharmacists on an Adjournment debate.  This is critical and involves vulnerable people who will find it difficult to access the drugs.  The Health Service Executive has put forward an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme.  The people involved have extreme difficulty handling the scheme and may well resort to street crime.  This is grossly irresponsible and it is mean-minded to hit the most vulnerable, weak and confused elements of society and we will have the inevitable backwash on ordinary citizens.</P>

	<P>We all saw the announcement in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the European Commission will take legal action against the State over the failure to protect adequately sites of national heritage.  This is in the context of the Hill of Tara and the fiasco of the motorway going through this national monument.  It is timely to call for a debate on the lack of protection we give to our national monuments and our heritage generally and the failure by the previous Government to implement a proper plan for the protection of heritage in light of the closure of D&uacute;chas.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on parenting and marriage.  Research on parenting in Trinity College and elsewhere shows what matters is the quality of the parenting and not the legal bond or otherwise between the parents, be they same sex or opposite sex couples or single parents.  It is not the case that married parents are better parents.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations extended to Anne Enright on her magnificent achievement.  It is a breath of fresh air to listen to her.  I also congratulate Archbishop Brady on his elevation.</P>
        <P>I would like this House to debate the reform treaty in the next couple of weeks in light of yesterday&rsquo;s debate in the Lower House.  During such a debate many of the points raised here on the matter could be clarified, including the opt-out clause and the reasons for it, without people jumping to conclusions as may have been the position today.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that the issues of parenting and marriage should be raised and I did so many times in the previous Seanad.  I asked about the future of society, what society can bring to us and whether we have a better quality of life today than we did in the past.  I do not know the <Col N="490"/>answers but we have a great deal of material for discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the words of congratulations to Archbishop Sean Brady on his nomination to the College of Cardinals.  I am proud to be a neighbour and fellow countyman of his.  He is an extremely great pastor as well as a great intellectual.  I am also delighted to join in the congratulations extended to Anne Enright.  It is a great personal achievement for her and it will be a great by-product of her success if it enhances and increases the level of debate on suicide.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Bradford in his timely call for an urgent debate on the pig industry.  The industry is on its knees and is suffering greatly.  The losses range from &euro;15 to &euro;20 per pig.  The difficulty is that the imported pork can be fed from genetically modified food while the reverse is the case in this country and it results in an unlevel playing pitch.  It is a serious matter on which many lives and many jobs depend.  There are people lobbying in Dublin all day today at their own expense.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise one other serious issue.  Will the Leader please convey to the relevant Ministers the necessity for urgent legislation to ensure mandatory reflector clothing for pedestrians and cyclists and on-the-spot fines for non-compliance?  This is a serious matter from a road safety point of view.  Lives are at stake and innocent people can be involved in accidents.  This matter has been passed at my county council and at a number of other chambers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to the congratulations to Cardinal Brady.  I worked with him in very pleasant circumstances during the World Cup in 1990 when he was a monsignor in the Irish College.  I congratulate him on his elevation.  Similarly, as a fellow artist, I congratulate Anne Enright on winning the Man Booker prize.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I, too, welcome the pregnancy warning labelling on alcohol products.  If we are to educate young people, the dangers of alcohol abuse should be part of the civil, social and political education curriculum.  We should also move on the obesity issue which is becoming more prevalent by adding the calorie content to the labelling on alcohol products.  Perhaps we can raise with the Minister for Health and Children the need for the labelling of alcohol products to include calorie content as well as the pregnancy warning that has recently been announced.</P>
        <P>Donegal Pet Rescue has been in touch with me again in regard to having the animal welfare Bill brought forward.  Senator Boyle indicated the Minister might come to the House to discuss the possible content of that Bill.  In light of recent attacks by dogs, it is timely to discuss not just the welfare of the animal when it is being abused but also the abuse of neglect and the issue of dangerous dogs.  In Northern Ireland, if a dog behaves <Col N="491"/>in such a manner as to cause a person to feel apprehensive of being attacked it is enough for action to be taken.  Under our legislation, I understand a dog must do something to a person before action is taken.  There is a need for this legislation to be moved on rapidly.  I would like if we had the opportunity to make an input before it comes to Second Stage.</P>

        <P>I call for a debate that I sought last week on community child care because of the change in the way it will be funded by the Department &mdash; from a staffing grant to a subvention base &mdash; which means community child care organisations throughout the State find it impossible to remain in existence and some have had to increase their fees by up to 28%.  This will be a national crisis unless we deal with it.  The Minister of State with responsibility should come into the House and debate the issue.  I raise the matter now because I did not receive a response last week when I requested a debate and I hope one will be forthcoming today.</P>

	<P>Many Senators correctly offered their congratulations to the cardinal designate, Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady.  It is a joyous day for the people of Ireland.  He is a brilliant man and a shining example in what he has done and achieved.  He has now been acknowledged by His Holiness the Holy Father to receive this great honour.  I want to be associated with our vote of congratulations to the archbishop on his appointment.  Senators Wilson and Reilly referred to a near neighbour of ours getting such a wonderful acknowledgement of what he has done through his lifetime.  I know he will enhance the College of Cardinals and we wish him well.  We look forward to the safe pair of hands and guiding spirit which he has shown throughout his career.</P><Col N="493"/>
        <P Just="Left">I also want to be associated with the many votes of congratulations for Anne Enright.  I think of the old clich&eacute; of Ireland as the land of the saints and scholars.  On the one hand Archbishop Brady has been appointed a cardinal and on the other hand we have the achievement of Anne Enright.  In my role of Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business in the last D&aacute;il, I visited countries throughout the world.  Everywhere I went I found that Ireland, as a small nation, was acknowledged as having the best people for going forward and helping out.  The best ambassadors we ever had were our religious and literary people.  It a proud day for Ireland to get such acknowledgements.</P>

        <P>Susie Long&rsquo;s death was a terrible tragedy.  On behalf of public representatives of all political parties, I say it should not have happened and it is to be hoped lessons will have been learned.  This should not happen ever again.  A very brilliant lady was lost and I extend my sympathy to her husband and family and everyone else associated with this tragedy.  A service was not available but, in fairness to the Government, &euro;15 million was invested in this area this year.

        <P>Senator Ellis called for a debate on the actions necessary to reduce the carnage on our roads.  As former Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, I worked closely with the Senator in the past five years and I compliment him on all he has done in this area.  The introduction of random breath-testing has reintroduced an element of fear into the law.  I understand it is difficult to test motorists for drugs, but New Zealand has perhaps the best system in place for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I will allow time to discuss any proposals that might assist the Road Safety Authority and the Department in making the roads safer.  This was a particular challenge for the last Government and much hard work was done.  The dedication of the Oireachtas Committees on Transport and Enterprise and Small Business was clear and they excelled in bringing forward, on a yearly basis, all the main players and making them accountable.  Assistant Commissioner Eddie Rock can be included among those who have undertaken great work to make progress in this area.

        <P>Senator Glynn speaks as someone with long-standing experience in public life when he cautions us on the various practices that have become commonplace at Hallowe&rsquo;en.  He calls for the Minister to consider placing such activities under licence.  I will pass these views on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn also mentioned another issue that will receive great support in this House.  He called for assistance for local authority members on the issue of legal advice available to county managers and paid for by the county council but not available to local authority members.  We may require clarification from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this and then we can consider debating the matter.  It is undemocratic, as the Senator stated.  We may review Senator Glynn&rsquo;s proposal when we receive a reply from the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris expressed strong views on the allegations about a civil servant.  The civil servants have been exemplary in our experience but there is always an exception to the rule.  On this occasion there was an exception to the rule and we want clarification on it.  After the Order of Business, I will pass on to the Minister the views of Senator Norris, particularly those on the confidentiality of individuals&rsquo; records.  The highest standards have always prevailed in the Civil Service.  Everyone would abhor this happening and for it to happen once is one time too many.  Senator Callely inquired whether the matter was one for the Minister or for the Health Service Executive.  The matter is for the HSE.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik&rsquo;s contribution covered a range of issues.  I will pass on to the relevant Minister her views on lack of protection for national monuments and other issues and will come back to her on it.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly expressed horror at people, including pedestrians and cyclists, not wearing proper reflective clothing on the road to make them more visible to motorists and in traffic <Col N="497"/>generally.  I could not agree more with the Senator.  Perhaps we could raise the matter the next time we have a debate involving the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney called on the Minister for Health and Children with regard to the labelling on products containing alcohol, particularly for segments of our community such as pregnant ladies.  This is sound advice which I will pass on to the Minister.  The Senator also raised the issue of animal welfare and dangerous dogs.  Three or four times recently we have been horrified to see on the main evening news, items showing the terrible savagery of some dogs.  We are horrified by stories involving young people who treat such dogs as pets only to have them turn on them.  Legislation is urgently called for if it is not already there.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty called for a debate on road accidents and his sentiments were echoed by Senator Ellis.  I have no difficulty with this happening.  There has been progress.  Statistics indicate that random breath testing, introduced on 21 July 2006, as proposed by the two Oireachtas committees Senator Ellis and I chaired, saved in excess of 88 lives and many hundreds of people from being maimed for life up to 20 July 2007.  I hope to have a debate on this before Christmas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Doherty also called for a debate on community child care and child care in general.  I will not have any difficulty in arranging time for that.  Last but by no means least, Senator Buttimer called for a debate on incineration.  The Senator may be in the House tonight and I am assured all will be revealed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, on this his first visit to the House.  I congratulate him and wish him well with his portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be here.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach stated, this is my first appearance in the Seanad.  I congratulate everyone who was returned to this august assembly.  I look forward to working with Senators for however long we remain Members of these Houses.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the achievements of the Government to date, our current initiatives and actions and our plans to minimise problem drug use in Ireland and alleviate the problems it causes.  While Members all agree that problem drug use affects many aspects of Irish life, I am sure they also agree that there are no quick and easy solutions to it.  Illegal drug use is a global issue and no <Col N="498"/>country has succeeded in coming to terms with all dimensions of the problem.  Our efforts to tackle it must, therefore, be seen in that context.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response, through its commitment to maximising the successful outcomes of the national drugs strategy, represents the best approach.  By taking a proactive, decisive and co-ordinated approach, much has been achieved through focusing on the original four pillars of the strategy, namely, supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.  More recently, the response has been augmented by the development of the rehabilitation pillar, the implementation of which will form a key part of the response to the drugs problem under the programme for Government.  The implementation of actions under all five pillars will in time provide a vital, lifelong continuum of care necessary to assist those affected by drug misuse.</P>
        <P>In the context of funding, the allocation this year of &euro;50 million in my Department&rsquo;s Vote clearly illustrates the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to tackling the problem of drug misuse in Ireland.  This amount represents an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure and is 87% up on the corresponding figure for 2004.  In all, more than &euro;200 million was spent on various drug programmes across Departments and agencies last year.  This figure is exclusive of the many mainstream services that are availed of in the normal way by those affected by problem drug use.  I am confident that resources will continue to be made available on a scale appropriate to the needs arising.</P>
        <P>As the national drugs strategy 2001-2008 nears its conclusion and with a new programme for Government bringing us through to 2012, this is an appropriate time to reflect on and note what has been achieved under the strategy in recent years.  In addition, it is necessary to evaluate our experiences during the past six years with a view to utilising the knowledge gained from the outcomes achieved when developing a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009 to 2016.  My Department will shortly take the initial steps in the process that will lead to the drafting of a new national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>The national drugs strategy 2001-2008 has achieved considerable success across a range of areas in reducing the hardship caused to individuals and the wider community by problem drug use.  One of the main achievements to date is the fact that the level of drugs seizures by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service has been well in excess of the targets set out in the strategy and includes a number of significant operations.  In addition, under the prevention pillar, the SPHE and Walk Tall programmes have been rolled out to all schools; awareness campaigns have been organised and tremendous achievements have been made under the young people facilities and services fund; treatment  facilities have increased significantly, with approximately 8,500 clients now in receipt of methadone; a  range of services <Col N="499"/>is being provided across the statutory, voluntary and community sectors for various types of problem drug use; and research in areas such as drugs prevalence, the outcome of heroin treatment, families and drugs, the effect of drugs on communities and cocaine issues have all helped to inform our progress.</P>
        <P>With regard to the methadone programme, I have already expressed my disappointment and concern regarding the decision of individual pharmacists to withdraw from the methadone protocol this week.  The putting at risk of an extremely vulnerable group such as methadone patients who are receiving treatment in a community setting cannot be justified given the destabilisation dangers associated with the interruption of their supply of methadone.  I have also urged the HSE to ensure that sufficient resources are put in place to ensure continuity of supply to the individuals involved while minimising the disruption they experience.</P>
        <P>The specific achievements of my Department under the strategy include the programmes developed by local and regional drugs task forces, capital projects developed under the premises initiative fund and preventative actions undertaken through the young people facilities and services fund.  I pay tribute to Members of this House and other public representatives for the role they have played in rolling out those initiatives.</P>
        <P>The 14 local drugs task forces have been in operation for nearly ten years and support more than 440 community-based projects, employing more than 300 people.  These projects deliver a wide range of services and supports for problem drug users, their families and their broader communities.  Furthermore, through the emerging needs fund, approximately &euro;4 million was allocated to 67 projects to ensure the drugs problem continues to be combated on the ground in the most timely and flexible way. In my visits to local drugs task force areas since my appointment, I have seen many of their projects at first hand and have been greatly impressed by the quality and breadth of the work being done and by the commitment and dedication of those involved.  Perhaps because of the scale of the work, much of this activity does not attract broader public recognition.</P>
        <P>Ten regional drugs task forces were also established in 2003, thus ensuring that all parts of the country now benefit from the operation of a drugs task force.  Following extensive consultation processes, each region prepared a strategic plan and these are now being rolled out.  While it has, of necessity, taken time to get regional drugs task forces fully up and running, they are now pressing ahead towards full implementation of their plans in the next year or two at a full cost in excess of &euro;14 million.  As late as yesterday, I attended a meeting of the north Dublin regional drugs task force and visited the southern task force in the <Col N="500"/>last week.  I am impressed with the potential that exists for those regional forces to have an effect.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, capital funding under the premises initiative is now open to applications from all drug task forces to address the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects.  It is envisaged that regional drugs task forces will come forward with an increased range of proposals under this fund in the coming period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The young peoples facilities and services fund was established to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The main aim of the fund is to attract into these facilities and activities &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  The target group of the programme is young people in the age range of ten to 21 years who are defined as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; owing to factors such as family circumstances, educational disadvantage or involvement in crime or substance misuse.</P>
        <P>Last month in Neilstown, I announced additional capital allocations of nearly &euro;7 million to support 42 projects under the fund.  To date, allocations of more than &euro;125 million have been made to almost 500 facility and services projects in local drugs task force areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork, as well as in the cities of Galway, Limerick and Waterford and the town of Carlow.  Under the programme for Government, it is envisaged that the young peoples facilities and services fund will be extended to further towns, mainly in Leinster, and I will consider such expansion in the short term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Meanwhile, arising from the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, rehabilitation became the fifth pillar of that strategy.  Subsequently a working group, chaired by Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and involving representatives of Departments, agencies and the community and voluntary sectors, was established and its report was accepted by the interdepartmental group on drugs, as well as by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, in March of this year. The report was published in May and the recommendations received a favourable reaction.  However, it was published in the middle of the general election campaign and received little or no coverage and even less debate.</P>
        <P>The key recommendations of the report focus on an effective inter-agency approach based on a continuum of care for the individual, involving protocols for inter-agency working, service level agreements, enhanced case management and quality standards; an expansion of the range of treatment options, including an increased number of residential detoxification beds; building on the rehabilitative impact of community employment schemes; and broader life issues, including medical support, access to employment and education, housing, particular issues relating to the rehabili<Col N="501"/>tation of offenders, child care, the role of families in the rehabilitation process, and research.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I view the substantially increased focus on rehabilitation as being significant for the overall strategy.  It is important that we go the extra mile to ensure people are facilitated in their efforts to regain their capacity for daily life from the impact of problem drug use.  Implementation of the recommendations of the report, which is included in the programme for Government, will be led by the Health Service Executive and co-ordinated through a national drug rehabilitation implementation committee.  In keeping with the national drugs strategy generally, the process will involve indepth cross-departmental or cross-agency co-operation in liaison with the community and voluntary sectors.  The aim is to ensure such co-operation is achieved from the top policy level to the implementation of the care plans of individual recovering problem drug users.  Meanwhile, the drugs situation in Ireland is constantly evolving and changing, and as such we must continue to be flexible in our attitudes and policies in order that we can adapt our approach to meet whatever challenges arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cocaine is one problem that we are endeavouring to tackle in a proactive way.  It is only when the second national drug prevalence survey is completed &mdash; the first reports from which are expected next month &mdash; that we will have an up-to-date picture of the prevalence of cocaine use in our society. However, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, and the national drugs strategy team prepared a joint paper on cocaine use last year and this led to the NACD publication, entitled An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland, being published.  This report, which was published in March, brings together all available data on cocaine in Ireland.  It concludes that data sources indicate an upward trend in cocaine use, albeit from a low base.</P>
        <P>The report highlighted the extremely high risks associated with cocaine use, risks that are often underestimated by users.  The physical problems arising include heart conditions, strokes, nasal problems and respiratory ailments.  Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, agitation, compulsive behaviour and paranoia can occur.  On top of these risks are the financial, social and dependency issues that arise and the increased threat of crime and violence.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, cocaine is particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and other substances and the messages on the real dangers associated with its use need to be brought home to users.  In this regard, I stress again the dangers associated with so-called &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; or &ldquo;weekend&rdquo; cocaine use and the glamorising of cocaine in some quarters.  Apart from damaging themselves in various ways, such users cause social and economic harm to their families and to the communities that bear the brunt of the behaviour and criminal activity associated with the supply and use of cocaine.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P Just="Left">As pointed out by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin recently, it is the personal responsibility of individuals to consider the negative implications of their behaviour on other people when taking so-called &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; drugs.  Their use of drugs such as cocaine impacts on others, including people in disadvantaged areas where we are witnessing the use of violence, including murder, to intimidate whole communities, notwithstanding the significant efforts being made by the Garda and other statutory, community and voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>The NACD report makes a number of recommendations, principally in regard to treatment but also covering supply, prevention and research.  A key conclusion of the report is that treatment, primarily in the form of counselling, can and does work and that there is no need to be unduly concerned by the absence of a replacement drug, as in the case of heroin.</P>
        <P>In regard to treatment, some stimulant specific treatment interventions are recommended though it is accepted that drug services generally should be capable of catering for the individual problem drug user, regardless of the drugs they use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recommendations in regard to the training of frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues are being followed up both by the HSE and my Department.  The latter has already funded training initiatives as well as four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use.  Furthermore, under the emerging needs fund, six cocaine specific projects in local drugs task force areas have been funded and support for a further nine projects aimed at polydrug-cocaine use has been also provided under that fund.  My Department also sponsored a highly successful conference organised by the SAOL project and the NDST at Croke Park last June on the response to cocaine through shared good practice.  A useful resource pack for workers in the field was launched at that event.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, it is a priority of mine to monitor closely the progression of the implementation of all the recommendations of this report through the health authorities, the Garda, the Irish Prison Service, drugs task forces and others.  I am doing this through my chairmanship of the interdepartmental group on drugs, where reports on implementation are a standing agenda item.  The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant, but I am confident we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking forward, the programme for Government contains commitments in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, developing and strengthening the range of drugs task force projects, continuing and extending the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund and providing cocaine specific facilities.  I am working to ensure these commitments are fulfilled.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>As indicated, I will shortly initiate the process that will lead to the formulation of a new national drugs strategy for the period post 2008.  In this context, I have long been of the opinion that the alcohol and illicit drugs problems are interlinked and I will be stressing the need for synergies in the approach to these issues.  Again the formulation of the new drugs strategy will involve collaboration between Departments and agencies and the community and voluntary sectors.  Many challenges will face us in the coming years but I am confident that, with a concerted effort by all involved, we can build on our experiences and achievements to date and successfully meet the problems presented over time by the evolving drugs situation.</P>
        <P>I thank Members again for this opportunity to speak here today and I look forward to listening to their views on this important matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, to discuss this important matter.</P>
        <P>The issue of the misuse of illegal drugs was once confined to fiction novels or to small areas of social deprivation of our inner cities but the drugs climate has changed significantly in the past 15 years.  Today the issue of illegal drug use, drug trade and drug warfare affects not only every city but every townland and village in our country and has serious and long-lasting repercussions for the innocent and not-so-innocent as we have seen in the tragic deaths of innocent victims in the past two years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ar an gcead dul s&iacute;os ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il don Aire as ucht teacht isteach agus an r&aacute;iteas seo a thabhairt d&uacute;inn inniu. T&aacute; s&eacute; pr&aacute;inneach anois d&uacute;inn dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb seo at&aacute; ag cur isteach ar ghach baile, sr&aacute;idbhaile is cathair sa t&iacute;r.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From talking to people who attended a conference held in Killarney last week, I am aware of the Minister of State&rsquo;s deep-rooted interest in this matter, on which I commend him.  I appreciate his coming to the House to discuss it.  Having talked to people in my constituency, they are appreciative of his efforts in this regard.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Like many issues of national importance, this debate should not be about trying to score political points or gaining political advantage on criminal activity that wreaks havoc on thousands of lives across the county.  The crisis that faces the Garda, parents, those addicted to illegal drugs and us as legislators demands a strong unified response, a debate that is focused on identifying the factors associated with high drug usage and creative, innovative and practical strategies that will enable us to gain control over a situation that has unfortunately begun to spiral out of control.</P>
     
        <P Just="Left">The Central Statistics Office figures published this week show that drug use and the number of <Col N="504"/>people in possession of drugs has increased by 958 and 762, respectively.  It behoves Members on both sides of the House to work together with local communities and relevant stakeholders to gain control of this crisis.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the model of investigation favoured by the scientific community of scientist practitioners could serve us well in this debate.   We must be forensic in our questioning, reasoned in our hypotheses and confident that our methods of intervention are effective and will work. <b>  </b>It is not enough to intervene blindly.  We must do so based on a thorough understanding of the reasons for the current situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bearing this in mind, we must ask relevant and pertinent questions.  What are the changes in society that have seen an increase in the number of people beginning to experiment with illegal drugs and continue into long-term use?  What is the process of transition through the so-called gateways to more serious and addictive forms of drug use?  Why have current educational and public health preventative strategies failed in light of the prevalence of drug use among young people?  What deficit exists with respect to the deployment and resourcing of State agencies responsible for the control of this illegal activity &mdash; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise?  Why has the price of a human life become so devalued and cheap that so-called drug barons think little of shooting dead innocent bystanders or fellow drug criminals? There should be no condoning the notion of a cheap life.  Why is there a public disconnect between recreational drug use and criminal activity?  What is actually required to enable a person to successfully become free of the dependence of drugs?</P>
        <P>These are some of the questions we must answer if we are serious about trying realistically to address the crisis that is the use of illegal drugs.   The task should not fall on the shoulders of the Minister of State.  Rather, there is a need for a multivariate response across a range of Departments, including Education and Science, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social and Family Affairs, and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to the withdrawal of methadone supplies from pharmacies, which poses a serious and frightening threat to former drug users on methadone programmes and highlights the urgent need to address the wider drug issue and to push for immediate action in implementing the national drugs strategy.  The severe stress and anxiety experienced this week by patients on the methadone programme and their families is unacceptable and demonstrates the fact that 3,000 of the country&rsquo;s most vulnerable people are suffering owing to the Government&rsquo;s hands-off approach to the health service.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael parliamentary party met the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, last week.  I call on the IPU to suspend its action.  I also call on <Col N="505"/>the Minister and the Health Service Executive to enter talks and stop shadow boxing.</P>
        <P>There are many positives in the national drugs strategy.  It has a clear focus, inter-agency partnership is working, the voice of the voluntary sector is being heard, family services are developing and a platform for funding is available.  Some 100 actions which, if carried out and completed in their entirety, would be a significant and effective response to the drug problem have been highlighted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to cocaine, considered by many to be a recreational drug of choice and the cause of untold hardship and misery across the country.   Young adults in particular are struggling under the weight of use of this drug.  It has been identified by international medical and psychological research to be associated with negative life outcomes for those who use it on a sustained basis.   It affects simple processing of information, attention and concentration, and the social and emotional ability of those who use it, not to mention the significant financial burden of trying to meet the cost that use creates.  This, in effect, introduces the person into the vicious cycle of crime to fund drug use.</P>
        <P>We have a major problem with the sale and use of illicit drugs, particularly cocaine.  Data from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs and Excise show an increase in the number of cocaine seizures.  Recently the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime issued a report showing Ireland as the country with the highest increase in cocaine consumption with rates higher than any other developed country.  The number of cocaine related offences recorded by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased fourfold from 297 to 1,224.  Cocaine seizures have increased significantly in 2006.  There is evidence of a growing cocaine problem in Ireland and in Europe where consumption is increasing and reaching alarming levels.</P>
        <P>There is no adequate treatment service to deal with cocaine addiction.  Treatment programmes in Ireland were designed to deal primarily with an opiate using client group, not stimulant users.  An additional problem is the fact that polydrug use is now common among drug users.  Many problem heroin users also use cocaine and alcohol use is prevalent across the board.  We must take a holistic approach to battling addiction.  There is no point giving a drug addict treatment specific to one drug when the addict uses many different drugs.</P>
        <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, report recommends a reorientation of drug services from drug specific intervention to treatment tailored towards the individual regardless of the drugs used.  This approach will provide options for the drug user appropriate to his needs and circumstances and should assist in reintegration into society.</P>
        <P>A strong message must be sent to those who think cocaine is a clean drug.  Yesterday, a tabloid newspaper carried an opinion poll from an influ<Col N="506"/>ential woman&rsquo;s magazine revealing that one out of six women claim they stay slim by taking speed or cocaine.  This is part of the folklore and myth surrounding the use of cocaine.  The Minister of State must consider a strong advertising campaign similar to the road safety campaigns, for which he would find support on this side of the House.  It is time to shock and educate young people on the use of drugs and specifically cocaine, which is not a harmless recreational drug, results in negative life outcomes and has been linked to relationship difficulties, work stress and the development of mental health difficulties.</P>
        <P>Not long ago a major shipment was retrieved off the south coast in west Cork.  The discovery owed more to a freak of nature than it did to investigation.  We must be honest with ourselves and admit that we do not know the quantity of drugs imported to Ireland daily or annually.  How many shipments arrive weekly without being intercepted?  Following recent drugs finds in coastal areas, there must be a co-ordinated and integrated response to tackling the drugs problem.  The Minister of State referred to the need to further develop links and working partnerships with our international partners.  It might be necessary to look at strengthening extradition treaties further or developing new ones.  As a single nation we cannot hope to address the issue single-handedly but we must be proactive.</P>
        <P>Regarding the local drugs task forces, a small but dedicated team of workers, community activists and volunteers wage battle daily against this tidal wave.  We are all familiar with the excellent work done by the Merchants Quay project and similar projects.  While these carry out important work, there is a level of dissatisfaction with the manner in which they are treated, managed and resourced by central government.  Many of these centres still operate as pilot projects and, while the workers are highly motivated, they lack security of tenure in their positions.  This leads to a high turnover of staff and a lack of consistency for those seeking intervention and creates additional difficulties for managers to plan for three, four or five years&rsquo; time.  This is important because it is these long-term approaches that will ultimately be successful rather than media-focused quick fixes.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  If it has been demonstrated that a centre is carrying out effective and reliable work, it should be afforded permanent status.  All workers, having proved their worth, are as entitled as any other public servant to the same permanency held by such public servants.</P>
        <P>The lack of an identified training qualification for drug workers represents a lacuna.  Many are highly trained teachers or youth workers who top up their experience by doing a variety of courses.  We require a specific qualification validated by universities or institutes of technology.  The University of Milan, working in co-operation with <Col N="507"/>European Cities Against Drugs, ECAD, has formulated a course and is preparing students in this discipline.  Perhaps the Minister of State would investigate this.</P>
        <P>We must strengthen the link with families.  Strengthening the families programme has a significant impact at local level.  If we help the family, we help the addict.  Undoubtedly the local drugs task force, which is responsible for the operation and supervision of specially designed projects, is doing excellent work.  The strength of the local task force in identifying emerging trends at local level cannot be underestimated.  Local people understand local needs best and can take action accordingly.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the provision of detox beds.  The Mannix report recommends 12 detox beds in Cork city and 12 in the Cork county and Kerry region.  There is a shortage at present.  Will the Minister set aside money in the budget submission for detox beds throughout the country?  This would indicate support for the treatment centres.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Farrell Grant Sparks report recommended a dedicated drugs court.  I ask the Minister of State to provide drug courts throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to the Walk Tall and SPHE programmes.  Our education services need enhancement and strengthening.  As a teacher, I know the time allocated for such programmes in the classroom is not sufficient and needs to be improved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The residential phase of drug treatment is an important part of the rehabilitation process, deserving great credit.  While considerable emphasis is given to community-based outpatient services, it is important that treatment centres such as Tabor Lodge in County Cork are also recognised.  Implementation of action 57 of the national drugs strategy, linked to No. 48, is not happening.  Proper funding for services such as Tabor Lodge is important.  The Minister of State must address the current problem at Tabor Lodge concerning benchmarking awards and take it up <?oasys _dc18- ?>with the Health Service Executive and the Labour Court to ensure there is no untold hardship and the proper delivery of services continues.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The Minister of State will find this side of the House supports the work of the national drugs strategy.  We have made many strong recommendations.  I hope the Minister of State will put more emphasis on the rehabilitation pillar in the forthcoming national drugs strategy and that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance will provide adequate funding for it in the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support the national drugs strategy and the drugs task force in the outstanding work it has done.  I am disappointed, however, that with all this good work, methadone dispensing services have been withdrawn by pharmacists.  The Minister of State must do everything possible to bring the two sides in the dispute together to ensure methadone users, who are most vulnerable, are not put back into a difficult situation.  It is important not to engage in a blame game as to which side, the Health Service Executive or the pharmacists, is wrong.  I would like to see greater efforts and, if necessary, a personal approach by the Minister for Health and Children to bring the two sides together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national drugs strategy pursued by the Minister of State and his predecessors is good.  My area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, has received a &euro;9.8 million investment in drugs task force programmes for young people and other related services such as child care and the outreach programme.  We would like to see further developments in these programmes.  Some areas in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which I will not name, have major drug problems but have received much attention from the drugs task force which I want to continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Child care is an important component in many individuals&rsquo; drug rehabilitation.  Many of those on methadone schemes who have found work find it difficult to continue if they cannot get child care.  This is an important issue which I hope the Minister of State will examine.  It is important the work of the drugs task force continues.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As it is my first time to encounter my old friend, Deputy Pat Carey, as a Minister of State in the House, I congratulate him on his new appointment.  I have complete confidence in his ability to deliver on his remit, knowing him from his days on Dublin City Council.  Earlier, I reflected on our time in the council chamber when he sat on one side of me and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, sat on the other.  I wondered where I went wrong.  Obviously, I did not work hard enough.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The illegal drugs trade is an international menace.  It is estimated its value is approximately &euro;500 billion, of which &euro;1 billion can be associated with our domestic situation.  It is an obscene amount of money and gives some indication of the difficulty in tackling this problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The use of drugs, particularly addictive substances such as heroin and cocaine, has numerous economic and social costs such as drug related deaths and blood-borne diseases.  There are also the costs to the individual, the family and the community.  In many addicts&rsquo; cases in Dublin city, their parents were also drug addicts.  There are also many other functioning families who have a son or daughter who has fallen off the wagon.  There is nothing worse than to witness the distress of such a family situation.</P><Col N="509"/>
        <P Just="Left">No state has managed to come to terms with the drugs problem.  Neither the heavy-handed approach of the US nor the softer approach of the Netherlands has worked.  This highlights there are no quick solutions to this problem.  The national drugs strategy, which runs to 2008, demonstrates the great efforts the Government is prepared to commit to bring some order to this escalating problem.  The strategy is balanced and well-focused, aiming to reduce drug related harm and disrupt the operations of the drugs markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Buttimer alluded to the recent discovery of a drugs shipment off the west Cork coast, which was a stroke of luck.  In that cache there was enough for a ten-year supply for this country which gives some indication of the moneys and quantities involved.  How did the seizure affect the individuals involved?  Did it take any drug barons out of existence?  It probably did not, which is frightening.</P>
        <P>There are encouraging signs of progress in the development of the strategy.  This is so whether one looks at the area of seizure, expansion of the treatment service or the prevention programmes in schools.  As well as that, complementary legislation was introduced by the Oireachtas in the past five years, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  This was outstanding legislation and cut to the heart of many of the drug barons.  As well as that there was the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 and the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Act 2003.  As regards the latter two, I wonder how effective they are, if at all.  Is there proof that they have been used to any great effect?  They should have been, because one has cross-Border associations between different countries while the other is concerned with nobbling these fellows at sea when they are coming in.  Many fine Bills are enacted through the Houses of the Oireachas, but much of the time we do not review their effectiveness.  That can be said, probably, of most legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State alluded to the local task forces.  I have no doubt they have been an outstanding success.  Some 12 of the initial 14 came into the Dublin area.  As someone who represented the north inner city, which is unfortunately blighted by drugs, I have seen first-hand the efforts put in there and the results.  One of the reasons they have been successful is that a good deal of thought was put into the make-up of these forces in the first instance.  Health executives were involved along with many people who encounter the drugs problem in their everyday lives.  These include the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, probation and welfare officers, public representatives and F&Aacute;S as well as many voluntary agencies.  I recall the late 1980s and early 1990s when it was people power, perhaps, that brought about these task forces in the first place.  The Minister of State will recall, as I do, local people taking to the streets, visiting these people&rsquo;s houses in the evenings, chanting outside and rooting them out.  Basically they put the focus on them and embar<Col N="510"/>rassed them out of their localities in some instances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many outstanding services and facilities have been established since those local task forces came on stream.  If proof is needed that vulnerable children can be taken out of their environment and helped, one has only to look at the programme, &ldquo;Diarmuid&rsquo;s Pony Kids&rdquo;, which was on television the other night, where five or six children were taken from various areas such as Ballyfermot and Finglas and there was one young fellow from the Traveller community.  They were put on a ten week course of horse riding, culminating in their time in the limelight at the RDS.  It was gratifying to see the joy those children derived from the exercise and to hear that they were resolved to develop their interest and perhaps take up this or another sport, thereby taking them out of the horrible mire they are in.  That was one of the good things in the programme.  I wish the Minister of State well and hope he continues to focus his resources in the right areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are former colleagues who served together on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The Minister of State and I were together at a debate in Trinity College a week or so ago.  It was greatly appreciated that he had taken the trouble to come there and talk about the difficult problem of drugs to an audience of young students.  He had to leave fairly quickly as he had to be in the House for a vote.  Perhaps he will be pleased to learn, however &mdash; and certainly I was surprised, as chairman of the debate &mdash; that the motion was actually lost, indicating that the young people believed, by a very small majority, it was appropriate to control drugs in this way. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I note what the Minister of State had to say and much of it I would categorise as fire brigade action in response to a critical situation.  No one would deny the situation is critical.  It is pathetic, certainly in the north inner city, where I live, to see the victims of drug addiction wandering around, confused, unable to sustain themselves properly, causing difficulties for other people and so on.  It is tragic for the families to watch this.  It is awful when one considers the level of mortality involved, either through overdosing or infection with AIDS and similar diseases.  Just as in the case of Ms Susie Long, a two-tier health service is being exposed.  Where that woman was sentenced to death for the crime of being poor, in the same way, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree, the  vast majority of casualties from drugs are from clearly defined social categories and postal districts in Dublin.  This does not mean there is not drug use and addiction among the professional and middle classes, but they simply are in a position to access either the drugs that sustain them in pure form, or rehabilitation.  The fact that here again, it is the most vulnerable elements of society that are involved needs to be looked at.</P><Col N="511"/>
        <P Just="Left">I know it is normal for the authorities to trumpet their successes as regards drugs seizures.  That is complete nonsense, however.  The Minister of State said the level of drug seizures by the Garda was one of the main achievements.  He said customer service was well in excess of the targets set out in the strategy and included a number of significant operations which were itemised.  However, a comparative figure indicating the amount of drugs actually seized and destroyed relative to the estimated level of drugs imports as a whole is necessary to understand the situation fully.  I understand the seizure figure is only about 5% to 10%, which is certainly extremely small.  That has virtually no impact except occasionally to create a type of shortage in the market.  I shall return to this because ultimately it is a question of marketplace economics.  That does not distress the drug barons because it just puts their profits up.  Therefore it is largely a cosmetic exercise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an unpopular thing to say, dangerous and difficult politically, but I believe it to be true.  It is time we opened a debate as to whether certain drugs, how many or even if drugs should be legalised.  I happen to believe they should be and that this is necessary.  It is the only way to defeat the criminal elements because what is driving them is the financial incentive.  The only way to stop them is to destroy the financial incentive.  I have some  support in this.  I said this many years ago in this House and the Minister for Health at the time, Deputy John O&rsquo;Connell, not only agreed with me but went further.  He was not only Minister for Health, he was also a doctor.  Another informed commentator, Mr. Gay Byrne, who takes a judicious view of matters, has said that at least this should be opened up for debate.  Rather than just listing fire brigade actions we should look fundamentally at the roots of this problem.  The Minister of State should appreciate that a very senior policeman in Britain, the Chief Superintendent of Cheshire, has indicated that this is also his belief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State may recall, as I do, that some years ago a courageous Roman Catholic priest made heroin, not just clean needles, available in the crypt of his church in Rotterdam.  The levels of crime dropped very rapidly by 75% in that area.  A similar experiment was tried in Britain but was closed down after diplomatic representations through the American Embassy.  That was the most fraudulently hypocritical action from a government that has consistently, certainly from the time of the Korean war, employed drugs as a strategic instrument.  Even when the Americans were funding the Contras in Nicaragua, they used covert operations to acquire and sell drugs so that they could pay for arms.  What is going on is shameless.  The country where one hears the loudest demands for the war on drugs, just as for the war on terrorism, is the United States, yet it has the single most critical drugs problem in the world.  If they cannot win it, <Col N="512"/>what makes us think we can?  We can offer palliative measures and I salute the Minister of State in doing this.  I am glad he has secured an increase in his budget, and he is a thoroughly decent, principled and well-motivated man.   However, we must look at the most radical approach to this problem, which might include the legalisation, registration, classification and quality control of drugs.  The reason I say this is that it would cut out the financial incentive because one would undercut the drugs barons who would find it very difficult.  I know it has been said that they would smuggle them like they smuggle cigarettes.  The only reason they are able to smuggle cigarettes is that they are so highly priced.  If they were not so highly priced, then it would not be a problem.  In addition, one would have quality control and would not have the spate of accidental overdoses by addicts which are caused by the fact that they can never tell the strength of what they buy on the streets or the degree of its contamination.  I could not give a figure and would only be pulling one out of the air but there would be a massive decrease in the levels of crime.</P>
        <P>Recently, I was at a very fine play written by a tenant of my house.  I was glad to see Anne Enright win the Man Booker prize.  She was in my attic while Sebastian Barry was in the basement.  It was a most literary house with me sandwiched in the middle.  As far as I know, I do not think there was any massive drug taking among any of us.  However, Sebastian has just written a play, &ldquo;The Pride of Parnell Street&rdquo;, which has been produced in the Dublin Theatre Festival.  It is the story of a drug addict and that man explains it very interestingly.  Friends of mine said they would not go to that play to see those gougers, &ldquo;skangers&rdquo; and blackguards being made heroes.  The character in the play did not want to engage in criminal activity but he robbed and attacked old ladies because of his desperation to get access to drugs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of reasons for considering this.  I am opening this up because the Seanad is the place in which to do so as it is, very largely, a theoretical debate.  I do not for one minute suggest that Dublin should become a drugs haven or area or that Ireland alone should relax its legislation.  This will have to be done at least on a Europe-wide level and perhaps a global one.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State travels quite a bit and has possibly been through Singapore airport.  If he has, he will have seen the signs.  One is executed &mdash; one&rsquo;s life is terminated &mdash; for bringing small amounts of drugs through that airport, yet people regularly do so.  Why?  If that does not stop them, does one believe our puny laws will do so?  I do not believe they will.</P>
        <P>It is time to open up this debate.  This must be tackled on a global basis and one of the ways we can prepare ourselves for it is to have this kind of debate.  There is an assumption that this behaviour of drug taking has always been seen as criminal activity, but that is not the case.  It was only <Col N="513"/>in the early 20th century that drug taking became criminal.  Establishment figures took drugs.  One could go into one&rsquo;s chemist to get them.  One could practically get them in one&rsquo;s hotel.</P>
        <P>A difficulty which needs to be teased out is the most dangerous drugs, for example, the drugs that alter behaviour in an unforeseeable way.  Crack cocaine is one such drug.  I have been attacked by somebody high as a kite on crack cocaine.  I do not believe they knew what they were doing and that is the problem.  One moves from what I call the naturally occurring organic drugs, which are made from plants by a fairly unsophisticated process, to the pharmaceutically derived drugs.  There are clever chemists everywhere who manufacture such drugs whose effect on the human brain is unpredictable.  That is something which calls into question some elements of my argument, so I am not saying I have the answers.  Sadly, however, the Government&rsquo;s strategy does not have the answers either.</P>
        <P>Simply by criminalising drugs, one is driving them underground and not affecting the substantial level of imports.  One should look at our skimpy Naval Service which, while comprising wonderful people, does not have the resources in terms of manpower, boats and so on.  The shoreline in County Cork is a smuggler&rsquo;s paradise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence and the Minister of State.  I look forward to the debate but would be lacking in my duty if, as I have always done, I did not say what I thought and what I thought was in the best interests of the nation whatever about the possible impact on my voters if they ever read this, which may not be entirely positive.  I know some of the mothers of Ireland would not agree because it is very tragic to see a son or a daughter on drugs.  I salute the families and, in particular, that wonderful mother whose name I cannot remember and whose daughter appeared in the newspapers with her arm so desperately scarred.  The love of that mother supported the daughter until she managed to get herself into a programme.  I salute these people but is it not better to have drugs regulated and the dose and the purity known?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his overview of the current national drugs strategy and his intentions in regard to the new strategy for 2009-16.  Until recently I was a member of the Bray local drugs task force, so I had an opportunity to experience directly the implementation of the national drugs strategy at a local level.  I was very impressed by the cross-sectoral and partnership approach and the quality of the projects being funded by the strategy.</P>
        <P>It is opportune to talk about the national drugs strategy as we approach its conclusion.  I hope this debate will influence the content of the new strategy.  There is much in the programme for Government on the shape of that, which is very encouraging.  In the new drugs strategy, I hope we move away from the central thrust of the previous <Col N="514"/>one, which was tackling the scourge of heroin abuse, and that we broaden it out.  As other speakers said, there is polydrug abuse in society.  There is widespread availability of drugs such as cocaine, hash and crack cocaine.  We must also look at the issue of alcohol.  To date, our drugs strategy has focused on the hard drugs which have been sources of concern.  To a certain extent, we have excluded alcohol from the focus of the drugs strategy and it very much needs to be incorporated into it.  Perhaps that could be included in the forthcoming drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>Like other speakers, I regret the action of the pharmacists in withdrawing the methadone treatment programme from very vulnerable people.  While we might empathise with the fact the pharmacists believe they have a very real grievance and want to express their concerns about the recent Government decision, that they chose to target a vulnerable, at-risk group to highlight it is unacceptable.  I hope they will reconsider their decision and that in the meantime, an interim supply system for that group will be made available.</P>
        <P>In terms of evaluating the previous drugs strategy, more than 8,200 heroin users receive methadone treatment.  That is a 66% increase on the 2000 figures.  That is a very clear indication that the national drugs strategy has been successful in its central focus.  However, one of the issues highlighted in the 2005 review of the national drugs strategy was the fact we would need to move beyond methadone maintenance because many addicts remain on methadone maintenance for years.  In fact, some remain on it for the rest of their lives, which is not a desirable outcome.  The fifth pillar proposed in the 2005 review of the national drugs strategy was about introducing rehabilitation.  An integrated rehabilitation provision for serious drug addicts should be a central focus of the new drugs strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, drug use is on the increase in Ireland.  That has to do with increased affluence and a greater acceptability of what is referred to as recreational drug use.  However, there are very negative consequences to this widespread availability and abuse of drugs.  Communities experience the types of problems which go with drug abuse and the drugs trade generally, which include anti-social behaviour, general insecurity and fear of violence.  Unfortunately, the violence ranges from more minors examples of intimidation to more serious punishment beatings to shootings for small drugs debts to the terrifying gangland murders which are becoming increasingly common.  Drug abuse and its connection with serious crime in Ireland comprise an area of growing concern.  There are clear challenges to be tackled in the new drugs strategy.   We can take some of our cues from the mid-term review of the current strategy, published in 2005, which review refers to adjusting some of the strategy&rsquo;s  priorities.  These include increasing Garda resources in the local drugs task force areas, placing greater <Col N="515"/>emphasis on community policing, establishing local community policing forums and preventing drug dealing.  The review refers to specialist training of the Judiciary in respect of drug related issues, the development and implementation of substance abuse policies in all the schools of the local drugs task force areas and the introduction of school-based prevention programmes.  It is very important to educate children of school-going age on the risks and dangers of substance abuse generally.</P>
        <P>We need more treatment options and a greater range, given the increasing choice of available drugs.  Greater emphasis must be placed on integrated rehabilitation provisions in the new drugs strategy.  This will lead to certain challenges arising from resource implications.  Increasing Garda resources will have such implications, but it is important to remember short-term costs will result in long-term benefits.  If we do not tackle all the problems in communities riddled with drugs, we will end up with much higher costs, including costs associated with prisons.</P>
        <P>The Green Party would support a new properly resourced national drugs strategy.  We hope it would emphasise community policing, rehabilitation services and greater community supports for families affected by drugs.  We also hope it would take bold steps, including steps to ensure the provision of clean needles in prisons.  Consideration should be given to injecting rooms, as proposed by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  Rather than continuing to deny there is a drugs problem in our prisons and problems with HIV transmission, pilot programmes should be put in place to allow for the provision of clean needles and injecting rooms in the main prisons.  An increase in community employment places should be considered so as to benefit recovering addicts.</P>
        <P>The issue of alcohol will not go away.  There is a voluntary code of self-control in the alcohol advertising industry but we need to adopt a stronger approach to the issue.  I hope the Minister will consider this in the forthcoming strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, to the House and congratulate him on his recent elevation.  It is a good sign that somebody of his commitment is in his position and this bodes well for the future.  I am sure we all agree that drugs are a major curse in modern society and I therefore welcome the chance to debate the subject.</P>
        <P>The commitments made in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 have not yet been honoured in their entirety and many problems have still to be addressed.  I wish to address four main areas: the means by which we can reduce supply; the means of preventing drugs from reaching our shores; improving treatment for addicts; and the need for research into why people feel the need to take drugs.  The current national drugs strategy lists 100 specific actions for tackling drug abuse. <Col N="516"/> We need to review the list as part of the new strategy and determine which actions have been carried out.  We also need to add to these actions, if necessary.</P>
        <P>Let me address the issues associated with one of the most prevalent drugs in our society, alcohol.  As a nation we top the poll for the consumption of alcohol.  In the past four years our consumption has increased by 10% and our rate of consumption is higher than the European average.  Some two thirds of Europeans have had a drink in the past month while the proportion in Ireland is higher.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the age profile of alcohol users.  The age at which people are drinking is becoming increasingly lower and this is because youths find it easy to purchase drink in off-licences or to get friends, family members or others to buy it for them.  We must consider the enforcement of our licensing laws to make it more difficult for younger members of society to gain access to alcohol in the first place.</P>
        <P>There has been an explosion in the use of cocaine in Ireland since the publication of the current national drugs strategy.  The number of people seeking help for abuse of this drug has increased by 250% in the past nine years.  Its use crosses all sections of society and affects the young and old, and the rich and poor.  Cocaine is perceived by many as harmless and accessible, and as a drug one takes when one goes out at the weekend, but the reality is very different.  It is a crime to take cocaine and it is not a victimless one.  The use of cocaine leads to more people in the drugs trade getting shot and means the reasons for getting involved in the trade in the first place remain.  Anyone who takes cocaine should do so knowing he or she is contributing to gang warfare, about which we are so concerned at present.  We need to educate citizens about the fact that cocaine use is a crime and that there are victims.</P>
        <P>Heroin addiction is a major problem and it is estimated that there are over 1 million heroin users across the European Union.  In Ireland, garda&iacute; will tell one heroin is mostly a problem in Dublin, in which nine out of ten heroin offences take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reasons for addiction to heroin are many and varied.  One reason that recurs is the lack of access to education.  Some 75% of heroin users have been shown to have left school at an early age.  It is important to ensure that we tackle drug use in schools and state to teenagers that it is detrimental to their future well-being.  It is through programmes such as the Right to Read campaign in Dublin, on which there is a conference on Saturday, that we can help people to avoid drugs and engage in self-improvement.  We should consider such measures.</P>
        <P>The issue of treatment has arisen time and again.  We need to ensure that there are places available for those who wish to come off drugs and that programmes such as the Merchant&rsquo;s <Col N="517"/>Quay project are sufficiently funded and expanded nationally.</P>
        <P>Harm reduction policy is essential and in this respect reference was made to needle exchange programmes.  A doctor from the Mater Hospital told me recently that a person taking heroin by needle has a 90% chance of contracting hepatitis C.  A needle exchange programme would clearly help to reduce this and the incidence of HIV infection.  At present there is only one full-time needle exchange service in Dublin.  It does not open in the evenings or weekends and is a nine-to-five operation, in spite of the reality that drug users are not users only from Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  They do not go to the country for the weekend; they are in the city all the time and it is therefore important that this be reflected in the strategy.  Opening hours need to be extended to evenings and weekends and the programme needs to be extended nationwide.</P>
        <P>There is an increase in the abuse of substances other than heroin and cocaine, including antidepressants.  The new national drugs strategy should refer to such drugs and propose methods to deal with their abuse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current national drugs strategy proposes the setting up of a trial inner-city drugs court.  This recommendation was implemented but I would like to know whether there are intentions to develop the programme further.  What sort of results did it achieve and could it form part of a strategy to help lower the rate of drug abuse in the Dublin area?  Such programmes, and other research programmes, can help to show us the way forward.  I would like an annual report on drug use in Ireland to be published.  Such a report would help us to learn what the problem is and try to come up with some solutions.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on that.  The national drugs strategy must support the drugs task forces by setting out a framework that will allow agencies to concentrate their energies on preventing and curing addiction, rather than criminalising addicts.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, to the House.  I am pleased he is responsible for the national drug strategy.  I am confident the Minister of State, whom I know well, will make his mark in this field.  I listened to his contribution and I wish him well.  As I do not have much time, I will speak briefly about the importance of rehabilitation, which is the fifth pillar to be introduced in this area.  In that context, I would like to emphasise the role of the education sector, with which I am familiar as a result of the work I did before I was elected to this House.  We must consider carefully <Col N="518"/>the link between the home and the school, which is a big issue.  The Minister of State spoke about the interdepartmental connection and the integrated plan, on which we must focus.  Children of ten years of age were mentioned earlier.  If we are to make a big start, we need dialogue between parents and teachers.  Parents should have a huge influence.</P>
        <P>I would like to talk about treatment.  I lament the recent decision taken by pharmacists in respect of the methadone programme.  It is a pity they have taken this course of action, which is affecting the most vulnerable people in society.  We need to invest more resources in treatment places.  I identify a gap in that sense.  Second chance education is an important part of rehabilitation.  We need to decide how best we can bring back young people into the education sector.  What role should be played by local initiatives, for example?  I appreciate that the Government has invested money in local initiatives, such as recreational programmes.  Capital funding has been provided for accommodation.  What is the best way of integrating these people into society?  Do we have the leaders, trained staff, teachers and counsellors needed to work in this field?  When I spoke to some career guidance counsellors recently, they told me they have huge problems when they deal with dysfunctional families in risk areas.  Resources are needed on the ground in these core areas.</P>
        <P>I would love to talk about this issue for another half an hour.  The Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is familiar with my position on this matter.  I will no have no difficulty in working closely with him on this subject at a future date.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the various Garda units involved.  I welcome the recent development in relation to Lisbon.  I was involved with the officials working on that when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the past five years.  I welcome the recent statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau is to be expanded to cover smaller dealers in illicit drugs and those who are involved in similar activities.  Such people will now be targeted to the same extent as the bigger guys because the manner in which they flaunt their <Col N="519"/>money is just as much of a problem.  Senator Norris, who is not present in the Chamber, advocated the legalisation of drugs.  If the Senator examines the four reports &mdash; covering issues like cocaine, cannabis and the inclusion of alcohol in the national substance misuse strategy &mdash; which were produced over the past five years by the joint committee of which I was Chairman, he will find there is no such thing as a &ldquo;soft drug&rdquo;. </P>

	<P>Alcohol and cigarettes, which are the softest drugs, are gateway drugs.  We cannot and should not pander to any liberalisation of the laws relating to habit-forming and addictive substances.  I say that with conviction and emphasis as someone who spent five years chairing a committee that was very involved in studying this matter.  I no longer have that responsibility, now that I am a Member of the Upper House, but I hope more good work can be done in this regard at committee level as soon as the new structures are up and running.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I travelled to a drugs conference in Sweden which was opened by the queen of that country.  It was a small conference, with just one delegate from each country in Europe.  When I decided to attend the conference to listen and learn, I was under the impression that Ireland did not have the big drug problem experienced by other European countries.  I was surprised to be rounded upon bluntly by the opening speaker at the conference, who asked me what Ireland was doing about its substantial drugs problem.  I fell back in my chair, having been quite relaxed before that, when I realised I was the focus of the meeting.  People were interested in Ireland because they felt it had a problem with the drug of alcohol.  When discussions take place about national drugs strategies in many other countries, no distinction is drawn at the top level between alcohol and other drugs.  Perhaps there is a distinction at the second level.  Alcohol is seen as relevant to drugs strategies in such countries because it is the drug of choice there.  There is no doubt that it is the drug of choice in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, to investigate the possibility of including alcohol in any future national substance misuse strategy.  I refer to the title used by the joint committee in July 2006 when it was dealing with consultants.  The committee asked the consultants to study the debate about including alcohol in the national drugs strategy.  The name of the strategy had changed slightly by the time the joint committee made its final recommendations.  I do not have time to outline in detail the debate that took place at that time.  We were aware in 2004 that alcoholic disorders accounted for 14% of all mental health admissions.  At least 25% of those <Col N="520"/>admitted to accident and emergency departments have alcohol related problems.  It has been suggested by the general hospitals that 30% of males and 8% of females have an underlying alcohol problem.  We are familiar with the problems associated with foetal alcohol syndrome.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the decision that has been made to place health warnings on alcoholic products, I am not sure it will be effective.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children when it examined the tobacco industry.  I am not convinced that the substantial advertising levels of the tobacco and alcohol industries can be counteracted by notices stating that such products can damage one&rsquo;s health, even if such notices are welcome.  Perhaps other measures would be more effective.  I would like alcohol advertising before 9 p.m to be banned.  I welcome the decision to introduce mandatory breath testing of drivers involved in accidents which<?oasys _jy ?>result in fatalities.  Many other things could be done.</P>
        <P>I would like to explain why we want alcohol to be included in any future national substance misuse strategy.  There is a framework &mdash; that is why the national drugs strategy is in place.  We will increase our chances of reducing the supply of drugs and rehabilitating drug addicts if we assign responsibility for this issue to one lead Minister and one lead Department.  I understand why this step was not taken in the past, when alcohol and drugs were used separately.  They are now being used as one and the same thing, however, which is causing mayhem in our communities.  Perhaps this is a matter for the debate on the increase in crime, which will take place in the House at<?oasys _jy ?>5 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is sincere.  I applaud him on his allocation of &euro;50 million for dealing with this serious issue.  This is another crap report, however.  I apologise if that is unparliamentary language.  All its aspirations are worthwhile and sincere.  No work has been done on prevention or treatment in my local area.  We do not have a regional drug treatment centre.  No money was spent during the first year of the regional task force.  I am angry about this.  I have attended too many funerals of people who died from heroin overdoses.  I am acutely aware that general practitioner services are trying to cope with difficulties in helping methadone users to access the services they need.  I am very angry about this.  We are applauding ourselves and saying we are great.  This report is too aspirational &mdash; it outlines what we want to do.  I do not doubt the Minister of State&rsquo;s sincerity, but I hope he has the will to drive forward this report.</P>
        <P>People in the midlands regional drugs task force area are beginning to become a little proactive.  They are recruiting an educational officer, for example.  We have a problem in our area.  I urge the Minister of State to show the will and <Col N="521"/>drive to spend the money that has been allocated.  A total of &euro;1.7 million remains to be spent by the midland regional drugs task force in my area by the end of this year.  How will it be possible to spend that money in such a short time?  I do not wish to judge the community workers involved in the task force but there needs to be leadership shown by the Minister for Health and Children and by the Government.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad Eireann, noting:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the upsurge in the brutal killing of citizens across the country;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the dramatic increase in gun crime in our society;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the inexorable growth in gangland drug-related crime</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on the Government to admit that it, and the last Government, have failed to ensure that the streets of Ireland are safe from vicious thugs and to develop a comprehensive plan to tackle the crisis on our streets through a combination of adequate resources for our garda&iacute;, effective criminal legislation and innovative policing methods.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I appreciate the attention he has given to the observations and issues being raised in this House.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Nobody can dispute the upsurge in brutal killings of citizens throughout the country nor the dramatic increase in gun crime in society, the poor detection rate for gun crime and the significant growth in gangland drug related crime.  The Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion is significantly longer than the motion itself.  The Government admits the explosion of crime under its watch when it condemns the callous disregard for human life shown by those involved in gun and gang crime and when it deplores the attacks on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while on duty.  A systemic problem exists which has not been effectively addressed by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael motion calls for a comprehensive plan to tackle this crisis through a combination of adequate resources for our garda&iacute;, effective criminal legislation and innovative policing methods.  That this is what is needed to tackle the upsurge in serious crime is acknowledged in the Government&rsquo;s amendment when it states that, &ldquo;the menace posed by gun and gang crime can be tackled effectively only through the properly resourced agencies of the criminal justice system, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, <Col N="522"/>operating within the effective legal framework being provided&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Therefore, on the Government&rsquo;s own admission, the twin obstacles to tackling serious crime are resources and legislation. In ten years, why have the resources not been provided? Why has legislation taken so long? What priority was more important than the Government&rsquo;s primary duty to protect its citizens?  The Government has failed but it has five years to put the situation right.</P>
        <P>The people of this country deserve an answer to one simple question.  Does the Minister truly believe the measures he promises will substantially reduce serious crime? What are his targets for the implementation of these measures?  Has he targets for the outcomes in terms of reported crime?  Has he targets for convictions?  How can we measure success?  Without such targets, how can this House hold him to account?  How can the people trust a Government?  Without such targets and without a firm promise that the resources are adequate to tackle the problem, the Government&rsquo;s announcements ring hollow.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the debate on crime held last week in the other House, the Government gave comprehensive replies to a series of questions on gangland crime, Garda numbers and the prison system.  There are figures, statistics and promises to suggest that everything is being done and everything will be all right on the night.  There is no sense of urgency or of a need for a change of course on any policy area.  Why has it taken NASA less time to put a man on the moon and return him safely to earth then it has taken to implement the civilianisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  The reason is there is no sense of urgency and there is an attitude of, &ldquo;Sure, it will do.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Government amendment to this motion is replete with statistics and outlines all the good things that are being done or are about to be done.  The amendment states, in effect, that this is as good as it gets.  This demonstrates the disjoint between Government thinking and what is happening on our streets.  All is not OK.  There must be a renewed focus and sense of urgency to the issue of gun and gangland crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Gangland crime has not been a priority because there has been a view that if criminals are killing criminals it does not matter.  Apart from the absurd and malign thinking behind such sentiments, there is serious collateral damage involved in gangland crime.  This is evidenced by the recent killings of a number of innocent bystanders.  It was only when someone as innocent as Anthony Campbell, a hard-working young man, was gunned down purely because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time that there was a full realisation of how bad the problem has become.</P>
        <P>The shooting of unarmed Garda Sherlock has highlighted once again the urgency of the issue and the need for a review of the arming of the police.  At the very least, it has raised the need <Col N="523"/>for greater armed back-up support for the force in dealing with criminal gangs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite the self-congratulation evident in the Government amendment, there has been a significant deterioration in the level of serious crime.  The Central Statistics Office headline crime statistics for the second quarter of this year show a 43% increase in homicide offences in the second quarter of 2007 compared with 2006; a 19% increase in murder or manslaughter offences in the 12-month period ending in the second quarter of 2007; assaults causing harm up 7% in the same 12-month period; overall drugs offences were up 30% and possession of drugs for sale or supply up 29% in the 12 months to the end of the second quarter of 2007; and an increase of almost 16% in the number of firearms discharged in the second quarter of 2007 compared with the same period last year.  Between 1998 and 2006 there was an almost 600% increase in gun murders, with detection rates falling from 75% to 37% in the same period.  There is no mention of these figures in the Government amendment to the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is easy for opponents of the Government to stand up indignantly and demand that well-worn solution to all of society&rsquo;s problems, the need for more resources.  We accept that it is not possible to have a garda on every corner in the State.  However, the Government has been in power for ten years and when it comes to resources, anyone selling electronic voting machines would know  the purse strings have not been tight.</P>
        <P>The self-congratulatory approach of the Government as set out in the preamble to its amendment is not acceptable.  New thinking is needed but it invariably seems to fall on someone other than the Government to come up with new ideas.  A Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the other House called for mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of road accidents.  Before the D&aacute;il met yesterday and to pre-empt the debate, the Government announced the implementation of the Fine Gael policy.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s speedy adoption of sound policy, but when a Government is reduced to robbing the ideas of its opponents, it appears worryingly redundant.</P>
        <P>It takes the Garda Representative Body to call for a debate on the arming of all garda.  The editorial in the October edition of the <i>Garda Review</i>  states, &ldquo;We are fooling ourselves if we doubt that it might become a necessity in the not too distant future.   We must have greater armed back up readily available in all areas of our cities and around the country.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It would appear that no arrangements have been put in place for greater armed back-up for unarmed garda&iacute;.  The question must be asked whether this Government has ever carried out an assessment of the need for arming units of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with organised crime.  What are the views of the Commissioner-desig<Col N="524"/>nate on this matter?  What resources does he believe the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs? How will he tackle organised crime?  These are the major issues facing policing in this country and I wonder whether the Minister asked him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is one of the more surreal aspects of the Government&rsquo;s approach to this matter that as more Deputies draw ministerial salaries than ever before, fewer Ministers feel that the actions of Government have anything to do with them.  I must admit I cannot name half of the new areas in which we have Ministers of State.  I do know when it comes to crime, the Minister sets policy and the Garda Commissioner carries it out.  If the Commissioner does not deliver the Minister can remove him.  Considering this has not happened, one must assume the Minister is happy with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s performance.  If, as the statistics suggest, one has only a 6% chance of being convicted for murdering someone with a knife and that appallingly low conviction rate is not the fault of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I ask the Minister who is the mysterious person in Government responsible for it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">For all the litany of successes listed in the Government amendment, what has the Government really delivered after being in power for the ten years of the Celtic tiger economy when it had the resources available to invest in crime prevention?  We still have run-down Garda stations, a lack of modern Garda cars and practical support for the garda&iacute; and, as highlighted recently, a lack of armed back-up.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment speaks about state-of-the-art technology for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the latest Garda Inspectorate Report points out that:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . the current state of policy technology in Ireland falls well short of industry standard.  For instance, mobile data devices, secure radio systems, GIS mapping, automated number plate recognition systems, investigative case management and human resources software programmes are among the many standard technology tools now well-established in many modern police services.  The fact that less than 10% of Garda personnel have corporate e-mail addresses is a simple but stark example of the shortcomings and is clearly a great source of frustration to members, particularly those working on the ground.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In light of this damning indictment we can only conclude that the state-of-the-art technology referred to in the Government amendment is spin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government was in power during the ten years in which sex offences came to the fore in Irish life.  However, as the killer of Manuela Riedo is being hunted, garda&iacute; waste precious hours leafing through paper files of sex offenders in their area because no national sex offenders database exists and no DNA database is available to progress it.  This is not the fault of those garda&iacute;. <Col N="525"/> If the culprit is a sex offender, even if he is caught and convicted, Government policy is to release him without rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>Communities in estates across this country cry out for help.  Their children are tempted by drugs and to feed their habit commit minor crimes and fall into the criminal justice system.  In some estates in west and north Dublin and Limerick, a generation of youths has its prospects of a good life ruined.  Some fall further and begin pushing drugs on their neighbours.  They get involved in gangs and terrorise entire communities.  However, no-one makes much money apart from a small cabal of drug-traffickers and gang leaders.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give us a commitment on the targets he hopes to achieve during the next five years?  If he does so he will receive support from this House.  I appreciate he is new to his office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new position as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.   A final borderline was crossed when Garda Paul Sherlock was coldly gunned down on the streets of Dublin recently.  It sent a shockwave through members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and every right-thinking person in the country.  The uniform is no longer a symbolic protection which served Ireland well in the past.  We have a new breed of criminal whose inhibiting brain-mechanisms are overridden by drugs and a ruthlessness and greed for the proceeds of a lucrative and ever-growing drugs trade.  They do not respect the symbols, laws or institutions of the State.</P>
        <P>As Senator Regan stated, no-one wants to see the day when we have a fully-armed police force.  However, we are fooling ourselves if we doubt it might become a reality and even a necessity in the not-too-distant future unless we get to grips with the current crisis.  The very least we must have is a greater armed back-up Garda unit readily available in our cities, towns and throughout the country, separate from detective officers already swamped with criminal investigations, court preparations and files.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The term &ldquo;gang warlords&rdquo; and other such terms romanticise these vicious thugs and criminals who see that big money can be made from drugs.  They have no fear of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na nor qualms about murdering anyone who stands in their way.  They are nasty, violent individuals who threaten the very fabric of our society.  While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an armoury of laws and specialised units to help quell this increasing tide of violent crime, we must continue to be vigilant and ensure that it has the necessary resources at all times.  If further legislation is needed to assist garda&iacute; then let us have it.  If laws dealing with evidence and curtailment of the rights of suspects need to be addressed, then let us address these laws.  The end game is to get these murderous thugs off our streets.</P><Col N="526"/>
        <P Just="Left">I read with interest the third extensive report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, entitled Policing in Ireland &mdash; Looking Forward.  I commend the inspectorate on an excellent report.  It made many recommendations and I will refer to two of them, namely, that community policing be at the core of Irish policing policy permeating the entire police force from top to bottom and that greater visibility of our garda&iacute; can be achieved in both rural and urban communities by reducing the time they spend on court service.  The inspectorate has hit the nail on the head with these recommendations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the Government amendment notes the ongoing provision of state-of-the-art technology to garda&iacute; to enable them to carry out their duties in a more efficient manner, the Garda Inspectorate report stresses the need for better technology to provide real time information to garda&iacute; on the beat most likely to be in the form of hand-held computers or personal digital assistants, PDAs.  The report also states that the technology systems in place could be much better integrated and that new technology systems will be required to bring the organisation to best practice.</P>
        <P>Where does this sit with the Government&rsquo;s amendment which refers to state-of-the-art technology available?  The Government amendment has so many flaws and inaccuracies that it is not worth commenting on.  However, referring in October 2007 to the commencement of the provisions of the Children Act 2001 shows the Government&rsquo;s failure and its inability to tackle any issue.  I formally second the motion so ably proposed by my colleague, Senator Regan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity afforded to me by the House to contribute to this debate on crime.</P>
        <P>To take up on a point made by Senator Cummins, great credit is due to my predecessor for enacting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legislation which provided for the office of the inspector.  When that legislation was debated, it is fair to say that most of the focus of Members of both Houses was on the establishment of the new Garda Ombudsman Commission and the investigation of complaints against garda&iacute;.  The debate on that Bill did not focus very much on the establishment of this office.  It is an important reformative innovation in the administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that we now have a professional external audit of Garda performance.  I assure Members that the recommendations of the inspector, some of which were referred to by Senators Regan and Cummins, are being implemented by the Government.  I am determined to implement them because, so often in these debates on criminal matters, we all give our opinion about how crime can be investigated, detected, punished and dealt with.  To have brought into Ireland a person of the eminence of the current inspector who formerly headed up the police force in Boston is very valuable and I pay tribute to her work.  She reports on the reform of Garda headquarters and on operational matters which I think was the report to which Senator Cummins referred.</P>
        <P>I would like to make one point about crime that every right-thinking person will immediately agree with and which is often forgotten in the heat of debate.  Surprisingly, it was forgotten by those who drafted the motion before the House.  Those who are responsible for the deaths, injuries and destroyed and broken lives which are the result of criminal activity are those who engage in criminal activity.  Being a member of society carries with it an obligation to obey laws which enable all the members of society to enjoy their lives and property without fear or threat.  It is to make this point that the first indent of the countermotion condemns the callous disregard for human life shown by those involved in gun and gang crime.  At the same time, we must be aware that those who seek out and use illicit drugs provide the demand that sustains the drugs industry and the deadly violence associated with it.</P>
        <P>The Government countermotion goes on to deplore attacks on members of the Garda S&iacute;och<Col N="529"/>&aacute;na carrying out their duty to protect the community.  We had a reminder recently of the dangers which members of the force face when going about their duties.  The reprehensible attack on Garda Paul Sherlock in the recent weeks made clear again that the members of criminal gangs will go to any lengths to protect and expand their illegal and harmful dealings.  I know Members have shared in the condemnation of this attack on a member of the force.  We are all relieved that Garda Sherlock is recovering from his injuries.  The Garda is vigorously investigating the attack.</P>
        <P>I hope this debate &mdash; dealing as it does with serious issues &mdash; can be constructive, so I do not propose to dwell at too much length on the terms of the Fine Gael motion which, in part, is tendentious.  The last time that party was in Government, it cancelled the prison building programme, presided over the famous revolving door policy and failed to put even one extra Garda on the street.  Time passes and I have to account for my stewardship of this office in this term of Government.  I accept that.</P>
        <P>It is easy to talk tough on crime but what is needed is to be tough on crime.  That means providing the resources.  There is one statement in the Fine Gael motion with which I agree.  What is needed is a combination of adequate resources for the Garda, effective criminal legislation and innovative policing methods.  I contend that this is precisely what the Government is providing and will continue to provide.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan raised the question of targets which was a fair question.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na set out targets in its annual policing plan.  That is an innovation and a new feature of the legislation my predecessor introduced regulating the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Resources for the Garda are at an unprecedentedly high level.  The Garda budget for this year stands at &euro;1.44 billion compared with just under &euro;900 million five years ago.  Garda overtime this year will amount to approximately &euro;140 million compared with &euro;66 million five years ago.  Since December 2006, approval has been given for the recruitment of 600 additional civilian staff and 300 have been assigned already, releasing garda&iacute; for operational duties.  The Garda fleet is undergoing extensive modernisation.  Last year &euro;24.7 million was used to purchase 1,378 vehicles for the force.</P>
        <P>The size of the force has been expanding through a concentrated programme of recruitment and training.  Senators are welcome to visit the training college in Templemore and see the volume of activity taking place there.  The current programme for Government re-affirms the commitment to a Garda strength of 15,000, with a target date of 2010, and commits us to increasing the strength of the force further to 16,000 by 2012.  Recruitment to the Garda reserve will also continue to be a priority.  One of the vital issues with such a substantial deployment of personnel is the efficient management of the personnel and its <Col N="530"/>deployment in as visible a way as possible to the public.  I welcome the views of the Garda inspectorate in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am determined that the Garda will have access to state-of-the-art technology in carrying out its duties.  Senator Cummins raised the question of the provision of communications equipment and Senator Regan may have touched on it.  In implementing the new national digital radio system during the next two years, more than 17,000 radios will be provided for members of the force in Garda cars and other locations.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A major incident computer system will automate many of the functions currently being performed manually when a major incident occurs.  We are proceeding with an automated number plate recognition system, an automated fingerprint identification system and an automated ballistic identification system.  Closed circuit television systems will be put in place in all major county towns.</P>
        <P>Senators are aware there have been major reforms to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the appointment of the Garda inspectorate, led by former Boston police commissioner, Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, as well as the advisory group on Garda management and leadership development.  As part of the programme of civilianisation, a new civilian head of administration at deputy commissioner level has been appointed.  All these changes are designed to support and equip the Garda in dealing with the complex challenges its faces.</P>
        <P>Other agencies involved in the criminal justice system are also receiving significant resources.  We have been doing that through supporting a prison building programme to ensure when people are convicted, they serve their sentences.  However, the growth of organised criminal gangs outside prison has had obvious consequences within the prison system.  Despite the best efforts of the prison authorities, members of these gangs were able to obtain mobile phones trafficked into the prisons, thus allowing them to maintain their power bases and continue to plan their criminal activities from within the prisons.  There has been a determined drive on this problem since my appointment.  More than 1,600 mobile phones have been confiscated within prisons in recent months.  Criminal bosses exercise influence within prison.  As a result, prisoners who have affiliations to groups on the outside feel under threat from each other, and prisoners with no affiliations can be pressurised to join specific gangs.  This is a serious position.</P>
        <P>Recently the Government approved a package of measures to combat such organised criminal activities in the prisons.  The number of prison officers is being increased to carry out dedicated security duties.  A drug detection dog service and <Col N="531"/>an operational support group specialised in searching for illicit materials are being established.  Drug detection dogs have already been introduced on a pilot basis and operate in the Midlands-Portlaoise Prison, Wheatfield and Cloverhill prisons, the Mountjoy complex, and Cork and Limerick prisons.  Security screening with X-ray or metal detectors for all staff and visitors entering prisons is being introduced, as are two segregation units for gang leaders in Cloverhill Prison.  Some 160 staff are being fast-tracked through the recruit prison officer training programme to provide staff for these new security initiatives, and other steps are being taken to hire suitable staff quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Electronic equipment to prevent the use of mobile phones has been installed in the Midlands Prison.  Testing is under way and is expected to be completed very soon.  The results so far are positive and, if confirmed, the equipment will be installed in all other closed prisons over an 18-month period.  Mandatory drug testing across the prison system is being introduced now that the new prison rules have become operative.  Additional resources are being introduced to allow prisoners access to addiction counselling and to improve the quality, co-ordination and availability of drug treatment in prisons.</P>
        <P>I agree with the principal Opposition party when it says that gangland crime is a serious phenomenon.  My first duty as Minister is to secure prisons against the writ of these gangs and then take the war onto the streets and confront them there.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has introduced innovative policing methods and will continue to do so.  Senators will be aware that Operation Anvil has been specifically directed against the activities of these gangs, especially in Dublin, but also in other parts of the country.  Figures I received from the Garda Commissioner show that from its beginning in May 2005 to 9 September last, 768 firearms have been recovered, 37,437 searches for drugs have taken place and more than 70,000 checkpoints established.  These figures make clear the unrelenting nature of the activity being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with these problems.</P>
        <P>Some debate is taking place at present on whether garda&iacute; should be routinely armed and how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should respond to the existence of armed criminals.  It has been one of the great strengths of the force that its members do not carry guns as a matter of routine.  I believe that is the way many members of the force want to keep it.  At the same time, the force must be equipped to deal with the challenges it faces, which is why members assigned to particular duties carry firearms.  Just under 3,500 garda&iacute; are currently authorised to carry firearms and can be called on to do so as the need arises.  This is a matter for operational decision by the Garda authorities, and these decisions are made taking into account the paramount importance of the <Col N="532"/>safety of members of the force and the public.  The balanced approach leaves the Garda authorities the operational discretion to use armed garda&iacute; where they think fit, rather than going down the road of arming every member of the force.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act gives me as Minister the power to determine priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commissioner will continue to keep me informed of the measures being taken to meet priorities that are set.  I am now in the course of determining those priorities for 2008 and have been consulting my colleagues about them.  My intention is to prioritise areas such as gun crime, organised crime and drugs and public order.  The priorities will emphasise the importance of profiling, intelligence gathering and threat assessments on the individuals and groups identified as involved in this type of crime.  I intend to include in the priorities a specific reference to enhanced liaison arrangements between individual Garda divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau in the pursuit of those engaged in drug dealing at all levels.  As it is, profilers trained by the Criminal Assets Bureau are now present in every Garda division.  The message should be clear: drug dealing by anybody on whatever scale is unacceptable and will be pursued.  In addition I propose to set a priority relating to enhanced activities by the drugs units and the force in focusing on places throughout the country where the presence of drug dealing and the consumption of illicit drugs is likely.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone cannot tackle the problems of crime that we face as a society that has rapidly been becoming more complex and diverse.  As a consequence, it is only through partnership between the different parts of our society that we can effectively tackle crime.  As I want to foster that spirit, I attach great importance, as I am sure Senators do, to establishing a joint policing committee in each local authority area, as the Oireachtas prescribed in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  These committees provide a forum where members of the local authority for an area and the senior Garda officers responsible for policing the area, together with Oireachtas Members and community and voluntary interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting policing of their community.  On the one hand, these committees should make policing more responsive to community needs.  On the other hand, they should make the job of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling particular problems easier by providing a forum for co-operation with all the interests involved.</P>
        <P>Some 29 committees are now operating on a pilot basis.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and I are examining what lessons can be learned from the operation of the pilot and we intend to have committees operational in all local authority areas as early as possible next year.  One of the priorities I intend to establish for the <Col N="533"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is full and effective participation in the work of these committees.</P>
        <P>I propose to include a number of priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to the expansion of the juvenile liaison scheme and the number of Garda youth diversion projects; the monitoring of sex offenders; combating homophobic and race crimes; co-operating with the newly established domestic violence executive agency, COSC, in curbing the problem of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; targeting the use of knives in violent attacks; and taking measures to deal with the evils of human trafficking.  The priority of dealing with terrorism, both domestic and international, will of course remain.  Other priorities will cover areas such as road traffic law enforcement and immigration controls, which are not directly related to this debate.  No significance should be read into the non-inclusion of particular types of crime in the priorities mentioned by me.  Priorities cannot include all the functions of the Garda &mdash; setting too many priorities carries with it the danger in reality of setting none.</P>
        <P>It is vital we ensure to the greatest degree possible that our young persons do not enter the criminal justice system as offenders or, if they do, that the system deals with them in a way that allows them to become full members of society again.  The Children Act 2001, as amended, set out an effective youth justice system, one based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use by the courts of community-based sanctions and measures, and the use of detention in the case of young offenders as a last resort.</P>
        <P>Recent measures have reformed our entire approach to youth justice through the establishment of the Irish youth justice service.  Apart from the criminal law, we have a range of initiatives in place to get at the root causes of anti-social behaviour by youngsters.  The Garda juvenile diversion programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting them away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Government approved a juvenile justice and child protection package.  The number of judges of the District Court to be assigned specifically to these cases will increase by three.  There will be 88 additional professional and administrative posts in the probation and welfare service.  Young persons probation, a division of the probation and welfare service to deal with young people under 18, has been established.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a point about the criminal law.  There can be a tendency for no account to be taken of the fact that our basic criminal law, which has been on the Statute Book for years, continues to provide us with the fundamental armoury in the fight against crime.  The obvious example is the law on homicide.  Nevertheless, we have made extensive changes in the criminal law in order to adapt it to the modern realities with <Col N="534"/>which we must contend.  On the one hand we have people who say we have done too little and on the other hand there are those who claim we have had too much criminal law reform too quickly.</P>
        <P>The Government and its predecessors have introduced a range of effective criminal legislation.  Two substantive Criminal Justice Acts were enacted in 2006 and 2007.  As well as addressing issues arising from organised crime, they updated procedural issues and addressed issues relating to lower level crime.  The Prisons Act 2007 addresses serious issues relating to the conduct in prison by those sentenced for serious offences.</P>
        <P>The 2006 Act criminalises, for the first time, participation in and assisting organised criminal gangs.  It updates offences and penalties for firearms offences and introduces heavier sentences of between five and ten years for those offences.  New drug trafficking offences are created covering the importation of drugs valued at more than &euro;13,000 and the supply of controlled drugs to prisons.  A new offence of possession of articles for use in connection with certain offences, including kidnapping, has been created.  This offence has been extended in the 2007 Act to cover money as well as articles for use in connection with a range of serious offences.</P>
        <P>I could say much more on the subject.  I look forward to listening to Senators and to studying what they have to say.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Just over 25 years ago I had the experience of being at the receiving end of a kidnap threat.  Armed garda&iacute; protected my family and me for some time.  At that stage I fully appreciated that we had the ability to arm garda&iacute; if we wanted to on occasions of concern.  However, in the fight against crime we must all do out best to ensure we do not need to resort to that in the future.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to spend some time with the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.  He explained why he wanted to opt out of a number of clauses in the reform treaty, which was that he wished Britain could <Col N="535"/>combat crime in the manner it wished.  That may not apply in the same way to the Irish position and we may not certainly agree but this is not the time to debate the opt-out clause.  However, Ireland must protect itself regarding its ability to fight crime in various ways.  Our criminal justice code is based on the common law system under which one is innocent until one is proven guilty whereas the Napoleonic code, which applies throughout the rest of Europe, has a different basis.  I am a committed European but I can understand that certain aspects of the reform treaty need to be controlled by ourselves.</P>
        <P>I spent time a number of years ago with V&aacute;clav Klaus, the current President of the Czech Republic, who was prime minister at the time.  When I mentioned my enthusiasm for the European Union, he said he was in favour of a united Europe but he had a big brother in Moscow for 40 years and he did not want to substitute a big brother in Brussels for him.  His views are not necessarily politically correct in Europe nowadays but it should be ensured the subsidiarity that has always applied in Europe means legislation and regulations can be kept close to home rather than being passed up to Brussels.  I make this case particularly in regard to crime.</P>
        <P>We do not have the same position on crime as others.  For example, the media&rsquo;s sin is the way they present crime stories as if they were much more common than they are.  They very rarely point out that, even with the dramatic increase in violent crime in the past few years, the level of such crime is relatively low in Ireland compared with international standards but to read the newspapers and to listen to or watch the broadcast media, one would be forgiven for making the inference that Ireland is the leading crime country in the world.  I do not say we should turn a blind eye to that but let us make sure, in combating crime, we do not go over the top.  Let us make sure crime is combatted in a manner that will protect our citizens without losing the dignity and perseverance of elements in our society, which we should make sure we do not lose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for allowing me the opportunity to contribute.  I welcome the Minister.  I refer to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comment on the question of arming the Garda.  The Minister referred to Katherine O&rsquo;Toole, a most distinguished woman.  I listened to her on radio the other day and she came across as extremely clear and cool and as a very practical woman.  She did not want the Garda to be armed in the way that was called for in the House last week and neither do I, as I agree with Senator Quinn.  Almost since the foundation of the State, we have had an unarmed Garda force, which is admired all over the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, the ongoing gangland battles are a problem and the people wish to be protected.  It is appropriate that we have, and strengthen, a rapid <Col N="536"/>response unit comprising marksmen who are professionally trained.  I spoke to senior members of the Garda earlier &mdash; I, unfortunately, do not confer with prime ministers as regularly as my colleague &mdash; and they also indicated that they do not want guns but they would like the response force.  This is the usual ding dong debate where we are presented with a Fine Gael motion and a Government amendment is attached to it, welcoming and commending such and such.  However, the Fine Gael motion contains a specific concentration on the gun issue, which is lacking in the Government&rsquo;s amendment, which praises all kinds of things.  It is important to focus on the gun issue.  I would be happy with increases in penalties to the most severe level for crimes such as the possession of firearms because we must get to them before they are used.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This relates to the drugs issue.  Guns are brought into the State with large-scale drug imports.  I do not want to rehash my contribution to the earlier debate but if the Minister is interested, it is on the record.  It is time to debate the legalisation of drugs at national level.  The Minister will not agree with this and this cannot be done by Ireland alone.  Such legalisation would have to be introduced on a Europe-wide basis at least.  That would remove the financial incentive, which is necessary.  The then Government took up an idea a number of years ago that had been promoted by Deputy Gregory, which was the formation of a Criminal Assets Bureau.  It strikes at the financial base of criminals.  They have demonstrated they are not sensitive to human feeling and they must be hit in their wallets.</P>
        <P>The criminalisation of drugs must be examined.  In the short term, I would support the Government parties in whatever they can do to assist, at a critical juncture, people who are addicted to heroin and who have been placed at a considerable disadvantage by the withdrawal of methadone services by pharmacists.  This is dangerous and irresponsible.  These people are among the most vulnerable in our community and their addiction may be triggered again by this withdrawal of service.  If that happens, that may lead to circumstances in which they commit further crime.</P>
        <P>The motion targets gun crime, about which people are worried.  Gun crime has increased considerably and that is the primary issue that needs to be examined while the drugs problem lies beneath it.  They both must be examined together in a radical manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The increase in gun crime is frightening and alarming, particularly in Dublin and other cities.  Thankfully, it is not a major issue in my home city of Cork.  Most murders involving guns are gangland-related and they stem from drug wars and the money that can be made from drugs.  A number of drug traffickers are very wealthy and ruthless and their ambition is to make more money while protecting their <Col N="537"/>turf.  This involves the necessity of killing off opponents in many instances.  Some people take the callous view, which I do not support, that if one lives by the sword, one deserves to die by the sword and people who engage in criminal activity, particularly involving drugs, and who are armed and hire professional hitmen to take out their opponents are only killing each other off.  I recently read a newspaper report about professional, trained hitmen and mercenaries who are flown in from abroad to take out people before leaving again.  That is a frightening prospect for our society to face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister and other speakers referred to the incident involving Garda Sherlock, which was deplorable.  One crime commentator reported that the guys he stopped were on a mission.  He was checking out a stolen car but these guys were &ldquo;focused and psyched up&rdquo; about what they were doing.  They might have been drugged up but they were on a mission and they had no fear about taking out whoever came in their way, whether it was a garda or a civilian.  The Government can be condemned about resources and legislation.  The previous Minister and his predecessor were sometimes lambasted in the D&aacute;il and in other fora for introducing reams of legislation and there is an abundance of legislation on the Statute Book.  One can throw all the resources one wants at crime but more and more people are using drugs in our society.  Twenty or 30 years ago, drugs were confined to deprived areas in parts of our cities and they were a scourge on the less well-off in society.  The drugs culture is expanding, however, as increasing numbers of middle class people use cocaine and other drugs.  As our society generates a greater demand for leisure drugs, more drugs enter the State and drug barons make more money and become more vicious in doing what is necessary to protect their patch.  Citizens must face up to this frightening reality.  In every area, there are people who know the identity of the drug barons and hit men.  Unless this information is conveyed to garda&iacute;, their task is increasingly difficult if not impossible.</P>
        <P>In my area of west Cork, a substantial consignment of drugs was intercepted off the coast earlier this year.  I made the point many years ago that west Cork is wide open to such activity because we face some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.  In many instances, the drugs consignments that arrive on our shores also include shipments of guns.  The sophistication of the weaponry being used by criminals on our streets is frightening, including automatic and semi-automatic guns.  These are the weapons used by foreign armies.  The last Government introduced legislation to impose greater penalties on persons in possession of unlicensed firearms.  Significant progress has been achieved by the Garda under Operation Anvil but we must be more vigilant.  The Garda must roll out other operations to ensure as many guns as possible are taken out of circulation.</P><Col N="538"/>
        <P>The brazenness of some of these criminals and the lengths to which they will go to safeguard their activities are startling.  In Limerick recently, for example, a person was shot within 50 m or 60 m of where two emergency response unit members were on patrol.  Through follow-up searches in Limerick, garda&iacute; have discovered that in many instances, these thugs use innocent people to hide guns.  Fearful for their lives, ordinary people may agree to conceal weapons in their attics or sheds.  The homes of the criminals, meanwhile, are clean.</P>
        <P>In the context of the increase in the prevalence of particular crimes, such as homicides using guns, one wonders whether we should categorise the various types of murders.  I accept that a murder is a murder, but there is a situation in some areas, especially in Dublin, where criminal gangs, sometimes through the deployment of hit men, take out other criminals in a tit-for-tat territorial turf war.  Such murders have become frighteningly prominent in the past five years.  On the other hand, we have cases such as that of the unfortunate young woman in south Tipperary who lost her life.  This was a homicide that took place in different circumstances and where no guns were involved.  It has been described as a frenzied knife attack.  We can only hope that her brother, who is fighting for his life in hospital, will survive.  In other instances, murders take place in the context of domestic violence.</P>
        <P>Close to the quiet town of Dunmanway in my own constituency, a body was found recently in a slurry tank.  People I have spoken to in my community in recent days are encouraged and reassured by the information that seven people have been questioned by the Garda in regard to this matter.  Going further back, one of the most prominent unsolved crimes is the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in west Cork in 1996.  While canvassing for the local elections in 1999, I encountered people in that locality who promised to vote for me if I could find her murderer.  This was a shocking crime &mdash; an innocent holidaymaker bashed to death just days before Christmas &mdash; and it remains prominent in the minds of people in that community.</P>
        <P>In supporting the amendment to this motion, I commend the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government on the significant progress that has been made in the past ten years in introducing legislation to combat crime.  In regard to drugs and gun crime, it seems that in many instances, the Judiciary has ignored the minimum mandatory penalties as laid down by the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I, too, wish Garda Sherlock well in his recovery.  For a servant of the State to be shot down while carrying out his brief was a most horrendous event.  Drugs and crime are irrevocably linked.  Increasingly, it <Col N="539"/>is juveniles who are involved in these crimes and we do not have suitable places of detention for them.  Neither adult prisons nor psychiatric units are suitable.</P>
        <P>How are decisions made regarding the numbers of garda&iacute; assigned to a particular area?  Tralee, for instance, although the same size as Clonmel, has twice as many garda&iacute;.  Much credit is due to the Garda and the work its members undertake throughout the State.  I particularly appreciate the achievement of garda&iacute; in Clonmel in respect of their juvenile liaison activities.  Alcohol-free events, which provide a positive outlet for hundreds of young people, have been organised in the town.  The student garda&iacute; who attend these events foster a relationship with young people in the community.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>More community garda&iacute; must be assigned to communities.  In addition, closed circuit television should be installed in all urban centres and we should make more effective use of it.  The garda&iacute; in Clonmel work hard but are operating out of a medieval building that is not suitable to the needs of a modern police force.  They have neither the privacy nor the facilities to assist them in carrying out their functions, but they do so with great efficiency.  It was one of the aims of the county development plan to identify a new site for a Garda station, but there has been no progress in this regard.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Some 3,500 mobile telephones have been seized in prisons.  Given the existence of technology for identifying when mobile telephones are in use, it should not be difficult to identify whether a specific location, such as a prison centre, shows an abnormally high usage.  However, I welcome the seizure of these devices, which will ensure criminals can no longer conduct activities from within the facilities to which they are confined to prevent them causing further hardship to citizens.</P>
      
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate when a new Garda station site will be identified for Clonmel, which is a very busy urban centre?  When will there be an increase in Garda numbers and when will closed circuit television be provided for the town?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is always a danger in debates about crime when politicians and even political parties put themselves forward as being the politician or political party most in favour of law and order.  Nobody in public life is opposed to the law being properly applied and nobody in public life believes chaos and anarchy is preferable to order.  The danger is if a person or party is put on a particular pedestal, there is an implication that people somehow accept the idea of serious crimes about the person, the existence of murders and the prevalence of weapons of personal destruction in society.</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>This is far from the case.  Unfortunately, we have experienced an increase in the number of serious crimes in our society in recent years, but in international and European terms, the rates of such crimes are still very low.  The problem is when debate and media reportage is conducted on these terms, we end up with something that is not a dialogue for trying to deal with the root causes or prevent the incidence of such crimes.  Instead we have a glamourisation of serious crime, such as gangland murders.</P>
        <P>There are incidents of gang activity and drug trade which sometimes result in killings.  An analysis, however, demonstrates that most violent deaths in this country are caused by people known to the victim.  Such analysis indicates many of these people are family members.  In international terms, these crimes are of a relatively low incidence.  To protect the ultimate victims, we should try to prevent the circumstances in which people commit these crimes.</P>
        <P>Although we need to fight against people being killed by guns and knives, incidents of which we have seen in recent weeks, we must also face the fact that the most numerous of serious crimes against the person in this country are physical assaults.  They can be seen on most weekend nights and many weekdays in towns, villages and cities.  In my city it is not unusual to see accident and emergency wards dealing with the victims of such crimes.</P>
        <P>People who die in gangland killings are painted in cartoon terms by news reporting which says they were known to the Garda.  This leads to much reduced public sympathy for a life which seemed to be of less value than others.  We seem to think the damage done in much of the fracas occurring every weeknight is a case of young men letting off steam.  The reality is different.  Many of these drunken fist fights and worse do not even fall under such neatly defined categories.</P>
        <P>Young women gouge other young women.  Some heroes of modern Ireland, fuelled with alcohol, believe it is fine to kick young women in the face and disfigure them.  That is an example of the serious crime in this country.  That is as much a responsibility of individuals and a failure of the society we have created than any lack of laws or resources being provided to law enforcement in this country.</P>
        <P>If we want to identify why serious crime exists in this country and why the level of it is creeping upwards, we must ask why there is such a shortage of shame.  Why is there a near-absence of remorse?  These are the responsibilities we have as public representatives in dealing rationally with this subject.  We could promote as many laws as we like but if those qualities are diminishing or lacking in society, we must fear for the type of society we are creating.</P>
        <P>I would prefer a more apolitical and all-party approach.  There is nothing to be gained by cast<Col N="541"/>ing stones or name-calling on this issue.  Those who are the victims of crime gain nothing from that and it does not stop the disfiguring, maiming or killing of people.  We have a responsibility to try to bring out a different society in this country and I am not sure it is helped by motions of this nature.  We must be more honest with each other as legislators and political activists.  We have a shared responsibility for the type of society we have created.  I would prefer if debates of this nature were conducted with this in mind.</P>
        <P>I do not have any great confidence this will come about and I suspect we will return to this theme quite regularly.  On the Order of Business each day there will be requests for more debates of this nature.  Fingers will be pointed and accusations made and yet, as I have stated, it will change nothing in terms of damage done to individuals as a result of serious crime.  Such crime does not exist because of the type of legislation or resources provided to the police.  Its sole cause is the collective responsibility we have for the society we have created.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This problem will not be solved by accusations or finger pointing but rather by accepting this collective responsibility.  I speak as someone whose own family has experienced this type of serious crime in recent weeks.  If we engage in this type of pantomime politics, nothing will be added to the reality of people&rsquo;s everyday lives.  We have no right to speak about crime as if it is something we can gain political advantage from.  People live with it every day and we have a responsibility to diminish the fear engaged by debates of this type and media reportage so that people can live their lives in society free from such fear.  Debates of this type will not help in bringing that about.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  I am disappointed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has left the House given the importance of today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Regan on the timely nature and relevance of the motion tabled.  I am an ordinary citizen, a mother and an educator and I am concerned about the growth in crime rates in our society.  It should be our aim to leave no stone unturned in protecting our citizens and garda&iacute;.  In particular, we should enable and equip the Garda to tackle crime quickly and efficiently.  Our garda&iacute; are sitting ducks for anybody to take a pot shot at, which is not good enough for servants of our State.</P>
        <P>Public confidence is fast disappearing in the fight against crime.  I opened a national newspaper yesterday to find eight major headlines on crime, ranging from rape to murder to attacks on the person.  Crime is becoming so commonplace now, my concern is we will get used to it and become immune to hearing about it.  Such an attitude would lead to us all being at risk.</P><Col N="542"/>
        <P>We live in a different time and this different environment requires different measures at both proactive and reactive levels.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has good intentions but they are not working adequately in practice.  It appears we are fast losing the fight against serious crime.</P>
        <P>The motion tabled by Senator Regan outlines the need for a comprehensive plan, of which I will discuss some main points.  The first deals with community policing and another with the sources of crime, to which Senator Dan Boyle has alluded.  That is an important issue, and to call this debate pantomime politics is insulting.</P>
        <P>Another matter on which I wish to focus is the need to equip garda&iacute; in order to ensure they are one step ahead of criminals.  The latter have no place in society and it is outrageous that we are being outwitted and outsmarted by them.  Ireland is becoming the place for criminals to be but this should not be the case.</P>
        <P>The first issue I wish to consider in this regard relates to community policing.  I am a member of the pilot policing committee that was established in Galway and I admit that it has been a great development.  The committee works in conjunction with the local authority and some of its members are local community representatives.  It gathers information and is able to resolve problems in Galway, regardless of the areas in which they occur.  However, what good is such a committee if there is a lack of manpower to use the information it has compiled in order to curb the growth of crime?  The answer is simple.  I spoke to the Garda authorities in Galway this morning and I was informed that in order to implement the concept of community policing, all they need is five community garda&iacute;.  I am extremely impressed by the attitude of garda&iacute; in Galway towards curbing the growth of crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the detective sergeants to whom I spoke earlier informed me that they had taken their eyes off the ball.  He stated that in the past local community garda&iacute; had been very good at being the friendly face of officialdom.  As crime has become more serious and criminals more hardened, the Garda lost focus.</P>
        <P>There are many levels at which crime must be fought.  Garda&iacute; must operate at community level.  I live in Oranmore, which has a population of over 6,000 but no community garda.  The officers to whom I spoke this morning stated that an average of one community garda per 5,000 is required.  Perhaps the Minister of State present will pass on my comments on this matter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask him to forward a response to them, indicating what are the plans for the future in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fear for our society, particularly if we continue to ignore the 20% to 25% of children in secondary schools that are completely turned off by the education system.  The justice and edu<Col N="543"/>cation systems must work in tandem to develop an overall system that is relevant to children in second level education.  The ESRI report issued last week stated that by the time the children to whom I refer come to sit the junior certificate, they have already lost their interest in education.  I know many of these children and I work with thousands of them each year throughout the country.  The exam-driven system that exists at second level has no relevance to their real lives.  They are not turned on by it; they are bored by it.  There are major discipline problems in classrooms and we need to provide an education system which means something to these children and which will provide them with the skills that will ensure they feel they have a real purpose in life.  For example, we could provide them with driver education.  These children value driving because they are going out, ripping off cars and joyriding in them.  If we teach them to drive, they might have more respect for the vehicles they use.  There is a great deal to do in this regard.</P>
        <P>Many of the children to whom I refer experience literacy problems.  John Lonergan has referred on many occasions to this issue in the context of many of the inmates at Mountjoy Prison.  I will, in another guise, be discussing this matter with the Minister for Education and Science.  These children need a curriculum to which they can relate and we must provide them with meaningful skills.</P>
        <P>It costs the State &euro;100,000 per year each to keep children who become offenders in detention centres or prisons.  I commend the youth diversion projects that are in place but these need to be broadened and become more widespread.  At a cost of &euro;80,000 per year, 20 young offenders in Galway who have been caught and cautioned on one occasion now have more favourable relations with the police.  The success rate of these projects shows that 75% of these young people do not reoffend.  What do garda&iacute; do with these individuals?  The bring them fishing, for example, in order to build up one-to-one relationships with and get to know them.  These children have real personal problems.  There needs to be much more of this sort of engagement.</P>
        <P>My final point relates to the need for a comprehensive DNA database.  We must introduce legislation similar to that which exists in most other countries in order to give garda&iacute; the power to take DNA samples and store them on a comprehensive database.  This will enable us to outsmart criminals.  Proof of the power of DNA evidence was clearly shown in a case in Galway some years ago involving a rapist who was convicted on the basis of a DNA sample taken from the victim.  A match was not found in Ireland because we do not have a DNA database.  When the sample was sent to the British authorities, however, a match was found with a DNA sample taken in Wales in <Col N="544"/>respect of a driving infringement.  The perpetrator in this case was Irish.</P>
        <P>Figures for last year show that there are 114 nationals from other EU countries and 130 non-EU nationals in our prisons.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s hands are tied and its time is being wasted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I would like it if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would take on board the three points I made in respect of community policing, co-operation with the education system and the immediate introduction of legislation relating to the provision of a comprehensive database to help in the fight against crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a tendency on the part of Opposition parties to conjure up a crime crisis following a spate of individual murders, despite the fact that there is no statistical basis for so doing.  The Fine Gael Party recently called for the Army to be drafted in to deal with crime.  In reality, however, this year&rsquo;s homicide rate is lower than that which obtained last year, with some deaths resulting from personal problems as opposed to gangland criminality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To deal with crime, we must first consider its causes and show how Ireland reached this point.  Statistics show that in comparison with the EU average, the homicide rate in Ireland was quite low until approximately ten years ago.  The increase since then, which is to be deeply regretted, unfortunately represents Ireland coming into line with the international norm.  The improving economy has led to an explosion in the demand for drugs.  With financial incentives so high, it is little wonder that gangs are so willing to kill each other&rsquo;s members in order to protect their lucrative empires.</P>
        <P>When former British Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that his Government wanted to be tough on crime and the causes of crime, he was accused of uttering a soundite.  However, his approach was essentially sound.  In a way, the phrase he used hides more than it reveals.  We know the nature of the law but we do not know what are the causes of crime because these are extremely complex.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P>How is it that the murder rate in Ireland is running at a multiple of what it was in the 1960s?  In material terms we are better off.  Nevertheless, we cannot overlook the fact that young men in general and both men and women from certain socially deprived areas and groups are still over-represented in our prisons.  This suggests a link between relative social disadvantage and crime.  However, there is a difference between a link and a cause.  How is it that some people brought up in almost identical circumstances and environments &mdash; even members of the same families &mdash; can go on to lead worthwhile lives while others become involved in lives of crime?  There is a danger in over-emphasising social factors as if to absolve people of responsibility for their actions.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate truth that in many cases victims suffer from disadvantages similar to those suffered by the perpetrators of crime.  That said, the Government must be conscious that a range of decisions we make on social issues can have an effect, which is why I congratulate the Minister in his previous role as Minister for State for putting an approach to youth justice issues on a formal footing.  With the implementation of the Children Act and, in particular, the establishment of the new youth justice service, the proper structures are at last in place to deal with young people.  The programme for Government is committed to doubling the number of Garda youth diversion projects.  The SAFE project in my home town of Wexford works very well and, in a low-key way, keeps young people out of trouble.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to ensure the probation and welfare service is resourced and restructured in the context of the full implementation of the Children Act.  Investment in this area will come back to benefit us.  It will help prevent young people throwing their lives away and becoming involved in serious crime.</P>
        <P>In respect of the wider criminal justice, I would encourage the Minister to look at the following issue.  The new organised crime unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has enjoyed significant success in the past two years but more resources and manpower must be put into targeting minor criminals and drug dealers.  In 2005, which is the last year for which figures are available, out of over 80 criminals brought before the courts who were eligible for the ten-year term, just ten received the mandatory sentence for having been found with drugs worth over &euro;13,000.  If the full term had been handed down by the courts, it might have been used as the disincentive it was intended to be.  I welcome the advancement of investment in our prison service because this will assist in tackling this serious problem.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to deal with the recent call by Fine Gael to send in the Army.  This is a classic panic reaction that does no justice to politics.  First, the Army has no powers of arrest <Col N="546"/>so even if soldiers witnessed a crime, they would have no power to stop it.  Second, the Army has no training in policing.  Lastly, such a measure would give the impression both home and abroad that the State has lost control.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his commitment to develop partnerships with the communities as a mainstay to tackling crime.  The new joint policing committees are providing a forum for local councillors, garda&iacute;, Members of the Oireachtas and interest groups who can consult, discuss and make recommendations on a matter affecting policing in local areas.  No doubt anti-social behaviour will feature considerably in these committees.  These people, who make misery for their neighbours, must be tackled effectively.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s Department is looking at the question of community payback and restorative justice and I urge him to explore how we could make more direct connections between the offence and reparation to the community affected by the criminal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another way of underpinning partnership with the community is through the expansion of the Garda CCTV scheme.  This can play an important role in supporting the work of garda&iacute; and deterring criminal and anti-social behaviour.  CCTV is not an alternative to garda&iacute; on frontline duty but it can act as an effective aid.  The community CCTV scheme has added benefit for local areas which have it so I urge the Minister to roll it out as soon as possible in all the major towns and villages in Ireland.  Some say CCTV represents an intrusion of privacy but it is more in the mould of a benign and sensible Big Brother.</P>
        <P>There can be no doubt that gangland activity poses a clear and present danger.  Such activities are almost inextricably linked to the market in illegal drugs.  As a society, we must address the demand for illicit drugs.  There has been considerable debate on this so I will not go into it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no point in underestimating the difficulties garda&iacute; face in trying to bring killings to an end.  They have launched and will continue to launch and undertake countless operations aimed at saving the lives of those involved.  They get no help from the people they are trying to protect and when the killings take place, they can get no co-operation either.</P>
        <P>To condemn these killings as, in some way, representing a failure on the part of the Garda or the Government flies in the face of the harsh realities involved.  It is no consolation that these killings take place among members of the criminal fraternity.  To take that view would be to share their disregard and lack of respect for human life.  Tragically, their activities have also spilled out into the law-abiding community.</P>
        <P>The fight against these gangs will be long and relentless.  I am satisfied the Government is providing the Garda with the resources described by the Minister today and will continue to do so.  I <Col N="547"/>also understand that the Garda Commissioner has been assured by the Minister that there is no limit to the funding available under the witness protection programme.</P>
        <P>Criminal law and its reform are living things and must take account of the constantly evolving nature of our society.  That said, I am enthusiastic about the series of measures contained in the programme for Government and commend the Minister on his calm and reasoned handling of his brief since he came to office.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to engage in a debate on this issue, in which I have a strong personal interest, having worked for years as practitioner in the criminal justice system and teaching criminal law in Trinity College.  It is important that we do not engage in pantomime politics.  Rather than being a Punch and Judy show, I was going to start by making some constructive comments and welcoming some of the things the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said and some things which have been implemented by the previous Government.  </P>
        <P>The Minister is right in that the Garda Ombudsman Commission has been a welcome development and the changes in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act have meant that important reforms have taken place in the Garda.  That is not to say that there are not flaws in the system.  At the time the Garda Ombudsman Commission was established I and others were very critical of the fact that it was to be a three-person commission rather than following the much stronger model of the one-person ombudsman, such as that held by Nuala O&rsquo;Loan in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments about retaining a balanced approach to the arming of garda&iacute;.  The current Garda review, which I believe we have all received, calls for a debate on the need to arm the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Most of us here would agree that the present situation, where we have an unarmed force with the ability to have some specialist armed members, is a better approach to policing and has served us well.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I take issue with some of the accepted wisdom adopted by the Minister in his speech.  First, the idea that the criminal justice legislation of 2006 and 2007 in any way represents an effective approach to dealing with the serious problem of gangland crime is misleading.  I do not believe the changes brought about by that legislation will have the effect the Minister wishes them to have.</P>
        <P>I believe, and I believe it is widely accepted, that these changes were brought in with undue haste and without time for adequate debate and sufficient consideration of how they would impact on due process and procedures in criminal trials. <Col N="548"/> We have all seen in the past the serious problems that can occur when there is what may be termed a &ldquo;conviction at all costs&rdquo; culture within any policing system.  In particular, we can think about the miscarriages of justice that occurred in Great Britain during the 1980s and those which occurred in recent years here.  What is often overlooked is that when the innocent are wrongly convicted, the guilty go free, which is in nobody&rsquo;s interests, least of all those of victims of crime.  We must be very careful about encroaching unduly on the due process rights of the accused.</P>
        <P>We must also be careful about things like mandatory minimum sentences.  There is no evidence that these are effective in reducing crime.  The Judiciary has been heavily criticised by politicians on the Government side for failing to apply ten-year minimum sentences.  However, the Judiciary was rightly given a discretion that where exceptional circumstances existed, those minimum sentences would not be applied.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the big drug bosses are not the people who are likely to get these sentences.  It is the smaller people, often addicts themselves, so-called drug mules and foreign nationals, as someone already mentioned, who are liable to be convicted.  These are the people who are liable to get the ten-year sentences.  What purpose does that serve in terms of rehabilitating offenders, stopping gangland killings and helping victims of crime?</P>
        <P>We must also be clear that what assists in successful prosecutions is the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we build trust in communities as successful prosecution requires evidence and witnesses must be encouraged to come forward through strengthening witness protection schemes and increasing the powers and numbers of community garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>We have already had a debate on drugs and I echo the comments of my colleague, Senator <Col N="549"/>Norris, that we need a radical review of our drugs policy.  We are already rightly providing methadone to registered addicts.  Increasing methadone provision is held by those who have analysed this to be largely responsible for the large decrease in property crime in the late 1990s.  We must be clear about the need to increase funding for heroin addicts to ensure that they are given access to methadone treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to examine prison policy.  In that regard, I would challenge those who suggested it is a positive development to have more prison places.  Containment is not the answer.  We need to examine the rehabilitation of those who are in our prisons to seriously take account of the critical comments of the committee for the prevention of torture on the dreadful conditions of our prisons, notably Mountjoy and St. Patrick&rsquo;s.  I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform why the Connect project, an important one for the rehabilitation of prisoners within the system, has been discontinued.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about tackling crime we need, as previous speakers said, to tackle the causes of it and to examine the rehabilitation of offenders.  We need to examine serious measures to increase trust within communities and to build successful cases to ensure that the persons responsible for crime will be convicted but that in the process we do not trample unduly on the rights of accused persons.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Seanad&oacute;ir Bacik as a cuid ama a roinnt liom agus deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</P>
        <P>We do not need more criminal legislation, rather what we need is effective redeployment of the Garda.  A robust process of civilianisation would allow for more effective and focused use of existing resources, including a doubling of resources allocated to the national and local drug units.</P>
        <P>There can be no doubt that increased gun crime here is directly linked to the increased prevalence of drugs in our communities.  A cache of guns and ammunition accompanies every major shipment of drugs entering the country.  Therefore, to seriously tackle gun crime, we also need to focus on tackling the drugs crisis.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a set of proposals to tackle serious drug and gun crime, which it submitted to the Garda and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The implementation of these proposals would result in the freeing up of approximately 4,000 garda&iacute; from administrative tasks who could be redeployed in the fight against serious drug and gun crime.  It must be demoralising for garda&iacute; who are fully trained to fight crime to be stuck behind a desk.  How many of them could be fighting drug and gun crime on <Col N="550"/>our streets?  How many more people have to be gunned down before the Minister acts?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s recommendations on tackling serious drug and gun crime include the continued and increased pursuit of major drug traffickers and lower level dealers; a doubling of the resources allocated to the Garda drug units; the disbanding, retraining and deploying of the Garda special branch to focus on organised crime; and increasing garda patrols, on foot and bicycle, in areas experiencing chronic problems of public drug dealing.  While areas throughout this State are plagued by drug dealing, violent attacks and anti-social behaviour, the Government has facilitated the regular deployment of up to 250 garda&iacute; to police peaceful demonstrators in Ballinaboy, County Mayo.  A staggering &euro;8.1 million has been spent to date on Garda resources to police demonstrations against the unpopular Shell gas pipeline.  These resources would be better deployed in the fight against serious drug and gun crime, which is claiming lives on our streets on an almost weekly basis.  The Garda has become hired security for Shell with the taxpayer having to foot the bill while their own communities are being neglected.  It is a great shame that this State does not protect its citizens like it protects the multinationals.</P>
        <P>I reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the deployment of garda&iacute; in Ballinaboy and to deploy Garda resources where they need to be put.  There is no point in having extra garda&iacute; unless they are deployed in the right areas.  I ask the Minister to take on board our submission to tackle serious drug and gun crime.</P>

        <P>During the past ten years that I have been a Member of this House and for many years prior to that we have had debates on crime.  As previous speakers said, it is customary for the Opposition to be critical of the Administration and for the Administration to defend itself.  Over that period and from time immemorial, going back to the time of Adam and Eve, serious crime has been committed.  That has not changed and crime will always be with us.  Therefore, the question that should come under review is the manner in which we address crime in the interests of the vast majority of people who are law abiding and wish to go about their daily lives without fear, intimidation or worse from those who engage in criminal activity.</P>
        <P>We do not have the recipe in terms of tackling this problem quite right.  Recently and in previous debates I mentioned that a friend said to me <Col N="551"/>many years ago in the context of comparing drug-related crime to prohibition in the United States in the 1930s that we should legalise them.  I disagreed strongly with him; I did not believe it was the right thing to do.  However, I have come to the conclusion that it is a proposition which needs to be carefully analysed and examined.</P>
        <P>Many addicts are involved in petty crime to fund their addiction.  The gang lords make millions of euro out of the racket.  As we have seen in this city, throughout the country, across Europe and in the western world in particular &mdash; I am sure we will see this happen in other countries as they become more affluent &mdash; they take the law into their own hands and have a total disregard for the lives, property and rights of others.  Any initiatives I have seen taken in other jurisdictions appear to only scratch at the surface.  From time to time our newspapers highlight drug seizures to the value of many millions of euro but the drugs that are not being found are multiples of those quantities discovered by the garda&iacute; and police in other jurisdictions.  I am not necessarily advocating that we legalise it but we must take a different approach to the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last night some Members had a meeting with the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee of the British Parliament which was examining prisons here.  Its members were going to visit the D&oacute;chas Centre and Wheatfield.  It has always struck me as somewhat odd that if someone is sentenced to prison for eight years, providing he or she behaves himself or herself in prison, he or she will get a remission of up to 25% of the original sentence.  In many instances, the crimes committed are serious.  I was a member of the child protection committee that was set up last year in response to some of the controversies that arose.  A sex offender can get remission without ever availing of any form of rehabilitative measures to correct his particular disposition in that regard.  He is released back into society with a high probability of reoffending.  That does not make sense to anybody.  We need to return to the point of noting the issues on a blank sheet, namely, that we need to protect society, accept that some level of crime will be committed and consider that we must do to tackle it.  Those are the issues.</P>
        <P>Some people are sent to prison for minor crime.  In many instances people are sent to prison for crimes that are not too serious but as a result of the contacts they make there they come out as serious criminals and become involved in a range of nefarious activities.  We are all aware of that, yet no serious initiative is being taken to redirect people in that regard.  I know a person who is in Castlerea Prison.  He is there simply because he did not impress the judge when giving evidence.  That type of thing should not be allowed in the judicial system.</P><Col N="552"/>
        <P>For a long time I have been an advocate that the Judiciary should be accountable.  Everybody in a republic should be accountable and measured in their performance.  Nobody should be above or beyond the law.  Certain crimes should be penalised by community service and the prison should be a place of last resort, only for serious criminals.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights discussed restorative justice and effective programmes were set up in Nenagh and Tallaght.  In New Zealand the concept has been developed further.</P>
        <P>Some people are jailed because they owe money and fail or refuse to pay it after a court order has been made.  There is no reason we cannot have a system of attachments, so that the person&rsquo;s wage or social welfare payment can be used to make good monetary recompense.</P>
        <P>Serious crime, such as the various murders we have seen, displays a disregard for life.  We addressed that with emergency legislation in 1998 with regard to terrorist offences.  Most people in towns and cities can finger exactly those involved in serious crime.  Human rights advocates may disagree but why can we not arrest such people for up to three years?  By that date they should be brought to court and held to account for their crimes.  It is ridiculous to see those involved in heinous crimes operate with impunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a wedding I attended recently a priest spoke to me about a local village.  He was told by a young man that he could be supplied with any drug within 15 minutes.  This is the situation across every parish in many towns and cities in Europe.  We must take a new approach at European level to tackle the scourge that gives rise to much of criminal activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the motion which gives us an opportunity to speak about an issue of importance to people across the country.  The amendment proposed by the Government is more of the same.  The last Government concentrated on increasing the number of prison spaces and imprisoning more people.  I worry about that attitude.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to people coming across drugs for the first time in prisons.  I read a report that stated that 50% of intravenous users came across drugs for the first time while in prison.  I am concerned about providing more prison places.  We must examine the causes of crime rather than locking people up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is particularly true in light of the recent review of the Whitaker report.  The original report was carried out by T.K. Whitaker, a former Member of this Chamber, in 1985 to consider the reforms needed in the prison system.  He was asked to review it 20 years later and produced a report last month.  Unfortunately, it shows that little has changed since 1985.  Prison is not the answer and should be seen as a last resort.</P><Col N="553"/>
        <P Just="Left">In modern Ireland communities are plagued by organised crime as a result of drugs and gangland killings.  Many people are getting caught in the war waged across our communities.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is struggling to keep up with these hoodlums.  It needs our support but sending in the Army is not the answer.  Providing resources to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the answer.  We could help the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by granting more powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and widening its remit to confiscate the assets of middle ranking criminals.  We could also introduce a witness protection programme so that people can testify in court safe in the knowledge that their lives or the lives of their families are not at risk.</P>
        <P>Anti-social behaviour is a growing problem, especially for residents of new communities in peri-urban areas around Dublin.  In villages such as Stamullen there is no Garda station for a population of 2,500 people.  Residents rely on garda&iacute; arriving from a neighbouring station, which can mean response times of more than one hour.</P>
        <P>The opening hours of Garda stations in such communities is also an issue.  While the opening hours might have served smaller villages and towns, increases in population of 50% within a few years mean we must examine how to redeploy garda&iacute;.  We could remove garda&iacute; from the Border region, which now has less demand, to our growing towns and villages to address anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I also wish to see more community garda&iacute;.  This is essential to address juvenile crime in order that garda&iacute; can get to know perpetrators at a local level.  Organised crime and anti-social behaviour is growing every day.  It is vital that the Government gets to grip with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Senators Buttimer and McFadden.  </P>
        <P>There has been a horrendous catalogue of crime in recent weeks.  There has been virtual anarchy on the streets of the capital, which is tragic and serious.  A major response is needed.</P>
        <P>The use of CAB is insufficient.  The Government is not exploiting that asset to capture the assets of criminals.  It is an initiative that came from Fine Gael, a fact of which I am proud, and I commend to the Minister its greater use.  There is no better way to hurt a criminal than by hurting him in his pocket.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A pernicious and prevalent form of crime is low-level crime, which creates fear in our citizens as they walk the streets of our towns.  It creates an awful atmosphere, particularly at night, and requires an organised response.  The civilianisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is vital and urgent.  Garda&iacute; should be designated to particular streets or wards on a permanent basis.  They would become known in the area and would get to know the area.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P>Rostering of garda&iacute; should coincide with peak times and times of high levels of incidents.  The same number of garda&iacute; should not be on duty on a Monday daytime shift as during a weekend shift.  Greater incentives must be made available to garda&iacute; to make it attractive for them to live in the communities they serve.  Negotiations should be urgently entered into with the Garda representative bodies to deal with this matter.</P>
        <P>I was heartened when the Minister informed the House that CCTV will be introduced to county capital towns.  However, it must be introduced in every town and village.  The savings made with this method of crime prevention are enormous.  In dealing with the dramatic high-profile anarchy on the streets of Dublin and other cities, we must not lose sight of low-level crime.  This is the type of crime that harasses the old when they collect their pensions, decent youngsters when they socialise at weekends and innocent people going about their normal lives.  This low-level crime creates fear and is pernicious and pervasive.  It must be dealt with by a Garda presence on the streets, civilianisation, CCTV cameras and community policing.</P>
        <P>No matter how wealthy the country, it is not a good society when people live in fear.  This is the most urgent issue facing our society that needs an immediate and urgent response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>This country again needs a policy of zero tolerance.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on rolling out CCTV in major towns.  I will, however, remind him that the roll-out of CCTV in Athlone was first mooted in 1998.  Last year, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, said Athlone would have it in several weeks.  We are still waiting.  Recently, there have been serious assaults on women in the Athlone area.  The Garda would have been better resourced if it had the use of CCTV in these cases.  It is not good enough to claim the Garda is properly resourced when it is not.</P>
        <P>I take exception to the removal of garda&iacute; based in rural areas.  People in rural areas deserve to have a Garda presence just as much as those in urban areas.  It is a matter of extra community garda&iacute; being deployed on the streets and in rural areas.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is a happy man <Col N="555"/>given Carriagtwohill&rsquo;s victory in the Cork county hurling final last weekend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tackling crime is a collective responsibility.  It is the job of the Opposition to hold the Government to account.  Senator Boyle spoke about pantomime politics, yet the crime figures between 2001 to 2006 tell a different story.  In this period, 338 people were murdered.  The second quarter of 2007 has seen a 43% increase in homicide offences, a 19% increase in murder and manslaughter offences and assaults up by 7%.  These figures are no pantomime.  Will the Members opposite ask the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, where his zero tolerance policy has gone?  The Government&rsquo;s crime policy has changed to anything goes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle should not be brought into a debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al, I should have referred to him as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who called for zero tolerance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Garda&iacute; claim they work in poor conditions, that their hands are tied and there is a need for more community policing.  The Garda must be provided with the resources it needs.  Equal resources must also be given to youth work initiatives and early intervention programmes.  Prevention is better than cure and critical areas of youth services and sport must be targeted.  One programme that works well is the youth cafe programme in Ballinlough in the Cork South-Central constituency.  Community-based projects such as this need to be supported and encouraged as they offer young people an opportunity to get involved, creating an alternative to anti-social behaviour and the drug culture.  Such projects empower young people, giving them a sense of community participation.</P>
        <P>The clear connection between drug abuse and criminality cannot be ignored.  Earlier the House debated the national drugs strategy.  If the drug culture and its associated criminality is targeted and tackled, crime of whatever hue will be diluted.</P><Col N="556"/>
        <P>I commend the motion.  It is opportune because it highlights the Government&rsquo;s inadequacies in tackling crime.  It is the Opposition&rsquo;s job to highlight these inadequacies and hold the Government to account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister claims the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s motion was tendentious and opportunistic, despite his agreeing that gun and gangland crime is a major problem.  He also agrees with the essential statement in the motion, that &ldquo;adequate resources for our Garda, effective criminal legislation and innovative policing methods&rdquo; are needed to tackle the crime problem.  The Minister does not agree, however, with the claim in the motion that this and the last Government failed to tackle serious crime.  Essentially, this is a tautology.  The facts speak for themselves.  Gangland killings, homicides, manslaughter offences and drug-related offences have all increased by 30%.  The Government has failed.  While I accept that phrasing a motion in these terms is provocative, it is a fair question.  If it provokes the Minister to defend the Government&rsquo;s position and ensures a good debate, then the motion is well phrased and well prepared.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The objective of the motion is to focus and instill a sense of urgency in tackling this issue.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment is defensive and displays an extreme sensitivity on the issue but misses the point.  It is for this House to keep a focus on the issue.  There are different facets to tackling the problem, but the most important is effective policing.  The Minister claims there will be prioritisation and the establishment of targets and timescales.  The reality is we are still waiting for the necessary facilities, such as the establishment of databases, to be provided to the Garda.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>The establishment of timescales will provide a benchmark on which the House can measure progress when it next debates this issue.  Wider issues have been raised such as prevention measures through education programmes, the prison system, rehabilitation, etc.  These are fundamental but the essential issue is the rise in gun and gangland crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to establishing priorities for the Garda.  I hope the House will have an opportunity to debate these and the Minister will report to the House on them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this Adjournment matter, which refers to the need for the Minister for Health and Children and the Government to ensure cancer services at Sligo General Hospital are maintained and improved to include a satellite service for radiotherapy.  I know the Minister of State is aware of this issue and that it is one which is close to his heart.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a very serious issue in the north west where this week we learned that Dr. Mary Hynes of the National Hospitals Office has written to the health managers in the region asking for the plan for the cessation of breast diagnostic and surgical procedures in the hospitals in the north-west region.  I implore the Minister of State to exert all possible influence on the HSE to have this decision reversed as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
        <P>Today in a live radio debate, Tony O&rsquo;Brien, chairman of the cancer control networks, was in a position to admit to me that these decisions were <Col N="558"/>taken without an audit of services in the hospitals in question.  The Minister of State knows Sligo General Hospital effectively has a centre of excellence in terms of breast care.  Over 4,000 mammograms and approximately 80 breast operations are done each year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully support the concept of centres of excellence.  However, I do not believe that in the establishment of the HSE, we set out to disenfranchise the people of the north-west region and to undermine the 50 years&rsquo; work by so many public representatives in that area from all parties and none, although it must be said from Fianna F&aacute;il more than others because it has been in Government more often.  Such expertise took so long to accumulate and be learned.  I refer also to the infrastructure which has been put in place.</P>
        <P>Tony O&rsquo;Brien is a management specialist and not a health professional.  I implore the Minister of State to put the people first in this instance because it is about people.  North of a line from Dublin to Galway and west of Mullingar, there will be no centre of excellence.  However, we already have one in the context of breast care in Sligo General Hospital.  We have excellent consultants and yet we seek to downgrade that service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the cancer control strategy, we suggest we will financially disincentivise hospitals which do not comply quickly enough.  Surely this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government did not set out to achieve this.  I appeal that common sense prevail in the interests of people.  We do not want to send these 4,000 people to Galway.  If they had to go there, where would they park apart from anything else?  The infrastructure is not in place, yet it is in place in Sligo.  No audit of service took place and there <Col N="559"/>was no consultation with the existing consultants specialising in this area.  Surely this is not the way to do business.</P>
        <P>As I said, Tony O&rsquo;Brien admitted to me on live radio that the consultants in the area were not consulted and that there was no audit but that it was intended to do one now.  How can we announce that we are shutting down a service which took 50 years to set up without considering the people, consulting the experts in that area and without an audit of service to ascertain what is the best?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister of State to use all his influence and that of the Government on the HSE to have common sense prevail.  The cancer care strategy talks about Ireland having a network of equitably accessible state-of-the-art cancer treatment facilities.  Surely we are not talking about <i>Animal Farm</i> equality where some people are more equal than others.  We, in the north west, would buy into centres of excellence and would be quite happy for Galway to be one.  However, we should not set out to do that by diluting and undermining the great services we already have.  Let it be an honourable, professional and expert satellite to the services in the centres of excellence.  I accept that by international best practice standards centres of excellence are the way to go in terms of clinical trials and research and development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Oncology and surgical procedures and a centre of excellence are already available in the likes of Sligo.  Why should we undermine that?  Surely it would cost less to enhance the service and to make it even better so that it could act as a satellite to Galway for the people of the north west, north of a line from Dublin to Galway and west of Mullingar.  It would sit with Government policy in every other way, including in terms of the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>It would also acknowledge the human factor.  We cannot just make a clinical decision without taking accessibility and transport into account.  We are not talking about the BUPA person but about the council house dweller on the minimum wage who does not have a first cousin in Galway or uncle in Dublin with whom he or she can stay.  We must be true to the people.  I know the Minister of State will do all he can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator MacSharry for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on Sligo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the HSE has appointed Professor Tom Keane as national cancer control director to lead and manage the establishment of the national cancer control programme.  The delivery of cancer services in this way will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality <Col N="560"/>of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant realignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one that is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE on four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by the end of 2008 and 80% to 90% by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>Sligo General Hospital has a dedicated inpatient oncology unit comprising 15 beds and a dedicated day services unit comprising eight beds.  The HSE has informed the Department that in 2006, Sligo General Hospital had 285 patient discharges from its inpatient unit and 3,849 discharges from its day care unit.  The HSE has also designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE&rsquo;s western region, which includes counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  Letterkenny Hospital is linked to the centre in UCHG because of its unique geographical circumstances.</P>
        <P>The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning are directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals, such as that in Sligo.  Cancer day care units will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.  Patients from Sligo needing radiotherapy are referred to the radiation oncology department at UCHG for treatment.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed the Department that in 2006, UCHG treated almost 1,000 radiation oncology patients.  The number of treatments increased from 11,300 in 2005 to 18,500 in 2006.  The hospital expects treatments provided to increase by 7% this year over last year.</P>
        <P>The Department and HSE have been working closely on the examination of procurement options to expedite the delivery of the national plan for radiation oncology.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has been assured that the HSE will have in place radiation oncology capacity to meet the needs of the population by 2010.  After 2010, the HSE will continue to increase capacity to ensure that these needs will continue to be met.  The Minister is fully confident that this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, public private partnership and, where appropriate, the use of the private sector.</P><Col N="561"/>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards.  I hope the developments which I outlined here today will ensure that a comprehensive service will be available to all patients with cancer in the west, including Sligo.  I assure Senator MacSharry that I will relate the very strong views he expressed on Sligo General Hospital to the Minister and the HSE at the first available opportunity.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for attending to deal with this matter.  It concerns an issue of regional importance that will not go away until it is dealt with adequately.   I call on the Minister for Education and Science to publish without delay the independent report carried out by Dr. Jim Port on the application for university status of Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>It is well established that the south east is underperforming economically by comparison with other regions.  While there are excellent third level education facilities in the region, there is a widespread view that the lack of a university is reflected in the lower-than-average participation rate in education, the higher-than-average graduate migration rate from the region and the lower-than-average level of research and development activity in the region.  These trends can be reversed and this would lead to better and balanced regional development through expanding the innovative potential of the region with the establishment of a regional university in Waterford city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The OECD education review of 2004 stated there should be no further universities established for the foreseeable future.  The more recent OECD annual report, Education at a Glance, states more widespread university education yields more prosperous economies and provides rich rewards in the labour market for those who graduate.  Across 25 OECD countries, those with university degrees and advanced research education had earnings at least 50% higher than individuals whose highest levels of educational attainment was below the upper secondary level.  For these very reasons, Waterford and the south east are at a clear disadvantage in attracting high-value and research-based jobs.</P>
        <P>Waterford Institute of Technology made a comprehensive application for university status to the Department of Education and Science.  Dr. Port, after his appointment, consulted the relevant stakeholders and has long since completed his assessment of the application.  It has been with the Department for many weeks but there is no word or recommendation forthcoming.  A <Col N="562"/>response is long overdue.  Fianna F&aacute;il made clear commitments in its election manifesto to support the granting of university status to the institute and we now need to see these commitments honoured.</P>
        <P>I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view on this report and on when we can expect the application to enter the formal statutory review process, which is the next critical step.  The educational and economic future of an entire region depends on this issue being addressed as rapidly as possible.  If the Government is serious about the application, it should include it in the statutory process without delay.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I will outline the legislative and policy context in which Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s application must be considered.  As the Senator may be aware, the Government commissioned a major OECD review of higher education to support Ireland&rsquo;s strategic ambition of placing our higher education system at the front rank of the OECD in the context of the wider national objective of developing the State as a world-leading knowledge economy and society.  A key recommendation made in the OECD&rsquo;s report to the Government was that Ireland should retain the differentiation in mission of the university and institute of technology sectors, which it identified as a key strength of our system, and that there should be no institutional transfers into the university system for the foreseeable future.  The report also recommended that the universities and institutes of technology be brought together under the remit of a single authority for the purpose of achieving a unified higher education strategy.  It further recommended that the extent of external regulation of the institutes of technology should be lightened, giving them greater managerial freedom in responding to the opportunities and challenges of supporting regional and national social and economic development.</P>
        <P>The Institutes of Technology Act 2006 addresses significant elements of these recommendations and marks a major milestone for the sector and the development of higher education in Ireland.  The Act provides for greater autonomy for the institutes to fulfil their missions.  By bringing them within the remit of the Higher Education Authority, it supports an integrated and cohesive strategic approach to the development of higher education in line with national priorities.  The Act means that, in practice, the Higher Education Authority and institutes of technology will now engage and relate in a way that is very similar to the way the authority and the universities engage.  The new arrangements provide for a more autonomous and strategic relationship with the Government, through the <Col N="563"/>HEA.  They reflect the dynamic and competitive nature of the environment in which the institutes of technology now operate.</P>
        <P>In February 2006, the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology wrote to the Department of Education and Science to request a review of the institute&rsquo;s status under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Government may, at any time, appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s and shall include international experts and national experts, including employees of universities to which this Act applies, to advise An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university under sections 12 and 13, an educational institution should be established as a university.  On the advice of the body and the recommendation of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, but subject to subsection (3), the Government may, by order, provide that the institution shall be a university for the purposes of this Act and, on the making of the order, it shall be established accordingly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To assist the Department in its assessment of Waterford IT&rsquo;s application, the Minister appointed Dr. Jim Port in February 2007 to provide preliminary advice on the merits of the submission by WIT, having regard to the national strategy for the development of higher education, the implications for regional development in the south east in the context of the national spatial strategy and any likely implications for the overall structure of higher education in Ireland.  Dr. Port&rsquo;s report was received by the Department of Education and Science and is under consideration.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, aside from the detailed statutory review process that is required in progressing an application, significant wider issues also need to be considered in advance of any possible statutory review.  The Minister for Education and Science is aware of the strong support in the south east for the application of Waterford IT for university status.  However, wider policy developments must be central to her consideration of the appropriate next steps in respect of the application.  WIT&rsquo;s application is being carefully assessed in that broad context.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s reply, which did not teach me anything I did not already know.  I am well aware of the statutory process and what it entails.  I am disappointed to note that the wording of the Minister&rsquo;s response is almost identical to the wording of a response given to my colleague, Senator Cummins, during a similar debate in this House on 16 November 2006.  We have not made any progress since last year despite the com<Col N="564"/>pletion of Dr. Jim Port&rsquo;s report, which I would like the Government to publish immediately.</P>

    <Title>Waste Management Policy. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, for coming to the House this evening to clarify the details of a recent significant move in Government waste disposal policy.  I would like the Minister to put in a broader context some statements he has made in recent weeks.  I am glad he is in attendance to do so.  He stated clearly a number of weeks ago that incineration no longer forms the cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s waste management policy.  He followed that up last week by making clear that the Government has altered its previous policy on regional waste management plans, which had been that eight incinerators were required throughout the country.  The Minister cited a study that was conducted by officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which indicated that a maximum of 400,000 tonnes of waste would have to be considered for thermal treatment each year.  He made it clear that he is considering forms of thermal treatment other than incineration and is aiming to remove the need to consider incineration at all.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Minister&rsquo;s second statement was covered in the media, some reporters seemed to suggest that the 400,000 tonnes of waste he mentioned would necessitate two incinerators.  They presumed that the two incinerators would be located at particular locations &mdash; Carranstown in County Meath and Ringaskiddy in County Cork.  I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm not only that he did not talk about incineration as a technology in either of his statements, but also that he did not refer to any locations for incinerators.  The proposal to locate an incinerator at Carranstown is something of a grey area following An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision yesterday to allow that plant to have greater capacity.  I appreciate that the Minister is not allowed to comment on decisions taken by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>The media&rsquo;s suggestion that a domestic waste incinerator will be located in County Cork as part of this equation is also far off the mark.  No planning application for a domestic waste incinerator has been made in the Cork area.  If such an application is made, its fate will depend on a number of policy decisions which have yet to be clarified by the Minister.  He has expressed his interest in the promotion of more environmentally friendly and sustainable forms of waste disposal treatment, such as mechanical and biological treatment.  Thermal forms of treatment that follow mechanical and biological treatment, such as the reduction of refuse to derive fuel, will have to be considered as part of the new order of waste disposal treatment.  We are trying to meet the com<Col N="565"/>mitment in the programme for Government to seek to reduce the proportion of waste consigned to landfill to just 10% within the lifetime of this Government.  Regardless of how we treat our waste subsequently, it will ultimately go into cleanfill as treated waste or be used as some form of energy fuel.  This will not have to be done through mass burn, high-stack incineration.  I think clarity is needed in these areas if we are to clear up the unnecessary confusion that was created in the media reports I mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P>In his original statement a number of weeks ago, the Minister said that incineration is no longer the cornerstone of Government policy.  He said he was willing to honour another commitment in the programme for Government by ensuring that the landfill levy would not be changed in any way that would give an unfair competitive advantage to other waste disposal options, particularly incineration.  It is clear from such logic that any increase in the landfill levy, which would probably be necessary if we are to reach our 10% target, would have to be accompanied by the imposition of levies on other unsustainable forms of waste disposal, such as incineration.  We would have to give favourable treatment to better methods of recycling and the mechanical and biological treatment of waste.  I ask the Minister to outline the trend of future Government policy.  Can he confirm that his two statements constitute an official policy position of moving away from incineration?  Can he confirm that he did not talk about incineration as any type of preferred technology and that, in fact, he said the opposite?  Can he confirm that he did not mention any locations for the treatment of the 400,000 tonnes of waste?  I refer to the waste for which proper methods of treatment have yet to be identified by his departmental officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Boyle for raising this issue.  I am happy to have an opportunity to spell out the Government&rsquo;s position on waste management.  I will also set out the progress already made in delivering the many commitments on waste management in the Government&rsquo;s policy programme.  The objective underpinning all these initiatives is the creation of a world-class waste management system that places the maximum emphasis on waste prevention, reuse and recycling while using state-of-the-art technologies to deal with residual waste.  We are not starting from scratch; we have increased our recycling rate from almost zero to approximately 35%.  We are massively over-reliant on landfill, however. We must move away from this over-reliance not only because it is environmentally the right thing to do but also because we run the risk of EU infringement proceedings, with the potential for fines, if we do not.  Previous Government policy, which was reflected in the existing suite of regional waste management plans, was <Col N="566"/>tied to incineration as a magic bullet.  That has changed and is not espoused in the programme for Government.  We must look to alternatives, such as technologies that are more flexible, easier to deliver and more environmentally benign.  Technologies in the areas of mechanical and biological treatment have advanced considerably in recent years and are well established in many countries.  I recently saw a particularly good example in Austria.  Incineration is not a one-track solution and is no longer the cornerstone of Irish waste management policy.  The programme for Government clearly commits us to exploring the full range of technologies available to us, in particular, mechanical and biological treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The data available to me suggest that with a developed MBT system the quantity of residual waste requiring disposal other than landfill would be reduced to some 400,000 tonnes by 2016.  In this context it is clear that the more than 2 million tonnes of incineration capacity foreseen in the regional waste plans and as a consequence of commercial developments is way in excess of what might be needed.  I see tremendous potential in other technologies for dealing with this residual waste of 400,000 tonnes, including co-firing in cement kilns or power plants.  The residual waste could be transformed into a refuse-derived fuel, already referred to by Senator Boyle.  Stakeholders in these sectors are already extremely interested in the potential of RDF, and I believe this should be explored in detail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the existing incinerator plans around the country, such a vast capacity could seriously undermine our efforts to maximise recycling in the years ahead.  I am therefore determined to change the emphasis away from incineration and I have recently advised Government colleagues of how we intend to proceed.  The first step, already under way, is to create a scenario in which local authorities no longer underwrite incinerators in the form of public private partnerships by guaranteeing a supply of waste to such facilities.  I am examining the potential for a policy direction to this effect using the powers available to me in the Waste Management Act.</P>
        <P>The second and more expansive step is the review of waste management planning provided for in the programme for Government.  I have advised the Government of my plans for this study and my Department is beginning the process.  This will include a very high degree of consultation with key stakeholders and will be a truly comprehensive piece of work which will inform future national policy on waste in all its facets.  Issues to be addressed will include how best to promote alternative technologies such as MBT and what standards should apply.  It will also advise on how best to regulate the sector and what reforms may be needed in this regard.  Taken together these initiatives will transform our approach to waste management.</P><Col N="567"/>
        <P>In the context of climate change, it is important to note that MBT and refuse-derived fuel offers us the best solution.  I confirm to Senator Boyle that he is correct; I did not mention any specific locations for thermal treatment.  I emphasise that I see great potential for RDF, refuse-derived fuel.  He is correct that the programme for Government states we will not offer a competitive advantage to incineration by increasing the landfill levy.  We may well need to increase the landfill levy but I regard landfill and incineration as disposal <Col N="568"/>methods.  It is important to state that MBT is a means of substantially reducing waste, in particular the residual fraction.  I acknowledge it is not without its problems but I believe it should and does form the cornerstone of Irish waste management policy.  It can be done only if recycling rates are increased to 50% which is certainly achievable.</P>
