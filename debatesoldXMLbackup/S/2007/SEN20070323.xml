	<P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make provision to support Drumnigh montessori primary school, Donaghmede, Dublin 13.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Toole of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to correct the anomaly which penalises a person who chooses to work in a low paid job rather than claim social welfare payments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Health Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude no later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 2, Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Bill 2007 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m. and conclude no later than 4 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage which will conclude no later than 3.30 p.m., and Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and conclude no later than 4 p.m.</P><Col N="1410"/>
        <P>It is my intention to amend the Order of Business if the relevant Minister is available to take No. 2 earlier than the scheduled 2 p.m. start.  We are endeavouring to ensure the Minister will be present in the event that our deliberations on the Health Bill conclude early.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s comments about keeping business under review throughout the day.</P>
        <P>A serious situation has arisen in respect of the State attempting to recover costs from victims.  Whatever about the legal niceties involved, there are approximately 450,000 schoolchildren in the care of the State.  At least, that is what their parents believe.  The Department must be given some regulatory and supervisory role.  It cannot merely hide and abdicate its responsibility.  Senator Lydon is nodding in agreement with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I made no comment on the matter at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated the question of costs would be approached in a sympathetic manner.  However, the State is threatening to pursue certain individuals.  This is making a mockery of the apology offered by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State.  Has the Government issued a declaration of war on the victims of abuse?  Despite the apology given, what is happening is unconscionable.  The State must accept responsibility for the abuse, where it occurred, of innocent children.  Leaving aside the legal niceties, we must remember that it is the State which pays the salaries of teachers and which paid those individuals who were abusers.  That is all I want to say on the subject.  I look forward to hearing the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What steps is the Department of Transport taking to ensure the benefits and challenges of the new open skies policy will be passed on to our many regional airports?  We require a fully integrated approach in this regard but there is no evidence of such an approach as yet.  Everyone is aware of concerns in the Shannon region and the south west as a result of this change.  There was disappointment that Shannon Airport would not be offered one of the three new Aer Lingus routes.  At this juncture, I am more concerned that there be a fully integrated approach and the regional airports will not be abandoned as the Cinderellas of the system.  Lastly, what remaining Bills is it intended to take between now and the recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in expressing real concern and horror at last night&rsquo;s programme.  A Member of this House, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, played a dignified role in that programme and told it as it is.  We must listen to him as a former General Secretary of the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation.</P><Col N="1411"/>
        <P Just="Left">I raised this matter yesterday.  It seems extraordinary that the Government picks up the bills.  So many of these matters are in the domain of the church.  It is time we had proper national education which is not only funded but also controlled by the State.  In saying that I am not inimical to the teaching of religion, but if one pays the bills, one must accept the responsibility.  It is extraordinarily cowardly of the Government to try to shift this to management committees which often are made up of parents who voluntarily give their time.  It is an outrage to go after them and send these kinds of terrifying letters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I noted in the programme that one splendid woman courageously spoke out and stated that the Government is now abusing the abused all over again.  It was also valuable to hear Colm O&rsquo;Gorman, who is not only the inspiration behind One in Four from which he has withdrawn for the period of the general election but who is also chairman of a school board, warn that if this trend of terrifying people by sending threatening and bullying legal letters is to continue, it may be difficult to get boards of management together next year.  Why should anybody put their head on the block in that way?</P>
        <P>We have a good Minister for Education and Science in Deputy Mary Hanafin.  She is forward looking.  She understands the situation.  She has a background in teaching.  I doubt very much if she is behind this.  I am not making any criticism of her specifically, but I would like to see her in the Minister&rsquo;s chair in this House responding to these concerns and questions and giving Members an undertaking, which they should demand, that such persecution of people who have already been abused will stop.</P>
        <P>The other matter I want to raise is the question of the Government of Palestine and I want to ask for a debate on the Middle East.  There is a legitimate Government of Palestine.  Hamas was elected.  This was not accepted by the West, especially by the United States of America, and there is an extraordinary situation where there is now a government of national unity.  The State Department of the United States at least is making some small degree of movement, but it is only speaking to the Fatah section, and this looks almost like an attempt to split them.</P>
        <P>We in this country have refused once again to take a moral lead.  It seems we are tied in to the European Union&rsquo;s policy, which is a disgraceful and morally bankrupt one.  They are speaking, for example, about the prospect of a legitimate government, which means we are agreeing that the duly elected Government of the Palestinian people, in their misery, oppression, degradation and discrimination, is not the legitimate government.  It most certainly is.  The hopeful sign is that the Palestinian Government, including the Hamas elements, have given a <i>de facto</i> recognition to the state of Israel.  They have spoken about the 1967 borders and about support for the <Col N="1412"/>initiative of the Quartet, etc.  Had we taken this hardline attitude in the North of Ireland, we would not be in the positive position in which we are today.  Shamefully, there is still nothing about the lifting of sanctions against Palestinian people which, as we will be aware, are hurting them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Norris looking for a debate on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for concentrating and focusing my attention in his usual way.  I am most definitely looking for a debate and those are my reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, want to express my abhorrence at the letter sent on behalf of the Department of Education and Science warning claimants to drop cases against the State on abuse in schools or face significant bills.  Apart from the insensitivity of that letter, given that the O&rsquo;Keeffe case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, it is premature for the Department to make that kind of statement in letters to claimants.</P>
        <P>The idea that the State is not responsible for what happens in schools and for the education system is incredible, as other Senators have stated, given that the Department pays the teachers&rsquo; salaries, funds buildings for schools and pays students&rsquo; capitation fees.  The Department and the Minister take credit for anything good that happens in schools.  If a board of management gets a school extension, the Minister is present to open it and take the credit.  The Minister also takes credit for matters such as good school results, yet if anything bad happens in schools, the Department is not willing to take any of the responsibility.  I find that incredible and unsustainable.  I cannot believe that could be true.  As others have stated, it makes a mockery of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology for abuse in State institutions.</P>
        <P>I noted a headline in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> about Fianna F&aacute;il concern over private hospital plans.  The article referred to Deputy McGuinness who has expressed concerns about proposals to collocate private hospitals on public lands.  I note the Minister, Deputy Harney, has stated that contracts for the construction of the private hospitals will be signed within the coming weeks.  Fianna F&aacute;il forms the overwhelming majority in the Government and if contracts are signed within the next weeks for private hospitals to be built on public lands, that is the responsibility of Fianna F&aacute;il because it forms the majority of this Government.  Its members cannot speak out of both sides of their mouth.  They will be largely responsible for any contracts signed on the collocation of hospitals in the next few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time one turns on the television or radio or one picks up a newspaper, there is something about the upcoming general election.  In 1991 we were in election mode when, in <Col N="1413"/>the dead of night, the house of a person who was mandated to his local town council and to his county council was broken into and he was brutally murdered.  I refer to the late Councillor Eddie Fullerton.  That was almost 16 years ago and yet no closure has been brought to the matter.  His family has lobbied Members of this and the other House to endeavour to exhort us to do what we can to bring closure to this horrendous incident for his wife and family.  No doubt collusion was involved because there were three men in armed combat gear seen getting into an unmarked RUC car.</P>
        <P>This House has a proud tradition in championing such cases as the murder of Eddie Fullerton and I ask the Members of this House to call on the Minister to set up a public inquiry to establish the facts of this case so that the perpetrators of this dastardly act can be brought to justice and closure can be brought to his family.  He cannot be brought back, but at least justice will be seen to be done and this House will continue the proud tradition of championing such causes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Coghlan, and others who expressed serious concern about the Government&rsquo;s abdication of responsibility for people who have been abused at the hands of schoolteachers.  I was shocked by last night&rsquo;s excellent programme.  It is unacceptable that the Government would take the stance it has taken.  This will have serious repercussions for the individuals who have suffered and for boards of management.  Clearly, our first concerns have to be for the victims and we must ensure their hands will not be tied in any way in terms of taking cases.  However, boards of management throughout the country may also be in jeopardy when they are replaced next year.  We have to give serious consideration to the possibility that many of the volunteers who previously gave freely of their time may decide not to continue serving on boards.  Given that they could be facing enormous bills, I can understand why they would make such a decision and agree with speakers who have said the matter is the responsibility of the Government of the day.  The Government pays for the schools and teachers&rsquo; salaries, so I cannot see why it should abdicate its responsibilities.  We require clarification on the matter, this morning if possible, and the Minister for Education and Science needs to come here to clearly outline the Government&rsquo;s position because the situation presented last night is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s call for an inquiry into the murder of Councillor Eddie Fullerton.  I raised the case previously in this House and will continue to do so because it contains several sinister elements.  The deafening silence has to cause concern among all of us.  This man was involved in the democratic process and <Col N="1414"/>his murder took place in the middle of an election campaign.  In normal circumstances, when a public representative is obstructed or, as in this case, murdered, people close ranks to protect the democratic system.  With the exception of Donegal County Council, which took a unanimous stand and called for an inquiry, that did not happen in the Fullerton case.  While we all hope to see closure of the Northern problems over the coming days, cases like this remain to be dealt with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The House has previously discussed the Pat Finucane case.  The British Government had given an undertaking to the Government that it would co-operate in setting up an inquiry into the murder of Mr. Finucane.  Subsequently, the British Government brought in legislation to ensure the inquiry would be restricted.  I am aware our Government is particularly concerned about that.  A similar situation has arisen in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and one has only to meet the relatives of the victims to see the torment and trauma they are suffering simply because they believe the inquiry is not being pursued with a sufficient degree of intensity.  We should bypass the British Government and raise the case internationally if it does not give sufficient co-operation because we cannot allow these situations to continue or totally ignore the suffering of our own citizens.  Even though we are pleased with the progress being made and hope to see closure, it is not possible to build on that for the future or bring cohesion unless we deal with the outstanding issues.  That is why I fully support Senator Glynn.  This is not a matter which should be put on the long finger.  It has to be addressed as a matter of urgency and we have to demonstrate that we are not turning a blind eye to the horrific cases which have caused so much suffering for families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent Environmental Protection Agency report on private water schemes indicates that e.coli pollution from sewage is getting worse, despite the incredible amounts of money being spent.  The episode of pollution of public water in the Galway area with cryptosporidium is the worst ever reported in the country.  We have to take this issue seriously.  Will the Acting Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to explain how these serious issues have arisen?  Cryptosporidium is the parasite which causes scour in calves and the cost to the tourist industry and businesses in the west of Ireland must be shocking.  Water polluted in that way is largely unusable.  We need to address this issue because it appears to be getting worse rather than better despite the facts that large amounts of money are being spent and that the EU directives on it are now decades old.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to last night&rsquo;s programme, I too was disturbed about the abuse of <Col N="1415"/>young children by those in authority.  However, I have great confidence that the Minister for Education and Science understands the background to the matter.  It would be useful if she came into this House to explain the issues differently from the way they were spun last night.  The manner in which the issues were presented last night would disturb anybody, so I think the Minister would be pleased to give a very good explanation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with previous speakers who expressed concerns about the threat of legal costs being awarded against victims of abuse and the implications for boards of management.  I have been a member of my local board of management for the past four years and am aware of the voluntary efforts made by many of the people involved.  If the issue is not resolved, a serious problem will arise when boards of national schools are reconstituted next year in regard to persuading people to take up positions.</P>
        <P>I am not surprised by the comments I read in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  Senator Tuffy referred to my constituency colleague, Deputy McGuinness, who is a frequent critic of the Government despite never having taken the opportunity to vote against it on any issue.  I share the concerns held by many others in regard to handing over public grounds for private hospitals.  Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children appeared on the radio in my region to explain the benefits of handing over a site on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital and was asked the number of beds which would be released in the hospital.  Even though a site worth many millions of euro is to be handed over to private individuals, only 70 beds would be released.  It is a shocking decision and I hope the contracts will not be signed before the election.  I know they will not be signed after the election, when a new Government and Minister will be in office.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I missed Tuesday&rsquo;s Order of Business, during which the ongoing difficulties in Zimbabwe were raised.  We should have a discussion as soon as possible on the continuing deterioration in that country&rsquo;s political situation.  Strong links have been built between Ireland and Zimbabwe, particularly in the area of agriculture, and I was recently contacted by several people who spent lengthy periods of time there.  It is a shocking example of a country which was financially sound and doing very well only to fall to pieces over the past couple of years due to bad governance.  We should not allow the situation to continue without at least having an earnest discussion which would allow us to air our points of view of the<?oasys _jy ?>debacle.</P>
        <P>This week, the Taoiseach made several comments regarding voting. I was appalled by the comments of the Taoiseach yesterday when he said he intended to hold the next general election on a Thursday.  That is a deliberate attempt to <Col N="1416"/>disenfranchise many thousands of students.  Regardless of the exact date of the election, third level students are likely to be doing examinations.  If Dubliners want to leave the city on a Friday evening, they can do so because they can make arrangements to vote earlier in the day.  The past two elections were held on a Friday.  This is a deliberate attempt by the Government to remove a significant number who would automatically be inclined to vote against it.  High turnouts traditionally favour the Opposition, regardless of<?oasys _jy ?>the jurisdiction or which parties are in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We are having one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government is serious about dealing with the issue of low turnouts in the Dublin area, it should consider having a two-day poll, as happens in many other European countries.  Students should not be disenfranchised if the Taoiseach&rsquo;s proposal is put in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the D&aacute;il earlier this week the Taoiseach was questioned about e-voting in the 2002 general election.  He replied that there were no problems.  I was aghast, as I watched his reply on the monitor in my office.  A total of 1,200 votes more were counted than had been cast in Dublin North, while 750 fewer votes were counted in Dublin West than the number cast.  My colleague, Senator Terry, lost the final seat by 200 votes and she has a particular interest in this issue.  How dare the Taoiseach say there were no problems in 2002 and then gloss over the facts relating to the e-voting fiasco?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>There is great disturbance about the date on which the Taoiseach will call the general election.  He should call it for 3 or 4 July, when the leaving certificate examinations will have been completed and everybody would be free to vote.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s call for an inquiry into the death of Eddie Fullerton, whom I knew.  He had a big beard and looked a bit rough but he was a lovely, kind and gentle person.  He was a very decent man who was savagely murdered by loyalists.  If he had been a member of a party other than Sinn F&eacute;in, an investigation would have been carried out long ago.  It is not too late, as Senator Glynn said, to bring closure to the matter and hold an inquiry for the sake of the family, if nothing else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to correct the record because Senator John Phelan was referring to electronic voting as opposed to e-voting.  The issue of e-voting has not yet been discussed in either House and it is time it was introduced in order that people could vote no matter where they were.  If we can pay our mortgages over the <Col N="1417"/>Internet, we should also be able to vote.  That would eradicate the problems associated with electronic voting machines.  That is the future.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest the points made by Senators Ormonde and Norris about the liability attaching to school boards of management and the State&rsquo;s refusal to acknowledge its responsibility towards children who were abused while in the care of State-run schools.  However, there is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  This argument was made during the Mrs. McCole case when a Minister acted solely on legal advice.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues should read the speeches they made about Deputy Noonan during that period because they are walking into a similar scenario on this issue, with legal advice taking over from political decision-making, which is not acceptable.  This issue is being dealt with by the State Claims Agency.  I would like someone to come into the House to explain how the agency takes the Government to court repeatedly and which Minister is responsible for it.  As I understand it, the agency is attached to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which issues letters on behalf of the Government.  A man was recently suspended from the office, as he was connected to an investigation into child pornography.  I asked the Minister whether that person had anything to do with legislation in this area and was assured the person had not.  Did that person have anything to do with the decision to fight these cases?</P>
        <P>Persons who serve on boards of management, similar to those who serve on State boards, can be sued individually or as part of the board and should be indemnified by the State against any liability that might arise.  This should be a condition of sitting on the board of management of a school.  Is the political system in charge of decisions to fight claims?  Is the State taking the decisions?  The membership of boards of management comprises teachers, parents and other members of the community who do their very best.  Members should recall the Mrs. McCole case because the same scenario is unfolding in abuse cases.  The then Minister for Health and Children doggedly followed the advice of his lawyers.  People know what happened them and Fianna F&aacute;il used the case very effectively at the time against Deputy Noonan.  The same speeches need to be made on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House?  We are approaching the end of the 29th D&aacute;il and Seanad during which there has been unprecedented prosperity, opportunity and social inclusion.  It should be recognised that Ireland is regarded as a shining light throughout the world.  We should discuss with the Minister how this progress can be sustained.  We also have peace, together with prosperity.  Given that there may be a breakthrough in Northern Ireland on <Col N="1418"/>Monday, I ask the Deputy Leader to send our best wishes to those involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Glynn made an eloquent and sincere call for an investigation into Eddie Fullerton&rsquo;s murder, while Senator O&rsquo;Murch&uacute; referred to the Pat Finucane case.  I was impressed to hear on radio earlier that three suspected terrorists had been arrested in Britain and would be held by the authorities for 28 days.  Imagine what they could do in that time.  We passed legislation a few years ago to provide for the detention of suspected drug dealers for seven days and the detention of suspected terrorists for three.  The British can hold them for 28 days.  It is a reminder that if they had the will, they could investigate the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Eddie Fullerton and Pat Finucane cases.  They have more powers to do so than they used to have.  I support the call made.</P>
        <P>The Institute of Fundraising of Northern Ireland has called on people to check the identity cards of charity collectors.  I am not sure what the legislative position is in this jurisdiction.  I am always concerned when I put money in a bucket for a collection about how much is given to the charity.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has pointed out privately that in parts of Britain collections where a percentage is paid to the collector are banned.  Such legislation should be considered here.  Between that payment and VAT, charities have not been helped in the manner they should have been.  We should examine this issue in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The ruinous situation in Zimbabwe is very sad but, unfortunately, the root cause of the problem was the failure of the British Government at the time of independence to establish and fund a land commission.  </P>
        <P>The State must be more than a legal entity.  I find it very difficult to stand over or defend in any way threatening legal action against people who suffered child abuse to deter them from taking legal action.  I agree with the point and have held this view for a very long time having worked with Government.  The State has duties towards its citizens.  It must act with moral authority and take a larger view than narrow legal advice designed to protect the financial self-interest of the Exchequer and, perhaps, of taxpayers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I find it very difficult to accept that the State, which has been responsible &mdash; or co-responsible if one wishes to be strictly accurate &mdash; for so much of the progress which has taken place over 40 years, has nothing whatever to do with some of the negative things that have occurred.  I speak as a member of a board of management and I am not looking for indemnification.  If one takes on responsibilities in regard to voluntary boards of various kinds, unfortunately one takes on certain risks.</P>
        <P>As everybody in the House knows, I am no Irish scholar but I deeply regret the decision of <Col N="1419"/>UCD to cease teaching and researching old and middle Irish.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No self-respecting country should decide to neglect or ignore, perhaps for commercial, cost-benefit or utilitarian considerations, the roots of its civilisation.  Does that perhaps lead to situations which have caused grief for people who are not anti-road or anti-progress in any sense?  In the case of the M3, souterrains were destroyed.  Why were they not uncovered during preliminary surveys?  I do not want to be too negative about it but there have been a number of incidents which we have discussed over recent years where we have been a bit careless of our culture and heritage.  Often we are able to correct the situation, as in the case of the Moore Street house.  If we do not have a body of experts, even if they must be subsidised, who have a knowledge of what are for most of us very abstruse things but which are, nonetheless, important in terms of value, culture and civilisation, we will not maintain the type of balanced identity we all want.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues in regard to an inquiry into the assassination of Eddie Fullerton who was a member of Donegal County Council and whom I met.  He served that body very well.  If any other elected representative had been killed, there would have been an inquiry by now.  This is not the first occasion on which my colleagues have sought such an inquiry.  A limited, preliminary inquiry, similar to the MacEntee inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, could be carried out into all the facts surrounding the assassination of Eddie Fullerton.  That would be a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for us to recognise the new Government in Palestine.  We should grasp the nettle on this issue because it is an independent state.  Following its establishment, this State was anxious to get recognition throughout the world.  De Valera and others sought that recognition and received it from the United States of America and other countries.</P>
        <P>The majority of the Palestinian Government does not belong to Hamas and the president is from the Fatah party.  I made the point to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that we should use our influence in the European Union to provide funds and support the state of Palestine and its Government.  No government would satisfy the Israelis except a government which not only is pro-Israel but also is under its control.  It does not really want the establishment of an independent Palestine.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to the call for recognition.  I spoke to the Palestinian ambassador after I spoke in this Chamber last Tuesday and he was very impressed by the fact this House has supported <Col N="1420"/>constantly the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.  It is very helpful to the Palestinian Government that an independent State such as this and an independent Chamber such as the Seanad would voice their opinion.  As a result of the Internet, what is said in this House is transmitted throughout the world almost immediately.  That is significant and we should not fail to highlight the commitment of this Chamber to the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.</P>

	<P>On No. 2, the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance has undertaken to try to come to the House earlier.  We will keep this matter under review and if it is necessary to amend the Order of Business as we come towards the end of Second Stage of the Health Bill 2006, we will do so to bring No. 2 forward.  I hope the various spokespersons who will contribute to the debate on the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Bill will be able to fit in with those plans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Coghlan, Norris, Tuffy, Terry, Ormonde, John Paul Phelan, O&rsquo;Toole and Mansergh all spoke about victims of abuse and the letter which was circulated.  The one thing I would have to reject on behalf of the Government is that it is a declaration of war on these people.  The Taoiseach has expressed his sympathy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about previous incidents of a similar nature.  Senator Mansergh probably made the most telling point of all when he spoke about the common good and the need for the Government to be conscious of it and to exert its moral authority.  This is a classic case of that.  I am sure the State must be guided by the advice it receives but at the end of the day, the Government makes decisions.</P>
        <P>Like others, I am a member of the board of management of a primary school.  As members of the board, we were left in no doubt as to our legal responsibilities.  One such responsibility related to the use of school property after hours which the board wished to facilitate.  However, from an insurance point of view, liability would have fallen on members of the board of management and it became very difficult.  I accept the point that people act voluntarily.  None of us sought indemnity but we were conscious of the fact we needed procedures in place to protect us in the event of a claim against the school.</P>
        <P>The best way to deal with this matter is to attempt to get the Minister to come to the House, explain it in detail and give Members the definitive position on behalf of the Government.</P>

	<P>Senator Coghlan also raised the open skies policy and the agreement which has <Col N="1421"/>been reached between the European Union and the United States in this regard.  It will be entirely beneficial for Ireland.  Aer Lingus has already said it will introduce flights to Washington and other US cities.  It will have a hugely positive effect on tourism.  I understand the concerns of the regional airports but if the business grows at the rate we expect, there will be benefits for everybody, including the regional airports.

        <P>Senator Coghlan raised a matter pertaining to the Bills that are outstanding.  Next week, the House will hold the Committee Stage debate on the Health Bill and the Second Stage debate on the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Bill and the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  The Private Members&rsquo; business will pertain to ethical foreign policy.  The Committee and remaining Stages of the Carbon Fund Bill will be debated, as will the Roads Bill.  Moreover, the House will complete the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill by Thursday evening.  Members will also debate the Medical Practitioners Bill, which they are already dealing with, and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  The Defence (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill must come back from the D&aacute;il.  Other Bills include the European Communities Bill, the Broadcasting Bill and the Statute Law Revision Bill, which Members have dealt with and which will come back before the House.  These are some of the Bills and I also expect the Criminal Justice Bill will come back before the House.</P>

	<P>Senators Norris and Leyden raised the very important matter of the situation in the Middle East and in Palestine in particular.  I suggest that Private Members&rsquo; business next week will provide an opportunity to deal with some of the matters raised.  One curious point that is difficult to understand is that the United States is one of the leading advocates of the need for democratic systems around the world.  However, it strikes me that when the outcome of the democratic system is not to its liking, it takes a different view on the matter.  After all, Hamas was elected.  I am unsure about the remark made by Senator Norris regarding the <i>de facto</i> recognition of the Israeli state by Hamas.</P>
        <P>However, the Government has been entirely consistent over the years, as has this House, with regard to its support for the Palestinian cause, the roadmap and the two-state solution.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has also been highly vocal in terms of his support for the Palestinian Authority.  Ireland has continued to provide humanitarian aid in this regard and will act in a sovereign manner.  While the European Union may state what it wishes, it does not have a coherent foreign policy until such time as the constitutional treaty is signed.  However, Ireland has its own sovereign position and will continue to articulate it.  Everything that has been said by successive Governments has been to indicate support for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian cause.  This House in particular has expressed such a view.</P>
        <P>Senators Tuffy and John Paul Phelan raised the issue of Fianna F&aacute;il concerns in respect of private hospitals.  Naturally, I cannot speak for Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am sure it will clarify its position over the weekend.  I was asked to vote for someone on the committee of 22.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If public lands lie idle, it seems sensible to use them, if possible, to improve the health services by providing additional beds and releasing public beds for occupation by public patients.  Compromises are made within coalitions and I hope Senator Coghlan and his colleagues will be able to experience such benefits at some time in the distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dardis will teach us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Glynn, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Lydon and Quinn all spoke about the tragic case of Councillor Eddie Fullerton.  This case merits <Col N="1423"/>inquiry and I will try to further that.  I take Senator Glynn&rsquo;s point that all Members must do what they can in this regard.  The Pat Finucane case also has relevance.  Senator Quinn made an important point on the capacity of the British to deal with suspected terrorists.  They can lock them up or inquire into their activities for 28 days, which is also relevant in this context.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the Environmental Protection Agency report on private water schemes.  There have been some rather disappointing results in this regard over an extended period.  As for the issue regarding cryptosporidium, I find it difficult to understand why the source cannot be found.  While I would have thought this was a straightforward exercise, perhaps that is not the case.  I will try to get the Minister to come to the House to deal with the issue.</P>
        <P>Senators John Paul Phelan and Mansergh spoke on the appalling situation in Zimbabwe.  It is terrible to think that members of the opposition would have been ill-treated to the extent that their lives appear to have been put at risk.  As Senator Phelan noted, it was a highly productive agricultural country and many Irish people who farmed well there were obliged to leave the country.  It is appalling to think that the country is literally unable to feed itself when it has such an extraordinary capacity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unable to support itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>People who were prepared to remain there and contribute to its future were effectively thrown out.  This was an appalling thing to happen.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan also spoke about the forthcoming general election.  The Taoiseach dealt with that matter adequately.  I am sure that were the election date to be changed from Thursday to Friday, similar criticisms would be made.  Senators Lydon and O&rsquo;Toole also spoke about electronic voting.  I suspect that if the manual system were examined in the same manner as the electronic voting system, one would find similar inconsistencies regarding the record of those who came in to vote and the number of votes cast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, there would not be as many.  There are differences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect anomalies exist in both systems.  Senator Hanafin requested the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to discuss the country&rsquo;s progress and to chart the way forward.  This would be valuable if it could be fitted into the busy schedule of legislation before the House, which must have priority.</P>
        <P>I strongly support Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s comments regarding the prospects for Northern Ireland.  Members hope that by the time they return to the House next week, a power-sharing Executive and <Col N="1424"/>the democratic institutions to which the North is entitled will be in place.  I strongly endorse the Senator&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn discussed the Institute of Fundraising and the percentage of charity collections that goes to collectors.  While Ireland has some regulations regarding the organisation of collections and people must be registered to carry them out, I am unclear as to the answer to his question.  I will endeavour to find out.  One must get a licence from a Garda superintendent to conduct a collection in the first place.  I agree that all Members have been lobbied regarding VAT, and this must be looked at.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh raised the issue of old Irish in UCD.  This is an important matter as something similar took place in Trinity in respect of drama.  Members should read a paper written by Sean Barrett in <i>Administration</i>.  This issue goes back to a decision made by a different Government.  Some of us who were then on the Opposition side of the House were active in the debate at that time.  It appears the arts are becoming increasingly curtailed in the pursuit of the sciences.  While it is good to pursue the sciences, it appears that in spite of very large increases in the moneys being given to the universities, it has been suggested they are underfunded and this is the reason such departments are closing.  This is wrong.</P>
        <P>As for the M3 and our cultural heritage and archaeological remains, the National Roads Authority recently produced reports on the remains that have been found during the construction of several of its roads.  Such finds are simply littered throughout the country and are everywhere.  It is impossible to build a road anywhere without uncovering something of significance.  Obviously, there is a compromise between progress and preservation.</P>
        <P>It is important for Members to acknowledge the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which will take place during the weekend, and its significance on the lives of us all.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Health Bill 2006:" RHead="Second Stage"> 
    <Title>Health Bill 2006: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Bill 2006 is a central element of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for the health service, as well as meeting commitments made in Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You and Towards 2016.  The measures proposed in the Bill, in particular the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services, will bring about a safer health and social services <Col N="1425"/>system which will entrench quality at all levels and in all settings.</P>
        <P>The Bill was framed with the central purpose of creating a new standards-based approach to health care services.  Patient safety and quality of services are the key principles underpinning the arrangements set out in it.  In many respects, the Bill represents a new and radical departure for the health system and the changes it introduces are fundamental to delivering a better health system in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Bill will create a national body, the Health Information and Quality Authority, often referred to as HIQA.  The purpose of the authority is to set quality standards and secure compliance with those standards in an open and transparent way.  In line with the national health information strategy, the new body will also have a vital role in developing, evaluating and improving the gathering and use of health care information.  It will also ensure emerging health care technologies are independently and objectively assessed to benefit both patients and taxpayers.</P>
        <P>The functions of the authority will be to set standards of safety and quality for all services provided by the HSE and service providers on behalf of the HSE, as well as private nursing homes, with the exception of mental health services which are covered by the Mental Health Commission and the Inspector of Mental Health.  It will monitor compliance with the standards it sets and advise the Minister and the HSE on the level of compliance.  It will undertake, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, investigations into the safety, quality and standards of services where it believes there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving services.  It will carry out reviews to ensure best outcomes and value for money for the resources available to the HSE and operate accreditation programmes for health and personal social services in both the private and public health sectors.  It will also carry out assessments of health technologies, including drugs and medical devices and perform a range of information related functions with regard to health services and the health and welfare of the population, including evaluating existing health information, identifying deficiencies, advising the Minister and the HSE on those deficiencies, setting information standards and advising the Minister and the HSE on compliance with those standards.</P>
        <P>The Bill also establishes the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services as an office within the authority with specific statutory functions.  The chief inspector will be an employee of HIQA with independent statutory functions which include the Social Services Inspectorate&rsquo;s current inspection work, namely, conducting inspections into children&rsquo;s residential services run by the HSE, as well as the important new functions of registering and inspecting residential services for those with disabilities and older people, including private nursing homes.</P><Col N="1426"/>
        <P>In line with guidelines on regulatory impact assessment, a public consultation process on the legislative proposals was undertaken last year.  More than 70 submissions were received and the proposals to establish HIQA and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services were generally welcomed.  The key features of the Bill reflect the outcome of these consultations and I am confident the Bill was strengthened as a result.  Discussions took place with the interim HIQA board and the social services inspectorate on the Bill.  Much preparatory work has been carried out by the interim HIQA board to ensure it can use its statutory powers as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Bill honours a commitment made by the Minister for Health and Children last year to provide for protected disclosures, more commonly known as whistleblowing, in the health service.  It does this by inserting a new part into the Health Act 2004 covering a range of circumstances.  The effect will be to create a structure within which protected disclosures can be properly made and investigated and to provide appropriate protection for the persons making such disclosures in good faith and in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I now turn to how the system of standards, registration and inspection for all designated centres will work together to create a fully independent and robust registration and inspection system.  These centres will be inspected against standards set by HIQA and regulations made by the Minister.  The chief inspector will have extensive powers to carry out inspections and may enter a centre, examine any records, take copies of documents, inspect and remove other relevant items and interview residents and staff in private.  I should make clear that the registration and inspection requirements will apply to Health Service Executive residential centres, centres operated by agencies funded by the HSE and private nursing homes.  This will guarantee that the public, voluntary and private sectors providing residential services will be required to meet the same standards of care.  The chief inspector will also be responsible for overseeing the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s performance in complying with regulations and standards in foster care for children, pre-school services and what is called in law the &ldquo;boarding out&rdquo; of older people where they reside in someone&rsquo;s home.  Residential centres covered by the Bill may not operate unless they have been registered by the chief inspector and it will be an offence to operate without registration.  A centre must be in compliance with the conditions of its registration.  Registration details will be available to the public on the Internet.  The chief inspector can cancel a registration if the residential centre fails to meet standards.</P>
        <P>Where necessary, the Bill provides for action to be taken quickly to protect service users.  This includes provisions for the urgent deregistration of centres where the chief inspector, on appli<Col N="1427"/>cation to the District Court, believes there is a risk to the life, or a serious risk to the health or welfare, of people resident in a centre.  Accordingly, issues will no longer arise about the legal capacity to deal with failing nursing homes or residential care centres.  If necessary, they can be closed down.</P>
        <P>Senators are aware that the Minister for Health and Children established a commission on patient safety and quality assurance to examine and make recommendations on a system of licensing for all public and private providers of health care.  This will include public, private and voluntary hospitals.  We have general agreement that this is the direction we must take to give patients the greatest possible assurances of safe and quality care.  The Minister asked the commission to report to her within 18 months of its establishment last December.  The commission established a subgroup on licensing which may be in a position to come forward with recommendations in advance of the commission&rsquo;s report.  The subgroup proposes to invite private health care providers to consult it as part of the process.  The commission also plans to advertise for submissions on the various areas it will address as part of its work.</P>
        <P>Part 1 of the Bill, comprising sections 1 to 5, inclusive, contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, interpretation, commencement, establishment day and expenses.  Part 2, sections 6 to 12, inclusive, makes provision for the establishment of HIQA, details its functions which I outlined and contains provisions required for its operation and other matters.  In line with arrangements for other statutory agencies responsible for setting standards and monitoring compliance, section 10 provides that standards set by HIQA must be approved by the Minister.  Section 11 provides that the standards will be admissible as evidence in court proceedings, while section 12 allows the authority to require information from the HSE and service providers.  Under the regulations, the Minister will be able to set out the procedures to be adopted by the authority in setting standards.  This is to ensure the appropriate statutory bodies will be consulted before standards are drawn up.</P>
        <P>Part 3, comprising sections 13 to 20, inclusive, provides for the establishment of the HIQA board and related matters.  The board will have 12 members.  Part 4, comprising sections 21 to 25, inclusive, covers standard provisions dealing with the appointment of the chief executive officer.  Part 5, comprising sections 26 to 28, inclusive, contains standard provisions dealing with the recruitment of employees and advisers.</P>
        <P>Part 6, comprising sections 29 to 39, inclusive, deals with the accountability and funding of the authority.  It includes provisions allowing the Minister to give HIQA general directions to ensure ministerial policy will be clear.  It contains provisions requiring the authority to draft codes <Col N="1428"/>of governance and a five-year corporate plan for ministerial approval.  It also allows HIQA to charge, should it deem it appropriate, for any services it provides, except those it provides for the Government, the HSE or public service providers.  There is also provision for the Minister to determine the authority&rsquo;s net annual expenditure and a requirement for the authority to submit a business plan to the Minister on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Part 7, comprising sections 40 to 45, inclusive, deals with the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services.  Section 43 provides for the appointment of inspectors to staff the inspectorate.  I should mention at this stage that section 72 allows HIQA, at the request of the chief inspector, to appoint qualified persons to assist the chief inspector and inspectors in the inspection of residential centres.  Section 44 deals with the corporate and business plans for the office of the chief inspector and their inclusion in HIQA&rsquo;s corporate and business plans.</P>
        <P>Currently, the HSE carries out inspections of voluntary children&rsquo;s residential centres and private nursing homes.  The legislation provides that these will become a statutory function of the chief inspector.  Section 45 provides that the Minister may require the HSE to carry out such inspections on behalf of the chief inspector.  This is intended as a temporary arrangement to facilitate the continued inspection of these facilities pending a transfer of staff and resources to the authority.  Such inspections must be carried out in the manner specified by the chief inspector and in accordance with standards set by HIQA and regulations made by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Part 8, comprising sections 46 to 69, inclusive, deals with the registration of designated centres.  Under section 46, a person shall not carry on or manage a designated centre unless it is registered and the person is the registered provider.  A person is prohibited from managing a designated centre if the centre is not registered.  Under section 47, any person applying for registration or renewal of registration is prohibited from giving misleading or false information.  Sections 48 and 49 deal with requirements in regard to applications for registration and the details to be included by the chief inspector in the registers he or she maintains.  The registration of a designated centre is for three years.</P>
        <P>Section 50 provides for the granting or refusing of applications for registration.  The chief inspector will grant the application if satisfied that the registered provider and any other person involved in the management of the centre is a fit person and the centre complies with standards set by HIQA and regulations made by the Minister.  If the chief inspector is not satisfied on these counts, the application will be refused and conditions may be attached to registration.</P>
        <P>Under section 51, the chief inspector can cancel a registration, vary a condition of registration or impose new conditions in certain circumstances.  These circumstances are where the registered <Col N="1429"/>provider or other person involved in the management of the centre is convicted of particular offences or is not a fit person, or where the centre is not meeting its regulatory requirements.  Under section 52, registered providers may apply to the chief inspector to vary a condition of registration.</P>
        <P>Sections 53 and 54 provide for notification by the chief inspector of proposed decisions and the right to respond.  The chief inspector must give notification of proposed decisions to refuse or cancel registration, vary or attach conditions of registration or impose new conditions.  Time is allowed for the making of written representations.  Section 55 provides that when the decision is made by the chief inspector, the person is informed in writing of the decision.</P>
        <P>Section 56 sets out certain requirements and prohibitions in regard to designated centres, while section 57 provides for the right of appeal, on the part of a registered provider or applicant, against a decision by the chief inspector to the District Court.  Appeals must be brought within 28 days after receipt of a written notice from the chief inspector.  Section 58 provides that the chief inspector can apply to the District Court for an order enforcing certain decisions.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the urgent cancellation or varying of conditions of registration where the chief inspector believes there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of residents.  Sections 59 to 61, inclusive, set out the procedures and arrangements in this regard.  The chief inspector must apply to the District Court for an order in regard to the registration and this application may be made <i>ex parte </i>and without notice to the registered provider.  An <i>ex parte </i>interim order may be granted by the court if it considers it necessary or expedient to make the order immediately in the best interests of the residents.  The chief inspector may apply to the court for a final determination.  Notice of this application must be given to the person who was the registered provider at the time of the <i>ex parte </i>application.  Under section 62, the Bill provides for the appeal of District Court decisions to the Circuit Court, while section 63 provides for the chief inspector to be a party to any court proceedings under this part of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Under section 64, the chief inspector must notify the HSE immediately when registration is cancelled and the executive must make alternative arrangements for residents.  Section 65 requires a registered provider to furnish the chief inspector with such information as he or she may require.  Sections 66 to 68, inclusive, are technical provisions dealing with the closure of designated centres and the appointment of persons by law to take charge of a centre.  Section 69 sets out the transitional arrangements for existing designated centres to allow them to operate pending registration for a period of not more than three years.</P>
        <P>Part 9 deals primarily with investigations by HIQA and inspections by it for the purposes of monitoring compliance with standards set.  It also deals with inspections of designated centres by <Col N="1430"/>the chief inspector.  Section 70 allows HIQA to appoint persons known as &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; to monitor compliance with standards set and carry out investigations where the Minister believes there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving services.  Section 71 provides that the HSE may appoint persons to examine designated centres operated by service providers for certain purposes.  For example, this may be to establish whether centres are complying with the terms of any funding given to them by the executive.</P>
        <P>Sections 72 to 77, inclusive, deal with the right of entry for authorised persons to relevant premises owned or controlled by the HSE or service providers.  This deals with the inspection and taking of copies of relevant documents and contains standard provisions that apply to procedures of this type.  The chief inspector, in respect of inspections of designated centres, has precisely the same powers as authorised persons.  In addition, under this Part, a warrant may be obtained from the District Court if an authorised person or the chief inspector, where appropriate, is prevented from entering premises or believes there is a likelihood of being prevented from entering premises.  In these circumstances, an authorised person or the chief inspector may be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will be an offence to refuse, obstruct or give false or misleading information to an authorised person or the chief inspector.  Provision is also made for entry to a private residence, if necessary.  Section 78 provides for qualified privilege for the reports of the chief inspector or authorised persons.</P>
        <P>Part 10, comprising sections 79 and 80, provides for the offences under the Bill and the proceedings for summary prosecutions.  A person guilty of a summary offence is liable to a fine of up to &euro;5,000, a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.  A person guilty of an indictable offence is liable to a fine of up to &euro;70,000, a term of imprisonment of up to two years or both.</P>
        <P>Part 11, comprising sections 81 to 85, inclusive, contains the standard provisions for board members, employees and advisers on standards of integrity, codes of conduct and prohibition against unauthorised disclosure of information and the standard disqualifications from board membership and employment.</P>
        <P>Part 12, comprising sections 86 to 97, inclusive, provides for the dissolution of the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board and the interim Health Information and Quality Authority and the transfer of their employees to HIQA.  Part 13, comprising sections 98 to 102, inclusive, provides for the general power to make regulations and specific powers to make regulations regarding registration arrangements and standards in designated centres.  Under section 8, regulations may also be made on the procedures to be followed by HIQA in setting standards.</P>
        <P>Part 14 amends the Health Act 2004 by inserting into that statute a provision dealing with <Col N="1431"/>protected disclosures in the health service.  This is an important innovation and it is important it should be featured in the Bill which is essentially about standards for patient care and safety.  The concept of a protected disclosure, as set out in the Bill, is framed on the basis that the disclosures are made in good faith and on reasonable grounds.  The type of disclosure that will attract protection includes disclosures about actions that put the health or welfare of those in receipt of services or the public generally at risk.  Employees making protected disclosures will be required to follow set procedures, established by the HSE or their employers, except, for example, where urgency is a consideration.  If the person making a protected disclosure is an employee, it safeguards him or her from workplace victimisation.  Furthermore, any person making such a disclosure will have immunity from civil liability, except where he or she recklessly communicates an opinion or makes a false, misleading, frivolous or vexatious allegation or gives information which he or she knows to be incorrect.  It should be noted that if a person makes a report that is false or misleading, he or she may be prosecuted for committing an offence under this Part.</P>
        <P>There are detailed redress procedures involving access to the rights commissioner service and, on appeal, the Labour Court for employees who believe they have been victimised for making disclosures.  The terms &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;employer&rdquo; have been specifically adapted to cover any entity which provides a health service inside or outside the remit of the health legislation.  Employees in private sector health facilities will also be covered by the protections in this Part where they report a matter to a professional regulatory body.  Any person who reports to a professional regulatory body will be covered by the protected disclosure provisions.</P>
        <P>Part 15, comprising sections 104 and 105, provides for consequential amendments to other legislation.  Schedule 1 deals with the repeals and revocations of relevant orders, while Schedule 2 sets out the precise amendments to other legislation.  One of these amendments is to the Civil Registration Act 2004 and arises from the urgent need to continue to facilitate the marriage of seriously or terminally ill people who, by reason of their illness, are unable to travel to a public venue for their marriage.</P>
        <P>I know Senators will agree experience shows that the case for a standards-based approach is indisputable.  There is an imperative for change and a new approach based on high threshold standards that are rigorously monitored and consistently enforced.  By establishing and empowering robust and independent structures in HIQA and the Office of the Chief Inspector, this Bill will help ensure the necessary change happens.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1432"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House, but I cannot welcome the Bill, which is regarded by this side as a belated response to the criminal and systematic abuse of senior citizens in need of continuous care.  While I welcome the establishment of an inspectorate of residential services for older people, people with disabilities and children in care, the Bill is flawed and does not meet the standards set out in my party&rsquo;s policies.  The Government could have gone much further in this legislation, but has failed to do so.</P>
        <P>According to the Government, this Health Bill addresses patient protection, but it does not put the patient at the centre of health services.  How could we possibly support it?  After the recent disastrous failures in the health service, such as the scandal at Leas Cross, the MRSA crisis, deficiencies in hospital hygiene and people left waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, patient protection should be our number one priority, but that is not the case in this legislation.</P>
        <P>People have had hospital procedures cancelled more than once and, as a result, have been condemned to die by the failures of the health system.  Elsewhere, a post mortem ascertained severe burns sustained from a radiator while in the care of a nursing home in County Kilkenny.  These issues in the health care system should be corrected by the Minister for Health and Children and addressed by the legislation.</P>
        <P>At Leas Cross, the HSE allowed elderly people to live in neglect and danger.  That is where this legislation originated.  Every day in accident and emergency departments, people are left waiting in Third World conditions.  When patients leave such departments for wards, their lives are continually threatened by the Government&rsquo;s failure to deal with matters of hygiene, MRSA and all the bugs found in our hospitals each week.</P>
        <P>Nothing in this legislation deals with the MRSA scourge.  It is strange that, as MRSA has grown more prevalent in our health care system, other European countries have addressed the issue, in some cases successfully, while all we get is the same old bluster and bylines to the effect that the Minister is interested in patient safety, when that is not the case.  For this reason, the legislation fails.  If this legislation had been in place for the Leas Cross matter, I wonder whether the person who complained would have been ostracised by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The only way to protect patients is to establish a patient safety authority with full responsibility in this area, as Fine Gael and the Labour Party proposed.  People would trust such an independent body to inquire into their complaints.  Even if there is a failure to establish an independent patient safety authority, one would at least expect the Minister to regard Members of the Oireachtas as suitable authorising persons on condition that they make inquiries in a discreet manner through the appropriate Minister.  Members do not abuse <Col N="1433"/>parliamentary privilege and they respect the institution of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not recognise or protect patients residing in centres registered by the Mental Health Commission or patients residing in acute hospitals.  We need strong legislation to protect the vulnerable people who must use one of our health care institutions.  The Social Services Inspectorate and the commission should have been amalgamated as part of a patient safety authority.  It is vital that we do not stigmatise those with mental illness as being different from patients in the rest of the health service.  Instead of breaking down barriers and destigmatising certain sectors, the Government is drawing in an even darker pen the line between patients with mental illness and patients in other areas of the health service.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis concerning children, particularly refugee children, who were trafficked into this country and escaped the protection of the HSE.  For example, the Minister is well aware that children went missing from a child care facility in Dublin.  We have no idea where they have gone or what happened.  Such an institution is not covered by this legislation.  It covers nursing homes and other specific institutions that have made media headlines rather than those to whom protection should be offered.</P>
        <P>Those suffering mental illness will remain stigmatised because the Government sees fit to protect mental health patients under a different body.  The commission is good and I wish to apply its principles to the entire health service. We should not continue to marginalise and stigmatise people with mental health difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes too many distinct roles for HIQA, which take from the original and sole purpose of the legislation.  The immediate role relates to the setting and monitoring of standards of residential care.  Subsequent roles for HIQA relate to the evaluation of information concerning the health and welfare of the population and setting information standards to ensure best outcomes for resources available to the HSE.  The scope of HIQA&rsquo;s role is too broad in its current form.</P>
        <P>One of the problems with HIQA is that patient safety is not its core objective.  The role of the inspectorate is to examine standards in all institutions involved in health provision.  HIQA&rsquo;s role does not just concern social services inspection, but also the evaluation of technologies.  This is a nice euphemism that slipped through in the explanatory memorandum.  Another of HIQA&rsquo;s functions resembles that of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>Patients in other countries have been given power in that they are placed at the centre of their respective heath services.  Too much confusion is evident within the processes and systems here.  It is unnecessary for the Minister to make all of the changes she has proposed.  The establishment of a patient safety authority would give <Col N="1434"/>power to patients.  Once the Minister moves the power base in the health service more towards patients, the changes she is having difficulty getting through will follow automatically.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will take on board some of the facts we have highlighted.  HIQA is not a patient safety protection agency, its remit is too broad and it will not work.  The Minister must separate the inspectorate and combine it with the commission to set up a proper patient safety authority.  Perhaps the Minister should not dismiss what the Fine Gael and Labour parties are doing, given that the WHO believes it is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on it, as it is an example of how the Minister is forging ahead with necessary change.</P>
        <P>As we all know, this Bill is a fundamental part of the health reform programme begun by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in 2003 and continued by the current Minister, Deputy Harney, since taking over the Department of Health and Children.  The programme is the most extensive reform of the health system in more than 30 years and its priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money and improved health care management.</P>
        <P>The development of a world class public health service is a core objective for everyone in the House because we want to expand quality and access.  We will achieve this through greater investment and system reform.  No one can claim there has not been investment in our health services during the past ten years.  As a share of national income, non-capital public expenditure on health has increased from 5.8% of GNP in 1997 to 7.6% today.  The Government is matching this increase with reform.  For example, the HSE has been established under the reform programme.  While I acknowledge it is facing many challenges, I am confident it will succeed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Bill has many important components, one of which relates to the protection of whistleblowers.  We are all familiar with cases which came to light when whistleblowers draw attention to them.  Those who came forward to expose the details of the Neary case can take credit for bringing to light the outrageous practices in that instance.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, the Ministers of State at the Department of Health and Children and the Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad are responsible for introducing legislation.  They are not responsible for operational matters.  It seems Opposition Senators like to infer that the Minister is to blame if there is malpractice in a hospital, or if a hospital is not living up to the standards of care and cleanliness one would expect.  As somebody who worked in a hospital for many years, I remind the House that those who are paid as managers have to manage. <Col N="1435"/> If management means taking harsh decisions against subordinate staff who are not doing their jobs properly, clear decisions have to be taken on whether the people concerned should continue to work in their current roles.</P>
        <P>The Bill will establish the Health Information and Quality Authority which will guarantee information and assure a certain quality of service and put in place an inspectorate and all that pertains thereto.  Patients will benefit from the top class service that will be secured by the authority.  The inspectorate will ensure the standards of care which will obtain in care locations will adhere to best practice.  One of the key policy aims of the health reform programme is to deliver high quality services, based on best practice supported by evidence.</P>
        <P>My colleague on the other side of the House, Senator Coghlan, spoke about the use of trolleys in hospitals.  We have to be fair and admit that the number of patients on trolleys has reduced significantly.  Similarly, there has been a substantial decrease in the number on waiting lists.  The phrase &ldquo;A Lot Done &mdash; More To Do&rdquo; is as true today as it was the day it was first coined.  The nature of the health service means there will always be more to do.</P>
        <P>The establishment in this legislation of the Health Information and Quality Authority is a central part of the Government&rsquo;s health strategy.  The authority&rsquo;s mandate is to ensure standards of world class apply to health and personal social services throughout the public, private and voluntary sectors.  The authority will engage in monitoring and inspection to ensure those standards are upheld.  It will provide information on health and personal social services and undertake health technology assessments.</P>
        <P>All the information available should be given to those caring for others.  This is important to ensure carers can offer the best possible health care service.  The Health Information and Quality Authority will play a crucial role in providing the highest quality and most efficient health services for patients.  The authority will bring a common thread of efficiency, quality and effectiveness to the health sector.  It will inform and assist decision-making at national, local and individual level.  It will ensure best practice is advanced nationwide rapidly, effectively and consistently.  It will act as a resource for planners, health care professionals, patients and their carers by helping them to make decisions about treatment and health care.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority will provide a stamp of assurance by acting as an underwriter for taxpayers.  It will ensure the highest possible standards of safety and systems are adopted by and embedded within the sector.  It will guarantee value for money in the delivery of health and personal social services.  A great deal has been said about the waste of money.  The establishment of the authority and the inspector<Col N="1436"/>ate in this legislation proves that the Government is keen to obtain value for money in the health sector.</P>
        <P>A great deal of the Bill&rsquo;s focus comes from the fact that the Health Information and Quality Authority will incorporate a new and independent inspectorate and registration authority for residential services.  The independence of the inspectorate will be one of the central reasons for its success.  It will not have to look over its shoulder at Members of the Oireachtas; it will be able to do whatever needs to be done to discharge its functions without apologising to anybody.  The establishment of the inspectorate will allow us to get tough in setting and enforcing standards.  One should not doubt that an independent organisation with real power is being created.</P>
        <P>The Bill will place the existing Social Services Inspectorate, SSI, on a statutory basis.  It will provide for the expansion of the SSI to allow it to inspect and register residential services for people with disabilities and older persons.  This will ensure there will be no recurrence of the problems at Leas Cross and other nursing homes, which have been exposed in recent years.  We cannot undo what has been done.  We can never change history, but we can learn its lessons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Social Services Inspectorate was established in 1999, on an administrative basis, to inspect social services.  While it initially prioritised the inspection of children&rsquo;s residential services run by the Department, it has recently extended that remit to cover foster care services.  Such inspections are particularly important in the light of the revelations of recent years about the abuse of children in some care centres.  The SSI bases its inspections on the national standards for children&rsquo;s residential centres, the 2002 standards for special care units and the 2003 standards for foster care.  These standards which were produced by the Department of Health and Children were the first nationally agreed standards in this area.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me to mention foster care without commenting on the important service foster parents provide for children and parents who experience various difficulties.  I wish to state publicly that I appreciate the fantastic role played in society by foster parents.</P>
        <P>The inspection reports of the Social Services Inspectorate include findings and recommendations based on the standards of best practice.  The first full round of inspections of statutory children&rsquo;s residential centres was completed in 2005.  The SSI uses the unique insights it gains through inspections to support developments which improve quality in the sectors in which it operates.  Its annual reports give an overview of its findings in the sector, prioritise areas for improvement and offer a national summary of service provision.</P>
        <P>The Social Services Inspectorate will be established as an office within the Health Information and Quality Authority, thereby allowing it to con<Col N="1437"/>tinue its work on child welfare and protection services.  The current inspection and registration arrangements are being replaced and strengthened.  There will be a fully independent inspectorate for public and private nursing homes, as well as for the first time centres for children and people with disabilities.  I welcome this provision, one of the most innovative aspects of the Bill.</P>
        <P>This legislation provides for clearer procedures which will allow a centre to be closed if its continued operation poses a risk to the health or welfare of its residents.  It outlines an explicit procedure to be followed if a centre needs to be closed immediately or urgently.  The Government is responsible for ensuring the standards set are applied consistently and on a national basis.  We need to outline the circumstances in which action can be taken quickly and effectively, when necessary, to protect service users.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority will have strong powers to monitor standards, including the power to enter and inspect premises, access documents and interview staff.  Senators will be aware of a notorious case in the last couple of years in which documents disappeared.  The Bill will give the inspectorate more power to deal with such cases.  The authority will engage in reviews and inspections to ensure standards are being met.  It will investigate serious concerns relating to health or social services.  It will evaluate and provide information for staff and the public on how well services are performing.  Such information will inform the planning of future services.  The authority will also assess new and existing drugs and equipment to ensure that they impact positively on the quality of life for patients and, importantly, represent value for money.</P>
        <P>Inspections by the chief inspector of social services will be carried out against standards set by HIQA and ministerial regulations.  They will cover areas such as accommodation, qualifications, numbers of employees, food and records.  In regard to the number of employees, in some cases, especially in private nursing homes, the euro features largely on the horizon, particularly in geriatric care, where a certain staffing level is required to meet the needs of patients.  It will be a core role of the inspectorate to ensure that all care locations, public or private, will have the required number of people to provide the appropriate service.  That is important.</P>
        <P>If the chief inspector is not satisfied that a residential centre meets the relevant standards, the centre will not be registered and will not be able to operate.  If he or she considers that a registered centre fails at some stage to comply with standards, the registration will be cancelled.  In other words, if such a centre does not deliver, it will be shut down and rightly so.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State outlined the penalties and I will not repeat them.  The HIQA is already established on an interim basis and it will be established on a statutory basis under this Bill.  It <Col N="1438"/>has undertaken a considerable amount of work to ensure that it will be able to recruit staff and undertake its responsibilities following the passage of this legislation.</P>
        <P>We all have a right to expect that when we or our loved ones come into contact with our health and social services we will be treated safely with high quality care, dignity and respect.  The responsibility for delivering a quality service lies with the providers of health and personal social services.  I am sure that HIQA will be a strong and fair watchdog to protect those in residential care settings.  I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the Bill.  We were all dismayed by the report written by Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill on the conditions in certain private nursing home.  It became clear that we needed far more robust standards for the inspection of institutions which provide cared for people, including children, who are elderly, ill or vulnerable.  This is a welcome and rapid response to the problems that were disclosed.  </P>
        <P>The Bill is wide-ranging.  The provision for the scope of premises to be reviewed and certified by the inspector and his or her staff is enormous.  It will take a great deal of work, even with inspections only every three years, to ensure they are all properly covered.  The bill for such inspections will be an expensive one for the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I did not agree with Senator Glynn when he said it is our role only to introduce legislation and following that we have no responsibility.  I was much more taken by what Senator Mansergh said on the Order of Business this morning when we discussed the issue of the State&rsquo;s responsibility to children in our national schools and the fact that the State, the Government and the Department have no responsibility for children who might be abused in our national schools.  Senator Mansergh pointed out that legal and moral responsibility are different.  I would have thought we all have a huge responsibility to ensure that this Bill is implemented and the recommendations in it are enforced.</P>
        <P>It is easy to introduce legislation and we are terrific at writing reports but subsequently there is frequently very little action.  I would like to be assured that plenty of money will be available to the inspector and to his or her staff to ensure that what we wish to achieve with the enactment of this legislation will be implemented.  That is extremely important.  Most people in these institutions are vulnerable.  Some have relations who visit them frequently.  However, Senator Glynn has often pointed out that some patients in psychiatric institutions, a service in which he had a career before he became a Member of  the Seanad, have visitors very infrequently.  Effectively, many of them are on their own and rely on the staff and those who should implement <Col N="1439"/>regulations to make sure that they are safe, comfortable, not bullied and so forth.  We have a continuing interest in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Operational details are a matter for employees and not for the Minister of the day or Members of this House. People who are paid to do a job in an institution or a hospital should do it and not depend on the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for that information but the Minister is at the top of the tree.  If the authority is not doing its job, it is the Minister who is supposed to keep an eye on the authority.</P>
        <P>The health care providers in private nursing homes will be covered by this legislation.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Authority will operate accreditation programmes and other schemes aimed at ensuring safety and quality in the provision of services.  It will also be open to private health care providers to apply to the Authority for accreditation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am not sure who are these private health care providers.  The Minister of State, when replying, might indicate who they are.  The more people who are accredited under this scheme the better.</P>
        <P>The authority will be required to bring forward a business plan.  Business plans are great but the preparation of them by an institution can be terribly time-consuming.  I hope this requirement does not take up too much of the authority&rsquo;s time.  Business plans can vary, on occasion, by the hour.  The legislation allows for the plan, when brought forward, to vary but I would not like to think it is one of the most important tasks the authority will undertake.</P>
        <P>Will a logo or some other symbol be introduced that private nursing homes or residential care facilities could display?  That would encourage people to obtain accreditation and meet required standards.  Owners of premises, such as restaurants or shops, usually have a sense of pride and can point to a logo which shows they meet certain standards.  Will certificates have to be publicly displayed in a residential unit?  I did not note a reference to such a provision in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am glad the section on protected disclosures has been brought forward because whistleblowers want to be anonymous.  We would not have had the Neary inquiry if two midwives had not gone anonymously to the then North Eastern Health Board to voice their complaints.  To the great relief of myself and everybody else, the Northern Eastern Health Board management acted rapidly.  What followed from that showed dangerous practice was taking place.  Whistleblowing legislation was badly needed and it appears that the provision in that respect is well covered.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance <Col N="1440"/>which it is hoped will report by the end of 2008.  If it makes any recommendations that the Minister considers would be useful to this legislation, I hope this legislation would be amended.  Will the Minister encourage the amendment of this legislation so that the advice of the commission can be taken on board?  There is not much point in setting up a commission on this issue if we do not act on its advice if it appears sensible.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to see provisions in the legislation for the functions of the authority but I would prefer if they had been explained more fully.  I refer to subsection 8(1)(<i>h</i>) which states, &ldquo; to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of health technologies including drugs and provide advice arising out of the evaluation to the Minister and the Executive;&rdquo;.  I have stated both in the House and at the Joint Committee on Health and Children on many occasions that the only people undertaking assessment of health technologies are those in the drugs industry.  They are most unlikely to declare that a hot bath would be better than taking some anti-arthritic drug or painkiller.  It is essential that the Government ensures other technologies are considered and I would welcome this.  I question whether there will be co-operation with the Health Research Board on this matter as it is a mighty undertaking for the authority.  The setting up of such trials would be a significant undertaking.  Does the legislation provide for the authority to do this on its own or with the help of the Health Research Board?</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of State that the drug companies carry out all the research in these areas.  Even at international level it is rare for trials to be carried out on other treatments in concurrence with drug therapy trials.  Independent hospitals will sometimes carry out such trials.  For example, in the case of slipped discs, one third of patients will be given operative treatment, another third will be given drug treatment and the final third will not be given any treatment.  In many of these trials, all patients turned out the same after a couple of years.  This is not to say some patients did not have more pain than others.  These trials are well worthwhile but they are not apparent in this legislation.</P>
        <P>Subsection 8(1)(<i>i</i>) states, &ldquo;to evaluate available information respecting the services and the health and welfare of the population;&rdquo;.  This is a public health issue of significance.  Will there be any co-operation with public health doctors or will the authority have a solo function?  We need to know how these two subsections will operate.  Will the authority do the work itself or farm it out to other institutions?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill which will have a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope it is enacted in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have an interest in speaking in this debate because of my document on a new approach to ageing and ageism.</P><Col N="1441"/>
        <P>The establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority comes not before its time.  I am in favour of its powers to establish, monitor and investigate standards of service provided by the HSE or on behalf of the HSE.  I can only hope the authority will be rigorous in both the setting of standards of service to be provided and in its monitoring of these in practice.  These standards are in place to help protect the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>The Seanad has debated on many occasions the standards of care afforded to nursing home residents since the Leas Cross scandal broke in 2005.  In February 2007, Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill, the author of the Leas Cross report, spoke about a new study which revealed that almost 90% of residents in nursing homes have a disability.  He declared that our nursing homes are populated by the most frail group of older people.</P>
        <P>This Bill provides a framework for serious action to be taken and I sincerely hope that real action and improvements take place.  The Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services, which is also established in this Bill, will ensure a fully independent inspectorate for all nursing homes, both public and private, as well as for centres for children and those people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>We have a special obligation to all those in care such as young people, children, older people and those with disabilities.  On too many occasions we have witnessed an abominable neglect of the duty of care.  Let future generations not speak of our treatment of those in residential care in the same tones we have used to speak of those in positions of authority in years gone by.</P>
        <P>We must ensure they do not ask, as we have done, &ldquo;How could they have let that happen?  Why did no one stand up and shout stop?&rdquo;.  We are now learning about the mistakes of the past but it is truly lamentable that we had to be shamed into action by a television programme.  It is my hope that investigations into safety, quality and standard of service carried out under the auspices of the Health Information and Quality Authority will be initiated promptly and conducted thoroughly.</P>
        <P>We in Ireland are fantastic at introducing regulations and in drawing up reports but, for God&rsquo;s sake, I ask that these regulations dealing with nursing homes be implemented and enforced.  It is not enough to pass this Bill; we want to see enforcement.  I cite the examples of countries like Germany or Switzerland where laws are introduced, implemented and enforced.</P>
        <P>We all know that talk is cheap and that actions speak louder than words.  Regulations which are not enforced are not worth the paper they are written on.  What good is a system of two inspections a year, either announced or unannounced, when the findings are obscured by bureaucracy or a lack of resources or will and a fear of implementing them?</P>
        <P>The northern area health board received numerous reports of the deficiencies in Leas <Col N="1442"/>Cross but nothing substantive was done until outrage at the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme brought it onto the public radar.  That must never happen again.</P>
        <P>It is vital the response to suspicions of ill-treatment of those in residential care takes place with the least possible delay.  If residents of designated centres find themselves poorly treated they may often have nowhere else to go or nowhere that is capable of meeting their needs.  We cannot allow them to languish in suffering.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the chief inspector will have the power to act quickly in urgent situations.  Leas Cross was a wake-up call to those responsible for these matters.  We must ensure they stay awake, alert and on the job.  I run a food production company and I know the implementation of standards by the multiples is impeccable.  Visitations by the retailers to the food production companies are both announced and unannounced.  There is no excuse.  People will be required to deliver and to have the highest possible standards.  We need the HSE and the bureaucracy to implement and enforce these decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House.  I also welcome the publication and the passing by the D&aacute;il of the Health Bill 2006.  This is important legislation because it is timely and necessary.  Many of the points made by Senator White are correct as far as the implementation of the Bill is concerned.</P>
        <P>The benefit of this Bill is that inspections will be carried out not only on private nursing homes but also on public nursing homes.  They were exempt from the original inspection system that was carried out by the former health boards and which continued under the Health Service Executive.  One gets the impression there was no inspector operating, but in fact there was.  From my experience on the health board, quite a number of private nursing homes came under very close scrutiny.  The possibility was raised that some of them might be closed down for poor conditions.  However, in many cases the service, care and kindness provided by many owners and managers of these institutions was second to none.  There may have been difficulties with the facilities, but the care and attention was not lacking.  The public nursing homes were exempt from any inspection whatever by this inspectorate, which was an anomaly because many of the public nursing homes had conditions which were not up to the standards we expect in this millennium.  That is why I welcome the fact the Bill provides for the inspection of public nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The residents in public and private nursing homes are not empowered when it comes to their views on the management of these homes.  There is a case to be made for a committee within the institution to be consulted on issues and to voice concerns.  Many of the active residents of nursing homes are quite capable of putting forward the views of other residents on care and conditions. <Col N="1443"/> When I visit the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon, I meet patients who have brought to my attention on behalf of other patients the conditions of sanitary facilities in those institutions.  There is a case to be made for the empowerment of those patients.</P>
        <P>A tax incentive is provided for the establishment of nursing homes, but there is no control on the numbers we require.  In fact, some quality nursing homes are surviving and possibly making a good profit, while the demand does not exist for other nursing homes in the same locality.  In that respect, there is excessive competition and because it is tax driven, there is no control.  The inspectors and the Health Information and Quality Authority should be given some power to license the establishment of nursing homes in a specific area in advance of the construction of the home.  They should also have a role in the plans for the home.  There is no reason the plans for a nursing home should not be submitted to the authority for its views on the design of the building.  I am also pleased there is an attempt to utilise the staff currently employed.</P>
        <P>I discovered something in the Bill which I thought was being removed from all legislation.  Section 13(3) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A person is not eligible for appointment as a member of the Board or a committee of the Board, if the person is-</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of  local authorities have now been deemed ineligible to be a member of this board for no reason other than they are prepared to serve the public and go before the electorate.  No person is in a better position to serve on this board than someone who has the experience of serving the public in public life.  In a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting, I put my name to a motion to ensure this type of pro<Col N="1444"/>vision would not be included in Bills in the future.  The motion was agreed unanimously and the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to that debate and said that he would never include such a provision in a Bill that he brought before the Oireachtas.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure an amendment in the name of those of us on this side of the House is tabled to remove this exemption from the Bill.</P>
        <P>In page 55 of the Bill, it states that if a member of the board becomes a candidate or a member of a local authority, he must resign from the board.  Looking at this logically, the only people excluded are prisoners and public representatives.  Both are ineligible to be members of this board.  I served on a local authority for 22 years and I take grave exception to this provision.  I put forward my views to the members of my electorate and it would be remiss of me if I did not make this point today.  As a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators&rsquo; group, I will do my utmost to have an amendment tabled on this Bill.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Minister to have this exemption removed from the Bill.  If these representatives are not excluded, it does not necessarily mean that they will be included, which is a matter for the Minister and the particular authority.  However, where somebody is suitably qualified, he or she could serve well on that board.  The person could have his or her ear to the ground, so to speak, regarding the management of these homes in the region.  The person could be a member of the new health consultative forum.  I rest my case on that issue.</P>
        <P>I welcome the amendment in this Bill to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  It relates to marriages being conducted in a home or private dwelling for medical reasons when certified by a general practitioner.  I am not sure if it applies to other institutions of the State such as prisons.  Seeing that the amendment is in the Bill, it is an opportunity for the Minister to look at this from a civil rights point of view.  A right to marry is something that is very special and someone in prison who wishes to marry might be able to avail of this.</P>
        <P>This is a timely Bill.  I commend the Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children on bringing it before the House.  It is very important we protect our elderly people.  We have a duty and a responsibility to ensure they live in proper conditions with proper services, food and heating.  This inspectorate certainly will ensure that, from now on, we will have a transparent approach to the management of private and public residential nursing homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill because it improves the situation in our health system.  The problem with the Bill is that it does not go far enough.  It does the minimum in providing for the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social <Col N="1445"/>Services  However, it does not go as far as it should in terms of placing patients and their needs to the fore.</P>
        <P>What is needed is the Labour Party-Fine Gael proposal for a patient safety authority.  The Minister of State will be aware that Labour and Fine Gael recently launched a policy document, Patients First, which provides for a new approach to regulating and monitoring patient care and which calls for the establishment of an independent body &mdash; the patient safety authority &mdash; with a strong legislative base.  The remit of the patient safety authority would be entirely patient-focused, which is what is needed.  In addition, it would bring together the various regulatory bodies and work in conjunction with other statutory bodies or professional bodies that have a regulatory function.</P>
        <P>No one is charged at present with ensuring patient safety in our health care facilities.  The difficulty with the Bill is that it makes no provision in respect of the licensing of hospitals &mdash; this would lead to their being properly inspected &mdash; or the regulation of private hospitals.  There are limited avenues through which patients can seek redress for substandard care.  Labour and Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal for the establishment of a patient safety authority would provide people with a much needed avenue of complaint.  The authority would be the patient&rsquo;s watchdog, it would independently review, inspect and assess the management, provision and quality of health and social care and, most importantly, it would promote human rights.</P>
        <P>I heard a recent edition of &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; and I was extremely impressed by an interview given by an Irish priest who had come home to Ireland on holiday.  What he said echoed much of what I hear when I knock on doors and talk to people about the health system, the issue of MRSA, etc.  While the priest to whom I refer was in Ireland, his sister fell ill and had to be admitted to hospital for treatment.  When in hospital, she unfortunately contracted MRSA.  Following her treatment, the woman, who was only in her early 60s, passed away.  The point the priest made to Pat Kenny was that there is a great deal of talk about charity in this country but he asked what is the position as regards people&rsquo;s fundamental rights.  He stated that the most vulnerable people in society are those who require hospital treatment.  These individuals have a right to receive the best care.  They also have a right not to emerge from hospital with their health in a worse state than it was when they were admitted.  It is not acceptable that people are dying because their health deteriorates following a stay in hospital.  We must do whatever we can to eradicate MRSA from our hospitals.  Other countries have done so and we have a duty to follow suit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the duties of the patient safety authority proposed by Labour and Fine Gael would be to carry out regular external hygiene audits and ensure that hospitals have effective cleaning pro<Col N="1446"/>cedures and follow good hygiene practice.  Members of the public are of the view that hospitals should be clean.  People believe &mdash; they are right &mdash; that hospitals used to be cleaner in the past.  I have not had a huge amount of experience of hospitals.  However, I am aware that hospital toilets are often dirty.  In fact, they are dirtier than those one would see in many other public places.  I once had to visit hospital late at night and was obliged to provide a urine sample.  I went into the public toilet in the hospital but there were no lights on other than those used to deter heroin users.  I could not see what I was doing, it was not possible to close the door and the toilets were dirty and could not be flushed.  Needless to say, I did not have a very good experience.</P>
        <P>There has been much negative publicity about maternity units in recent times.  The <i>Evening Herald</i> has been running stories on the matter and printed a letter from a patient in the Rotunda who had the unfortunate experience of miscarrying.  I am of the opinion that if one visited any of our maternity hospitals, one would find other women with similar stories to tell.  Even though quite a few people have miscarriages, many of them do not discuss their experiences with others.  The woman to whom I refer who wrote to the <i>Evening Herald</i> did so anonymously and later others came forward with similar stories.</P>
        <P>When one enters hospital to give birth, the overall experience, particularly if one has a healthy baby, is good.  The only occasion on which I was obliged to stay in hospital was when I gave birth.  I had many good experiences while there but I was also unhappy with certain aspects of my stay.  Some of my disappointment related to problems with hygiene and the remainder related to how I was treated by particular members of staff, etc.  Hospital authorities &mdash; particularly those in maternity hospitals &mdash; should consult patients after their stay in hospital and inquire with regard to what was good and bad about their experience and where they think improvements might be made.  To my knowledge &mdash; it certainly did not happen to me &mdash; hospital authorities do not engage in such activity.</P>
        <P>A recent study carried out by obstetricians in which maternity services were evaluated and in which patients who had experience of such services were surveyed indicated a great deal of dissatisfaction regarding the quality of care in our maternity hospitals.  Issues arise in respect of how people are treated in hospital, including those who are admitted to have babies.  Hospital authorities must be much more proactive with regard to discovering what is wrong with the services on offer, what needs to be improved, what are the good things, etc.  I am not saying that it is all doom and gloom in our hospitals but there are problems that need to be addressed.  The patient safety authority would be one forum through which this might be achieved.</P><Col N="1447"/>
        <P>I hope the Health Information and Quality Authority will carry out the type of research to which I refer.  The Minister of State indicated that the authority will carry out investigations on its own initiative into safety, quality and standards of services where it believes there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving services.  In my view it should go much further than that and carry out surveys among patients who access services in different parts of the health system and discover where problems exist.  People do not necessarily complain about inadequate services because they might perhaps be satisfied with the overall level of care they receive.  I hope the Health Information and Quality Authority will be proactive in that regard and will try to discover what needs to be done.  The most obvious avenue it should explore first is what needs to be done to improve maternity services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The majority of those who work in the health service are good people and they do a good job and work very hard.  In many instances they operate under pressure, particularly in circumstances where the proper resources and staffing levels are lacking.  Such issues must be addressed.  It is important that patients should be placed to the fore in the context of the health system.  They should be treated with dignity and respect and should be able to have their say on how the health service should be run.  This is not the case at present within the health system but provision should be made to bring about that which I am suggesting.  I do not know whether it is the fault of individuals or the system but when one is admitted to hospital, one is often treated as almost sub-human.  It is almost as if one does not have the same rights as one had before entering hospital.  This relates to the overall focus of the health system.  We introduced patient charters in the past but I do not believe we have gone far enough.  We must put the patients to the forefront of the health system so that they are the primary people in the health system.  It is important that all the different interests have their say, are respected and get proper resourcing, but the patient is the most important person in the health service and we must ensure that is so in future.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for the broad welcome they extended to this legislation.  Although Senator Coghlan was careful to point out his party had a distinct philosophical position on the legislation,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State not to shoot the substitute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;most Senators recognised the need for legislation of this character.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the scourge of MRSA.  Of course, the authority will set standards on safety and quality in health care and, as <Col N="1448"/>part of that function, has been asked to address the issue of MRSA.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan also raised the question of whether mental health services could be included in the legislation, but the view the Minister took was that it would be inappropriate to include mental health services in view of the establishment of the mental health commission and to give HIQA a role in these services would give rise to confusion as to what organisation was responsible for the mental health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Health technology assessment was also raised by Senator Coghlan.  Clearly, health technology assessment is important and a critical part of HIQA&rsquo;s functions is to promote quality care.  The role of HIQA here will be to support evidence-based decision-making and the availability of expert evaluation of health technologies will be a valuable resource for the HSE and for service providers.  HIQA adds further value to the health chain by having an advisory function in that regard.  That role in health technology assessment will be important in the future and I appreciate why Fine Gael has raised this issue because health technology assessment is widely regarded as able to deliver succinct, high-quality and trusted evidence to decision-makers at all levels of the health care system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is envisaged that the HIQA health technology assessment function will support those evidence-based decisions and that the availability of impartial evaluations of the clinical value and cost-effectiveness of complex health technologies, including drugs, would be very valuable for service providers, health care practitioners and policy-makers.  The role of HIQA in this context will be to advise the Minister and the HSE in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn warmly welcomed the Bill and made the point that the Government is responsible for legislation and for the overall funding allocated to the HSE, but of course operational decisions on matters are the responsibility of those who carry them out.  As we approach the next few weeks when there will be a great deal of debate about the quality and fairness of the health service, it is a point worth making in the public debate that the Minister for Health and Children presides at the top of a pyramid, which employs in excess of 100,000 persons and which is involved in the expenditure of over &euro;15 billion.  Clearly, critical responsibilities exist at every level of this system.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry was anxious to inquire as to how quickly and effectively the Bill would be implemented.  The interim HIQA was established in 2005.  That body already recruited a chief executive officer and recruitment of the other staff is being undertaken, and the existing staff in the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board and the Social Services Inspectorate will join HIQA on the establishment day.  Clearly, a considerable amount of work has already been done.  The health technology assessment was also raised by <Col N="1449"/>Senator Henry and I restate the point that of course the function here is advisory in character to the HSE and to the Government.</P>
        <P>In carrying out its functions HIQA must co-operate with other public authorities and this would include the Health Research Board.  That is quite clear from section 8(2)(<i>b</i>).  The Bill, therefore, gives wide scope to HIQA to carry out work with other bodies.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry also raised the question of the patient safety commission.  Legislation will be required to implement the licensing of hospitals and health facilities, either by way of new legislation or by way of an amendment to this legislation, depending on the recommendation of the patient safety commission.</P>
        <P>Senator White raised the important question of enforcement.  Clearly, this new independent inspection system established under the legislation will ensure that regulations and standards in designated centres will be enforced.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden turned to the important question of the inspection system, that it now covers both public and private nursing homes.  I agree with him that a critical feature of this legislation is that it applies equally to both.  He also referred to the licensing of homes and, as I stated earlier, the question of licensing is being addressed by the patient safety commission.  Depending on what the commission recommends, we must make a decision as to whether to amend this legislation or introduce separate legislation to deal with it.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden also raised the question of the membership of members of local authorities of boards such as the one established in this legislation.  He stated that it is an issue about which he has had considerable concerns for a period of time and despite receiving some favourable assurances from a member of the Government, the matter does not seem to have been followed up at the drafting level where the standard clauses are being introduced.  I will draw the attention of the Minister to this matter.  Senator Leyden indicated he may well table an amendment to the Bill in this connection.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy raised the question of redress for substandard care.  A new complaints system was established by the 2004 Health Act and it was brought into operation at the beginning of this year.  It provides a statutory system for making complaints and seeking reviews on a wide range of issues other than clinical decisions and actions.  Complaints about clinical decisions and actions are dealt with by the professional regulatory bodies such as the Medical Council in the case of doctors and the analogous bodies in nursing and pharmacy.  The position on attitudes is that a complaints framework can provide for dealing with complaints issues such as staff attitudes and hygiene.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important part of the health reform programme introduced by the Government.  There are those who will argue the Bill does not go far enough, but we must be practical <Col N="1450"/>and look at what has been worked up within the system.  Looking to the future, the authority established by this system will provide a valuable external audit on an area which, as I stated at the beginning, involves the expenditure of a significant amount of public money and the deployment of a considerable number of personnel.  It is important in considering legislation of this type that we appreciate that fact and, given the amounts involved, that we put in a system of external evaluation such as is envisaged by this legislation.  I thank the Senators for their help in the debate.</P>

    <Title>Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P FLI="0">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend and update the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001, which established the legislative foundations for the launch in 2003 of the Irish asset covered securities market.  Ireland has since then moved quickly to confirm its role in this expanding specialist activity and by the end of 2005, we had become the sixth largest market in Europe for this type of security.  It has been a particular success of the Irish Financial Services Centre, generating significant employment, incomes and tax revenue for Ireland and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a centre of excellence in international financial service provision.  The term &ldquo;asset covered securities&rdquo;, ACS, is really our brand name for covered bonds issued under the Irish ACS statutory framework.  They are bonds which are issued by designated credit institutions &mdash; specialist banks &mdash; set up under licence issued by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The covered bonds legislative and regulatory framework established under the 2001 Act is widely regarded as a best practice regime and an improvement in certain respects on other long-established jurisdictions in this market.  However, competition between covered bonds issuers in the various member states is intense and several states have subsequently introduced innovative refinements to their covered bond regimes.  In addition, while covered bonds issuance used to be largely a European banking activity, some American banks have now resorted to this European technique, thus bringing further pressures and opportunities <Col N="1451"/>to the market.  The amendments proposed in this Bill will maintain and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position in this area, secure existing employment and create opportunities for further growth.</P>
        <P>A number of factors underlie the urgency with which this legislation is being brought.  The Bill is needed to effect some necessary technical changes to the 2001 Act to provide more legal clarity and facilitate greater flexibility when operating some provisions of the 2001 Act.  Financial services are a highly competitive industry in terms of innovation in the nature of the services and products being offered and the scope allowed by the legislative regimes in the different jurisdictions in which financial centres are located.  A competitive opportunity can be gained from being an early mover when a new innovation becomes feasible but, once reforms are announced, they can be followed quickly by similar measures in other centres and the advantage will be lost if proposals are not brought to market as expeditiously as possible.  Imitation may well be a supreme form of flattery but in the world of financial services, it is a challenge and a competitive threat.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline the background to this important niche sector of the financial services industry.  Covered bonds are bonds, or debt instruments, which are issued to investors and backed by, or secured on, a ring-fenced cover pool of eligible assets, currently restricted under Irish legislation to residential mortgage loans or public sector debt.  Investors in covered bonds have a preferential claim on the assets in the cover assets pool in the event of a default by the issuing bank.  The assets in the pool, which essentially are the loans in the pool, serve as collateral backing for the bonds, and the interest and principal repayments on those loans are used to meet the interest payments due to the bondholders and, eventually, to redeem the bonds.  Meanwhile, the funding raised from the bond issue can be used to make further loans.</P>
        <P>The process of issuing covered bonds is the most cost efficient form of secured long-term funding available to Irish banks.  This activity takes place entirely within the wholesale end of the banking sector and the bonds are not for retail customers.  This means that the investors are, for the most part, professional institutional investors such as pension funds, investment funds and banks, including central banks.  The investors who buy our covered bonds are located worldwide.  Thus, Irish covered bonds are now a global capital markets product.  The attraction of these bonds is that they provide investors with access to a security that is supported by high quality assets over which the investors maintain a robust, preferential claim.  One of the features of the cover assets pool is its dynamic nature, which means non-performing or redeemed assets must be replaced in the pool by new assets.  In this way, the high quality of the cover assets pool can be <Col N="1452"/>maintained.  This dynamic feature of the cover assets pool, allied to the conservative management of the pool, enables institutions to obtain high credit ratings for such bonds and to issue covered bonds at low interest rates.</P>
        <P>There are two distinct types of asset covered security, the first of which is a public credit covered security.  These securities are issued by specialist banks associated with credit institutions, the main activity of which is the provision of finance to Governments, municipalities and local authorities.  The securities are backed by public sector assets such as sovereign bonds, local authority loans and Government guaranteed loans.  The second type of asset covered security is a mortgage covered security.  These securities are issued by institutions with significant mortgage loan portfolios.  Where a designated credit institution has been authorised as a designated public credit institution and a designated mortgage credit institution, it must keep a separate cover assets pool for each of the different types of securities it issues.  The backing cover assets, that is, mortgage loans and public sector debt, cannot be mixed in the same cover assets pool.</P>
        <P>Total employment in Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector now stands at more than 19,000.  This is in addition to the 40,000 or so employed in the wider financial services sector at domestic level.  Employment in international financial services is highly lucrative for the Exchequer, with the total yield of corporation tax from IFSC companies in 2006 standing at more than &euro;1 billion according to the Revenue Commissioners.  That amount represents almost 16% of the total corporation tax yield of &euro;6.7 billion for the State in 2006.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;asset backed securities&rdquo; covers a wide spectrum of financial products but covered bonds are at the low-risk end of that spectrum because the activity is governed by specific and bespoke legislation.  The covered bond issuer must be a credit institution and is subject to tight regulatory and prudential supervision.  There is regular interaction between the issuer and the Financial Regulator to the extent that it could be described as micro-regulation.  The set of eligible cover assets is tightly restricted and set down in the legislation.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, it is currently limited to residential mortgage loans and public sector debt which must also meet certain credit quality requirements.  The cover assets pool must contain sufficient cover assets to meet bondholders&rsquo; claims throughout the entire term of the bonds in issue.</P>
        <P>Where the investors are themselves credit institutions, the bonds can be particularly attractive owing to the favourably low level of capital that must be held against that class of investment.  To qualify for this concessionary treatment, it is crucial for the bond issuer that the bond issue gain a triple-A rating from the international credit rating agencies.  That rating is only awarded after very close vetting by those agencies, which <Col N="1453"/>act in the interests of investors, and means that the proposed bond offering is fully and securely collateralised by high quality assets in accordance with the terms of the governing legislation.  All of the bonds issued to date under the Irish covered bonds framework have qualified for the triple-A rating.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While this technique is new to Ireland, it is not exactly a recent innovation and has been around in the form of the German <i>Pfandbriefe </i>model for about 150 years.  However, it was only in the past decade that other member states with developed financial services industries began facilitating this type of activity.  It is believed that the availability of asset covered securities has contributed to stability in continental European markets owing to their long-term primarily fixed rate nature.  Their high credit rating enables issuing institutions to raise long-term funds at interest rates only marginally higher than those of a sovereign borrower.  This confers a significant competitive advantage on the banks which can access this cheaper form of credit.</P>
        <P>With an increasing proportion of savings in Ireland going directly into investment funds and pension schemes rather than being held on deposit with banks, it has become important for our banks to be able to draw on diversified sources of funding in order that the financial system can support economic activity effectively.  I trust it will be clear to Senators from what I have outlined thus far that this specialised financial service is operationally important for the domestic side of our banking industry in terms of raising funding as well as strategically vital for the internationally focused side of the industry.</P>
        <P>The parent Act, which we are now amending, dates from 2001.  It might seem somewhat premature to overhaul a relatively recent Act so quickly.  However, the financial sector is particularly conscious of the need to have solid legal backing for its activities.  Large sums are at stake in many activities and there must be absolute legal certainty as to the rights and duties of the contracting parties.  Certain provisions of the 2001 Act are deemed by the industry to be in urgent need of clarification to ensure greater legal certainty, particularly as regards aspects of complementary activities such as hedging contracts and the associated provision of hedging collateral.  Accordingly, it is necessary to make a range of technical changes to provide greater legal certainty and more operational flexibility as regards various elements of our existing regime.  At the same time, the opportunity is being taken to modernise the regime in the light of changes made in other jurisdictions and in EU legislation.  We now have a &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; to exploit reforms introduced under the EU&rsquo;s recent capital requirements directive, or CRD as it is now generally called.  It is not only a question of aligning our regime with the provisions of the CRD to gain some competitive advantage over other issuers because if we do not align our ACS frame<Col N="1454"/>work quickly with the CRD&rsquo;s, then our covered bonds will become less attractive as investment products for foreign banks and other entities which hold these bonds.  As a &ldquo;first mover&rdquo; in incorporating the CRD&rsquo;s reforms into our ACS regime, we gain a competitive advantage for those who issue those bonds under our legislative and regulatory framework.</P>
        <P>I will outline for the House the technical changes needed to meet the operational needs of this specialist sector. First, the industry has been seeking clarification of the term &ldquo;duration&rdquo; in the 2001 Act.  It relates to the weighted average term to maturity of the mortgages or loans held in the cover asset pool.  The proposed revised definition is in line with standard industry usage.  Second, derivatives such as swaps are used to hedge various risks such as currency risks, credit risks or interest rate risks.  The proposal is that the associated collateral lodged by the hedge counter party would be protected in the event of the bank&rsquo;s insolvency, as with the assets in the cover assets pool, but maintained separately from those &ldquo;cover assets&rdquo; in the pool.  This will serve to reassure hedge counter parties and further facilitate the collateralisation of hedge pool contracts.</P>
        <P>Section 2(<i>n</i>) inserts a new definition of the term &ldquo;include&rdquo; in the 2001 Act.  This definition is needed to make it clear that the insertion of an asset or hedge collateral into the cover assets pool does not mean the continued maintenance of that asset in that pool because it is necessary to actively manage the assets in the pool on an ongoing basis.  This new definition has, in turn, triggered a raft of consequential amendments throughout the Act whereby the word &ldquo;included&rdquo; is replaced by the term &ldquo;comprised&rdquo;.  Timely modernisations are also included, in line with trends in other jurisdictions.  For instance, the 2001 Act requires that the asset covered securities be fully, that is, 100%, collateralised.  It is proposed to strengthen investors&rsquo; rights by introducing mandatory overcollateralisation of 3% in the case of residential mortgage loan and public sector loan pools.  Several major reforms now proposed arise from the coming into effect on 1 January last of the EU&rsquo;s CRD.  The CRD was designed to give effect across the Community to the new Basel II capital accord.</P>
        <P>However, the directive also opened up new opportunities as regards the regulatory treatment of covered bonds.  Perhaps the most significant innovation being advanced is a new type of designated credit institution &mdash; a designated commercial mortgage credit institution &mdash; which will be enabled to issue covered bonds secured on commercial mortgage loans.  The Bill includes a provision for commencement orders and the sections relevant to commercial mortgages may be commenced at a later date to allow time for the details of the regulatory regime to be set out by the Financial Regulator in consultation with the industry.  The mandatory overcollateralisation in <Col N="1455"/>the case of a commercial mortgage cover assets pool will be 10%.</P>
        <P>Among other innovations in our ACS regime following on from the CRD are the following: the definition of &ldquo;public credit&rdquo; is being modified to bring it into line with the directive definition and New Zealand and Australia are being added to the existing list of non-EEA countries &mdash; currently comprising of Canada, Japan, the Swiss Confederation and the USA &mdash; whose assets may be included in a cover assets pool; to reflect the developing nature of the ACS business, it is proposed to provide for the use of loans to highly rated multilateral development banks such as the IBRD, the EBRD the EIB, the Asian Development Bank and so on.  It will also cover loans to international organisations such as the IMF and BIS; the pool eligibility criteria for so-called &ldquo;substitution assets&rdquo; &mdash; essentially temporarily surplus cash from the &ldquo;cover assets pool&rdquo; held on short-term deposit with highly-rated banks &mdash; are being brought into line with the CRD.  This involves,<i> inter alia</i>, reducing the Irish limit for substitution assets of 20% on a pool asset basis to 15% on a covered bonds outstanding basis; the amendments also provide for the inclusion of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, that is, units of mortgage securitisation issues, in the respective cover assets pools and also meet the requirements of the CRD in this regard; and the current provisions that restrict the level of public credit covered securities to 50 times the designated credit institution&rsquo;s own funds level are being modified as a result of the changing risk weighting of public sector loans under the<?oasys _jy ?>CRD.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware this is quite technical and complex legislation but I assure them the reforms I have outlined have been carefully drafted in consultation with industry legal experts, the Financial Regulator and the Parliamentary Counsel.  The proposals have also been formally vetted and cleared by the ECB, which confirmed that it had no problems with them.  While the Financial Regulator was consulted about these proposals, it was also a partner from the outset in the drafting of these provisions.  The regulator attended round table meetings with the Department and industry representatives and even held separate bilateral meetings with industry representatives when they wanted technical issues clarified.  The regulator suggested many adjustments, which the Department was glad to take on board, and some of the amendments were even proposed by the regulator on his own initiative.</P>
        <P>I trust that it will be clear to the House that it is essential that we update the provisions of the 2001 Act for legal, operational and strategic reasons and that we move expeditiously in this regard to protect the competitiveness of ACS issuers who operate under our legislative and regulatory framework.  Failure to fast-track these <Col N="1456"/>reforms could see some ACS issuance relocate out of Ireland.  On the other hand, quick action on our part will serve to safeguard this activity here, with all the benefits associated with that in terms of high-quality employment and revenue for the Exchequer.  It may encourage other issuers to locate here, with all the associated benefits that would bring in terms of more high quality jobs and tax revenues.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House.  I thank him for attending earlier than scheduled to accommodate the House and the smooth passage of business.  Fine Gael supports the legislation.  The Minister of State said he hoped he made clear to the House the need for the changes.  In a previous incarnation I worked in financial services having studied finance in college.  Everybody I am friendly with from my college years works in financial services and I pride myself on being up to date with developments in this area but asset covered securities is an area in which I do not have significant expertise.  As my colleague in the Lower House said, we must take the word of the Minister of State at face value but I have no reason to doubt his word in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the past ten years, the number of companies operating in the financial services sector in Ireland and the number of jobs created has expanded significantly.  The IFSC is thriving and numerous other organisations operate throughout the State in this industry.  I would welcome wholeheartedly any legislation that secures those jobs and investment going forward and attracts additional investment.  Fine Gael is supportive of any development of our legislation, which has a sound, prudential basis but which also allows new products to develop.  Ireland has developed a well earned reputation for being effective in regard to regulation by using a light touch that is not excessively bureaucratic.  That reputation must be maintained to attract new entrants into the sector and to retain current investment.  Fine Gael believes the success of the IFSC, in particular, is a source of immense national pride but that cannot be taken for granted into the future.  We recognise the challenges outlined in the document, Building on Success, including the integration of EU markets and the emulation of the Irish corporate fiscal environment by other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also believe the next Government has the potential to overcome these challenges by maintaining the solid foundations on which the IFSC&rsquo;s success is built and developing them for a changed world.  Fine Gael will strengthen the three pillars on which that success rests &mdash; tax certainty, responsive regulation and a developing skills base &mdash; and ensure the IFSC not only remains a powerful force in the economy but grows and develops.</P><Col N="1457"/>
        <P>Under Fine Gael and our colleagues in the Labour Party, tax certainty will be maintained and strengthened.  For several years, Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy on taxation has been crystal clear.  We believe this country does not need higher taxes.  That means no increase in income tax rates, corporation tax rates, capital gains tax rates and capital acquisitions tax rates.</P>
        <P>In the area of regulation, we must be vigilant to ensure the factors which have made the IFSC a success are maintained.  Our agenda will focus on ensuring that the clearing house groups continue to work efficiently, that IFSRA consumer and corporate governance related regulation does not become too onerous and that the EU financial services action plan is implemented domestically in a smooth manner.</P>
        <P>There is evidence that new regulation driven domestically or from the EU could impact negatively on the IFSC.  The recent report of the National Competitiveness Council indicated that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking on the impact of regulation had fallen to seventh out of 16 countries benchmarked.  It is essential that Departments devote greater resources to reviewing the impact of major regulatory change on competitiveness &mdash; effectively, business proofing new legislation &mdash; and that their assessment be independently tested.  This is especially important in regard to the IFSC because of the very mobile nature of the business conducted in the centre and the vigorous international competition for this investment now and in the future.</P>
        <P>On a national level, Fine Gael believes our system of economic regulation has become too complicated and is characterised by too many small, sector-specific regulatory bodies that have not proved effective in opening up regulated markets to new entrants in a way that benefits consumers.  A smaller number of larger, cross-sectoral regulators would have pro-consumer advantages, in particular, by lessening the dangers of regulatory capture by incumbent monopolists and by providing opportunities to share the scarce legal and economic expertise used in economic regulation and, in the process, generating administrative efficiencies and lower costs for regulated companies.</P>
        <P>In the area of skills and skills upgrading into the future, more than 570,000 individuals, or more than one quarter of the current workforce, have not obtained a leaving certificate or equivalent qualification.  The long-term solution must be to raise the second level completion rate towards 100%, as has been achieved in a number of European countries, especially in the Scandinavian countries, and to raise further the proportion of school leavers entering third level education.  However, in the interim, our social cohesion and economic competitiveness also require greater policy attention on upskilling those already in the workforce through life-long learning.</P><Col N="1458"/>
        <P>This skills challenge facing the economy must be addressed by the next Government.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party will, when elected to power, commit to increasing the number of people in employment that formally progress by at least one level under the national qualifications framework by 100,000 over a five-year timeframe.  For the IFSC, this means producing graduates with more advanced mathematical and financial skills as well as developing Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a location for cutting edge applied research in financial product development and in risk management.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Bill, Fine Gael does not question the need for these changes but I wish to make some other points.  There is an ongoing problem in regard to the level of personal indebtedness among people in this country.  Senators have raised this issue on different occasions over recent years.  Debt levels have risen at an alarming rate in the past two years but the Government is only adding to the problem by ramping up its own spending plans.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s monthly statistics for last December have revealed that in the past two years alone, Irish residents have increased their indebtedness by &euro;118.2 billion.  This represents an extra spend equivalent to 80% of gross national product.  Most has gone on a huge expansion in term loans and overdrafts.  Poor planning policy is pushing many young families into debt.  Too often they are buying into housing schemes for which public services have not been provided.  They are spending large sums of money on travel and child care.  Bad policy is putting them on a financial treadmill.</P>
        <P>This credit boom has fed into huge increases in Government revenues.  The current Government has expanded its spending at a rate 50% faster than GNP growth on the back of those revenues.  That results in significant vulnerability for this country.  Spending programmes must be built on solid long-term foundations.  A property and credit boom are an uneasy basis for the expansion we have seen in recent years.</P>
        <P>The figures underline the urgent need for the Government to curb its inflationary policies.  The inflation figures for this month are marginally down on last month&rsquo;s but the projections by most of those looking at inflation figures over the next six to 12 months are that they will return to an upward trend very soon.  We need to focus more on value for money, particularly from this extra spend in public services.  This needs to be based on an agenda of public service reform which has not happened.  We also need strategic planning of public services into the future.  I am not convinced the Government has grasped the nettle in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The financial services sector of the economy has grown rapidly.  We have gained significant market share in this area in the past ten years.  We have been very effective in developing a good niche in the financial services sector.  I would not pretend to comprehend the intricacies of this Bill, <Col N="1459"/>despite the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation, but it is a step in the right direction.  We need to do everything to promote the financial services sector because it has been a major success story for the economy and country.  At a time when employment in manufacturing, construction and other sectors is under threat, there is a real opportunity for further development of the financial services sector into the future.  That is what this Bill is based on and, as such, I wholeheartedly support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and the Bill which is quite a technical and complex one.  Like the previous speaker, I believe we must, to a large extent, trust the work done by experts.  It is very clear this Bill is based on very detailed, expert discussions between the officials and interests in the industry and that it is designed to maintain the balance between reasonably light regulation while, at the same time, preventing abuses or scandals which could affect the reputation of the centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The previous speaker was quite right in saying that the International Financial Services Centre &mdash; indeed, it is no longer confined to one area &mdash; has been an enormous success.  April 2007 will be the 20th anniversary of the International Financial Services Centre.  I was privileged to be at the discussions in December 1986 when it was mooted and Dermot Desmond, economists from the ESRI and Michael Buckley, who subsequently became chairman of AIB, met Charles J. Haughey and one or two of his colleagues.  They had three proposals at that time. The country was on the floor in that confidence was low, the number unemployed stood at 250,000 and emigration was high.  Borrowings came to more than 12% of GNP and there had been a near run on the currency in October of that year.  Three proposals were made, only one of which was adopted.  The first was for another devaluation and was not adopted.  The second was for serious cuts in social welfare payments.  One of those present claimed to be an expert in social welfare but the proposal was not adopted.  The third was the establishment of the financial services centre.  It is a great tribute to the genius of a much criticised, not to say reviled man, namely, Charles J. Haughey, that he adopted this proposal, ran with it and fast-tracked it.  The process of its establishment began within one month of his taking office and was driven initially from the Department of the Taoiseach and subsequently the Department of Finance.  At the time the most optimistic scenario was that after a period of years it might employ 5,000 or 7,000 people.  A niche market was envisaged.  There may have been a difficulty in believing Ireland would be able to compete with major financial centres but 20 years later 19,000 are employed there.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;1 billion in revenue is attributable to the financial service centre, which constitutes <Col N="1460"/>the cost of many schools and hospitals.  However, I recall the debates of the 1980s that demonstrated the contrast between what one might call theoretical and practical socialism.  In the 1980s there were great complaints to the effect that one could not get revenue from business or capital.  If memory serves, total revenue from both sources in 1986 was approximately &pound;290 million.  I checked the returns from last year and they came to more than &euro;10 billion, which represented 22.3% of Government revenue.  The comparable sum of &pound;290 million constituted approximately 3.7% of revenue.  This was not achieved by raising corporation tax or capital gains tax but by doing the precise opposite.  The rate of corporation tax was reduced to a general level of 12.5%, while capital gains tax was halved.  This was highly controversial for our Labour Party and trade union friends, some of whom are still not really happy with it and cannot believe it has created far more activity and revenue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a backhanded manner Gordon Brown&rsquo;s budget this week paid a compliment to the competition because he reduced corporation tax by 28%.  Admittedly, he also raised the tax on small businesses. Amazingly, however, when one considers the history of the British Labour Party, his highest priority these days is the protection of the City of London.  In its budget supplement the<i> Financial Times</i> stated that several companies had relocated headquarters to countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg recently, citing tax as a factor.  While one hears much doom and gloom in this House about competitiveness, the financial services centre has been competitive beyond our wildest dreams.</P>
        <P>On the subject of Gordon Brown&rsquo;s tax policy in respect of business, it is interesting to note that both on corporation tax and income tax, he gave with one hand and took back with the other.  Consequently, there was virtually no net cost to the Exchequer.  For example, although he cut the standard rate of income tax from 22% to 20%, he abolished a special low introductory rate of<?oasys _jy ?>10%.  In Ireland I suspect the Labour Party&rsquo;s promise to reduce the tax rate from 20% to 18% could be accompanied by a similar sleight of hand, whereby a concession would be given with one hand and clawed back with the other.  One of the great merits of the budgets of the past two or three years is that this has not happened.  Any tax reliefs given have not been taken back by other means.</P>
        <P>I noticed some of Senator John Paul Phelan&rsquo;s comments regarding tax and budgetary policy.  Although he accused the Government of ramping up spending, it has been highly responsible.  However, if one considers the auction politics developing on the Opposition side, I do not know how&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Perhaps the spending commitments made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, in particular, are not to be taken seriously.  However, if they do not involve a ramping up of expenditure, I am unsure what is involved.  It may be that they propose some hidden countervailing cuts.  I have stated at local level that the decentralisation programme which comes under a barrage of attack at national level is at risk.  I will ensure the people in my constituency understand this well before they come to vote.</P>

	<P>Senator Phelan mentioned inflationary tendencies in the property market.  One good consequence of the discussion on stamp duty is that it has contributed to a cooling-off in the housing market.  I refer to the discussion rather than the action.  This is thoroughly positive because housing has reached the limits of affordability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>In many parts of Ireland the stamp duty debate is utterly irrelevant.  I visited a leading estate agent in my home town of Tipperary yesterday where the average price of good three bedroom houses is approximately &euro;220,000.  Obviously, this is far below the threshold and any changes in stamp duty policy would relate in the main to the greater Dublin area, as well as to one or two other city areas.  I am uncertain whether the Fine Gael Party has thought through the possible inflationary consequences of its proposals on stamp duty, the campaign on which has been run by the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, in particular.</P>

	<P>As a representative of the auctioneers noted, the person who pays stamp duty is often the seller rather than the buyer.  I fear the <i>Sunday Independent</i> represents some very well-heeled people.  Property price inflation means that, on paper, many of us who have owned houses for 20 years have become enormously wealthy, were we to move out.  Some wish to keep such inflation going and attacking stamp duty is a way to do so.  While they pretend their concern is for the first-time buyer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Members <Col N="1462"/>should be under no illusion as to the origins of this campaign.  I have stated previously that I am not against moderate and well considered reform of stamp duty.  However, I have little sympathy for some of the agitation about the matter.</P>
        <P>I will revert to the legislation which is welcome.  Governments which held office during the past 20 years are to be congratulated for being exceptionally responsive to market challenges and opportunities which helped to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and put it on the world map of financial centres.  It is a tremendous achievement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minster of State, Deputy Parlon, and support the Bill.  I wish to comment on points made by Senator Mansergh with regard to the International Financial Services Centre.  Given the economic background of the country at the time, it was remarkable to have had the vision to go ahead with the initiative which has been extremely successful.  The Minister of State and Senator Mansergh gave us the figures for the enormous revenues from taxes and the large numbers employed in the sector.  The centre has done our international standing a lot of good, not alone from a financial point of view but also in general.</P>
        <P>I recall that when the Progressive Democrats were founded, we discussed reducing rates of capital and personal taxes and taxes on business.  The general reaction was one of universal horror and fear that services such as hospitals and social services would collapse.  When we argued it would increase revenues available to the State, people stated it would not happen but it did.  Senator Mansergh is correct to state the British Chancellor seems to have converted to a similar philosophy.</P>
        <P>The Bill pertains to an area which involves extremely large sums of money.  It is important to strike a balance between regulation and securing moneys, a point on which Senators Phelan and Mansergh touched.  There is a tendency to overregulate in these areas.  In this circumstance, given the enormous sums involved, we must have due regard to the potential for disaster.  It would be disastrous if these instruments went wrong.</P>
        <P>We must also consider the degree to which the financial industry changes.  It is creative in coming up with new and wonderful products within retail banking services and elsewhere.  We must keep an eye on these matters.  We saw in the US mortgage market the inherent dangers if one does not exercise proper control or have proper financial prudence.  Even extremely large financial institutions can be open to collapse.  One saw the influence Nick Leeson had on a particular bank.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned actively managing the assets in the pool on an ongoing basis.  Active management is a recipe for people to lose the run of themselves, unless there are adequate safeguards.  An important distinction must be made between public asset covered securities and mortgage covered securities.  There is a greater <Col N="1463"/>degree of confidence that public credit covered securities bonds are secure.  The area of mortgage covered securities is more problematic, particularly residential mortgage loans.</P>
        <P>I am aware the collateral figures amount to more than 100%.  I believe the figure is 3% on residential mortgage loans and public sector loans and increases to 10% on the commercial mortgage covered securities pool.  It is important that within the securities there is more than enough to ensure the moneys will be secured in the event of something going wrong.  We also have the matter of ring-fencing.  In the event that an enormous financial institution crashes we must have a way of isolating these instruments from the general pool which would become amenable to the creditors of the company.</P>
        <P>Certain key and important matters relevant to the Bill require a great deal of consideration and careful management.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service at a time when the Governor of the Central Bank had more fiscal powers than he does now.  The matter of confidence in the banking system always arose and seemed to be used as a cloak.  If anybody asked difficult questions, he or she was told confidence in the banking system was very important and such questions might have an effect on confidence in the system.  This is a load of rubbish.  We must ask those critical and important questions; otherwise people have the capacity to run away with themselves and we do not have the degree of public accountability we should.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation is important and must be renewed on an ongoing basis because of the creative capacity of the sector to introduce new, improved and novel instruments and perhaps circumvent the important regulations imposed to ensure assets are secured and nothing untoward can happen.  One has confidence that nothing untoward will happen one&rsquo;s money in extremely large, secure and government-backed bodies such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, of which the former Deputy, Mr. Des O&rsquo;Malley, was a director, and the International Monetary Fund.  Even there, perhaps there is the capacity for somebody who is mischievous, creative or bad enough to put funds at risk.</P>
        <P>We must strike a balance between regulation to ensure funds are secure and not over-regulating to the point where the instruments become so unwieldy that the ordinary business required to underpin the success of the International Financial Services Centre is not jeopardised.  The Bill must be welcomed and I will support it.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Asset covered securities or covered bonds play an increasingly prominent role in international capital markets.  Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the covered bonds sector on foot of the 2001 Act was a major success, as other speakers and I stated.  The international financial services area is not one in which we can rest on our laurels.  With greater integration of financial services throughout the European Union more and more member states are getting involved in this activity.  This means increasing competition between financial centres throughout the Union to serve as locations for the issuance of this type of bond.</P>
        <P>As I made clear in my opening address, the major reforms following on from implementation of the capital requirements directive in so far as they relate to the covered bonds sector will be carried into our legislation by the Bill.  We are one of the early movers in this regard.  This gives us an opportunity to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a centre for the issuance of these highly regarded bonds.  As legislators, we must move quickly in this regard.  While this type of covered bond is mainly a European banking product, the merits of this type of financing technique are now becoming more widely appreciated and large US banks are beginning to become involved in issuance.</P>
        <P>I would regard this latter development as being very positive, as it should mean that American banks in general will become more familiar with this product and will be more likely to invest in these types of bonds.  This will help grow the market overall, and if some of these US banks decide to channel some of their issuance activities through European financial centres, Ireland will be glad to welcome them.  For the present and near term, our most likely source of new bond issuance to locate or relocate here is from the EU.</P>
        <P>I will briefly deal with some of the issues raised.  With regard to US difficulties in the mortgage market, I assure Senators that the downturn in that country&rsquo;s property market should not affect Irish asset-covered securities.  The ACS legislation has asset quality requirements that ensure the quality of the cover pool.  The assets of the pool are very conservatively valued, and non-performing loans and loans that do not meet the loan-to-value requirements are replaced.  In this way the high quality of the covered asset pool can be maintained.</P><Col N="1465"/>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan raised the matter of the high level of credit in the country.  The growth in credit is a matter for the Central Bank through its participation in the ECB, where interest rates are set.  That issue would not arise here.  Senator Dardis made the important point that the Bill is largely about getting a balance between regulation and continuing to attract the very substantial business we are getting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies for not being present for the Second Stage debate.  I have not seen the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech but I agree that this is an important piece of legislation.  My understanding of the Basel II agreement, which comes into force on 1 January next, is that it should have a major impact on the levels of securities demanded by the central and reserve banks in order to credit the mortgage and lending companies.  This idea we have been suffering with over the last number of years regarding 110% or 100% loans will no longer look as attractive to bankers.</P>
        <P>I have noticed that in recent times some banks have got in under the wire, so to speak, offering fantastic deals to people who have a mortgage of less than 60% of the asset value of the homes.  This means banks will now be more attracted to lending funds to people whose assets are significantly greater than the amount of the mortgage.  The total value of mortgage underwriting to the 100% value of assets will be significantly restricted, both by this legislation and the implementation of the Basel II agreement, which will be introduced on 1 January next year.</P>
        <P>I apologise if I am not completely <i>au fait</i> with the facts but this is my understanding of the matter.  It is very important for us to get on-side with the issue as asset value will become more important.  I do not wish to be a prophet of doom or be seen to reinforce the negativity of some commentators in the media, but if we did see a negative equity position come about, it would clearly be exacerbated by the high percentage of mortgage values being offered.  With this legislation we at least have a mark to market approach in terms of what can be offered to a customer.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is very sensible legislation which will doubtlessly pass unremarked by the world at large.  It is a significant change in the position of banking in terms of the prudential arrangements to be put in place for bankers.  It is also a significant change in terms of the relationship between bankers and central or reserve banks.  Consequently there will be protection for many people looking for loans.</P>
        <P>I wish to put this on record because I know that at some stage people will argue that it is unfortunate banks will not give 95% or 100% loans to <Col N="1467"/>people.  That is part of what has been driving up the cost of houses.  Banks will work to the market and it is in the interest of young people, in medium term, for this legislation to be passed.  It puts proper brakes on the unrestricted offering of money and the increasing of credit limits without asking.  The idea behind the term &ldquo;Press here to increase your borrowing limit&rdquo; is appalling.  Wrapping up current accounts with mortgage accounts is an appalling recent development.</P>
      
        <P>I apologise for delaying the House, but I welcome the Bill and thank the officials, who worked through extraordinarily boring, but important, legislation.  We appreciate that work, even if it is not often recognised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I encountered this issue recently and I presume that, of all Ministers, a Progressive Democrats Minister of State will sympathise.  I do not want to go into detail, but I will read my Adjournment debate into the record.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to correct the anomaly which <Col N="1468"/>penalises a person who chooses to work in a low paid job rather than claim Social Welfare payments.  This penalisation arises when the person is deemed ineligible for a Back to Education Allowance should they wish to participate in Third Level Education.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am talking about a simple and human situation.  I will use two people in my example.  A man asked me whether he was naive to work while preparing to return to education and whether he would have been better off going on social welfare.  I said he would not have been, but I was appalled by the facts and figures he outlined.  The current structuring of the student support system leads to one student receiving &euro;71,600 in direct Government support during the course of a degree and another student, who may be sitting next to the first, receiving under &euro;12,000.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply will not matter because he and I know it will not deal with the issue.  The two people in question are returning to education, which we want them to do, sitting side by side and studying for the same degree at university level.  What is wrong?  The gap in direct Government support between the students, who are required to produce the same work to earn their degrees, is almost &euro;60,000.  The only difference between the students is that one was in receipt of a minimum of &euro;16,000 per year in social welfare payments while the other was in a low income job earning less than &euro;16,000 per year.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State shares my opinion.  This situation makes me angry because we are trying to stop it occurring.  In my years in the trade union movement, we were trying to make it sensible for people to move from social welfare payments or work to college.  The man, who was earning &euro;16,000 per year, decided to continue working until going to college so that he could make his contribution, but he was penalised to the extent of &euro;60,000 as a result.</P>
        <P>I do not claim to understand the details, but they are factual.  In the course of a year, the student who was in receipt of social welfare payments gets the back to education allowance of almost &euro;10,000, rent support of almost &euro;7,000 and a special rate of maintenance grant of almost &euro;3,000.  The student also gets a European social fund grant and a student support grant.  We should examine the six or seven elements of support for the student in question.  However, I am not knocking them, as one must qualify for each.  The other student doing the same course and paying the same rent does not get the back to education allowance, rent support allowance or special rate of maintenance grant.  In the course of a year, that student receives &euro;3,900 and loses out on almost &euro;20,000, which is wrong and unfair.</P>
        <P>I get involved in social welfare issues rarely, but this issue energises and angers me because the Minister of State and I have often debated it and agreed or disagreed on the importance of returning people to and raising the level of edu<Col N="1469"/>cation.  Last week, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, spoke about people studying at master and doctorate levels and bringing people who understand and worked in the private sector into the education system to determine what they can contribute, but it is not taking place.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s answer will give me little comfort and annoy me further, but I want him to consider the two students doing the same degree course and paying the same money, one is in receipt of &euro;20,000 per year less than the other because he or she was working in a low-paid job of less than &euro;16,000 per year and was not on social welfare.  If he or she had chosen to jack in the job two years earlier and gone on social welfare, he or she would be receiving an additional &euro;20,000 per year.  Where is the incentive, motivation, sense or logic and what is it we are trying to do?</P>
        <P>I have a long script on our approach, but the Government should examine the back to education allowance and include workers earning less than &euro;16,000 per year before going to college full-time.  I am also referring to the rent support grant and special rate of maintenance grant.</P>
        <P>I could talk for another hour and go through the bits and pieces of the social welfare system, which are listed for me here, but I would like to give hope to a young man who has taken it upon himself to return to college.  He represents hundreds of others in the same situation.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply will make a great deal of sense, but can we make some changes?  It is a busy time for him and the man in question is not his constituent, although he could be given that he is a Maynooth student, but will the Minister of State write someone a letter to get an answer as to why this is happening?  I look forward to his answer, but I would like to hear from someone who will take the matter in hand and try to correct this unacceptable anomaly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry that Senator O&rsquo;Toole is so dismissive of the very good statement that has been prepared.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to be surprised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs administers a range of back to education programmes under the umbrella of its social and family support services.  The programmes encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to return to work through the acquisition and improvement of skills and academic qualifications which will enable them to compete more successfully for employment.  The programmes, which range from <Col N="1470"/>basic literacy courses to certain postgraduate courses of study, include the back to education allowance scheme, the fundamental aim of which is to assist people who are unable to access the labour market because of their lack of qualifications or education.  I refer to people who are caught in a cycle of unemployment and disadvantage.  The scheme has given many people who left school at a young age a second chance for education.  It has improved their prospects of getting employment in our buoyant labour market.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is a social welfare replacement income.  It is paid in place of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  Essentially, an individual who is in receipt of the back to education allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate that is equivalent to the maximum payment under that scheme.  To qualify for the back to education allowance an applicant must be, <i>inter alia</i>, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or 12 months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.  The 12-month requirement is reduced to a nine-month requirement in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course who are participating in the national employment action plan process.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance scheme was established to help people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose employment opportunities would be enhanced by their participation in the scheme.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  It is considered necessary to ensure that the limited resources are directed at those who are most in need.  People who are already in employment are not considered to be in the target group for the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>People in employment who pay tuition fees in respect of third level education to an approved college in respect of an approved course may be eligible for tax relief.  Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid by individuals for certain training courses in foreign languages and information technology.  Those who want to obtain information about the relief available should contact their regional tax offices.  People in low-paid employment who have families may be eligible for the family income supplement scheme from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Family income supplement is a weekly payment for members of families, including one-parent families, who are working on low pay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is satisfied that the current arrangements relating to the back to education allowance scheme ensure that it continues to support those who are most distant from the labour market.  There are no plans to abolish or modify the existing qualifying criteria for participation in the scheme to include <Col N="1471"/>people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Minister of State has to go through his script.  Does he agree that the effect of the current regulations is that people with low-paid jobs who want to go back to college will be looked after better if they go the dole for a year beforehand?  What are we doing?  People laugh at politicians when they find out we are creating problems of this nature.  The Minister of State said that people who go back to education may be eligible for tax relief, but the person to whom I referred is outside the tax net, or barely inside it.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion does not apply to this person in question because he has a low-paid job.  I ask the Minister of State to send a letter to somebody about this matter, which needs to be addressed.  He should tell the relevant authorities to be sensible about these regulations.  I accept that they were originally intended to encourage people on social welfare <Col N="1472"/>to go back to college.  There is nothing wrong with that aim because it makes sense.  However, this assistance should also apply to people who are in lower-paid employment.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the point the Deputy has made.  Tax relief is not of any benefit to somebody who is earning less than &euro;16,000 per annum.</P>
