	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Rourke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the issue of domiciliary care allowance, details supplied, in County Westmeath.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to indicate the steps she is taking to assess the economic advantages to Irish agriculture if GM crops which may cross-pollinate with conventional and organic crops are excluded.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Minihan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the position regarding the purchase of a site for a new primary school in Ballygarvan, County Cork, in view of the fact that protracted negotiations by the OPW on a three-owner site appear to be stalled, and if she will outline the proposals she has to purchase a suitable site for this urgent project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reasons that the automatic entitlement of 2.5 resource hours per academic week for children diagnosed with Down&rsquo;s syndrome on entry to national school was withdrawn, on whose recommendation this was done, and if she recognises that children denied this previously automatic right regress in their formative years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P><Col N="1814"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to initiate moves to provide a train service from Dublin to Donegal.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Citizens Information Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 2, Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 5 p.m.; No. 3, Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken if No. 2 has concluded before 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 4, Statute Law Revision Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of Private Members&rsquo; business, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 24, motion 37, to be taken between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  There will be a sos from 2 p.m to 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>More than four years ago, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution unanimously recommended to the Government that before a constitutional referendum takes place, there should be at least 60 days of discussion on the matter.  It recommended the optimum period of 120 days.  In light of the Government&rsquo;s stated intention of holding a referendum of children&rsquo;s rights and child protection, will the Acting Leader agree that a more sensible approach by the Government would be to publish a White Paper on its views on these matters?  The only consultations the Government has so far undertaken have been between the two largest Opposition parties in the Lower House and interested parties in the community and voluntary sector.  Throughout the 1980s mistakes were made with rushed and politically motivated constitutional referenda.  It is not good practice to hold a referendum so close to a general election.</P><Col N="1815"/>
        <P>Will the Acting Leader agree a White Paper should be published?  Two principal issues are at stake.  First, there are those issues that arose from the CC case, which are urgent and require the Oireachtas to make legislative changes to give an absolute zone of protection to children.  The other issue concerns amendments to Article 42 of the Constitution, relating to children&rsquo;s rights, and in respect of which it is more difficult to arrive at a consensus position.  This would be more sensibly left for a longer period of reflection, consultation and discussion among society in general so that we can reach a consensus that is agreed by all and which can be confidently implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more with the points made by Senator Brian Hayes.  I received two telephone calls in the past 24 hours from constituents wishing to know exactly what is involved in the proposed referendum.  There is a general view that a referendum on the rights of children must be a positive development, and most people tend towards being supportive of it.  However, Members who ask their constituents whether they know what the referendum is about will find that most do not.</P>
        <P>I agree that rushing into such a referendum will not achieve anything like the type of consensus that is desirable.  As an Independent Member, I am also concerned that the debate on this issue is breaking down along party political lines.  This should not be a political issue.  I am not saying that either the Government or the main Opposition parties are trying to make it such, but that is what is happening.</P>
        <P>We have almost become out of practice when it comes to White Papers.  It is, however, an important part of the parliamentary process that there should be discussion of White Papers and Green Papers on various issues.  I suggest to the Acting Leader that we have a debate on this particular issue as soon as possible to ascertain Members&rsquo; views.  It is only then that we will discover the wide variety of views on this issue, as well as the level misunderstanding around it.  It is a highly complex issue.  The constitutional group, comprising experts on such issues, took a long time to issue its response.  It is unfair to expect others to understand all the implications in such a short timeframe.  It is inappropriate to rush into this before an election and there is no reason that it cannot be postponed.  We must allow a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>A recent survey shows that one in six parents take their children out of school during the school term to take advantage of low air fares and holiday breaks at home and abroad.  The Government should consider making travel companies and tourist outlets aware that by increasing prices at times when schools are on holidays, they are presenting parents with an inducement they cannot afford to ignore.  I am not saying that we should interfere with how the market works. <Col N="1816"/> However, this practice is causing great disruption in schools.  I understand parents&rsquo; actions; the difference in fare prices before and after a mid-term break, for instance, is huge.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should enter talks with the appropriate tourism providers to ascertain whether there is a way of dealing with this, not to prevent businesses from making profits but at least to have some type of graded approach.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  I am always dissatisfied when it is decided that if a particular debate finishes before a certain time, we will move immediately onto the next matter.  I understand the pressure of business but I would prefer sufficient time for each debate.  I understand the difficulty today and I do not object to the proposed arrangement.  I ask the Acting Leader, however, whether we can at least agree that there be a half an hour break between Nos. 2 and 3 so that if Members are at a meeting, for example, they can organise to return to the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That will only arise in the event that the debate on No. 2 ends early.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  If the debate on No. 2 finishes early, we should not go straight to No. 3.  Otherwise, Members may not realise the next debate has begun.  Members must be able to organise their day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Cathaoirleach will indulge me by allowing me to thank the Fianna F&aacute;il press office for the enormous publicity it generated for me by objecting to a photograph of myself and Fidel Castro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the press office&rsquo;s professionalism and efficiency, and would like to record my awe of its skill at getting publicity for Opposition Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan should speak on matters relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not grant Senator Ryan any indulgence; he took it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a debate in the immediate future on the grievances being articulated by nurses, the apparent conflict, once more, between the Taoiseach and Minister for Health and Children regarding the approach to this issue, the apparent dissent within one of the Government parties to the Minister&rsquo;s approach, and, far more seriously, the quality of the working conditions and rewards we offer to nurses?  Most people who have experience of any aspect of our <Col N="1817"/>hospital service recognise that nurses work extremely hard under extraordinary pressure for rewards which are small relative to those enjoyed by persons who claim to be the great and the good in this country.  A debate in this House in which the views being expressed behind closed doors could be articulated in public might help us to advance the cause.  I ask the Acting Leader for some indication that such a debate might take place.</P>
        <P>Yet again, I raise the issue of the apparent descent into something close to civil war in the Palestinian territories in Gaza.  The use of language in discussions of this issue is extraordinary.  It has been omitted or lost by many commentators that there is an elected Government in the Palestinian territories to which nobody will talk.  This is a recipe for instability.  The Western world, and the world in general, has taken a single view on this.  That view is part of the problem.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business, the Acting Leader announced that No. 2 will conclude at 5 p.m.  Does this mean that if Committee Stage is not completed by then, he will terminate the debate?</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleagues, Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Toole, that the issue of children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution is far too profound and complex to be rushed.  We in this House regularly encounter mistakes in legislation.  This was the case as recently as last week.  The prospect that an erroneous, badly phrased or ambiguously worded amendment relating to children&rsquo;s rights might be included in the Constitution is something that should concern us all.  I appeal to the Government to consider a means of allowing these issues &mdash; about which there is an overwhelming consensus in many cases, at least in terms of the objectives &mdash; to be debated in a way that does not generate either disagreement within the Houses or disagreement through misunderstanding or malicious representation outside the Houses.  The best way to calm such matters is to leave sufficient time for debate and not give the impression that the process is being rushed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We all expressed concern earlier this week about how we might mitigate the impact of global warming.  We must also pay some attention to mitigating the impact of such global warming as will happen in any case.  Last summer&rsquo;s so-called drought led to significant and still ongoing water supply problems in high-lying areas.  We would be outraged if there were power cuts every day, often lasting several hours, in various areas throughout the State.  That is what is happening in regard to water supply, which is a basic need of life.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the various local authorities are working hard on the problem.  I refer not only to group water schemes but also public water supply.  We must raise this issue up the national political agenda.  People ought to have the same right to uninterrupted water supply as they have to <Col N="1818"/>uninterrupted electricity or gas provision, telephone lines and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>On a previous occasion, I raised the possibility that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources might come to the House to address us on the issue of An Post.  There is now a sense of urgency in respect of this issue because we all understand we will see the wholesale closure of post offices once the general election campaign is over.  I understand An Post is holding off until after the general election in case the Government might be embarrassed by the closure of post offices.  Many non-automated post offices will be closed while others will be automated.  Many of these smaller post offices also have grocery businesses and their only hope of survival requires the continuation of both businesses.  If the post office component of these businesses closes, the grocery shop will close too.  Then we will again bleat about the demise of rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to come to the House and be honest with us in respect of what is happening in An Post.  Over the next few weeks those involved in the post office business will highlight the serious situation in which they find themselves.  Rather than wash his hands of what is happening, I would like the Minister to come to the House and tell us honestly what is happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange an urgent debate on mandatory retirement?  On Monday, the Taoiseach launched the European year of equal opportunities for all.  How can we have equal opportunities when people must retire at 65 years of age?  A recent MRBI-<i>The Irish Times</i> poll stated that 43% of people in their 50s said they would like to work beyond the age of 65.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Especially Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when there is a shortage of skills, we are letting skilled people leave the workforce.  I have received numerous telephone calls and letters from people whose hearts are broken and who are fit, healthy and are able to do their jobs but who are being told to retire at 65 years of age.  Many of them work in this building.</P>
        <P>This year Senator Maurice Hayes will be 80 years of age.  Think of what the Seanad would be like without his wisdom.  The Cathaoirleach will be 73 years of age in May and his discerning diplomacy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very well aware of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator reveal her own age?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach.  The point is that politicians do not have to retire, so why should people in the public and private sectors have to do so?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1819"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was very eloquently put.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the House is in such good humour, should we not recognise what a beautiful day it is and what a relief it is in a period of global warming to see a bit of ice, frost and snow?  I agree with Senator Mansergh that we should be very concerned about climate change and that is why I have a number of items on the Order Paper in that regard.  I hope that at some appropriate time this issue will discussed in some detail.  It is worrying when one sees the way political leaders tack into the wind.  It is not very dignifying to see Ms Merkel, for example, championing the automobile industry of her country while holding the Presidency of the EU.  We would give a lead if the Oireachtas required all its joint committees to have an environmental audit because so much of the work we do has, in one way or another, an environmental impact.</P>
        <P>I laugh when I hear people talk about the water supply and so on.  This is a damp little island and we are subjected to perpetual deluges of rain.  It is a simple problem of bad management and the sooner the county councils and other authorities wake up to this and do their jobs, as they are supposed to, the better.</P>
        <P>I disagree with my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Everybody does not agree there should be an amendment protecting the rights of children in the Constitution.  I do not; I never have.  It is not because I am inimical to the rights of children but because this is another fudge.  What we want is an article guaranteeing the rights of the individual.  Let us have that instead of this gimmicky politics coming up to a general election trying to sentimentalise the issue and get votes.  Let us address the real issues of equality and copperfasten, as they did in the 1916 Proclamation, the rights of the individual.</P>
        <P>Can we have a debate on the health service which does not only involve scoring party political points, because we really need to look at the issue?  Yesterday, the issue of MRSA was raised.  Today, we hear there is no hot water in unit 3 of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  How can we expect people to wash, or be washed, if there is no hot water?  There is no signing facility for patients who are deaf.  They cannot explain their symptoms.  Worst of all, the situation of Mr. Neary is yet again to the fore.  We have been very badly let down by the medical profession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point has been eloquently made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to finish this point.  The report spoke of collegiality and compassion.  Those qualities were not shown to the patients but to the doctor who has been found unfit to practice.  Three of the most eminent doctors in this country would have sent that man back with a clean bill of health and a note stating the <Col N="1820"/>patients were lucky to have him.  That is an insulting approach, shows a total lack of moral courage and is the old boy network in practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many Senators offering and I would like a bit of brevity, if possible, so I can accommodate them all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now 12 months since Transport 21 was approved by this Government.  It is also more than 12 months &mdash; December 2005, I believe &mdash; since the Minister for Transport was last in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not bring him back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like a number of issues addressed.  Before Christmas, we were promised legislation on the setting up of the transport authority for the greater Dublin area.  A head of the authority, which was announced nine months ago, has not even been appointed.  Only yesterday, I received a letter from Dublin Bus stating that it had now secured a timetable for the train service to Donabate and that it would endeavour to serve commuters there.  One would hardly believe Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann were part of the same organisation since 1932.  They can behave like that because they have a monopoly.</P>
        <P>What is happening with the State Airports Bill?  We do not know what is happening in Shannon Airport nor do we know who will pay for Cork Airport.</P>
        <P>Under Transport 21, ports were transferred to the Department of Transport.  We have not received a statement on why that happened and on the policy direction.  There is a very clear commitment in the national development plan that a study will be done on the location of Dublin Port, yet it has stated it wants to increase its size.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have allowed the Senator good latitude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a conflict there and it is time the Minister came to the House to outline his plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1984, following the collapse of PMPA, the Government introduced a 2% levy on all insurance policies.  I understand PMPA&rsquo;s debts were paid off in 1993, yet since then, we have continued to pay a 2% levy on all our insurance policies.  Where does this money go?  Has it been ring-fenced for some purpose?  When will this 2% levy, which is another stealth tax, be abolished?  I understand that in 2005, in excess of &euro;76 million was collected from this 2% levy from all who pay insurance policies.  Questions must be answered in this regard.  Members need to know where this money has gone, whether it has been ring-fenced for any purpose and when will the levy be abolished.</P>
      
      </Speaker><Col N="1821"/>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls to the Acting Leader for a debate on the State Airports Bill.  It should be discussed at the earliest possible opportunity because its provisions, which set out a requirement to agree business plans, have not yet been reached and unfortunately, Shannon Airport and the other airports are suffering as a result.  Regrettably, the management of the Dublin Airport Authority is still actively involved in the day-to-day running of Shannon, as it has completely lost the workers&rsquo; goodwill through its change management process.  A recent ballot on the proposals was rejected out of hand.  However, the Dublin Airport Authority management has made no approach to work through a plan that will benefit the region and the entire west.  Some outdated thinking underlying the Bill&rsquo;s provisions may need to be addressed and I would welcome a debate in this regard.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also wish to refer to some of the health provisions that have been discussed and in particular to the lack of occupational and speech and language therapists in the mid-west region, which has lagged behind every other district in Ireland and possibly every other district in the Western world.  At present, an outrageous situation exists in respect of elderly people who require the services of an occupational therapist in order to be provided with aids to living at home.  I refer to basic facilities such as extended toilet seats to allow those with mobility difficulties to be able to use sanitary facilities.  It is appalling that elderly people are so treated and it reflects poorly on the HSE that it is unable to apportion its services in a manner that does not detract from the mid-west.  This issue must be addressed.</P>

	<P>I believe Edmund Burke stated that for evil to thrive, all it needs is for good men to remain silent.  I mention this because of the courage and bravery of a young woman from the Congo that was reported in the newspapers yesterday.  She gave evidence of an outrageous assault that she had endured for a number of years, having been brought into Ireland by the perpetrator.  I raise this matter because the young woman in question was only 15 years old and it would have been very easy for her to stay silent.  I gather that a large number of young people do so under similar circumstances.</P><Col N="1822"/>
        <P>I understand that a referendum will be held and I completely agree with the point made in the House today by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  This House is the forum in which the matter should be discussed in the coming months, rather than springing a referendum on citizens without anyone having the time to understand the details.</P>

	<P>I fully understand that and fully agree with the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling.  Consequently, I will try to be as brief as possible.</P>
        <P>I ask the Acting Leader to consider having a debate on dormant accounts.  The reason is that I am beginning to have some concerns about questions of accountability, mainly because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael has always called it a slush fund.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="1823"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is mainly for two reasons.  First, as all those who receive details on dormant accounts whenever new measures are introduced are aware, enormous sums of money are involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is solely at the discretion of the Minister  for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, a measure is being introduced at present which appears to overlap across a variety of different Departments on a national and local basis.  I refer to a scheme for sports equipment for socially and economically disadvantaged areas to which one can apply.  A total of &euro;2 million has been set aside nationally.  While I consider that to be a paltry sum of money, someone somewhere made that decision.  In real terms, the amount involved for County Leitrim is &euro;12,000 each in respect of the youth and sports sides of the scheme.  Initially, the Department of Education and Science was responsible for implementing the scheme and forms were issued.  However, County Leitrim VEC subsequently discovered that the Department was passing it on to the local partnership bodies where such bodies exist.  In the case of County Leitrim, none exists as yet and it was obliged to prepare a new form.  Finally, the closing dates differed and the applicants were then informed that henceforth, Pobal would be responsible for the transmission and investigation of these claims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Senator could bring it up as an Adjournment matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  However, I thought this would be a useful exercise because of the enormous sums of money involved and the fact there are some obvious sceptics on the other side of the House, who wrongly believe the money is probably being misappropriated.  I do not suggest this for one moment and do not believe this to be the case.  I simply suggest that it might be instructive and educational for the relevant Minister, who in this case is the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come before the House to provide it with a review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has an opportunity for doing this by raising the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggested he should come before the House to provide a review of the scheme in order that there could be a debate as to how the dormant accounts system is working.  I add and emphasise that I do not suggest there is anything amiss.  However, there are questions about accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost 12 months ago I raised my concerns about the decision by the Minister <Col N="1824"/>for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to merge the partnership and Leader programmes around the country.  I mention this because in my own locality, the Arigna Leader programme has been highly influential in ensuring that development was secured for the area.</P>
        <P>It is said that this is Ireland of the welcomes and each day one hears of Ministers welcoming grants of &euro;10,000 and &euro;5,000, etc.  However, in this instance I asked for proper consultations for transparency and accountability.  It is clear that the news is not good regarding the Arigna Leader programme, which serves County Leitrim as well as north-west Roscommon very well.  I ask that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should come before the House and explain the reason that staff from his Department asked members of the Arigna Leader programme for a two-week confidentiality clause.  This is extremely serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware it is serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>How dare the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This could be a matter for the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Minister to come before the House in order that I may ask him how, effectively, he could gag members of the Arigna Leader programme with a confidentiality clause.  It is clear that the Government only makes announcements when the news is good.  When the news is bad, it gags the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a few points in support of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments regarding the removal of children by their parents from school off-season to avail of low fares and special offers from airlines.  While a standardised mid-term break was introduced to prevent such actions, it is creeping in again.  Many parents and teachers have expressed concern regarding the flow of young people from schools at crucial times to facilitate the airlines in respect of low fares.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should enter into discussions on this subject because it is having a highly negative impact on education, particularly at a time when children are preparing for mock examinations, etc.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris in his call for a debate on health as quickly as possible.  We are fully aware of the problems in the health service.  We hear about them every day in the media.  However, the health service reached a new low as the HSE initiated measures to restrict the availability of drugs to Irish patients due to their costs.  This is new and dangerous.  The Minister and the HSE based this new tactic on a British model treated with derision throughout Europe, yet here we are following it.</P>
        <P>An eminent cancer specialist in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin stated one of his patients was refused an approved treatment because of the cost of the drugs.  We were accustomed to obtaining the best possible drugs under the GMS scheme.  This new model adopted mimics the British system already proven a failure.  If a drug suitable for treatment for a cancer patient is denied due to its cost, it is time for the Minister to consider her position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not often I agree with Senator Ryan.  However, on this occasion I agree with his call for a debate in the House on the issues facing nurses.  Two weeks ago, I met representatives of the INO and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  Last Friday, at their invitation I met approximately 100 nurses in groups and individually at Sligo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>We face a serious problem as nurses feel ignored, demoralised and neglected.  Two issues are raised, pay and the number of hours worked.  The problem with hours should have been dealt with through benchmarking but has not.  It is important to debate this matter.  One nurse I met has small children and works a four-day week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not need to go into full detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important and I wish to make the point.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his time.  The lady works a four-day week and should work 34 hours.  However, she works 40 hours.  Nurses do not get paid overtime.  No nurse I spoke to finishes work on time.  They are supposed to get hours back in lieu.  However, this might happen six months later.  We must deal with the issue and the sooner the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The closure of post offices raised by my colleague, Senator Finucane, is a national disaster.  What is being planned now that will not be revealed until further down the line?  As Senator Finucane stated, the Minister must come <Col N="1826"/>before the House and be up front and level with us.  In Killarney, the greater part of the town on the eastern side where the bulk of the population lives lost its post office.  It closed a week ago with no plans for a replacement.  Are pensioners and social welfare recipients expected to go online with bank accounts?  It is farcical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible.  This matter needs our urgent attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues who referred to the Dr. Neary case.  It was an opportunity lost, which is extremely regrettable.  The fitness to practice committee of any profession exists to ensure the integrity and standing of that profession is protected.  I hasten to add I worked with many fine consultants.  This was terrible and poured mud on what was already an extremely hurtful and traumatic situation for many young women who were denied their right as women to bring children into the world.  I will not labour the point as everybody knows what I am talking about.</P>
        <P>I support what Senator Scanlon stated on nurses.  A number of groups were catered for outside the benchmarking process.  The nursing profession is the only group which does not work a 35 hour week.  It is not my business here to indulge in industrial relations.  However, fair play comes into focus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Glynn stated.  I congratulate the Medical Council on its finding of professional misconduct against the three consultant obstetricians.  I was astonished at the one-line statement in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers.  The so-called &ldquo;three wise men&rdquo; state they are bitterly disappointed with the finding and find it fundamentally wrong.  They have no regard or thought for the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss what they stated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>As somebody who sat on the Neary inquiry, I have first-hand knowledge which I put on the record of the House.  This statement rubs salt into festering wounds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>To me, it states they find nothing wrong with their finding the man not guilty of wrongdoing when all the rest of us found him guilty.  I query their judgment and the type of minds they have.  I will go so far as to state I hope when the Medical Practitioners Bill comes before the House each of us, regardless of what side of the fence we are on, will be mindful of this.  I also hope we will be at one with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on dealing with the consultant contract and support her. <Col N="1827"/> Once and for all it must be about public safety and the care of patients and not about collegiality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent times, a story from St. Louis attracted world headlines.  A young man was abducted several years ago and presumed dead.  Through vigilance and good police work he was found alive and returned to his family.  We are all aware that many Irish families had a keen interest in this story.  They are in a living hell as they also have loved ones who are missing.  One can only imagine the nightmare of not knowing whether they are alive, dead or suffering.  We all hear their isolated calls for help and see their messages at railway stations and bus stops.</P>
        <P>At present, we are not pro-active in helping them.  It is wrong to presume those missing persons are dead.  We need a dedicated Garda unit with proper resources to pursue these cases.  I am convinced many missing persons may be alive and a possibility exists that we could have another good news story like that in St. Louis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes together with Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan, Norris and Quinn raised the proposed amendment to the Constitution to embody children&rsquo;s rights.  I was a member of the all-party committee which considered the matter at great length.  Everybody regarded what we came up with as something to which every party could subscribe.   It is worth stating extensive consultation took place.  Many groups came before the committee and put their points of view to which we listened.  I am not sure whether a White Paper would add much to those consultations.  Perhaps the greater consultation which now takes place explains why there has been a reduction in White Papers on this and other issues in recent years.  I agree with Senator Norris that there is not unanimity on the matter but there is a wide consensus.  I do not agree with his remarks on the rights of the individual.  The importance of children being specifically referred to in the Constitution was clear to the committee&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as was their being given specific protection.  I take Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point that it required enormous courage on the part of the Senegalese girl to come forward.  One hopes there are protections for girls in such circumstances.  She was vindicated by the law but one can imagine other cases where a constitutional provision would be important.  I agree with the proposition that the matter be debated in the House and we will try to arrange it.  It is hoped to bring a proposed wording to Cabinet in the near future to dispose of the matter by referendum as quickly as possible, though I cannot anticipate how that will develop.</P><Col N="1828"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to low air fares, also mentioned by Senator Ormonde.  It is unfortunate that attractive deals are offered during term time, meaning parents who wish to avail of them must take their children out of school rather than wait until school holidays.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said that was the way the market worked.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and tell him the House wishes him to speak with the relevant travel agencies.  I saw one offer last week of an apartment for &euro;43 per night, offered by a well-known insurance company in Spain, which included breakfast and seemed extraordinarily attractive.  Those of us of a certain age can remember when the standard excuse for not being in school was that a child was working in the garden.  I am sure there are now other, more up to date excuses.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked about the possibility of a break of a half an hour but it is very unlikely that Committee Stage of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006 will conclude before 5 p.m.  If it were to conclude before 4.30 p.m. we would certainly take a break of a half an hour.  If that requires an amendment to the Order of Business I will propose it.</P>
        <P>I will convey Senator Ryan&rsquo;s good wishes to the Fianna F&aacute;il press office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure it will be delighted to hear them.  Senators Ryan, Scanlon and Glynn raised the grievances of nurses.  There is no conflict between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children and the Government is at one on the issue.  The Government is bound by social partnership and agreements made under it so there is no room for discretion in the matter.  I am not aware of things having been done outside benchmarking and the Labour Court recommended it be resolved within benchmarking.  I see no reason, however, we cannot debate the matter and I am sure the Minister will agree to come into the House to do so.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan referred to the situation in Palestine, where there is effectively a civil war.  We hope Hamas and Fatah will agree a <i>modus operandi</i> going forward but that may be hoping for too much.  However, we will keep the situation to the forefront of this House.  The Senator also raised No. 2.  It is unlikely it will terminate because to do so would require a motion to be tabled to that effect by 1 p.m. but I will clarify the matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Mansergh and Norris spoke about the effect of global warming on the water supply.  Senator Mansergh made a good point about water supply, an essential service.  A number of places, not on very high ground, have experienced serious service disruptions.  We are taking so much out of the River Liffey at present that the sustainability of the river is in doubt.  We must find the additional water services for the extra <Col N="1829"/>90,000 houses we build each year.  My own view, not supported widely, is that water should be taken from the Shannon.  I suggested that 20 years ago and the county engineer in Kildare told me it could not be done.  A report then came out stating it could be done.  We have a wayleave all along the canal and could bring a pipe to Dublin without having to acquire land.  I do not, therefore, see why it cannot be done.  We are not short of water but have plenty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Finucane and Coghlan raised the potential closure of post offices and I have some sympathy with their point of view.  Senator Finucane asked for a debate on the matter and we will consider it.  Grocery shops are closing down, as well as other shops, in many cases because of modern living but I have a great deal of sympathy with the point made regarding access for pensioners.    </P>
        <P>Senator White asked for a debate on mandatory retirement and I agree fully with her.  We will need more people in the labour force and many people are very active after the age of 65 and should be utilised if they wish to work.  Retirement should be voluntary but they should be allowed to work if they wish.  There is a degree of ageism in society but a person who survives until the age of 60 has a good chance of surviving until the age of 90.  Many active people would be delighted to work and the Senator makes a good point.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, Glynn, Feeney, Dooley and Ulick Burke referred to the health service.  I heard on the radio about the failure of the showers at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, which is appalling and underlines a feature of the public service, that it exists to serve itself rather than its clients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not fair to the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the way it is administered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the fault of management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems that to replace a washer on a shower one must put an advertisement in the paper through the European procurement system.  It would have been done overnight 20 years ago and we will have to look at that issue fairly seriously.  We will try to arrange a debate on medical services.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medical Council has made its adjudication in the Dr. Neary case and has registered a finding of misconduct, with no further sanctions to follow.  It underlines the questionable practice of people&rsquo;s peers adjudicating on their competence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is undesirable and should not happen.  Hopefully the legislation going through at present will deal with such issues.  I bow to Senator Feeney&rsquo;s knowledge on these matters because she has a great deal of expertise in the area and I agree with her comments on consultants.</P>
        <P>Senator Dooley raised the paucity of occupational therapists but I do not know the answer.  Senator Ulick Burke questioned the availability of drugs.  My hospital once prescribed a specific drug for me but my general practitioner prescribed a generic, which is much cheaper.  That is not to say anybody should be denied a drug that can be sourced more cheaply elsewhere but it merits a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Morrissey asked about Transport 21 and the State Airports Bill, as did Senator Dooley.  We will try to find out when the Bill is due before this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins asked about the 2% levy on insurance policies.  I cannot answer the specific question but will try to ascertain the facts.  On the face of it, the levy seems inappropriate.  In passing, I compliment Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the achievement of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which an independent study found has saved &euro;24 million in legal fees in the past year, which is expected to rise to &euro;48 million this year.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney asked about dormant accounts but I am not aware of the specific details of the situation in Leitrim.  We will see if we can arrange a debate on the accounts generally.</P>
        <P>Senator Feighan queried the merging of the partnership and Leader programmes, the latter of which has been one of the great successes in rural Ireland.  I am aware of the particularly good job Arigna has done in that part of the country.  We will try to get specific answers.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked about missing persons and referred to the experience in St. Louis.  I know of two Irish people who have not been found.  The suggestion of a special unit to deal with the matter is a good one.</P>

    <Title>Citizens Information Bill 2006: Second Stage.  </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Citizens Information Bill 2006 is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s national disability strategy and is designed to ensure that people with disabilities are supported to enable them, as far as possible, to lead full and independent lives, to reach their full potential as individuals and to participate fully in society.  The Bill provides for a number of important changes to the Comhairle Act 2000 to strengthen the functions of the statutory body in the provision of high quality information, advice, awareness and advocacy as part of the delivery of a new seamless and customer friendly national information service under one easily accessible and visible brand of citizens information.</P>
        <P>With the Disability Act 2005, the accompanying sectoral plans and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, this Bill demonstrates clearly the Government&rsquo;s intention to have an effective combination of legislation, policies, institutions and services in place to ensure equal access to services and full participation in everyday life for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the Comhairle Act 2000 to enhance the functions of the statutory body in supporting the development of advocacy services, particularly for people with disabilities.  Most importantly, the Bill provides for the introduction of a personal advocacy service for certain people with disabilities who would otherwise have difficulty in getting access to the services available to assist them.  The substance of the Bill provides for matters such as the qualifying conditions for eligibility for the assignment of a personal advocate, how the service is to be organised, the responsibility of the personal advocates, the application process, an independent appeals system and related matters to ensure that the new service is placed on a sound footing.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, the name of Comhairle, which was established in 2000 with responsibility for the direct provision of independent information and advice services on social services to the public, will be changed to the Citizens Information Board or An Bord um Fhaisn&eacute;is do Shaor&aacute;naigh.  Other provisions include a definition of social services in section 2 of the Comhairle Act 2000 to include a broad range of <Col N="1833"/>social and civil services provided to the public and the expansion of the definition of a voluntary body to include citizen information centres, a number of amendments to section 7 of the Comhairle Act to strengthen the board&rsquo;s role in supporting and developing the provision of information on social services and the work of the citizen information centres and other voluntary bodies throughout the country and amendments to section 9 of the Comhairle Act to change the size and the term of office of the board in order to provide for improved operational efficiency and to allow for greater continuity in the leadership of the organisation to the benefit of local services relying on its support.</P>
        <P>The information elements of the Bill are designed to deliver and meet the needs of a dramatically changing and evolving 21st century Irish society in which the delivery of independent, quality, accurate and integrated information is a priority, including meeting the challenge of immigration from new EU member states and elsewhere.  The Citizens Information Bill, combined with the implementation plan set out in Comhairle&rsquo;s 2006-09 strategic plan, represents a major overhaul and modernisation of the provision of information on social services and will deliver an integrated and seamless supply of high quality and independent information to the entire population and, in particular, those in society who are most vulnerable and in need of support.</P>
        <P>The provision of independent, clear and accessible information has a central role in helping to break down barriers, easing anxieties, opening up opportunities and clearing the way for citizens, particularly those who are most vulnerable in society, to improve their situations and build better lives.</P>
        <P>Before I outline the provisions of the Bill, I wish to acknowledge the significant increase in funding for disability support services provided by the Government in recent years.  Under the national disability plan, some &euro;19.2 million will be invested in providing quality services and opportunities for people with disabilities.  In 2005, almost &euro;3 billion was spent on addressing disability issues.  This figure does not include the &euro;2 billion plus spent by my Department in 2006 on income supports and entitlements for people with disabilities or illnesses and their carers.  The significant real increases to social welfare rates in recent years underlines my Department&rsquo;s position at the forefront in providing for the income support and other needs of people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>There is an important link between the provision of information and advocacy in that access to information and a range of options flowing from that information are two key aspects of empowerment and citizenship.  That is particularly relevant to the functions of the newly named citizens information board in the provision of enhanced services for people with disabilities.</P><Col N="1834"/>
        <P>The Citizens Information Bill 2006 envisages advocacy services as supporting people with disabilities in identifying and understanding their needs and options and in securing their entitlements to social services.  In its broad sense, advocacy is a traditional concept linked to the notion of the citizen taking responsibility not only for him or herself but also for his or her neighbour.  It is not to be confused with the giving of information or the offering of advice <i>per se</i>, although both functions are aspects of the advocate&rsquo;s role.  Advocacy is something that many people daily do for others.  Parents advocate for their children and relatives and friends speak on behalf of vulnerable persons when necessary.  Public representatives do it all the time and, indeed, those present in this House today can speak from personal experience in that regard.  To put it simply, it is the act of supporting or speaking up for someone.  To put it more formally, it is a dynamic process of negotiation conducted by or on behalf of an individual who is marginalised in some way.</P>
        <P>The proposed service, as set out in the Bill, will provide for the assignment of a personal advocate to assist, support and represent a person with a disability in applying for and obtaining social services and in pursuing any right of review or appeal in connection with those services.  It is envisaged that the arrangements for the new personal advocacy service will be completed without delay when the legislation is in place.</P>
        <P>The board of Comhairle has undertaken a significant amount of work in preparation for the introduction of the new personal advocacy service.  Two important studies have informed this work and provide the basis for the legislative provisions in the Citizens Information Bill.</P>
        <P>In October 2005, Comhairle published guidelines to inform and guide the development of advocacy services by community and voluntary organisations.  In tandem with the guidelines, I launched a programme of funding amounting to &euro;2 million for advocacy projects in that sector.  At the end of 2006, 31 projects were in place.  Each project employs an advocate to work with people with disabilities in accessing a range of different services to help them achieve their personal objectives.  Other work undertaken in preparation for the introduction of the advocacy service on a statutory basis includes the production of a resource pack for the new advocacy projects, training and networking days and support for a higher certificate course in advocacy studies accredited through Sligo Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>I will now outline for the House the contents of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 provide for the usual definitions of the terms used in the Bill.  The definition of disability is that used in the Disability Act 2005.  Section 2 amends the definition of a voluntary body in the Comhairle Act to include citizens information services and citizens information centres.  My purpose here is to provide statutory recognition for the citizens information centres which comprise the primary <Col N="1835"/>channel through which the citizens information board will provide information to the public.  This section also includes the definition of social services, which will underpin the board&rsquo;s work in the provision of information about entitlements and public services.  Social services are broadly defined in the section and include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, employment and training, equality, asylum and immigration.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for the change of name from Comhairle to Citizens Information Board or An Bord um Fhaisn&eacute;is do Shaor&aacute;naigh.  My objective here is to have the citizens information board and the voluntary bodies providing information services, particularly the citizens information centres, readily identifiable by the public as part of one overall, coherent brand in the provision of State-funded information services in matters of civil rights and entitlements.</P>
        <P>Section 4 amends section 7 of the Comhairle Act 2000.  It provides for a number of changes to the functions of the statutory body, in particular, to provide greater support for people with disabilities.  These include a function for the board to support the provision of advocacy services in the community and voluntary sector for people with disabilities; the introduction by the citizens information board of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities who meet the criteria of qualifying persons for the service; a function for the board to support and develop greater accessibility and public awareness of the social services available to people; and a remit to promote the provision of integrated information about those services by voluntary and statutory bodies.  The provisions state that the board, in providing the personal advocacy service for people with disabilities, shall have regard to the financial resources available to it and whether advocacy services are available to the person in the community or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>In addition, section 4 inserts into section 7 of the Comhairle Act new provisions to enable the citizens information board to set terms and conditions for voluntary bodies seeking funding and to promote the development of high quality standards in the provision of information to the public.  The effect of the provisions is that voluntary bodies that seek funding may be asked to demonstrate how they will pursue quality service objectives and funding may be refused if the body concerned fails to supply the board with the information requested.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for the details of the personal advocacy service by inserting in section 7 of the Comhairle Act a number of new provisions &mdash; sections 7A to 7F.  The new section 7A provides for the designation of persons as personal advocates by the chief executive officer of the citizens information board; that the qualifications, experience and competencies required to be a personal advocate of the personal advocacy <Col N="1836"/>service shall be set out by the board; for the appointment by the board of a director of the personal advocacy service who will manage the personal advocacy service; and for the qualifying criteria to be satisfied by a person to have a personal advocate assigned to him or her.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides that a qualifying person, in the case of a person 18 years of age or older, is a person who, in the opinion of the director, is unable to obtain or has difficulty in obtaining a social service without the support of a personal advocate because of his or her disability.  The director must also be of the view that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is a risk to the person&rsquo;s health, welfare or safety if he or she is not provided with the social service in question.  A person under 18 years of age may qualify for a personal advocate if his or her sole parent or guardian is a qualifying person or if he or she has a disability and, in the circumstances of the case, it would be unreasonable to expect a parent or guardian to act on his or her behalf to obtain the social service without the assistance of a personal advocate.  The new section 7A(4) also provides that a person will not be disqualified for the assignment of a personal advocate if he or she is already getting a social service.</P>
        <P>Section 7A(5) sets out how the board will prioritise the assignment of personal advocates to people who qualify for the service.  The process will take account of factors such as the needs of the person to have a personal advocate assigned to him or her, the benefits likely to accrue to him or her by the assignment of the personal advocate and any risk of harm to health or well-being that may arise if he or she cannot obtain the services sought.</P>
        <P>Section 7A(10) provides that any person who has an interest in or who is involved in the welfare or well-being of a person with a disability and who is of the view that the person may be entitled to a personal advocate may approach the personal advocacy service and tell it about the individual concerned.  It also provides that where the director or a member of the staff of the citizens information board involved in the personal advocacy service is informed about a person who may be entitled to a personal advocate, he or she shall arrange for information about the service to be provided to the person.  The section also provides that the Minister may make regulations for incidental or supplementary matters that may arise to give effect to these provisions.</P>
        <P>The new section 7B of the Comhairle Act details the arrangements for making application to the personal advocacy service for the assignment of a personal advocate and for the decision process relating to applications.  It sets out that any person may apply to the director for the assignment of a personal advocate on behalf of a person with a disability.  It states that an applicant may appeal against a decision of the director of the personal advocacy service if he or she is not <Col N="1837"/>satisfied with the decision about qualification for the service.  It also provides for a reversal of a decision to refuse the assignment of a personal advocate in the light of new evidence or if a mistake is made about the facts.</P>
        <P>The new section 7C of the Comhairle Act sets out the arrangements for a person to make an appeal against a decision that he or she is not qualified for the assignment of a personal advocate.  The section provides, in effect, that the social welfare appeals rules and procedures which are detailed in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 will apply, in a modified form, to appeals involving the personal advocacy service.  An appeal against a decision may be lodged with the chief appeals officer, either directly by the person concerned or by any other person on his or her behalf.  My objective is to ensure that people who are dissatisfied with the decision on their qualification for the assignment of a personal advocate have access to an impartial and independent appeals system.  The social welfare appeals office has a proven record in this regard and is ideally positioned to meet the needs of people who seek the assistance of an advocate.</P>
        <P>The new section 7D of the Comhairle Act, sets out the duties and responsibilities of the personal advocate.  These are to assist, support and represent the qualified person in applying for and obtaining a social service, including an application for an assessment of need or a service specified in a service statement under the Disability Act 2005; to pursue any right of review or appeal on behalf of the qualified person; and to provide support and training to the qualified person, to any member of his or her family, a carer or any other person who represents the interests of the person with a disability.  This section empowers a personal advocate acting on behalf of the person with a disability to enter any place that provides day care, residential care or training for him or her and to represent his or her interests.  It also provides that the personal advocate may, subject to data protection legislation, access information and attend meetings or consultations on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 7D(4) imposes an obligation on statutory or voluntary bodies to co-operate with a personal advocate in the performance of his or her functions on behalf of the person with a disability.  Subsections (5), (6) and (7) of section 7D set out the offences to apply to persons who obstruct or hinder a personal advocate in that context.</P>
        <P>Section 7E provides that where an offence under section 7D(5) is committed by a body corporate and where the offence is proved to have arisen because of the action or inaction of an individual connected with that body, the individual and the body corporate shall be guilty of the offence.  The section further provides that where the body corporate is managed by its members and the offence is attributable to a member in a management role, he or she shall be guilty and <Col N="1838"/>liable to have proceedings taken against him or her.</P>
        <P>The new section 7F of the Comhairle Act 2000 provides that the citizens information board may arrange for the functions of personal advocates to be performed by persons other than members of the staff of the board, as it considers appropriate.  Such a move by the board would be subject to the approval of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Sections 6 and 7 of the Citizens Information Bill provide for changes to the term of office and membership of the citizens information board.  These changes are considered necessary in the light of operational experience since the board was first constituted in June 2000.  Section 6 amends section 9 of the Comhairle Act so that the term of office of members of the board will be extended from three to five years and the number of members of the citizens information board will be reduced from 20 to 15.  This approach is in keeping with a general trend towards smaller boards in respect of State agencies.  Of the other agencies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, the Pensions Board and the Combat Poverty Agency each has 16 members on its board, while the Family Support Agency has a 12 member board.  This section provides for a consequential adjustment to be made to the board arising from the reduction to 15 members.  The number of members representing people with disabilities is being reduced from five to at least three and, having regard to the Government&rsquo;s mainstreaming policy, the nominating role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of these members is being removed.  Section 7 of the Bill amends section 11 of the Comhairle Act and provides for a revised quorum for board meetings as a result of the reduction from 20 to 15 members.  The quorum is being reduced from 11 members to a number between eight and five as may be considered appropriate by the board.</P>
        <P>Section 8 amends section 23 of the Comhairle Act and pertains to the accountability of the chief executive before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The section brings the legislation in line with current best practice by ensuring that the chief executive will be accountable to the committee in similar terms to secretaries general of Departments.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides for the insertion of a new section 24A in the Comhairle Act.  It provides that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs may issue policy directions to the citizens information board, including directions to directly undertake information campaigns on specific social services.</P>
        <P>Section 10 sets out the standard provisions relating to short title and collective citation.  It also provides for the commencement arrangements for the implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions with different commencement dates applying to different sections of the Bill.</P><Col N="1839"/>
        <P>The introduction of the personal advocacy service by the citizens information board is an important priority in my Department&rsquo;s programme of work to enhance the services available to people with disabilities.  A lot of progress has been made since such a service was first mooted in 2001.  The views and the experience of people with disabilities and of those who work with them have made a significant contribution to the development of the advocacy programme already underway and the proposals in this legislation.  Officials of my Department will continue to consult with disability interests groups in the development of the services proposed and the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s disability sectoral plan.     The issue of resources is central to the successful implementation of any new service being introduced by the Government.  I assure the House that the resources necessary to introduce the new personal advocacy service are being provided to the citizens information board.  In 2006, Comhairle was allocated a total of &euro;24.362 million, of which &euro;2.012 million was provided for the development of advocacy services by the voluntary and community services, as well as &euro;250,000 for preparatory work on the personal advocacy service.  For 2007, my Department has allocated &euro;28.422 million to Comhairle, with a total of &euro;4.312 million allocated specifically for advocacy services.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities face many barriers to full participation in society.  The personal advocacy service provided for in the Citizens Information Bill 2006 has a significant contribution to make to ensure every person with a disability has access to appropriate assistance and support in securing their entitlements to social services.  It represents an important step forward in delivering the Government&rsquo;s commitments in the disability strategy to the full integration of people with disabilities in all aspects of society.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome to the House the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and his officials.  I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on the obstacles faced by people with disabilities.  I broadly welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction, although I wish to raise a number of questions on its provisions.  I also intend to raise issues on behalf of my colleague, Fine Gael&rsquo;s Seanad spokesperson on social and family affairs and equality, Senator Terry, who is unavoidably absent.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Bill 2006 is one of the major strands of the national disability strategy.  It will establish a personal advocacy service to be operated by the citizens information board.  The establishment of a personal advocacy service to assist people with disabilities in accessing health and personal social services and supports has been urgently sought by numerous disability groups, including in particular the National Dis<Col N="1840"/>ability Authority and Inclusion Ireland.  The service aims to ensure equal access to services and supports for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>It is clear that advocacy services for people with disabilities are underdeveloped in Ireland.  The 2004 report, Developing an Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, stated that service providers, the community and voluntary sectors are increasingly aware of the need for these services.  An independent advocacy service is essential if people with disabilities are to be fully included in the process of service provision.  This will give many people with disabilities, who may be unable to seek services for themselves, the opportunity to put forward their requests and views on the range of services they receive.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will address the following questions in his response.  What will be the geographic remit of the personal advocacy service?  Where will the personal advocates be based and will they be in Dublin only or around the country?  Has the citizens information board determined the number of advocates to be employed, the office supports to be provided and where they will be located?</P>
        <P>The Disability Federation of Ireland pointed out that advocacy services can be often passive in that a person must make an application to them.  However, individuals may not know where or to whom they must apply, whether they are entitled to the service or even of its existence.  How can the most marginalised and vulnerable in society be assisted in taking advantage of this service?</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Stanton, has noted that section 5 states that a person must be at &ldquo;risk of harm to his or her health, welfare or safety if he or she is not provided with the social service or services that he or she is seeking to obtain&rdquo;.  These seem very negative grounds for availing of a service.  An indication should be given that a person could avail of the service if he or she would benefit from it because, as it stands, individuals will qualify only if harm would come to them should they not receive the service.  We should turn that around by stating that a person qualifies if he or she would derive benefit from the service.  How does a person prove he or she will come to harm by not receiving a service?  The Minister should re-examine this aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The issue of prioritising also arises.  Subsection (5) of the proposed section 7A, to be inserted by section 5, states: &ldquo;The board shall have regard to the following to determine the order of priority to be accorded to different qualifying persons in the assignment of personal advocates to such persons:&rdquo;.  It goes on to list five different grounds for qualifying.  It does not make clear how this will work.  It appears that only the most complex services will be dealt with by the personal advocacy service.  This matter needs to be teased out further.  Otherwise, the service may not be practicable.</P>
        <P>Many people with disabilities are found not only in day and residential care and training <Col N="1841"/>places, but also in hospitals and places of detention.  Under the proposed section 7C, to be inserted by section 5, the personal advocate can enter premises to attend and represent the person at any meeting, consultation or discussion.  However, would he or she be able to enter a hospital or place of detention?  The Disability Federation of Ireland maintains that the powers of the personal advocate must extend to any place where people with disabilities reside.</P>
        <P>Many of those who will qualify for the personal advocacy service will not have the capacity to apply or have someone to apply on their behalf.  The Bill appears to provide that a person with an intellectual disability may apply in writing under the proposed section 7B, to be inserted by section 5, or such other forms as specified by the Minister, to the director for the assignment of a personal advocate to him or her, and he or she shall specify in the application the social service or services he or she is seeking to obtain.  It is important that the application process is made as simple as possible with the service being proactive instead or reactive.  As the Bill stands, it will not reach out to the marginalised people who need this help.</P>
        <P>What happens if a personal advocate giving advice and information, and acting for a person with a disability makes a mistake?  Is there a review process?  The advocates appear to work on their own; in other cases, it would be a team effort.  Will the advocate work as part of a team?  If the advocate gives incorrect advice, what recourse does the person have?</P>
        <P>It is important that the service is independent, particularly of service providers.  We must also avoid the establishment of a cartel between advocates and service providers; there should always be a distance between the two.  An advocate should be fighting on behalf of a person with a disability.  Advocates must also avoid downplaying the expectations of the person with the disability.  While the advocate can attend and represent the person at any meeting, consultation or discussion, who decides when the meetings take place?  If the person is not qualified, the meeting may not take place at all.  Who notifies them of the meetings?  Are they entitled to such notification?</P>
        <P>The advocate can enter at any reasonable time any place where day care or residential care and training are provided for the person.  That avoids mention of places of detention and hospitals.  Who defines reasonable time?  Is it the service provider?  Must an appointment be made and notice given, and when the advocate attends, what can he or she do?  These questions were put to Senator Terry by an advocate.  I would like the Minister to respond to this point.</P>
        <P>A statutory body or voluntary body that provides social services shall co-operate with the personal advocate in the performance of his or her duties.  A person who, by act or omission, obstructs or hinders a personal advocate in the <Col N="1842"/>performance of his or her function shall be guilty of an offence and will be liable on summary conviction to punishment.  Can a statutory or voluntary body be guilty of an offence?  While other sections of the Bill state that statutory bodies shall co-operate, this section mentions a &ldquo;person&rdquo; who obstructs or hinders an advocate.  Who lays that charge?  In similar legislation, an advocate or inspector who enters premises needs identification and is required by law to produce it.  Otherwise, anyone could claim to be acting as a personal advocate for someone.  It is important that it is a requirement that a person demanding entry to premises must have such means of identification.  That provision should be added to the Bill.  Proceedings for an offence under this section may be brought and prosecuted by the Minister.  What is the process for bringing the information to the Minister?</P>
        <P>The sign language interpretation service for deaf people was covered by the original legislation, the Comhairle Act 2000.  However, it is not included in the Bill and the Minister did not refer to it in his remarks.  What are his intentions regarding this service?  If it is not intended to establish it on a statutory basis, will it operate as another of the Department&rsquo;s administrative schemes?  The sign language interpretation service is essential for deaf people, many of whom cannot lip-read and suffer high levels of social exclusion that are intensified by poor literacy levels caused by a lack of communication with education providers and teachers.  We have a major shortage of sign language interpreters for deaf people.  I understand only 50 freelance interpreters serve approximately 5,000 deaf sign language users and many of these are based in the greater Dublin area.  How many additional interpreters will be provided?  Where will they be trained and how will they be distributed?</P>
        <P>The Bill does not include a facility for the director of the personal advocacy service to appear before an Oireachtas committee, except in the case of accounting for funds.  While an Oireachtas committee may be able to call the director before it, similar legislation on other bodies makes explicit provision for directors to appear before committees of the Houses at regular intervals to explain the operation of his or her service.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, which represents a step in the right direction.  However, a number of issues have been brought to our attention and I ask the Minister to respond to them.</P>

	<P>I join Senator John Paul Phelan in welcoming the Bill.  I welcome the concept of making life easier for people with disabilities.  The Bill is intended to provide an enhancement of life for people with disabilities.  In considering where we are in providing services for people with disabilities, we should take a step back and consider some philosophical questions.  I have the following problem with the Bill.  Why do we need advo<Col N="1843"/>cates to give people the rights to which they are entitled?  What is wrong with the system that it requires the establishment of an independent advocate-type body with appeals mechanisms, directors, staff, a budget of &euro;2 million, etc.?  Should our efforts not be directed towards correcting the system rather than finding mechanisms to make it better for the people who need to use it?</P>
        <P>The key question is what we need to do with the system.  While in the short term it might be appropriate to introduce a mechanism of advocacy and assistance, our real goal should be to devise a system that is sustainable into the future.  We must ensure that the people who have rights in any system, including the health system, services for those with disabilities and education, which are guaranteed by the Constitution, should not need special steps or measures to give them that to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about spending on services for those with disabilities.  It must be recognised that we have come a long way in working with people with disabilities to look after them, educate them, and provide them with facilities and carers.  When we ask people with disabilities and their service providers whether things are substantially better now than they were ten years ago we are told that while they are better, there is a long way to go.  I will give an example of a service provider in Galway city.  A training centre was established to help people with disability who have completed second level education and provide life skills, etc.  Fifteen people travel from Portumna to Galway city, spending six hours a day on a bus to access training and development services.  That does not make sense and it is not acceptable.  Will an advocacy service improve that situation or do we need to improve the system for those people?  There is a group of parents called Voices for Galway which provides additional speech therapy for children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  We sang carols before Christmas to raise money and collected approximately &euro;4,000.  What of the &euro;2 million being put into this advocacy service to help us win rights that we already have?  Why are we fund-raising to provide basic human rights, in this case the right to be able to speak properly for people who have that ability but need assistance?</P>
        <P>This is not a personal attack on the Minister because it is not his problem but it is time we took stock and asked what we are doing about disability.  The Minister referred to mainstreaming.  That is a joke.  We are creating segregated groups of people within a mainstream environment.  Anyone involved in education and training at any level would say this mainstreamed integration of people with disabilities is not happening.  There are special teachers and assistants, and children who are made to feel different because they are in a classroom.  That is not real <Col N="1844"/>mainstreaming.  The general population does not accept what people with disabilities can give.</P>
        <P>I attended a meeting recently to review someone who had entered a new service.  This took place five months after the person joined the service.  The incredible feature of that meeting was that throughout the meeting the service providers discussed what the person was able to achieve.  It is to their credit that they did not talk about disability but ability.  At the end of the meeting it was clear to all involved that while this 20 year old was able and achieving within the training setting provided, that did not extend to the wider setting of the community and the person could not go to the pubs or cinemas on Friday nights.  The person did not have a social circle or the supports to live in our society.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to create a review mechanism to see if we can eliminate the requirement for this advocacy service in five or ten years.  The money provided to health services has increased significantly over the past ten years, yet despite that and the establishment of the Health Service Executive, the service is not as good as it used to be.  People are waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency units and hospitals must close because of MRSA.  Why are there so many problems in the health service.  Where is all this money going?  Why do we not get the type of improvements that we should get for the money spent on the service?  Maybe this is because we have created levels of administration, advocacy, directors, appeals and people doing paper pushing jobs.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>An example is the Minister&rsquo;s reference in an earlier version of his speech to the terms and conditions of funding and the new provisions in the Comhairle Act to enable the citizens information board to set terms and conditions for voluntary bodies in seeking funding and to promote the development of high quality standards in the provision of information to the public.  The effect of the provisions is that voluntary bodies seeking funding may be asked to demonstrate how they will pursue quality service objectives, and funding may be refused.  Show me a service provider in this country for people with disabilities who is not working his or her backside off trying to provide frontline services while being hindered time and again with the need for plans, strategies, quality statements and whatever.  This pulls frontline staff away for planning days and service days while at the coalface, the people who need the service, such as social workers in their homes, visiting psychologists and speech therapists are losing this service.  We are all too busy writing plans and strategic documents and putting them in language that ensures we do not lose funding or that we get the funding to which we are entitled.</P>
        <P>That is the problem.  We spend too much time writing bloody books to try to get funding instead <Col N="1845"/>of saying: &ldquo;This is what we want to do, this is how we will deliver and if we do not deliver, you can take the money from us next year and we must find a different way to do it.&rdquo;  We need to start proofing legislation.  We are creating more and more layers of bureaucracy through which people cannot wade, which is very worrying.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about reducing the size of the boards.  I agree in principle that we may not need 20 people on a board to run a service.  I have serious difficulty, however, with his saying that we are to reduce the number of people representing those with disabilities from five to at least three.  We should ensure a space is kept on the board for those who represent people with disabilities or for someone with a disability.  If extra space is required to do that, it should be provided.  Reducing the number on the board from 20 to 15 and reducing representatives of those with disabilities from five to three when we are trying to improve our services to people with disabilities is neither fair nor right.  The Minister may have some reason for this but I am concerned about this suggestion.</P>
        <P>The Minister defined advocacy as being the act of supporting or speaking up for somebody or, to put it more formally, as a dynamic process of negotiation conducted by or on behalf of an individual who is marginalised in some way.  We do not need somebody to engage in this process if the education, health and social welfare systems have responsibility for delivering the services they should deliver without having somebody on the other side fighting for that person.  If the Minister worked in a factory where he was expected to deliver 100 units of a product, he would find the manufacturing system simple because it would tell him as the operator that he is responsible for ensuring from start to finish the product would do what it was intended to do.  That is how the education, health and social services should work.  It should be the responsibility of those providing the service to ensure there is no need for advocates, appeal systems or reviews because people will receive their entitlements.</P>
        <P>The real challenge and responsibility the Government and Secretaries General of Departments face is to create a system that does not contain barriers.  Such a system would remove the need for advocates.  People would be then able to access their entitlements and rights in the way originally intended and would not be obliged to depend on somebody fighting on their behalf to secure those entitlements and rights.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for listening to my points.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.  I look forward to seeing if any changes regarding a review mechanism to consider the future operation of the legislation will be introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the Bill, which I regard as a worthwhile step in the direction of treating, with the proper con<Col N="1846"/>cern, the needs of those of our fellow citizens who have disabilities of one kind or another.  I have got out of the habit of using the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo; and I almost swore that I would not use it anymore.  I was very impressed by the efforts of those involved in the ability awards scheme, which highlights that people with disabilities are also people with abilities.  I accept it is not possible to use the word &ldquo;ability&rdquo; in place of that of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in every instance but trying to use it as much as possible sends a welcome message.  The work done by organisations such as the Aisling Foundation to inform employers about the abilities of people who they might have otherwise regarded as being somewhat lacking because they have disabilities is to be commended.  The foundation has done marvellous work and the Minister has supported it in many ways.</P>
        <P>What impresses me about those who are in need of help is that, whereas in the past those experiencing difficulties formed groups and sent emissaries to Dublin to seek assistance, they now form such groups and then decide to take action themselves.  They still seek support from the Government in Dublin but they tend to help themselves.  The Minister has recognised such self-help initiatives in the legislation because it is now the intention to provide support.</P>
        <P>The Bill recognises the need of the State to reach out to people with disabilities and to meet their needs more than halfway.  Our history in dealing with these people has not been particularly happy and has been characterised by the less than pretty sight of very human needs coming into full frontal collision with the inflexible face of bureaucracy.  Much of the heat that has been generated by the issue of disability has been caused by the lack of humanity that has been applied in approaching the question.</P>
        <P>A key aspect of the Bill before us is the proposal to rename Comhairle as the citizens information board.  This may appear to be a matter of cosmetics &mdash; the Minister outlined the facts very well in this regard &mdash; but it is not; it goes to the very heart of the need to reach out to the people on this matter and to speak to them in a language they understand.  I share with many people an affection for having the names of State bodies in Irish but not when this gets in the way of communicating clearly the function and purpose of a body, as unfortunately happened in this case.  There were many people who came within the remit of Comhairle who had no idea the organisation was intended to meet their needs.  This is a valuable change.</P>
        <P>I was involved with An Bord Phoist approximately 20 years ago.  The first thing we decided to do was change the name.  We arrived at a name &ldquo;An Post&rdquo;, which does not need to be translated.  To a certain extent, I set a challenge to every Irish organisation establishing operations as to whether it is possible for it to have a name that can be read in both languages and in respect of which an English translation is not required.</P><Col N="1847"/>
        <P>I am also delighted to note that even in today&rsquo;s Stalinist-like atmosphere created by the Official Languages Act, the Minister has found the courage to undo that mistake and make a fresh start.  How we name things is important and it is a matter about which we should always think carefully.  Another problem regarding Comhairle is its website, which brings together in one place all citizen-related information.  This is an excellent idea, which I totally support, but the website was unduly hampered because it laboured under the obscure name of Oasis.  I have no idea as to what that name was intended to convey and I hope we have seen the last of it.</P>
        <P>Another pillar of the Bill is the concept of personal advocacy.  I congratulate the Minister on this development, which I welcome.  It is an attempt to redress the unfairness, which obtained for too long and under which people who did not have all their abilities were expected to jump through an impossible succession of hoops and obstacles in an attempt to have their needs properly met.  The most unfair aspect was that, by reason of their disabilities, many people were unable to negotiate those hoops and obstacles, while the bureaucracy was able to sniffily observe its requirements had not been met.  This led many people to press for a rights-based approach to disability legislation because they saw it as the only possible way to overcome the obstacles faced by people with disabilities.  They may well be right.  However, I have always felt there was nothing the situation needed that could not be provided by a modicum of reasonableness and a touch of humanity, helped along the way, of course, by a little more money.  Now that we have the resources to do what until recently was impossible, some of these apparently immovable obstacles can be expected to disappear.  Given that we have the money which we did not previously possess and which delayed progress for so long, it would be tragic if we could not also supply the degree of reasonableness and humanity that are also required.</P>
        <P>There is a world of difference between, on one hand, putting obstacles in people&rsquo;s way and, on the other, going out of one&rsquo;s way to help and make matters easy for them.  I was recently honoured to become patron of the Irish Association of Supported Employment, IASE.  I am conscious of the difference of approach to which I refer, particularly when I discuss the question of supported employment with other employers.  For some individuals, the idea of employing people with disabilities &mdash; which is the most pressing need for many people with such disabilities &mdash; is problematical and burdensome.  It is a matter about which some people would rather not think.  However, I and many other employers have discovered that people with disabilities also possess abilities.  For example, people with bad hearing often possess good eyesight and <i>vice versa</i>.  Employers must seek out people&rsquo;s abilities and <Col N="1848"/>concentrate, strengthen and support these.  The ability to allow them to do so is provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In contrast, however, those who have a more open approach and follow their instincts are invariably rewarded by an experience that enriches everyone affected by it.  When an employer takes on a person who perhaps would not have been his or her first choice because of the existence of a disability, his or her initiative garners support from other employees.  People feel good when working with those to whom I refer, particularly in terms of seeing them improve, gain, grow in stature and blossom.  It also has a positive effect on customers.  Customers, colleagues, other employees and suppliers often state that a company is worth supporting because it is doing good through employing those with disabilities.  The really clever people in business are those who realise it makes very good business sense to develop employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In the end, the person who benefits most is the employer.</P>
        <P>I wish the Bill every success and hope it will pass into law speedily.  If any amendments are brought forward, I am sure the Minister will give them careful consideration because the objective behind them will be to improve what he is setting out to achieve in this legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister and the introduction of the Bill.  I have experience of what was then the Department of Social Welfare, now the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and this legislation will enhance the vital services that Department provides throughout the country.  In the information society in which we now live, the provision of accurate and concise information in a speedy manner is more or less expected, especially when it comes to people&rsquo;s rights and entitlements.  People not being aware of their entitlements and rights has always been an issue and for many years the Department of Social and Family Affairs was accused of not giving enough information.  My experience is that it is a Department which embraced technology at an early stage and attempted to provide as much accurate information as possible in as speedy a manner as possible.  Employment exchanges, for instance, were the first organisations to computerise their systems and the changes suggested in this Bill, particularly from an information provision point of view, will enhance the existing service.</P>
        <P>In a sense we have come full circle with the Department because this legislation is an attempt to make as much information as possible available to as many people as necessary, especially those with disabilities or people in vulnerable sections of society who may not have access to information to determine their rights.  This legislation is welcome in that regard.</P><Col N="1849"/>
        <P>When we consider that more than 1.5 million people access welfare services every year and almost 1 million payments are made by the Department, in most cases to people in the most vulnerable sections of our society, the speedy provision of accurate information is crucial because it not only benefits the person receiving the information or a benefit but also the staff who provide that service whose lives are made much easier.  I am aware from speaking to people working in the sector that they want to give as much information as possible and this legislation is an attempt to facilitate that.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not just deal with welfare issues; it covers housing, employment, health and education.  Successive Governments have placed much emphasis on consumer rights and we now have a range of services dealing specifically with consumer rights.  This Bill is another brick in that wall and it will ensure that people get what they are entitled to in a speedy manner and that as much information as possible is provided.</P>
        <P>The Bill will streamline the provision of information on a wide range of topics.  Along with most public representatives, I have had experience of the citizens information centres.  The 235 centres throughout the country play a major role and provide an excellent service in their communities.  As public representatives, we have all had experience of people coming to our clinics seeking information, and in some cases we advise them to go to the citizens information centre, which is probably the quickest way to get the information they require.  We can follow up the representation by writing a letter and so on but if they go to their local citizens information centre, they will get the information they need.</P>
        <P>There is a very busy citizens information centre in the heart of the city which provides a wide range of services, including legal services, health services and information on the various offices where one can get relevant information.  That centre plays a major role in the community.  This Bill will streamline that service and pull together the three strands that existed previously, including the Oasis service, the telephone line and the citizens information service.</P>
        <P>An examination of the figures in that regard reveal that in 2005, the Oasis website reached nearly 2.5 million people.  The citizens information service dealt with almost 734,000 queries and the citizens information telephone service dealt with almost 88,000 queries.  The need for this service has been proven and the changes suggested in this legislation will make access to information much easier for people.</P>
        <P>The new communities being set up by those who come here from another country is an issue, particularly in respect of their rights and entitlements.  This service will provide information on asylum and immigration but also on the requirements involved and what is expected of people coming to this country. From that point of view, <Col N="1850"/>the legislation will help deal with some of the issues being experienced in certain areas.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities were mentioned.  In my experience, many people with varying degrees of disability are quite capable of being their own advocate.  The thrust of this Bill is to assist those who are not in a position to put their point of view.  We have all had experience of people with disabilities who would have no contact with services, established groups or organisations, or any of the support groups and whose only support came from their immediate family.  Those people will be given the opportunity to support their family members in a particular way and be an advocate for them.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Bill will encourage full participation in society, which links in directly with the strategy on the provision of services for people with disabilities.  I have had experience of groups such as the centres for independent living and Vantastic which provide services for people with disabilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week and ensure they can participate in life in general but especially in their own communities.  Without that help, those people would be unable to do that.  I have known individuals who had particular issues with which they could not get any help.  When someone has a disability, it is much more difficult to get information or access a particular entitlement.  This legislation will make life much easier for people at the centre of the services.</P>
        <P>The personal advocacy service allows a family member, carer or helper from one of the groups or organisations assist a person in getting information or access to benefits.  Not every disabled person is linked in to an organisation and this legislation will strengthen their position in that regard.</P>
        <P>On section 4 and voluntary bodies that seek funding, I have had much experience of the funding administered by the Department.  In some cases it might be a relatively small amount of money but it can make a significant difference to the group concerned.  The more streamlined and accessible that funding, the better because the effects are immediately beneficial to the groups and organisations requiring it.</P>
        <P>The provision of independent, clear and accessible information has a central role in helping to break down barriers and eases people&rsquo;s anxieties.  It can require great effort for an individual to go through his or her personal details with an adviser.  It can be harder when the individual has a disability or cannot convey what he or she wants to express.  The provision of information is crucial to allowing easier access to entitlements.  Better still, it saves individuals from worry, heartache and effort.  The more that can be done to streamline the service, the better.  This legislation will benefit people in this regard.</P>
        <P>A commitment has been made to increase funding for the new citizens information board and expand the services.  Total funding of &euro;55 million will be provided in 2006 and 2007, a sign of <Col N="1851"/>the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to implementing an essential service.  Citizens information centres play a large role in local communities, not just in urban areas but rural areas where people can be isolated.  These centres allow people to walk in off the street, gain quick access to information or application forms.</P>
        <P>A significant number of people do not know what services are provided by citizen information services.  I am glad a nationwide high profile information and awareness campaign will be undertaken to ensure people are aware of the services and information available.  With a service such as this, people have to be actively encouraged to take advantage of it.  If not, then the accusation can be made that people are being prevented from applying for services.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation as it will make matters concerning entitlements easier for people.  The service will become user-friendly and enhance people&rsquo;s opportunity to access their entitlements.  Over the years the functions of employment exchanges have changed dramatically.  I recall the time when the queues at exchanges would be out the door but these days they are used for a myriad of different benefits and entitlements.  While it is welcome that we no longer have an unemployment problem, we must acknowledge the service has changed.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest if we can continue to provide a quality social welfare service with concise information.  The Bill goes a long way in improving the excellent services provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to the House.  The Bill is enlightened and progressive social legislation which will be welcomed by those who deal with people with disabilities.  Comhairle and the citizens information service are important public services.  The thrust of the Bill is to ensure that the service will be expanded and better resourced.  Of course when informing people of their rights, nothing beats local radio discussions of points relating to particular categories of entitlements.</P>
        <P>The concept of advocacy goes beyond the provision of information, which is necessary in cases of persons suffering a disability.  The term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; covers a host of different circumstances and conditions.  If this advocacy proves successful, will there be a case for extending the concept to other parts of the social welfare system?  I can already hear the objection from colleagues in both Houses that politicians would be doing themselves out of a job.  I do not believe that any more than the liberalisation of the taxi system in Dublin put existing licence holders out of a job.  As many and as varied a range of workers in particular fields is required.</P>
        <P>Some ask what is constituency work when a citizens information centre would do the job <Col N="1852"/>nicely?  Public representatives do not just act as conveyors of information but as advocates with the system.  There is a further distinction which even the advocacy role will not cover.  Problems, not just individual ones, brought to the attention of legislators allow them to highlight some defect or gap in the system.  Legislators also have more direct access than ordinary citizens to Ministers and Departments in their decision-making capacities.</P>
        <P>I get very impatient with the conventional, metropolitan, editorial wisdom that legislators should just legislate and not make representations on behalf of individuals.  If one thinks through the logic of this, under this notion public representatives would be cut off from their constituents.  It is healthy to listen to people&rsquo;s problems.</P>
        <P>I speak for myself as well as my colleagues in saying that many of the issues we raise on the Order of Business are problems that are brought to our attention by constituents.  It is rarely the case that they are issues that affect only the individuals in question and nobody else.  In many cases, they are problems that affect a wide variety of people and which should be brought to our attention.  In terms of legislation and the way in which any administrative system operates, there are always questions of judgment and margins of discretion.  In that capacity, a public representative acts as an advocate.</P>
        <P>It is easy for a correspondent to <i>The Irish Times</i>, living in the leafy suburb of Glenageary or Foxrock, to deplore clientilism and constituency representations and to insist that legislators should be in the Chamber from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Such persons live only six miles from the centre of power and may have civil servants as neighbours.  Living in the capital, one has easier access to many facilities.  There are many others, however, who live a long way from the capital and do not regularly encounter senior civil servants let alone Ministers.  Such people may want help in communicating their needs and concerns to the places where decisions are made, which is mainly, though not exclusively, Dublin.</P>
        <P>One of the positive aspects of our political system is the accessibility of public representatives, from the highest officeholder down, to the public.  In some more heavily populated countries and under different political systems, the people who make decisions are impossibly remote.  This is a positive feature rather than a deplorable one and something we should retain.  A substantial bulk of the representations we receive come under the departmental responsibilities of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and involve people who are in a relatively disadvantaged position.</P>
        <P>I draw Members&rsquo; attention to a fine statement by the former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, in 1963.  It represents the very opposite of the philosophy often &mdash; wrongly, in my view &mdash; attributed to him in the context of his comments on a rising tide <Col N="1853"/>lifting all boats.  The quotation is so eloquent that I have included it on the back of my visiting card:</P>
        <P LI="1">All human experience bears out the lesson that social justice must be organised, that governments have the duty to intervene to protect the common good of all citizens without preference for any individual or group, although giving more attention to the less fortunate citizens who are less able to defend their rights and assert their legitimate claims, and that unless this is done, indefensible inequalities persist and tend to become more widespread, including the too ready assumption that social benefits would follow automatically economic achievements and that they would be fairly shared amongst our community.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Defending the rights and asserting the legitimate claims of the disadvantaged is what this legislation is all about.  Criticising the &ldquo;too ready assumption that social benefits would follow automatically economic achievements&rdquo; is the diametric opposite of the notion that a rising tide lifts all boats.</P>
        <P>This Bill is fairly and squarely within the spirit of the enlightened social philosophy of Se&aacute;n Lemass.  I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I join those who have welcomed this Bill.  I avail of this opportunity to pay a well deserved tribute to the Minister, who is like a breath of fresh air in the area of rights and opportunities for people with disability.  The hallmark of his ministry to date is his focus on consultation rather then controversy.  This is exactly what is needed in this area.  We have some well organised, well intentioned and professional lobby groups for people with disabilities.  At times when such groups found it necessary to use the media to make a point, that was done more out of frustration than anger.  The feeling was that there was no opportunity to present their cases.</P>
        <P>I was taken by some of Senator Cox&rsquo;s comments in the context of the difficulties that existed in the past in regard to mainstreaming for those with disabilities.  One may theorise as much as one wants about an issue such as this but the people who know best what is required are those who themselves have disabilities.  While one may sympathise with somebody who suffers a bereavement, one can never feel that person&rsquo;s grief.  The same is true of the challenges that face people with disabilities.  Such challenges may consist of something as simple as access to a building or may relate to a wider issue, such as a generalised characterisation of people with disabilities or a patronising attitude towards them.</P>
        <P>The growth in the network of citizen information centres was to some extent organic.  There was no major plan and many of the centres had their own particular style.  Taking up Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s point about public representatives acting as advocates, many of these centres enjoyed the involvement of political activists <Col N="1854"/>because there was the possibility of growth without conformity.  However, there were also weaknesses in the system.  I say this without in any way taking from the work done by the centres.  They carried out several important functions, such as avoiding over-familiarity and endeavouring to reduce offsetting bureaucracy.  There was always the perception that one could walk into one of these centres and find someone with whom one could identify.  I would not like to see that change.</P>
        <P>However, society has changed and people are now presented with new opportunities.  The economy, in particular, has changed for the better.  We must ensure that people can avail of the new opportunities and resources.  It is clear from this Bill that the Minister was not satisfied merely with producing legislation; he also produced the funding.  There are issues other than funding, however.  Our perception of people with disability is a particularly important issue.  I have had experience in recent times of a F&Aacute;S scheme in an area where some people with disabilities joined the workforce.  It was a wonderful experience.  When the people with disability came in, they did not do so in some type of categorised fashion or to create a balance between the able-bodied and people with disability.  There was a vacancy, they came in and they blended in in such a way that one could see development in their attitude and in that of other people to them.  This is what I would regard as mainstreaming.  There was equality, which was vital.  I am sure that occurs in many schemes.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have often said the reason F&Aacute;S has been so successful has been that the people who have run the schemes have been exceptionally pragmatic practitioners.  Whatever their background, whether they are carpenters or otherwise, they have brought that attitude to the job so bureaucracy has been very much diluted.  They have been able to deal and engage with people who have wanted to work with F&Aacute;S.  They have always been ahead of the posse in deciding what is necessary and what should be done.  I recommend F&Aacute;S as a model in terms of what it has achieved without, in some way, categorising and excessively highlighting people with disability.  Since these schemes have provided training and those participating in them have not been part of the general labour force or in pursuit of jobs because their needs have not allowed them to take up jobs, I guarantee that virtually every F&Aacute;S scheme will demonstrate the point I make.  That is being done without any fanfare.  As a result, the situation is normalised and there is equality.</P>
        <P>One cannot have 230 citizen information centres without developing a cohesive policy for them.  This comes back to what I said about the availability of opportunities and resources.  The only way to do this is by a single branding, which is what is intended here, as anything else will weaken the ability to avail of the opportunities which exist.</P><Col N="1855"/>
        <P>There are other aspects to this as well.  There is a learning curve for each of the centres.  If they always see themselves as isolated, stand-alone centres without having similar experiences to other centres, although we know that is not the case, they will miss out on those opportunities.  This legislation, however, will supply that learning curve.  I cannot see how one can have a new engine without fuel, or a director.  The suggestion that there will be a director of staff makes so much common sense that one wonders why it was not done previously.  That is why I paid tribute to the Minister and his officials in this regard.  We have now identified an important element.</P>
        <P>I noticed Senator Cox sounded a few notes of warning.  She is exceptionally good at that and is generally very prophetic.  She usually speaks from experience.  I join her to this extent, namely, it is very important that the new advocacy structure does not, in some way, create a bureaucracy which should not exist.  It should only be seen as complementary or supplementary to the new system being put in place.  I do not know how one could do that but one way is for primacy to remain with the centres.  The work of the centres should be acknowledged.  They have often worked without great resources and in buildings and centres which have not been especially suited for the work they had to do.  Nevertheless, they have given an important service so the primacy should remain with them.  However, the real primacy must be the people with disability.  That is why we must avoid any type of bureaucracy which prevents them from having a voice.  From reading the Bill, it is quite clear there is no intention to create a structure which, in some way, becomes paramount.</P>
        <P>At one stage, I was surprised by Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s approach to the debate but he was 100% right.  An issue arose recently, which I will not mention, relating to representation by a Member of the Oireachtas.  The debate became very broad.  I even heard a person for whom I have the greatest respect, Fr. McVerry, make a point about it on a political programme the other night.  He was wrong to say there is a need to remove public representatives from the area of representation.  That is all very well for people who understand the system and for people who know and have the confidence to look for their rights.  I have made representations for hundreds of people who, despite the best will in the world, were not capable of doing so themselves.</P>
        <P>I will give another example of this which might be slightly against Government policy but I will do so anyway.  I always believed getting rid of the health boards was a retrograde step because somebody who could not get attention, etc. could knock on the door of an advocate, namely, a public representative, seven days per week.  Public representatives should not only feel they have a mandate but that they have the confidence of the people.  They are held accountable for <Col N="1856"/>whatever results they deliver.  If that element of democracy is taken away, it is a weakness.  I now understand why Senator Mansergh focused on that so much.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome this Bill which is long overdue and so practical.  A contest should not created between the system and the information centres.  It should be seen as a partnership trying to deliver cohesion which, in the long run, will give people the opportunity to get their rights.  That is what it is about.  It is not about charity or something to which people are not entitled.  If it does that, and it certainly can help towards doing so, this is among the best legislation I have seen in a long time.  I wish the Minister and his Department well in pursuit of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators on all sides for their contributions on this proposed legislation.  I listened very carefully to the points made.  As the Bill goes through the different Stages in the House, I will try to respond to the points made.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan asked a number of questions.  In the initial phase of the service, it is planned that the director of the personal advocacy service and four to six personal advocates and support staff will be recruited.  He also asked about the location.  The director of the personal advocacy service will be based in Dublin initially but on decentralisation of the citizens information board headquarters, he or she will move to Drogheda.  As the service develops throughout the country, it is intended that trained advocates would be located in different parts of the country.  This all depends on the demand for the service as it develops.  Some advocates will be placed at local level, again depending on the requirement.  There is a certain degree of useful flexibility.</P>
        <P>On recruitment, the initial steps have been put in place without in any way pre-empting the legislation.  However, formal recruitment will begin when the legislation goes through the House and is signed by the President.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan expressed concerns about the assignment of personal advocates and how people would know about the service.  The board will continue to consult organisations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is important to state this is a completely new service as the provision of public services have not been approached in this manner in Ireland previously.  To some extent we will be obliged to learn as the service is rolled out, to remain flexible, to continue to consult and to make the requisite changes as we proceed.  We will do so while keeping our eye on the ball and on the main objective, namely, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has just noted, to ensure that people receive the rights to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>In respect of how people will know about the service, it will be highly proactive.  The legislation requires the citizen information board and the advocates to seek out and offer support, as well <Col N="1857"/>as targeting those who may need the service to bring it to their attention.  Rather than adopting a reactive approach, I specifically included such a proactive approach in the legislation.  The service will undertake a programme to promote awareness.  For example, it will contact GPs, public service nurses, social workers, hospital and residential services, as well as day centres.  In addition, public representatives will be given full information as the service is rolled out.  It will also undertake a number of training and developmental initiatives as it develops.</P>
        <P>I have also asked the board to establish a committee of the board to include representatives of disability groups.  Its purpose is to advise me on further measures I can put in place at an administrative level as the service comes together.  In response to Senator John Paul Phelan&rsquo;s question as to how the public will know about the service, this will be achieved through the aforementioned proactive high-powered awareness campaign and programme, which will be undertaken as soon as the service gets moving.</P>
        <P>As for the issue of sign language schemes for deaf people, some time ago I launched a plan for a language service for deaf people who use sign language in Ireland to ensure that members of the community have full access to public services.  It sets out a phased approach to the development of services in the next few years and involves the establishment of a new entity, the Irish sign language interpretative centre to develop and deliver services while maximising the benefits of new technology, in order that people throughout the country may have access to such services.  I launched this service regarding sign language for deaf people recently.  It is amazing how technology has changed everyone&rsquo;s life.  Members can imagine the benefits that have been offered suddenly to those who face the difficulty of being deaf in modern society by the advent of text messaging.  One can envisage the benefits of technology and how we need to support technological developments in support of people with different problems and issues.  The Department will invest almost &euro;3 million in this service during the next few years.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan also asked about mistakes made or wrong advice given by personal advocates.  The citizens information board will have in place a fairly robust, highly transparent and public system of complaints.  A customer who is dissatisfied with the services of a personal advocate will be able to complain in the first instance to the director mentioned in the legislation.  Thereafter, complaints may be made to the board itself and there will be full access to an appeal system.  Consequently, I am satisfied that any incorrect advice will be flushed out fairly rapidly by the system.  The Senator also raised some other queries that I can deal with on a one to one basis, if necessary.  Alternatively, I can revert to them at another time such as on Committee Stage.</P><Col N="1858"/>
        <P>In respect of Senator Cox&rsquo;s comments, as usual Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has put his finger on it in the course of an excellent philosophical analysis of the need for such a service.  Senator Cox was correct to raise this question.  One could as well ask why a social welfare, health or any other service is required.  The Senator is correct that in a perfect, ideal world, one would not require such a service and I would like to live in such a world.</P>
        <P>Sometimes we all make the mistake of associating disability with those who are confined to wheelchairs.  However, many people have other disabilities, including sensory and intellectual disabilities, some of whom will need advocates more than others.  While some are more than capable of fighting the system themselves, others need someone to fight it for them.  This resembles the need for the Combat Poverty Agency.  Although such an agency should not be necessary, for as long as poverty exists, there should be an agency to attack it and sort it out, as well as campaigning for and championing those affected.</P>
        <P>The citizens information agency is required similarly for as long as people need support to fight the system.  While they should not be obliged to fight the system, that is the reality of life.  The involvement of the European Union and other authorities, such as State boards and companies, central Departments and so on has made the system both vast and increasingly complex.  The more complex it becomes, the greater the need for the vulnerable to have someone on their side.  I was greatly taken by the comments made by Senators Mansergh and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding the role of public representatives who provide such an advocacy service.</P>
        <P>Senators Cox and Brady also raised the question of funding.  I can confirm that the total grant for 2007 is &euro;28.4 million, of which &euro;4.3 is earmarked for the advocacy service and I have already spoken in respect of the sign language centre.</P>
        <P>I hope my contribution did not give Senator Cox the wrong impression regarding the possible refusal of funding to groups that did not measure up to some requirements.  One reason for the name change is because the citizens information board will fund citizens information centres throughout the State.  I wanted to ensure that both the public and, increasingly, immigrants would see a brand they could recognise and that this would be an organisation that does what it says on the tin.  It is a brand that people can recognise and support.</P>
        <P>The citizen information centres throughout the State perform excellent work, involving substantial number of volunteers, whom I salute in particular.  However, I wished to ensure that such centres will continue to strive to reach a high standard that can be verified nationally and independently.  I do not envisage many refusals.  Instead I envisage that the central board will support all the centres nationwide in their continued efforts to maintain standards.  Many fine organis<Col N="1859"/>ations are involved in such work and I wish to join with Members in paying tribute to them.  My words in no way reflected on them because I have nothing but the highest admiration for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I interpreted this incorrectly.  On re-reading it, the Minister is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not worry as this provides me with an opportunity to state clearly the admiration felt by all in these Houses and in Ireland for such marvellous organisations, including Inclusion Ireland, the Brothers of Charity in Limerick, the Bray Partnership, the County Monaghan Partnership, the Galway advocacy service, the Longford advocacy forum, the Mayo partnerships, the centres in Cork city, as well as those located in counties Clare, Donegal and Westmeath.  I could go on as all counties contain an advocacy group or service, or a citizens information board, all of which perform excellent work.  I am trying to ensure that together, we will pull together a national movement with plenty of local volunteers that provides a first class service with certain standards of quality and uniformity to deliver a quality service across the board.  I join with Senator Cox and other Members in paying tribute to all those excellent groups.</P>
        <P>I should explain a point raised by Senator Cox.  The outgoing board of Comhairle had 20 members.  I believe Members will concur with the advice I received, which was to reduce this number to 15.  In so doing, the number of people to be appointed specifically to represent the disability sector will be reduced from 25% to 20%.  However, if one reduces the numbers on a board from 20 to 15, all groups involved get squeezed and this is not the only group to be allocated a lower representation.  Nevertheless, there is nothing to prevent me or future Ministers from appointing other members of the board to seek to ensure that the disability sector is fully represented.  I gave a commitment to this effect in the D&aacute;il.  The only agenda arises from numerical necessity because of a reduction in numbers.</P>
        <P>Apart from its disability role, the citizens information board also plays a major role in providing information through the citizens information centres to old and young people, teenagers and families, including those in crisis.  It has a range of responsibilities.  I appreciate the opportunity to explain this is purely a numbers situation.  I am sure it can be dealt with.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Quinn who greatly supported the name change.  I grew up as a supporter of doing as much as possible through Irish.  It is with great reluctance I move away from the present title.  As Senator Quinn put it, in a changing Ireland, having a website called oasis, an organisation called Comhairle and an organisation called the citizens information board in every town is too confusing, particularly for immigrants.  One <Col N="1860"/>needs another organisation to figure how they all provide information.</P>
        <P>I opted to change everything.  The national organisation will be the citizens information board, the local organisations will be citizens information centres and the website will be <i>www.citizensinformation.ie</i>.  If an organisation charged with providing information cannot provide information about itself we are off to a bad start.  It needed to be streamlined and is no reflection on our use of the language.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh quoted Se&aacute;n Lemass.  It is not the first time he has done so when I visited the House.  He has done so on a number of occasions.  It must be something I said.  He is right that a rising tide does not lift all boats.  A model civilised society must reach down and back and help certain boats and those who do not have boats.  Helping the individuals and groups who get left behind is the mark of a modern civilised society.</P>
        <P>I thank my officials who did an enormous amount of work on this Bill over a long number of years.  This began with a Comhairle Bill in 2000.  It is now 2006.</P>

	<P>We are not exactly rushing it.  We are in 2007.  The Bill is the Citizens Information Bill 2006.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about the role of public representatives.  As a Member of the Cabinet, I have regular opportunities to visit other countries and speak to my opposite numbers.  Increasingly, I find they are not elected.  In Belgium, France, Italy, the United States and sometimes in Spain, Cabinet Members are appointed.  When I sit down for a cup of tea, or something heavier from time to time, we discuss these matters and I come away thinking how fortunate we are that we stay closer to the public.</P>
        <P>Members of Government must be elected by the people.  Public representatives meet the public week in week out.  If we ever reach a stage where people who walk these corridors see themselves as only legislators and not representatives of the real people our democracy will be greatly demeaned.  I support a great deal of what Senator Mansergh stated.  We would lose something special if we suddenly found a D&aacute;il and a Seanad remote and away from the problems of everyday life.  It would be a sad day for the country.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for considering the Bill.  I have taken on board the comments made and we will deal with them further on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P el="0">Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, to section 2 are technical amendments that will ensure clarity as to what material can be carried on multiplexes.  These amendments will ensure that some radio services will be carried on television multiplexes, although television multiplexes will be primarily for television.  Similarly, some television or audio-visual services can be carried on radio multiplexes, allowing a degree of overall flexibility to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the multiplex contractor applicants.  While this flexibility could be construed from the Bill in its published form, the amendments will further define the intended use of each multiplex.  Amendment No. 15 to section 3, amendment No. 47 to section 11 and amendment No. 49 to section 13 are follow-on amendments clarifying the fact that certain provisions in those sections relate only to television multiplexes.  These amendments need to be introduced because of the amendments to section 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any control over the number of stations broadcasting on multiplex?  I am not a technical person but believe that, if there are much more than five, there is considerable interference.  While the amendments are reasonable, will multiplex channels become overloaded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify whether there will continue to be six multiplexes, some of which will be used for radio signals, instead of there being additional channels for radio?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Minister&rsquo;s presentation and speech on Second Stage, many of us were approached by digital radio mondiale, DRM, pro<Col N="1862"/>viders and yesterday attended a presentation in Buswells Hotel.  It was very impressive in terms of improving signals and extending their range across Europe.  Data I have received from RTE suggest it will not, however, represent an ideal alternative.  Does the Minister have a view on what will be the more effective system?  Will DRM be considered?  From what I have seen it seems very effective. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Senator Henry&rsquo;s query on the danger of overload, such matters will be controlled by the BCI.  Obviously there are limits to the amount of spectrum that can be used.  The technology allows four channels but it could be eight or 12 in the future, depending on developments in digitisation.  We operate on the basis of four channels at the moment to ensure there is not the overspill about which the Senator spoke.</P>
        <P>Senator Kenneally asked for clarification on the use of multiplexes for radio signals.  The Bill is designed to allow radio or television but we were advised there could be some doubt over the wording so we have clarified the point that multiplex channels can be used for either.</P>
        <P>We are learning about digital radio mondiale, digital audio broadcasting and so on.  The specifications for DRM are technical.  RTE is piloting a DAB scheme.  It is believed that DAB would have greater quality and could provide more domestic services.  DRM would deal mainly with lower quality stations from further afield.  Nothing has been finalised, but the systems cannot be compared in terms of their relative spectral efficiencies because they have been designed for different parts of the radio spectrum.  The spectrum allocation has been agreed internationally.</P>
        <P>There will probably be more experimentation, pilot schemes and so on, but I am unsure as to the Senator&rsquo;s point on the effectiveness or efficiency of DRM as opposed to DAB.  For domestic purposes, DAB is viewed as the appropriate system.  I do not doubt that we will try to standardise specifications across Europe and that DRM will be considered in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I attended a presentation on DRM.  It appeared to be an effective signal as it was shown projecting clearly from Portugal to Cyprus.  With DAB, a signal can fail if one passes underneath a bridge.  I am not an expert and this is new technology to me, but I would not like RTE to have an initial bias in favour of DAB without having considered the other option if it is more effective.  Ex-RTE employees are promoting DRM and have tried explaining it to RTE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will small stations be able to transmit from the multiplexes or will they need to send their signals to hubs from which they will be selected?  What will be the quality?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1863"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking guidance.  While this is a technical matter and, like the Minister and others, I am not a technology expert, I have a considerable interest in this area.  Will we address the technology issue on this grouping of amendments?  Other amendments deal with technology specifically.  I do not want to stifle debate.</P>
        <P>Am I to understand the Minister that these amendments will include sound broadcasting at multiplexes, which everyone would welcome?  I welcome that the Minister responded rapidly to the concerns expressed on all sides of the House on Second Stage about sound broadcasting being the poor relation, whether the legislation would give it equality and whether the multiplexes would allow for it.  Subscribers to cable companies can get visual and audio channels and I assume that the amendments relate to that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments relate to a mixture of radio and television.  The Bill is technical, but we should not be too afraid of technology.  It is not the case that there is a great deal of physical hardware, which we imagine when we discuss muxes.  A multiplex is part of a spectrum, which is available to everyone.  It is not physical.  Often, people who listen to us get the impression that they would be able to see or buy these objects.  Senator Mooney is correct in that we will discuss technical aspects later, as these amendments relate to the inclusion of broadcasting.</P>
        <P>Regarding DAB and DRM, both have pluses and minuses, but DAB is the preferred option.  RTE is experimenting in that regard because DAB is more suited to the sending of signals to the domestic market.  I am unsure concerning the question of difficulties, but problems with bridges or tunnels may prompt RTE to look elsewhere.  From our perspective, it is important that the legislation should not prescribe one way or another.  RTE should be free to get the best available system.</P>
        <P>DAB makes better allowances for small and regional stations than DRM.  As to whether smaller stations will be able to transmit from multiplexes, the muxes will be open for people to bid onto multiplexes.  I imagine that different radio and television groups will put packages together, seek spectrum space from the BCI and be adjudged.  It is good to involve the BCI because it will have an overall view of gaps in what is available and will be able to make judgments on the types of programmes on the system.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Government amendments are welcome but I would prefer if the Minister accepted our amendments because they are more specific.  It is not enough to insert &ldquo;a sound broadcasting service&rdquo;, we must specify what we want.</P>
        <P>This service will not just be for people in Britain, where there are many Irish people and people interested in Ireland and the programmes broadcast on RTE.  I may have criticised RTE radio on Second Stage but it is obvious that I listen to it.  Its programmes are of value, my criticisms are to get back programmes I wanted but that have been taken away from me or to suggest they should be broadcast at more suitable times.  There are plenty of people on mainland Europe, such as my son who lives in France, who would listen.  If we included &ldquo;digital radio mondiale&rdquo;, they would be in a position to receive sound radio.  The programmes are worth listening to and many English speakers in continental Europe, such as those who have retired to Spain, or others who may have sight problems and rely on radio for information, enjoy RTE radio as a good source of information.</P>
        <P>I complain sometimes about the music programmes or the lateness of the arts programmes but we should spread our wings further and consider this amendment, which is more specific than &ldquo;a sound broadcasting service&rdquo;, which would leave a great deal to the broadcaster to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Taking up the Minister&rsquo;s theme as outlined in the debate on the previous amend<Col N="1865"/>ments, I would not support specifics when it comes to technology.  In general, Bills of a technical nature tend to deal with generalities rather than specifics because technology changes so quickly &mdash; only 25 years ago it was not possible to record a programme for future viewing.  Digital broadcasting is a new phenomenon.  Customers are now urged to ensure they have high definition as an option when buying a television even though high definition programmes are yet to be broadcast on a regular basis.  The Minister was right earlier that we should tread cautiously in fixing a particular type of technology in this area.</P>
        <P>I am not a technical expert but to grapple with the debate that has arisen as a result of this Bill, I tried to find out as much as possible.  I come from a broadcasting background so I have an ongoing interest in this.  Digital audio broadcasting and digital radio mondiale are not rival technologies.  DAB is primarily used on a national basis while DRM is used for international purposes.  RTE has a long-wave transmitter on Summerhill, in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, which is approaching the end of its lifespan.  It is in the process of upgrading the transmitter so it will have a dual capacity whereby it will continue to provide a long-wave service which Irish people abroad can pick up, although on the Atlantic coast in Portugal and such areas medium-wave is available.  More than two thirds of Britain can receive the long-wave signal.  The dual capacity element of the new transmitter is DRM, not DAB, primarily because it is best suited for long-range transmission.</P>
        <P>The European Broadcasting Union&rsquo;s digital strategy group published a report entitled &ldquo;Public Service Media for the Digital Age&rdquo; on 26 June 2006.  It stated that by the end of 2006, more than 50 countries would launch DAB broadcasts on a permanent or test basis.  There are now more than 475 million people who are potentially covered by DAB signals and more than 800 radio stations, most of them European, are broadcasting on DAB.  In the receiver market, the report notes, there are more than 200 receivers available as prices decline and sales grow.  Digital radio mondiale, DRM, is intended as a digital alternative to replace AM analogue radio channels in the short, medium or long wave bands.  That is why RTE purchased a dual capacity transmitter for Summerhill, it will eventually replace the long-wave signal.</P>
        <P>The report goes on to state that it may also be a viable alternative to DAB for radio stations covering large areas or complex topographies.  This is significant for Ireland, which has mountainous regions.  There are still parts of the country, such as south-west Cork and Donegal, where it was sometimes difficult to pick up the RTE FM signal until repeater stations were established.</P>
        <P>The report continues that the first multi-standard receivers have entered the market in the last 12 months, combining DRM with AM, FM and DAB, which is in keeping with RTE&rsquo;s initiative <Col N="1866"/>in having a dual capacity transmitter.  DRM also contains a modest data capacity for additional text services.  Broadcasters such as the BBC and Deutsche Welle in Germany are using or testing DRM for overseas broadcasting.  RTL in Germany has begun broadcasting on DRM for its European market.</P>
        <P>An additional system, DRM 120, is planned for the VHF bands as a digital replacement for FM radio channels, which addresses Senator Henry&rsquo;s comments about over the bridge and under the bridge.  It will deal with the bit level available on the spectrum that can affect the quality of the FM signal.  This system may be valuable in parts of the world where there is still space on the VHF/FM bands, although there is not much surplus space available in Ireland and we have agreed internationally to go on to an VHF3 band, which is part of the new technology.  The Minister and his officials are the experts in terms of drafting and executing the Bill.  I am merely attempting to outline the reasons I would not necessarily support the arguments made by those who brought these amendments.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Predicting the future of technology is a hazardous undertaking, so I agree with the Minister that legislation should not be prescriptive with regard to the technical ways and means of achieving the objective of a superb radio service with state-of-the-art technology for domestic audiences and the Irish abroad.  Projecting the image of Ireland to an international radio audience is a separate issue.  The current dual approach of testing DRM while continuing to support DAB is the best way forward, although the Minister is right to avoid setting out a specific technological direction in this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for responding to Senators who pointed out during the Second Stage debate that while the Bill gives RTE a remit to provide television services to the Irish abroad, it does not make specific provision for radio broadcasts.  Is such a provision is necessary, however, given that RTE already broadcasts on long wave?  I recall listening to Gaelic games while on holiday in France.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator also mean to refer to football?  It was marvellous to be able to receive a radio signal, although I accept that digital technology will allow for a much improved signal.  I hope the Minister will clarify whether the need exists for provisions on radio broadcasting.</P>
        <P>When referring to overseas services from RTE, we probably think of emigrants in the UK, to which a signal can be easily broadcast.  How far will modern technology allow RTE to broadcast a signal?  I presume it will not travel to far flung places such as the United States or Australia.  I <Col N="1867"/>think, however, everybody will welcome the progress we are making in terms of this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the spirit of the amendments proposed by Senator Henry.  I listened carefully to the arguments made by Senator Mooney and, while I am not as familiar with the technology as I would wish, I hope the Minister&rsquo;s response to the amendments will ensure the Bill is flexible enough to manage future developments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for the contribution they made in terms of bringing these amendments.  I am aware from the debate on Second Stage that we are all in agreement on the principle of what we are trying to achieve and acknowledge that the amendments were proposed in a good faith attempt to reach as many of the Irish abroad as possible.  We decided to be explicit in including radio services in the Bill because, while we did not need to do so, several Senators cogently argued on Second Stage that it would be a good signal &mdash; pardon the pun &mdash; to send to Irish communities abroad.  We concur with that principle and have therefore introduced a number of amendments to achieve our shared goals.</P>
        <P>The amendments tabled by Senator Henry and Senator Norris, however, are unacceptable for a number of reasons, primarily the issues to which Senator Mooney referred.  I am not casting any aspersions on the Senators for proposing their amendments because I acknowledge their interest lies in maximising RTE&rsquo;s reach.  However, their proposals would restrict the current and future technology options available to us.  We made that mistake in 2001 when we tried to be specific in primary legislation as to how we should develop digital terrestrial television, with the result that we tied people&rsquo;s hands and could not attract sufficient commercial interest to develop a service.  We were following a model which existed in Europe at the time but it did not work for us.  The purpose of the primary legislation is addressing principles rather than technical details.  It is increasingly difficult to achieve the correct balance with legislation in terms of leaving enough flexibility to Ministers or officials to introduce change by means of regulations but we need to allow for the maximum level of flexibility when we deal with technological matters.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendments clearly set out the principle that the RTE authority must provide a radio service to Irish communities overseas as well as account for the funds spent on providing such a service.  These amendments will allow the authority the flexibility to use the best available technologies to achieve that mandate.  Obviously, price and other issues will have to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13 insert the term &ldquo;sound broadcasting service&rdquo; into section <Col N="1868"/>3(1) of the principal Bill.  That is the generally used term to describe a radio service in broadcasting legislation.  The amendments are designed to amend the core remit of the RTE authority, which was set out in the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, to ensure sound broadcasting services are provided to the Irish abroad.  Amendment No. 50 replaces the old section 14 of the principal Bill with a new section 14 and includes a restatement of section 8(8)(<i>d</i>) of the Broadcasting Act 2001 to correct a minor grammatical error in sections 14(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).  The amendment also inserts the term &ldquo;sound broadcasting service&rdquo; into section 14, which has the effect of amending section 28(10) of the Broadcasting Act 2001 to require the RTE authority to report to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the use it has made of television licence fee funding in the provision of the proposed radio services to Irish communities abroad.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 54 inserts the term &ldquo;sound broadcasting service&rdquo; into section 15 of the Bill, which has the effect of requiring the RTE authority, where directed by the Minister, to maintain special accounts on the use of the television licence fee funding.  We are providing for it to broadcast to the Irish overseas and be accountable for moneys so expended.</P>
        <P>I realise that these amendments relate to many different sections.  Taking the proposed amendments into account, section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) requires RTE to provide a broadcasting service to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland in so far as the RTE authority considers it reasonably practicable.  That flexible wording in section 3 accords with the thinking and recommendations of the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants that the development of a culturally sensitive media service for the Irish abroad needed to be addressed.  The Bill entrusts RTE with considering the most appropriate technological and financial means of addressing the needs of such Irish communities abroad.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney made a number of accurate points.  The long wave 252 transmitter in Summerhill, County Meath, is being upgraded.  The DAB and DRM technologies should be seen more as being complementary rather than in competition with each other.  Last year&rsquo;s world radio conference agreed that there should be three to four DAB multiplexers on VHF, which is the same as in every other country.  We are now bound by an international spectrum agreement.  Transmitting radio signals to the US, Australia, etc. cannot really be achieved terrestrially.  It must be achieved by Internet or satellite, which is how RTE tries to do it.  The changes in the Bill for the first time will allow RTE to use public moneys to broadcast abroad by radio.  It is being given this power in line with what was requested by Senators on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification.  What would be the timeline for <Col N="1869"/>implementation now that he has outlined the interpretation of the sections relating to RTE&rsquo;s obligation to provide a radio and television service abroad?  As Senator Kenneally has indicated, this service would be mainly directed at the audience in Britain, our nearest neighbour.  While we all welcome that this will be in legislation, there is a difference between what is in legislation and what will happen on the ground.  What role will the Minister have in the timeline for RTE to come back to the BCI to outline its proposals?  Will it only be required to provide such accountability annually?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what the timeline will be.  However, the obligation will arise from the enactment of the Bill.  I have already spoken to Cathal Goan in RTE.  The station envisages some difficulties and has raised a number of points.  It is enthusiastic about trying to achieve this outreach quickly.  Having a specific legislative base in this regard is important for it.  I would not be unfair in stating that he would have accepted it as a strong signal of the wishes of Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not anticipate any undue delay.  The timescale we are considering would be in the region of 12 to 18 months to get everything right technically and otherwise.  RTE management views this as a positive development and I am sure it will respond very quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to return to the issue of television.  Many Irish people who emigrated to the UK in the 1950s and 1960s do not have access to computer television programming or satellites at present.  In that context they could be regarded as being media poor.  How can we ensure they have access to Irish television in the UK?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have quite a few relatives in the UK, all of whom managed to get Tara when it was on the go.  They all still manage to get RTE radio broadcasts.  My aunt in Leamington Spa rang me just before Christmas to thank me for the Bill, about which she had just heard.  They are not having too much difficulty at the moment.  The Bill will give it a legislative basis and ensure money can be legally spent on such items.  Before this we had no legislative basis for using licence fee money in this way.  The Bill entrusts RTE with considering the most appropriate technological and financial means to address the issue and I am sure it will be able to do so.  Even as matters stand, RTE tries to reach out with its radio broadcasting through the use of long wave, Internet and satellite.  It has been active in the area and now that it is entitled to spend licence fee money on it, it will consider the technological means and begin as quickly as possible.  I do not want to stipulate how as I would not know technically anyway.  I would not want to restrict it in how it might do that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1870"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given a very clear explanation why his amendment is better than that of Senator Norris and me.  I am especially taken by what Senator Mooney has said because he has decades of experience in broadcasting and was one of the presenters of &ldquo;Both Sides Now&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to his programme for many years even though, thank goodness, I did not have much to do with emigration.  We should not be too modest or parochial about who will listen to and look at these programmes.  RTE should lift its sights rather than remembering the people in Dagenham, many of whom are dead.  RTE is now broadcasting to a totally different generation of Irish people.  When I was in the south of Portugal recently, where my friends were able to get RTE on the radio, I was informed that most of the private jets at the local airport belonged to Irish people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>RTE needs to look up.  This radio station will broadcast not just to the Irish communities in the United Kingdom, or to elderly people.  It should be regarded as showing the Irish face.  English is a second language for many people.  Why not aim at them?</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s arguments and will withdraw the amendment but I hope this station will not be regarded as addressing only a few Irish communities abroad, although they are important.  I hope that elderly people who do not have access to the Internet will get good enough equipment to receive the television or radio signals by whatever modern method we send them.  Never let it be said I stood in the way of improved technology but it is changing so much that the Government may have to consider installing new technology in community centres in England, which it supports.  It would be very disappointing if a community with which we are particularly concerned could not receive these signals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Henry for her kind remarks.  It is a pleasure to be able to present such programmes for the Irish abroad.  Senator Henry&rsquo;s points about how RTE presents the image of Ireland abroad are extremely significant.  Now that it is being given the legal vehicle to present Ireland abroad, through radio programmes, it has an added responsibility because it is no longer broadcasting only to a domestic audience.  As a child I tuned into the overseas services of a myriad radio stations from Radio Monaco to Radio Moscow, to the extent that people thought I was becoming a Communist.</P>
        <P>The BBC overseas service is a benchmark radio service.  While it does not overtly present the British Government&rsquo;s line because it has a reputation for objectivity in its news reporting, it presents the image of the United Kingdom internationally.  I hope that the Minister, because of his overarching role in policy-making, will convey to RTE that it is not only a matter of technology or of the fact that it has a remit to transmit programmes abroad but that it is a challenge.  I am pleased to hear the Minister say that RTE has <Col N="1872"/>responded enthusiastically to this new mandate.  I hope it will rise to the challenge as it has done in the past, by presenting innovative and interesting programmes not just for the Irish abroad but for the international radio audience it will gain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain why it was not necessary to mention 2FM and Lyric FM in the Bill? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is well made and RTE should bear it in mind not only because it is going to broadcast specifically to Irish or other communities abroad.  While criticism is good, and it is important in a democracy that journalists are vigilant, to constantly harp on the negative conveys an unbalanced view of Ireland today.  I take the point that RTE should be conscious of the image it conveys. </P>
        <P>It may not be popular to make comparisons with our friends across the water but the BBC has high broadcasting standards.  RTE has matched those, probably because it competes with the BBC.  We should acknowledge that, although it may not be popular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>RTE has increasingly taken on that national responsibility in regard to internal issues, not necessarily political ones.  It is increasingly assuming responsibility in certain areas and there are times when it could play a leadership role on particular issues.  There is no need for it to be party political, Government-oriented, etc., in this regard.  As an example, I wish to cite some of the special reports the station has produced in respect of road safety.  These reports have highlighted an important issue.  Another issue about which everyone is talking and which will become even more important and central to politics is that of climate change and the need to educate people in that regard.  There are matters of this nature in respect of which RTE can play a role, without being obliged to stray into the area of party politics.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Henry&rsquo;s related point regarding broadcasting to the Irish community abroad.  In that context, others will be watching when this service commences and this will be a wonderful opportunity to highlight what is happening in today&rsquo;s modern and vibrant Ireland to people other than those whose roots are here and who are aware of the nature of our culture.  The new service will serve a useful purpose in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry also inquired about 2FM and Lyric FM.  I stand open to correction by my officials but I understand that because they are RTE stations, they are covered by the reference to RTE and do not need to be specifically mentioned.  If I am wrong, however, I will correct the position later.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, subsection (1), line 17, after &ldquo;1960&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;and to ensure as far as practicable that Irish broadcasting services are readily accessible on the electronic programme guide&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 4 is central to the Bill in that it sets out the additional functions of the commission.  The issue to which I wish to refer is that involving multiplexes.  One of the matters that has arisen in discussions on the Bill is that relating to the electronic programming guide, EPG.  Amendment No. 26 is designed to ensure that an additional function of the commission would be to ensure &ldquo;that Irish broadcasting services are readily accessible on the electronic programming guide&rdquo;.  The Minister and those who are members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be aware that those involved with Channel 6 have raised this issue because the station has been assigned a position that is extremely low down on the electronic programming guide.</P>
        <P>This is an important matter.  I do not have a satellite or multichannel system in my house.  I have little enough time available to me to spend it watching television.  I am aware, however, of how the system relating to satellite channels works.  Although the channel menu is extremely well set out and provides people with an idea of what is on and what will follow, the order in which the many channels appear on this menu is very important.  Ireland is a small country and it is important our national stations should appear high up on the menu to facilitate Irish viewers.  I accept an agreement is in existence between Sky and RTE to the effect that RTE 1, TV3, etc., are easily seen and accessible on the menu.  However, those at Channel 6 are extremely agitated by the fact that the station is effectively invisible on the electronic programming guide that is available at present.  I tabled this amendment to add to the list of responsibilities and duties of the BCI, when digital is rolled out and when the Irish DTT system is in place, that it should ensure Irish stations are easily accessible and seen on the electronic programming guide.</P>
        <P>It is important for members of the community to have instant access to their preferred sources of information.  It is also important that Irish channels appear high up on the electronic programming guide.  After all, it is difficult enough to compete with the increasing number of channels that are becoming available.  The control of the EPG is an important issue.  That is why the commission should have a particular responsibility in this regard.</P><Col N="1874"/>
        <P>The amendment was framed in a way designed to keep matters straightforward and simple.  I hope the Minister will note the use of the phrase &ldquo;to ensure as far as practicable that Irish broadcasting services are readily accessible on the electronic programme guide&rdquo;.  I hope, therefore, that it will be possible for him to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support amendment No. 26.  I wish to declare an interest in that I have a small investment in Channel 6 and I know how frustrated those in charge of the station are regarding the fact that it was assigned channel 223 on the electronic programming guide on Monday last.  If we are governed by the marketplace and by what customers want, I presume those responsible for making a decision in this regard will come to the conclusion that Irish audiences will want Irish stations to be placed near the top of the EPG in order that they will not be required to travel as far as channel 223.  I support Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment because it would be of value that customers should be able to readily access that which they seek.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the amendment.  I had not identified the necessity in this regard because I had taken it for granted Irish channels would appear near the top of the guide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree this is an extremely important matter.  That is why it is being dealt with in the Bill and in amendment No. 36.  I am sure RTE, as a public service, will show a clip on this evening&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; of somebody saying that Channel 6 can be found on channel 223 of the electronic programming guide.  I was not aware of that.  I sought out Channel 6 but I became fed up trawling through the various other channels.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment is not needed because of the specifics of the legislation.  The difficulty regarding the existing satellite system is that it falls outside of Irish regulation and, as such, we have no control over it.  The current position obtains as a result of grace and favour on the part of Sky.  We should acknowledge what Sky has done in this regard and its actions made commercial sense.  Cable and DTT will come under Irish regulation and, therefore, this Bill, combined with the 2001 Act, will mean the EPGs relating to the cable and DTT networks will give priority to Irish stations.  There will be no need to use terms such as &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; because it will be specifically stated.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 36 to section 9 involves a restating of paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).  While the restatements are not substantial in nature and while the fundamental meanings are not being changed, the word &ldquo;continued&rdquo; is used in the amendment.  This is the case in order that the BCI can ensure multiplex providers will provide ongoing content and do not reduce it.  The <Col N="1875"/>amendment also improves the drafting of paragraph (<i>c</i>).  An operator that maintains a multiplex on a particular basis must maintain it at the initial level and cannot reduce its content.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 36 will change the provisions in paragraph (<i>d</i>) and stipulate that the BCI must consider issues around multiplex reception and compatibility across multiplexes.  It is vital that all the television multiplexes in an area, including the RTE multiplex, can be seen on the one set-top box.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, must seek to ensure that applicants take that into consideration in their applications.</P>
        <P>It is also important that viewers can keep themselves informed of services across all the multiplexes in an organised and coherent way.  Viewers do that through a menu or the electronic programme guide, EPG.  These can be produced locally and automatically in the set-top box or created and transmitted to viewers in a controlled fashion over an overriding EPG.  The provisions in paragraph (<i>d</i>) will now ensure both types of EPG must be taken into consideration by multiplex applicants and by the BCI when it is judging the application submitted.</P>
        <P>Section 16 of the Broadcasting Act 2001 contains further conditions to ensure the priority of Irish broadcasting services on EPGs.  This amendment Bill also proposes, in section 13, to apply section 16 of the 2001 Act to the DTT framework proposed.  We are pulling three different Acts into place.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 26 on the positioning of Irish broadcasting services and the electronic programme guides, I ask Senators to examine section 13 of the Bill.  It provides that under section 16 of the 2001 Act relating to the electronic programming guides for existing broadcasting services, that will now apply to DTT services.  That is not clear from the amendment Bill because one must refer to two other Bills.  The existing provisions under section 16(5) of the 2001 Act remain, that is, that any EPG produced under this section may be easily used by members of the public to access the programme schedules of Irish broadcasting services.  We do not even use the phrase &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  It is important that it happens.  It is already stipulated in legislation and we are just bringing it forward.  That ensures that Irish broadcasting services will be in prominent positions.  Since that provision already exists, Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment is not necessary.  The principle is an important one and it was important to include it in the Bill.</P>

        </Speaker><P>Government amendment No. 27:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(4) It shall be a duty of the Commission to endeavour to arrange, as a matter of priority, for the establishment, maintenance and operation of three national television multiplexes, which multiplexes, in so far as it is reasonably practicable, shall be capable of being transmitted by digital terrestrial means to the whole community in the State.&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 27 to section 4 and amendments Nos. 33 to 35, inclusive, to section 8 should be considered together.  The aim of the amendments is to emphasise the importance of the BCI moving quickly to contract with applicants for national television multiplexes.  The BCI will be obliged to consider DTT as a priority.</P>
        <P>A key issue is ensuring a degree of coherence in timing around the RTE roll-out of its DTT multiplex, and the separate DTT multiplex is to be licensed by the BCI.  While BCI may in due course consider regional or local television multiplexes, it is important that these first multiplexes give significant national coverage, taking into consideration the commercial realities.</P>
        <P>The proposed Government amendments address the issues raised by Senators O&rsquo;Meara, Ryan, McDowell, Tuffy and McCarthy in their amendment No. 35.  I accept fully the spirit of the amendment but I propose amendments Nos. 27, 33 and 34 to achieve the same objective in a manner that is in keeping with the structure of the Bill.  For that reason I cannot accept amendment No. 35.  It is another case of where we are all trying to achieve the same objective and I believe we can do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s amendment appears to meet our concerns.  I agree with the Minister that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  It is important that the BCI moves quickly to arrange for the establishment of the multiplexes.</P><Col N="1877"/>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify one point?  His amendment No. 27 states that it will be the duty of the commission to arrange for the establishment etc. of three national multiplexes.  Does the Minster see that happening simultaneously or one after the other?  That is an important point.  My understanding is that there is no reason the BCI could not roll out two simultaneously, which might meet some of our concerns regarding a point we have not yet discussed, namely, free-to-air access, especially of British channels currently available free to air on the east coast.  That is in the context of the availability of those channels which will no longer be available when the analogue system ends.  Will the Minister clarify that point?  I accept that the amendment meets our concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>On the free-to-air British channels that are easily received in most areas of the country, will one of these multiplexes take care of them?  I do not suppose the Minister is in a position to force them to do so but I would have thought that was important.  Will there be any competition among the various groups that will set up these multiplexes so that we will know what each is offering?</P>
        <P>I scarcely dare mention this but is there any problem about political agreement on this issue?  I am aware it is all part of the Good Friday Agreement under which we will all have access to each other&rsquo;s television and radio stations and so on but in the past, before the Good Friday Agreement, when I brought up accessibility of the RTE stations in areas of Northern Ireland where there was no overspill, I was told there was a problem getting agreement for rebroadcasting in such areas.  I presume it can be taken there is political agreement on all this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I had intended waiting until the debate on the section to raise Senator Henry&rsquo;s important point.  In light of what is included as part of these amendments, section 4(4)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;any television broadcasting service in Northern Ireland that is notified to the Commission by the Minister, being a service that is receivable throughout the whole of Northern Ireland and is provided by terrestrial means&rdquo;.  All of us who have been following this issue are aware that there is some resistance on the British side to allowing access to RTE television within Northern Ireland.  I understand, and perhaps the Minister will confirm this, that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement it was agreed by both sides that TG4 should be accessible, especially in parts of Belfast where the signal is not readily available.  It is interesting that as it was seen as an Irish language channel and had a cultural dimension, there was no difficulty in it being broadcast there.  Is it possible in the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with his British counterpart that consideration might be given to amending the BBC&rsquo;s charter to legally permit the transmission of BBC Northern Ireland across the island of <Col N="1878"/>Ireland?  A reciprocal arrangement could be then introduced whereby RTE television would also be likewise transmitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not realise Senator Mooney&rsquo;s suggestion could be a potential solution to the problem.  A cousin of mine who lives in Newcastle, County Down, regularly contacts me to express her frustration that although the town is close to the Border, she cannot receive RTE.  It may be due to the physical proximity of the Mourne Mountains or the Cooley Mountains.  The various solutions proposed by Senators Mooney and Henry deserve attention.  There must be a strong body of people in Northern Ireland who would like to participate in an all-Ireland television station.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether the establishment of the national multiplexes will happen simultaneously or sequentially, is a matter for the BCI.  My preferred option is for the BCI to run the competition for all three national multiplexes simultaneously, as it would bring coherence to the process.  Hopefully, there will be more than three consortia competing in the process.   However, I believe that even before that stage is reached, there may be much competition among the various consortia to get the best channel combinations for their proposed multiplexes.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement referred specifically to TG4.  The station is available in Northern Ireland and its transmitter on the Divis Mountain was switched on some time ago.  RTE 1 and RTE 2 are available in Border areas by overspill only, as are UTV and BBC.  It is not a matter of political will or agreement in making these channels available on either side of the Irish Sea or North and South.  Serious questions concerning copyright have given rise to difficulties.  If RTE were to transmit to the UK, obviously its copyright fees would increase substantially.  There have been discussions between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs with their UK counterparts in working out an arrangement in this regard.</P>
        <P>The introduction of DTT will assist transmission of the various channels.  If a consortia can convince the BBC to be broadcast on its multiplex, everyone in Ireland will be guaranteed to receive it.  Likewise for RTE in Northern Ireland.  There is a commercial interest in this.  The switch-off of analogue transmission will end the overspill of BBC, HTV and UTV into this jurisdiction.  There is, however, an audience for these channels, of which those consortia setting up multiplexes will be only be too conscious.  In turn, they will want their multiplexes to carry these channels.</P>
        <P>I do not believe it has reached the level of amending the BBC&rsquo;s charter.  The copyright aspect is the more difficult one.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1879"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much competition between satellite, terrestrial and cable broadcast providers.  On Second Stage, all Members welcomed the necessity to switch from analogue transmission to DTT.  However, commercial concerns exist about the provision of the DTT platform and to what degree it could impact on the other commercial operators in this field if State funding were provided.  Will the Minister outline his thoughts on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the situation.  Will the provision of a multiplex broadcasting to the UK have to address copyright issues?  It is accepted there will be no re-broadcast of current RTE television services because of these rights issues.  American soap operas, movies, sporting events broadcast on RTE have attached rights to them.  It will be a challenge as to the mix of programmes that will be broadcast on the multiplex for the UK.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage, I explained one of the main reasons Tara Television failed was because it mainly used archive material from the 1970s and 1980s and did not reflect Irish current affairs.  All involved in this area will know that the Irish community in the UK is anxious to get contemporary news and current affairs programmers from RTE because they want to feel the sense of belonging to the nation.  I agree commercial interests will dictate the number of channels.  The popularity of British channels in Ireland, it has been suggested, has given rise to a form of blackmail.  If one wants British channels one has to sign up to providers such as Sky, NTL and Chorus.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Will the Minister explain the references to Northern Ireland, the BCI and its obligations regarding the provision of services?  Is there some way to address this deficit?  While BBC television is generally available across two-thirds of the country, RTE television is not available in large parts of Northern Ireland.  It is not simply a matter of saying it is available to anybody who wants it.  Ensuring such availability may require additional expenditure and the erection of a 50 ft. aerial.  My concern is that people in the North, particularly members of the Unionist community, are getting an unbalanced view of this part of the island.</P>
        <P>I am passionately committed to the view that RTE should be available across the island, including those large parts of the North where it is not currently available.  The Minister knows more about this than I do because he deals with officials at senior level.  My suggestion of a charter amendment is one possible way forward.  We are essentially at one on this; I know the Minister would also like to see this happen.  All we can do is urge him to continue to make the appropriate representations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all largely <i>ad idem</i> on this issue.  In regard to maximising the reach of RTE television, it would be good if there were co-<Col N="1880"/>operation in both directions, east-west and North-South, in terms of common channels and so on.  This Bill facilitates such developments by providing a framework under which they are attainable not merely for two thirds of the Republic or one third of the North but on an all-island basis.  This is something we will examine.  I have no doubt from discussions I have had with various people that this is not far from the minds of those who are talking in terms of trying to put together multiplexes.  They will avail of this legislation into the future and will utilise a multiplex on the DTT framework.</P>
        <P>I assure the Senator that I am not dismissing the point he is making.  In regard to the BBC charter, there may be something specific that prohibits the wider availability of its services on a free-to-air basis, just as the legislation prohibited RTE in this regard.  It is not the main hurdle we must overcome, however, and where there is a will there is a way.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane asked about the fact that I used the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; on several occasions in reference to DTT services.  The provision of broadcasting services on a DTT platform is a commercial enterprise.  One of the multiplexes will be free-to-air and will include RTE and the other terrestrial Irish channels.  All other services, however, will be commercial.  Senator Finucane asked specifically about the effects of the DTT platform on other commercial providers.  The answer is that it will represent competition for them.  I cannot answer how effective the competition will be or who will win the battle.  Commercial operators will make decisions on the basis of whether they believe they will get a return.  They will have to vie for their place in the market.</P>
        <P>DTT is something that is mandated.  The reason the EU is so keen for analogue switch-off by 2012 at the latest is all to do with having spectrum available for an entire range of services other than television broadcasting, including telecommunications, emergency services and so on.  I take the view that we should not be totally dependent on the private sector and that public infrastructure should be in place that allows us to provide public service broadcasting on a DTT platform.  Some of the commercial interests may not be best pleased about this, but it is in the national interest that we ensure this is the case.  That is why the Government, with the agreement of all sides in both Houses, brought this section of the Bill forward.  We must take action in this regard sooner rather than later.  These developments will create additional competition for existing providers but they are absolutely necessary in the national interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to co-operation on an east-west basis and across the entire island.  Bearing in mind the Treaty of Rome and EU regulations governing the free movement of labour and services, I contend that the franchise areas operated by Sky Television are anti-Euro<Col N="1881"/>pean and anti-competitive and should be challenged.</P>
        <P>I completely agree with the Minister&rsquo;s point, which I have made myself on many occasions, that we should not be dependent on Sky Television.  I do not understand or support the notion that RTE should be encrypted on Sky.  The opportunities we are missing out on are extraordinary.  The Sky astro satellite has a footprint that stretches from Belmullet to the Balkans and south through most of Spain.  All of that audience is available to us to put forward our message.  Public service channels in small countries such as Cyprus and Malta, for instance, can be tuned into on a free-to-air basis throughout Europe.  One can tune into RTE from any place in Europe but one cannot receive the signal unless one is a Sky customer.</P>
        <P>The Minister said something revolutionary today and it is only fair to recognise that.  It is important that we should not be dependent on the private sector &mdash; in this case, Sky Television.  It would be easy for us to take satellite space on our own and to broadcast our public service channels on exactly the same frequency and geostationary reception area as they are currently assigned by Sky.  An Irish person living in Brussels, Rome, Madrid or the south of France can happily watch Gaelic games or anything else on RTE television so long as they have gone to a shop in Ireland and bought a Sky satellite decoder and card and brought them with them.</P>
        <P>I have had many discussions in recent years with RTE about why the service is encrypted rather then free-to-air.  By putting up a satellite dish anywhere in France, Italy, Spain or the Benelux countries, one can, without being a Sky subscriber, tune into BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, ITV1, ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4, all free-to-air.  RTE, however, cannot be received because it is encrypted.  RTE says the reason it is encrypted is to do with the purchase of programmes and related strictures regarding audience sizes.  I do not accept that explanation.  However, even an arrangement whereby some programmes could be blanked out but news and home-made programmes could be broadcast free-to-air would be a major advance.</P>
        <P>Every group of Irish emigrants in Europe to whom I have spoken raises this issue.  RTE&rsquo;s response is that such people can tune in via the Internet.  Many do so but the service should be available to view free-to-air.  All over Europe, RTE Radio 1 and Radio 2, Lyric FM and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta can be accessed.  T&aacute; siadsan ar f&aacute;il on EPG simply.  Why is this not the case in regard to RTE television services?  The simplest way to facilitate the east-west co-operation to which the Minister referred is to have the RTE signal encrypted on an astro satellite platform so that viewers in Europe do not need to be Sky subscribers to access it.  I ask the Minister to take on board this suggestion and to investigate whether the movement by Sky to create franchise areas in <Col N="1882"/>Europe is anti-European in that it mitigates against the free movement of labour and services.  That is not available.  In terms of our message as a country and an economy, this would be very attractive and something for which we should strive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said in this regard.  It is certainly a novel idea blanking out some of the programmes as one transmits freely across Europe.  It is encrypted on satellite because if it was in the clear, there would be the major copyright issues I mentioned earlier.  I will raise the Senator&rsquo;s point about whether home produced news and current affairs programmes could be free-to-air across Europe to see if it is a possibility.  Part of the reason the BBC can do what it does is that it owns the rights on Freesat.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Senator Quinn but I must leave the House for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will take over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I propose this amendment is that we have a seriously dysfunctional method of collecting our television licence.  The effect of it is to waste a large proportion of the money collected.  That money is lost to broadcasting.  A further effect is that a large and increasing number of people succeed in evading payment of the licence fee altogether.  That creates unfairness and makes life more expensive for the majority of law-abiding people.</P>
        <P>Since the licence fee was first collected in the 1920s, there has been no change in the approach to the manner in which it is collected.  We still collect the licence free in exactly the same way we did more than 80 years ago despite all the changes which have taken place in the meantime.  My amendment proposes that we take a fundamental look at the television licence fee and at how it is collected, and that we substitute our current way of doing things with a more efficient and modern way to achieve our objectives in this area.  We need new thinking by a new set of people who will not carry any of the baggage of the existing players.  We need people who will stand back from the current situation and devise a better way.  I have no doubt a better way can be devised.</P>
        <P>The television licence is a tax.  Any taxation expert will tell one that a primary consideration with every tax is how much it costs to collect it.  The ideal is a tax which, in effect, collects itself.  The ultimate horror is a tax that needs a special, dedicated mechanism to collect it.  It is horrific because that way is always the most expensive way to collect a tax.</P>
        <P>My amendment proposes that before creating a new arrangement for collecting the television licence, we should look around the world to see what lessons can be learned from experience in other countries.  One such country is Cyprus which has a delightfully simple way to collect its television licence.  It is added to everybody&rsquo;s electricity bill each billing period.  In effect, collecting the licence costs virtually nothing.  Compliance is not the issue since people must pay their electricity bill or their power is cut off.</P>
        <P>There is another feature of the Cypriot system which we might consider adopting.  Instead of a fixed amount being collected for the television licence &mdash; in other words, everybody pays the same amount &mdash; they levy a certain proportion of the cost of one&rsquo;s electricity bill.  In that way, they ensure better off people, who presumably spend more on electricity, also pay more for their television licence.  There are attractions to this <Col N="1884"/>approach but it is quite separate to the fundamental characteristic of the Cypriot approach which is to roll together the collection of the television licence and the electricity bill.</P>
        <P>The reason this makes sense is that these days, ownership of a television set is virtually universal.  There is not 100% ownership but I gather it is probably 97%.  That is why we should concentrate on the very few exceptions, namely, the few people who decide not to have a television.  We should make them apply for the exemption from the television levy.  For everybody else, we should assume they have a television and charge them accordingly instead of wasting a large amounts of money on detection vans and on schemes to find those who seek to avoid paying.  The majority of people would greatly prefer a better and more efficient way to collect the television licence because it would make significantly greater funds available to be spent on broadcasting.  In the interests of all those working in the industry, we should push for such an approach.</P>
        <P>I purposely used words such as &ldquo;shall have special regard to&rdquo;.  In other words, I am not saying we have to do this but it is something at which we should look.  There is much validity in this approach.  Having worn an An Post hat in the past, I would be regarded as somebody who is being disloyal to it if it is no longer being given the job and the licence fee is to be added to the electricity bill.  It is not a solution to say it is being done by somebody at present.  If it is not the most efficient way of collecting the licence, we should find a more efficient way to do so.  My amendment is worthy of consideration and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment which is, as usual, a practical and sensible approach to an important issue.  As he quite rightly said, money is being used &mdash; I do not want to say &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; &mdash; collecting the licence fee which is then not available for its initial and most important purpose, namely, public service broadcasting.  It is a worthwhile amendment and I hope the Minister will consider it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>We should listen carefully to Senator Quinn who has decades of experience collecting money very successfully.  It is important we take note of what he says despite the fact I very much enjoy the advertisements on the television where a man is watching a golfer just about to take a putt when the television licence inspector knocks on the door, or where there is some romantic interlude on television when the television licence inspector arrives in.  I support what Senator Quinn said because we are probably expending a lot of money on the small number who do not have television licences.  The simplest way to do this is probably the best way.</P>
        <P>There is the dreadful situation at present where people are being sent to jail for non-payment of fines.  While I know legislation is being brought <Col N="1885"/>forward on this issue, it is a terrible waste of money.  This proposal would get rid of that element.  People are far more likely to pay their electricity bill than their television licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members on the Government side of the House wonder whether Senator Quinn knows more about An Post than do they, given his past experience as its chairman.  Moreover, while the Minister of State will have a view on the underlying text of the amendment, I support the motives behind it.  It is important to realise that the efficient collection of the television licence has a direct impact on television and radio programming as it pertains to RTE.  I understand the split in broadcasting revenue has changed in favour of the commercial side.  This constitutes a danger, because the original concept was that public service broadcasting effectively would be funded on a 50:50 basis and that the public would pay a television licence that would largely fund RTE.  Unfortunately, when commercial interests become involved, a form of creeping commercialism takes place that can dilute the public service concept.  This is particularly true in the media, as Members will have witnessed in other areas.</P>
        <P>Public service broadcasting is coming under increasing threat across Europe and anything that will improve the efficient collection of television licence fees is to be welcomed.  However, I am uncertain whether this suggestion is the correct approach to take.  Members on the Government benches have been considering the Cypriot example, which makes use of the electricity bill.  What happens if someone has a private generator, if someone wants to opt out, or, human nature being what it is, if someone pirates electricity from others?  In addition, were this method to be used, it would be necessary to consider refusals to pay licence fees on the basis of not having a television set.  However, these are only minor quibbles and I do not wish to detract from the highly measured approach adopted by Senator Quinn while tabling this amendment before the House.</P>

	<P>While I share the concern expressed by Senator Quinn and other Members to the effect that the collection of television licence fees should be efficient and effective, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  The issue of the television licence fee and the manner in which it is collected is being reviewed actively in the context of the draft general scheme of the forthcoming broadcasting Bill.  As the Senator is probably aware, the draft general scheme has been submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for public consultation under the e-consultation initiative.  I understand there has been considerable comment during the course of the consultation process on the basis for the tele<Col N="1886"/>vision licence fee, its collection and whether suitable alternatives exist.  The Government proposes to bring forward legislative proposals in respect of this issue in light of the outcome of the e-consultation process.</P>
        <P>As for the issues raised by Members, a variety of mechanisms are used to fund public service broadcasting.  Most of northern Europe avails of television licences.  The Netherlands applies a special levy on income tax, France levies a household tax, Spain and Flanders provide direct Exchequer funding while Greece, Turkey and Cyprus avail of television licences.  The United Kingdom, which is most similar to Ireland, recently reviewed the concept of the television licence and decided that while it is not a perfect system, no immediate alternative exists.  The British authorities will review the issue in 2012.</P>
        <P>As the Government is considering this issue at present in the context of the wider broadcasting Bill, on which consultation is under way, this matter is not appropriate to the Bill under consideration.  However, I share the Members&rsquo; sentiments and I expect the matter will be dealt with more effectively when the forthcoming broadcasting Bill comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his consideration.  I did not necessarily expect that the amendment would be accepted at this time.  However, it should be noted that the amendment did not outline what should be done.  It suggested the commission should have regard to the manner in which it is done.  I feel frustrated when I encounter surmountable inefficiencies and I believe this to be an inefficient method of collecting television licence fees.</P>
        <P>Last year, I was contacted by a highly annoyed individual, who is quite anti-television and does not possess a set.  However, he had received a letter from An Post that accused him of failing to pay his licence fee.  I contacted An Post about the matter and its representative explained to me that since so few people did not have television sets, the organisation deemed it acceptable to assume that everyone has one.  I assume An Post is obliged to apologise to the few who do not &mdash; although I did not hear an apology.  It assumed that everyone has a television set and I understand it was correct in approximately 97% or 98% of cases.  However, the remaining 2% to 3%, for whom this was incorrect, were upset because they had been accused of failing to pay their television licences.</P>
        <P>I mention this because this method appears to be inefficient and other ways may be better.  The method used in Cyprus impressed me.  While I understand the Minister&rsquo;s methods differ from those operating in other countries, I suggest the Cypriot method should be included and put into the melting pot in whatever Bill is tabled by the Government to consider the best method of collecting the fee.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (2), between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) the principal British television broadcasting services which are free to air as of the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Reference has already been made to this issue in the context of previous amendments.  It pertains to the question arising from the fact that at present, British television stations and services are available free to air to a substantial part of Ireland.  The figure for the number of households that receive British broadcasting services at present due to what is known as the spill-over on the analogue service varies and may be open to dispute.  However, the fact remains that a substantial proportion of Ireland receives the British channels free to air at present and has done so for many years.</P>
        <P>Earlier, the Minister stated that the first multiplex roll-out would maintain the Irish stations on a free to air basis.  This has always been my understanding and is as it should be.  However, like me the Minister is a politician and I am sure he is aware that in the past, this issue has been contentious.  I refer to the deflector issue.  People have been receiving additional services and this issue could become contentious when the analogue service is switched off and its digital replacement is introduced.  I doubt whether many people are aware at present that in future, they will be obliged to pay for something that is now free.  Members are aware of what people are like when it comes to such matters.</P>
        <P>While I recognise the Minister&rsquo;s remarks in respect of copyright and so on, an opportunity is <Col N="1889"/>available to make what is currently available on the east coast available on a nationwide basis.  Previously, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated three multiplexes are planned and in their roll-out, the British services available free-to-air on the east coast will become free to air in the rest of the country.  I accept issues may arise and the reason I tabled the amendment is to tease out this important matter and hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Meara.  This is an important issue.  We discussed it earlier and we do not need to go through it again.  However, we did not discuss the financial cost.  I presume an additional cost will arise if these channels are on one of the multiplexes which will charge.  Senator O&rsquo;Meara makes a good point in that the entire project will not be a success if those who now receive these channels for free find they must pay for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is anticipated the UK overspill will be reduced from 2008 when the analogue switch-off is planned.  However, UK services are already available to Irish viewers on cable, satellite and MMDS services.  While I recognise the concerns of Senators about the availability of UK broadcasting services to Irish households, my primary aim is to create a legislative framework for Irish broadcasting services.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment proposed.</P>
        <P>I expect that with the full roll-out of DTT services, multiplex operators will offer UK TV services given the level of demand which exists in the Irish market.  In addition, while UK analogue services will be switched off from 2008, a degree of UK digital spillover may remain available to Irish viewers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State expand on his final sentence regarding future UK digital spillover?  To whom will the spillover be available and where?  Will the current inequality between one set of viewers and another continue?  The intention of my amendment is to give everybody equal access to what many people, but not everybody, has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised some spillover will occur, especially in Border areas, but not as much as happens at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be even worse than the present situation.  I understood spillover would end when analogue was switched off.  However, it seems the inequality will continue.  I can neither agree with the Minister of State nor withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the British have decided to switch off and it is outside our control.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1890"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that.  RTE will have the first multiplex.  However, the BCI will roll out the other multiplexes which we discussed at some length.  The BCI should be required to ensure the British channels available free-to-air to a substantial part of the country will continue to remain free-to-air to them and, on a more equitable basis, be free-to-air to everyone in the country.  I did not hear a good reason not to do so.</P>
        <P>Previously, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources discussed copyright issues.  If they must be explored, let us explore them.  I did not hear a solid reason in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to reject my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated, the Irish public has long enjoyed the happy accident of the overspill of UK analogue services.  The UK will switch off these services over the next five years.  This has nothing to do with the roll-out of Irish DTT.  It is simply the actions of the UK authorities in planning for their spectrum use.  Some DTT overspill is likely to be available in the future.  However, enacting this legislation will create a framework for a multichannel framework on DTT in Ireland.</P>

	<P>This is a very important issue.  I will re-submit the amendment on Report Stage and on that basis, I withdraw the amendment and ask the Minister of State to consider this important point.  What the Minister of State is stating to the public, especially those with free-to-air access to British broadcasting services, is the Government is happy for that access to go and for people to pay for it.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash102"/>endorses this plan as a costed seven-year blueprint to transform Ireland and create a better quality of life for all.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  His late father would have been proud because he produced the first national development plan with his colleagues in Government in the late 1980s.  He placed tremendous emphasis on public investment.  I regret that there is an amendment to the motion.  That practically everyone outside the House has welcomed the plan raises a doubt about the degree of commitment of parties opposite to implementing the plan should they be in Government.</P>
        <P>The figure of &euro;184 billion is a record.  It is of historic significance that the European funding element, so important in previous plans, is negligible at &euro;3 billion.  In the plan&rsquo;s foreword, the Minister for Finance, who I gather will be in the House later, refers to the country reversing its history and consolidating its progress.  As has been observed by a number of commentators, our healthy public finances and the fact we are not facing a significant ageing population provide us with a window of opportunity to address rapidly some of the infrastructural and service sector deficits.</P>
        <P>The previous plan accompanied an average annual economic growth of more than 5% and was consistent with a financial surplus in every year except 2002 and a reduced gross Government debt of 25%.  If one takes account of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the latter figure is 15%.</P>
        <P>This plan has four priorities, namely, tackling infrastructural bottlenecks, providing necessary educational skills, providing high-value employment and redistributing wealth to underpin social inclusion.  The &euro;33 billion investment in transport is an important element.  A sum of &euro;13 billion will be invested in public transport, which is relevant to competitiveness.  For example, roads will be completed.  We have the geographical advantage of being a compact island and nowhere is too far from anywhere else.  When the roads are in place, <Col N="1894"/>we will be an attractive place from which to do business.</P>
        <P>I would have liked more to be spent on non-national roads, given the great deal of work to be done in that respect, but it is not possible to do everything at once.  There is greater emphasis on important regional roads connecting some of the main towns and funding for the rural transport initiative, aspects of which my parliamentary party discussed last night.</P>
        <P>Contrary to the situation obtaining even ten years ago, emphasis has been placed on public transport, which is proper.  No one can accuse the Government of not investing substantial money in that sector.  However, I have reservations.  Were the rainbow Government to include a green element &mdash; unfortunately, the Green Party is not represented in the House &mdash; that element would want to cut roads investment substantially, with which we would not agree.  I would be surprised if other parties agreed.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;concerning the parties&rsquo; commitment to decentralisation, some projects of which are advanced.  There is an emphasis on the diversification of the rural economy, where there are already good schemes in operation, such as RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and REPS.  It makes the point that Ireland is still a comparatively rural country, with 40% of the population living in the countryside.  I commented yesterday on the Order of Business on the notion of dropping a Department <Col N="1895"/>with responsibility for agriculture and rural development, an utterly absurd idea.</P>
        <P>Concern was expressed recently about value for money.  Clear figures are given which show cost inflation has been reduced from 12% to<?oasys _jy ?>4%.  We should not get lectures on value for money from a party that suggested without any costing that its manifesto would include a commitment to a second Dublin airport somewhere in the middle of the countryside.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as aid for industry is concerned, I welcome the weighting of support in favour of the less economically forward regions, not just the BMW region but the south east as well.</P>
        <P>The chapter on all-island co-operation is an innovative feature of the plan.  It builds on earlier initiatives, some of which the Leader was involved with when she was Minister for Public Enterprise, such as the City of Derry Airport and the all-island energy policy.  It is appropriate and all sides of the House should defend it even if some of the money will be spent north of the Border.  It is one of the fruits of the peace process and the knitting together of the island economy.  Much of this will be achieved through the North-South bodies, where the tourism body has been already an outstanding success.</P>
        <P>The plan pays attention to environmental sustainability, something that has been highlighted in various reports in recent times.  We have made progress in this area, such as the increase in <Col N="1896"/>recycling from 9% in 1998, a minimal figure, to 35% three years ago.  Progress is being made but more should be done, such as investment in water schemes, as I mentioned on the Order of Business this morning.</P>
        <P>I have reservations about the large-scale deployment of wind energy when dealing with alternative energies.  Caution is needed because this depends on the siting of such facilities and communities must be included in the process.  We cannot impose wind farms on areas where local communities do not want them.</P>
        <P>I welcome the &euro;126 million to be spent on the islands, a sum that will achieve a great deal for the communities living on them.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to go into detail on every aspect of the plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not much detail in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The &euro;3.5 billion to build up world class research is of great importance.  We have made huge strides in the past ten years where instead of having derivative, applied and second hand research, we are carrying out cutting edge research ourselves.</P>
        <P>I welcome the further investment in education and the emphasis on science and physical education.  Obviously it is right to target resources to achieve a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in primary schools but I am a universalist and believe we should strive to provide that for all classes.  The targets in the plan have the colour of Department of Finance thinking.  It is socially progressive if it is a first step but we should bring up the level across the board because no area is more important than education.  I also welcome the 50,000 extra child care places and the plan for preschool places for those who need them.</P>
        <P>The plan recognises that in the health services there is a strong social class gradient that must be tackled.  Health and survival rates fall according to a person&rsquo;s position on the social scale.  That is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I welcome the &euro;1 billion for the access programme for the arts and another &euro;1 billion for sports facilities.  This is an excellent plan that should act as a foundation for the work of the next Government and I am confident it will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s motion.  I will speak now because I may not get in if I do not &mdash; there are eager cubs on the other side of the House. That is a nice word, cubs, in case they run to the radio about some word I said.</P>
        <P>I welcome this motion and the opportunity to speak in favour of the national development plan.  So often we talk about decisions made on the spur of the moment or planned on the back of an envelope.  This plan is well laid out and couched and it covers every area of life.  It is a fine piece of work drafted by eminent civil servants but with a strong political flavour to it.  That is what is so <Col N="1897"/>good about it, it is the best of the mix of political leadership and Civil Service attention to detail.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, because this plan is typical of his work.  He goes to do a job and he does it excellently and without any carry on.  This is a plan of which we can all be proud and I hope Opposition and Government both support it.  If the unforeseen were to happen and the Government change, I have no doubt the Opposition&rsquo;s criticisms would be replaced by a strong espousal of the NDP.  However, I will not continue in that regard because I do not talk about events which will never happen.  The Government will be re-elected.  It is in the spirit of having a plan that Departments understand what they must do and are compelled to take ownership of their policies.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the gateways innovation fund, in which regard it has been immensely helpful that we are dealing with a Minister from the midlands.  Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar, or ATM, which is an unfortunate acronym, are gateway link towns.  The spatial strategy has been criticised as not being implemented but the NDP provides for the establishment of a gateways innovation fund which will operate on the basis of a lead local authority, which will be Westmeath County Council in the ATM area.  Submissions will be invited from projects within the area which, for example, persuade people to change from private to public transport.  A very good railway project team has been established, of which I am a member, to bid for part of the &euro;300 million made available over the first two years of the fund.  We met the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, last week and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, a few weeks ago.  Next week, we will meet the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, under whose aegis a committee will be established to manage the fund.</P>
        <P>The fund is tailor-made for the restoration of the Athlone to Mullingar railway.  In case any doubt should arise, this line was abandoned in mid-1986 by a certain former Minister for Transport.  As he has since passed away, I do not wish to pass comment on him other than to say he was also critical of Knock Airport.  The then Taoiseach, Mr. Garret FitzGerald, produced a document entitled backwards into reality &mdash; I apologise &mdash; Building on Reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Haughey implemented that report when he returned to Government, after a series of U-turns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>During his term in office, the Minister in question abandoned a number of railway lines, one of which was the Athlone to Mullingar line.  I have researched the matter, so I know what I am talking about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Todd Andrews did something similar to the Harcourt Street line.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1898"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was good that the Minister abandoned the line because, if he had closed it, we would not now be able to restore it.  An opportunity now beckons for the line, although it needs upgrading and new signalling and Moate needs a new station and platform.  I am glad we have the chance to put our best foot forward by seeking a sizeable portion of the gateways innovation fund.  The fund is a creative and imaginative idea and I have no doubt the Minister for Finance had a direct hand in its formulation.</P>
        <P>What I am about to say is somewhat painful.  It appears that some from the Opposition who were on the project team want to cast doubts on the project and, instead of rolling up their sleeves, are saying it will never happen.  They are asking why they were not handed the money but I can only imagine the howls of outrage from those who seek properly designed projects if money were simply handed out.  They would ask where was the accountability or transparency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be more accountability if the money were handed out.  However, nobody suggested that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what they are doing.  Members of the Opposition wish the project does not happen so that they will have a stick with which to beat me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not happened; that is the problem.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Even when Ministers seek projects from them, they say it is not in the writing.  That is how they speak and I wish the newspapers would report them in that manner.  Fortunately, I do not speak like that.  I appeal to those in the Opposition who wish to receive money without working, that is, by developing a well-documented plan, which we have done, to put their best foot forward and engage with the different Ministers.  We have already started on that odyssey which will be a wonderful one.</P>
        <P>If the Leas-Chathaoirleach is good, I may invite him to join me on the restored Athlone to Mullingar railway line.  He would make a nice companion on such a journey.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will meet him in Moate, waving a flag to herald his visit.  I am happy that the railway line is in the NDP and am appreciative of the work done on it by the Minister for Finance.  This is positive news, so begone with the <Col N="1899"/>begrudgers.  The NDP is a well-thought plan which awaits implementation by Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash102"/>&ldquo;notes the failure to deliver many of the promises outlined in the National Development Plan 2000-2006;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash102"/>notes the failure to deliver balanced regional development throughout the country;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash102"/>abhors the scandalous waste of public money in many public infrastructure projects; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash102"/>calls on the Government to put in place a comprehensive system of checks and balances to ensure project delivery, reduce waste and promote value for money in the construction of public infrastructure projects.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  I hope he will be returned to the Opposition benches after the next general election but nonetheless wish him well during his brief tenure as Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I am surprised by the comments made by certain Members on the Government side.  I am especially perplexed that Senator Mansergh does not see the need for the Opposition to table an amendment.  If ever a Government plan deserved scrutiny, surely it is the spending of &euro;184 billion proposed in the NDP.  This Opposition amendment, which I am delighted to move, merely sets out the areas which deserve closest scrutiny.</P>
        <P>I wonder about Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s comments on the Opposition&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the NDP.  Given that the Government failed to implement the previous plan, I question its commitment in implementing this one.  The Leader was correct in saying that the NDP is good news, just as most fairy tales involve good news.  However, I have a strange fear that, like most fairy tales, parts of this plan will not come true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator fears the plan will be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>A body of opinion among economic analysts cautions that the NDP may give rise to inflationary problems.  It is legitimate for Opposition Members and the public to question the Government&rsquo;s ability to deliver.  Senator Mansergh and others will be familiar with the many areas of the last plan which were not delivered, such as the inter-urban routes which were originally estimated to cost &euro;5.6 billion but are now projected at &euro;16 billion, even though less <Col N="1900"/>than 50% of the work that should have been completed has been carried out.</P>
        <P>Regional development probably represents the biggest under spend in the last national development plan.  Different speakers have committed themselves to regional development.  Senator Mansergh mentioned decentralisation as part of regional development.  It is ironic that he should mention a plan that three years ago the Government proposed would be completed by now with 10,000 people decentralised.  Only 700 people have been decentralised at a time when it was supposed to have been finished.  Some 700 others who were already working outside Dublin are covered by the plan, but they cannot be included.  It is understandable for Opposition spokespersons to raise the decentralisation programme, on which the Government parties have failed even more miserably than they have on most of the other matters they have failed to deliver in course of their ten years in office.</P>
        <P>I spoke about regional development.  Under the last national development plan the Government promised to spend more than &euro;4 billion in the BMW region.  However, only 60% of the allocated funding, &euro;2.4 billion, was spent under the last national development plan.  The Government promised to spend &euro;656 million on e-commerce and communications measures in the last national development plan.  However, only 15% of what it announced, &euro;100 million, was spent.  The Government promised to spend &euro;446 million on the child care programme.  By the end of 2005 it had only spent &euro;273 million, 60% of what it committed in the last national development plan.</P>
        <P>In the last national development plan the Government promised to spend &euro;1.2 billion on back to education initiatives and only spent &euro;600 million, half of what was announced.  In the area of health, the Government promised to spend &euro;1.3 billion on non-acute continuing care, but has spent only &euro;844 million, 65% of what should have been delivered.  The Government only spent 35% of the resources allocated in the last national development plan to water management and rehabilitation initiatives including water conservation programmes.  The rural water investment scheme was also under-funded with only 54% of the original target realised.</P>
        <P>The mismatch between the headline figure announced by the Government and what was delivered is stark and raises legitimate questions.  In following the last national development plan it is reasonable to suggest that the systems are not in place to see the plan implemented as the Government has proposed.  Today&rsquo;s national newspapers reported that the Government had spent more than &euro;360,000 on the launch of the development plan.  This included the cost of media presentations, publications and the printing of the document itself.  That is a staggering amount and it could have been done for considerably less.</P><Col N="1901"/>
        <P>The biggest failure in the last national development plan was in the area of broadband delivery.  The Minister responding at the end of the debate should outline what new scheme the Government proposes to put in place now that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has officially dropped the rural broadband scheme that was in place.  While I accept it was not delivering, we now have no scheme.  Countless small businesses, mainly in rural Ireland, will face serious difficulties in the next few years if no scheme is initiated in the area of broadband.</P>
        <P>It is clear that there is a crisis of confidence.  Despite the huge investment of taxpayers&rsquo; money, improvements in infrastructure have been too slow, too limited and too costly.  The failure to deliver is the legacy of a decade of project mismanagement and waste, and a decade of missed opportunity.  It is the legacy of Government failures and policy inconsistencies in a number of areas.  The Taoiseach has shown a lack of strategic vision and clear prioritisation.  There has been a lack of ministerial accountability for project performance.  There has been a lack of reform in the construction sector to increase competition and capacity.  There has been a diversion of scarce construction resources from public infrastructure projects into tax-driven boom projects.  There has been inadequate investment in project management skills in the public sector.  There has been an absence of sophisticated cost-benefit analyses to help project prioritisation.</P>
        <P>There have been last minute politically driven changes in project design and inadequate provision of planning staff for local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la leading to significant delays for major projects.  Yesterday, An Bord Plean&aacute;la postponed a number of decisions across the country for two months because of lack of staff in its operations.  There is poor co-ordination between different State bodies in major infrastructure projects.  We have a defective compulsory purchase order system, which delayed major infrastructure projects.  We have ineffective community consultation on many of those major infrastructure projects in recent years.</P>
        <P>The message Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have sent to the public in the past ten years is clear.  They are saying to the taxpayers: &ldquo;This may be your money, but we have it now and we will spend it as we want to spend it.  We will continue to waste it over the lifetime of the next national development plan&rdquo;.  I have news for Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.  After the general election they will not get the opportunity to continue to waste and mismanage public resources in the next five years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, on his second visit to the House.  When the Government announced he was to become a Minister of State, his appointment was universally <Col N="1902"/>welcomed on all sides of the House, such is his standing in both Houses.</P>
        <P>I am glad Senator Mansergh referred to the airport at Knock.  One of the most positive announcements in recent weeks regarding Knock and the connection between the west and the north west was the announcement of new transatlantic flights from New York to Knock, which were brought about directly as a result of the political intervention by Deputy Perry of Fine Gael.  While his name has not been mentioned, I wish to put it on the record.  Mayor Bloomberg came to Sligo last summer for the commemoration of an historical event.  Out of that visit came the fruitful discussions that led to the announcement made ten days ago.  I welcome that my Fine Gael colleague from Sligo was the catalyst upon which the transatlantic flights between the north west and New York were brought about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a good thing the airport was already there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was rather churlish of Senator Mansergh not to refer to the Deputy in passing.</P>
        <P>As Senator John Paul Phelan has said, much of the new national development plan is very positive in its general scheme of projections for what it plans to achieve in the next seven years in the areas of regional development, infrastructure and particularly in the development of public transport, etc.  However, most commentators now accept that the Government is trying to sell this plan on the basis that its Ministers are competent managers, whereas, as Senator John Paul Phelan rightly said, its whole record is one of utter incompetence.  Some 60% of the previous plan was never implemented and Ministers were responsible for such disasters as the key health project PPARS on which millions of euro were wasted and the e-voting debacle on which &euro;60 million was wasted.  No one takes responsibility for these projects.</P>
        <P>The majority of the people looked at the great press launch of the plan and shrugged it off as of no great consequence.  The people selling themselves as the people to implement the plan have a record of disastrous mismanagement and incompetence in areas such as broadband, delivering interurban routes on budget and the gross under-projection of amounts required for projects in Dublin, for instance the Dublin Port Tunnel, which came in &euro;240 million over budget, and Luas.</P>
        <P>The problem for the Government is that it is regarded as utterly incompetent by its own supporters and Deputies.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is in this dilemma having fired its two magic bullets between the national development plan and the budget because it is utterly incompetent at developing and implementing a plan that it produced.  That is why people are moving away from it.  The Government lacks a sense of responsibility.  The people who waste money are promoted in key Departments.  That would not happen in the private sector.  If any large plc failed to deliver on its seven or five year plan people would take responsibility for that.  That is the key difference between this side of the House and the proposals in our published documents in this area as against the Government record over the past ten years. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not idealise the brilliance of the private sector as Senator Brian Hayes does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I know this hurts Senator Mansergh.  A golden opportunity for regional and national planning was missed in spatial development and decentralisation over the past ten years.  If we are going to create new hubs of economic activity away from the east coast, thereby creating better regional development, it is essential that the Government must select a few areas and concentrate development there to increase capacity and drive economic growth.  The Government however, like a super county council, cannot decide where it wants to put those economic centres.  The former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, said that if he could not develop this by December 2006 he did not deserve to be re-elected.  The Government has implemented 10% of its promise, another gross incompetence. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not quite say that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Many economic consultants in Dublin have said that this plan is based on the tax receipts from the property market continuing into the future.  That will not happen.  No one in the Department of Finance and no serious economic consultancy believes that will continue.  The large tax returns, many of which are driven by the property and construction sector, will not last.  It seems inevitable that if we are serious about this plan we must tackle the tax issue at some stage in the course of the next seven years, no matter who is in Government.</P>
        <P>The Government is not squaring up to this.  The plan is predicated on the rate of growth over the next seven year period staying the same as it is now.  If people are honest they will say that the tax returns will not remain as buoyant as they are now because of our dependence on property and construction.  There must also be a financial commitment to delivering this over the next seven years.  The plan is flawed not in its aspirations but <Col N="1904"/>because of the people in charge whose track record is visible to all.  The people realise that it is time to hand over to new people with new ambitions for this country and a new ability to deliver political responsibility and accountability.  That is the key test of the plan, one on which sadly this Administration has failed miserably in the past ten years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, on his second appearance in the House.  As he can see from the compliments he has received he has support across the House.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the all-island co-operation section of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Since the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998, society in Northern Ireland has been transformed, as have North-South co-operation and east-west relations.  This is thanks in many respects to the exemplary negotiation skills of the Taoiseach.  It is hard to believe the transformation that has taken place on the island.  The national development plan sets out in detail a range of existing and planned North-South projects already agreed with the Northern Ireland Administration and being implemented.  It also sets out for the first time proposals for Irish Government investment in North-South projects and initiatives for mutual benefit.  The Government wishes to agree and implement these with the British Government and a restored Northern Ireland Executive in the period 2007-13.  These projects and initiatives will benefit the entire island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Partition has been the single greatest impediment to balanced economic development across the island of Ireland.  This has left communities along the Border on both sides and in the northwest severely disadvantaged socially and economically.  The North&rsquo;s transport infrastructure, once regarded as being superior to that of the Republic, has not kept pace in recent years.  There is no direct motorway between Belfast and Derry, the two main cities in the Six Counties, and the railway system is seriously under-resourced.</P>
        <P>Due to the existence of the Border infrastructure projects have in the past been built in both the North and the South without regard to the impact in the other jurisdiction or any efficiencies that could be gained from working together.  In this plan there will be economies of scale and co-operation on cross-Border all-island infrastructure development.  The North is only now getting its act together to build a motorway to meet up with the Republic&rsquo;s M1 from Dublin to the Border.  Making decisions on an all-island basis would in many cases be better for the welfare and health of all the people on the island.</P>
        <P>In a dramatic statement in November 2005, Peter Hain, Secretary of State for the North said &ldquo;the economy in the North is not sustainable in the long term&rdquo; and that in future decades, &ldquo;it is <Col N="1905"/>going to be increasingly difficult to look at the economy of Northern Ireland and the South except as a sort of island of Ireland economy&rdquo;.  At the end of last October, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Secretary of State for the North, Peter Hain, published a comprehensive study on the development of an all-Ireland economy.  In their joint introduction to the study, the Ministers said: &ldquo;It makes clear the strong economic imperative driving north-south co-operation ... To be globally competitive we must exploit the opportunities of all island co-operation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>These conclusions by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and Peter Hain are a far cry from the previous back-to-back approach to economic and social development on this island.  Both parts of Ireland are on the cusp of a transition to genuine economic and social co-operation and cohesion which could transform the prospects for peace and prosperity on this island.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in presenting the Government&rsquo;s pre-budget 2007 spending plans, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have an economy that is working and a country that is at work.  From being one of the developed world&rsquo;s worst economies twenty years ago, we now have a model of excellence and a performance which is the envy of much of the developed world.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At a time of unprecedented economic growth in the South, the North has deepened its public sector dependency and reliance on the British Treasury.  The public sector in the North is also the largest employer of university graduates, preventing the private sector from gaining their skills.</P>
        <P>No matter what co-operation goes ahead my mantra remains that there must be a change in the corporation tax in the North.  The current rate of 30% in that jurisdiction seriously inhibits the ability to attract foreign investment.  It is the responsibility of Gordon Brown to be inspired and to make a decision.  He must not be inward-looking and protective towards the union.  The Chancellor must see that, for the benefit of the entire island, there should be a common rate of corporation tax in order that potential investors who are considering investing here will not see the island in terms of North and South but as a total area in which they might invest.  Sir George Quigley, who sponsored my nomination to the Irish Exporters Association, is the main driver for change in this area among business people in the North.  The SDLP is also pressing for change and has suggested a corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Sinn F&eacute;in advocates a rate of 17%.  There is a consensus that change must take place.</P>
        <P>The national development plan is concerned with all-island co-operation.  As a result of the North&rsquo;s 30% corporation tax, Goodbody Stockbrokers estimates that it has lost 20 times the potential investment it could have attracted.  At <Col N="1906"/>our meeting with the SDLP last week, I inquired about how strongly it was pressing in respect of a reduction in the rate of corporation tax.  One of those present asked me if I would accompany them to Downing Street on their next visit to exert pressure on Gordon Brown.  I stated that I would be delighted to do so.  The Government, led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, is not afraid of competition.  We are willing to share and to include the North.  We are not defensive and do not believe that no one else should benefit from a corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  We would be delighted to promote Ireland on an all-island basis.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  I have little to say about the national development plan.  I looked through it and I reckon it involves a great deal of amalgamation of previous plans.  I took home with me the other night the Hanly report, the national spatial strategy and the decentralisation directives and read them to see if I could try to marry them up from a geographical point of view.  It was utterly impossible to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps Members will recall that when they were children, they were frequently given puzzles to try to encourage them to figure out how one would travel from A to B, etc.  The position was similar when I read the reports.  It was unbelievable.</P>
        <P>I feel very bitter about this matter because I was one of the few people in this entire nation who supported the Hanly plan.  Under the decentralisation programme, places which could have been important in the context of Hanly were treated differently.  I do not know what happened to the gateways, spokes and hubs but they have re-emerged in the new national development plan.  Something must be done to encourage joined-up thinking in respect of the geographical aspect.  I do not know if such thinking exists in respect of the economic aspect because I am not an expert in that regard.  From a geographical point of view, I am of the opinion that if one is determined to develop a hospital in an area, one would make it an important part of the infrastructure therein.  The dispute that appears to be ongoing between Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise is unbelievable, especially when one considers that Athlone is a hub.  The entire matter must be given careful consideration from a geographical point of view.</P>
        <P>Decentralisation is a good ideal but I wish it had taken place over a period of 40 years.  I feel <Col N="1907"/>very sorry for all those senior civil servants whose jobs have been moved down the country.  One of these individuals informed me last evening that he actually liked his job and is not quite sure what he is going to be doing from now on.  There are senior civil servants who are in no position to move, who are in jobs they like and who now, through no fault of their own, will be obliged to spend the latter part of their careers in employments for which they may not be suitable.  I regret that because I have a great deal of respect for our Civil Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, of whom we expect big things.  We know that he will take action in respect of everything said during this debate.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on what I regard as the four big surprises in the new national development plan.  The first of these is that the plan, which is far and away the largest ever contemplated in our nation&rsquo;s history, was developed without even the slightest pretence at public consultation.  I recall a lovely seanfhocail that I learned in school, namely, &ldquo;&Eacute;ist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhaidh t&uacute; brad&aacute;n; listen to the sound of the river and you will catch a salmon.&rdquo;  One of the things the Government is obliged to do is listen to what is happening in the world to ensure the fishing is good.  I get the impression that it has not done so.  The new national development plan was conceived &mdash; without public consultation &mdash; within the secret corridors of Government and then brought to the attention of an unsuspecting public at a glitzy launch.  I read in the newspaper that the launch in question cost the taxpayer &euro;340,000.  However, I stand open to correction in this regard.</P>
        <P>What does it say about the state of democracy in Ireland that this phenomenally important project, which will have an impact on the future of every man, woman and child, was not deemed worthy of any input whatever from the people who will be affected by it in the years ahead?  Is the message being put across one which clearly states that the Government knows best and does not need to consult the people about its future?</P>
        <P>That first surprise leads to the second, namely, that this is clearly a plan that is driven by the need to spend enormous sums of money rather than to achieve specific, clearly defined objectives.  My experience of economics and business is that one sets out one&rsquo;s objectives and then decides how best to achieve them.  If the people had been consulted, they would have been asked about the action they wanted the Government to take and about their priorities in respect of making Ireland a better place in which to live and for securing the country&rsquo;s economic future.  Clearly these questions did not drive the formulation of this plan.  Instead of starting out from a list of priorities and agreed national objectives, the <Col N="1908"/>starting point was an enormous pot of money and the challenge of how to allocate it.  When one has such as a vast sum to spend and so many projects clamouring for a share, one is likely to end up pleasing many people.  It is difficult to escape the suspicion that is the real point of the operation.</P>
        <P>Another thing that is likely to happen, which leads me to my third surprise, is that one obtains very bad value for money.  In view of our poor track record with previous national development plans, I would have expected that on this occasion a serious attempt would have been made to apply a sound cost benefit analysis to all the projects within the plan and that there would be a rigorous system of cost management to ensure a reasonable level of value would be delivered.  As far as I can see, this has not happened.  By all accounts, it appears that exactly the same kind of sloppy financial management that served us so badly in the past will again be employed on this occasion.</P>
        <P>The fourth surprise, which is the most disappointing of all, revolves around the sheer lack of imagination that characterises the plan from start to finish.  Despite all its expensive glitziness, this plan is really just more of the same.  One is often minded to look for something different with plans of this nature.  As far as this one goes, however, it appears that an approach has been adopted to the effect that because we are doing well, we should continue to do what we did in the past.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by what Senator Brian Hayes said about the tax issue.  The plan appears to assume that tax will continue to come in, despite the fact that it is very much dependent on the property and construction sector.</P>
        <P>This plan is a programme for throwing even more money in the same direction as previously.  It contains no new ideas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, is leaving the Chamber.  I thank him for what I gather was his second visit to the House.  I suggest to the Minister that there are no new ideas in this plan or major goals to grasp the imagination.  There is no underlying vision to this very expensive plan.  This is a plan devised by people who, regrettably, have no clear idea of where they are going and even less idea of what is needed to bring them where they want to go.</P>
        <P>Those are my four surprises and they add up to what I regard as a lost opportunity.  Unfortunately, it will be many years before the full extent of the opportunities we have lost will become clear to us.  When this plan fails to meet our needs in the years ahead &mdash; I hope I am wrong &mdash; we will only have ourselves to blame for the lack of foresight that allowed this poor excuse for a national development plan to see the light of day.</P>
        <P>There are four unpleasant surprises in the plan that I did not anticipate.  We should have listened to what is happening on the ground and identified the objective we wanted to achieve.  Instead, we told ourselves we had a great deal of money and wondered about the way we would spend it.  Had a cost benefit analysis been done on each of <Col N="1909"/>those, and perhaps the Minister will tell us there was and will explain that to us, we would know that our objective is likely to be achieved with value for money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions thus far to this debate on the national development plan.  I am sorry if Senator Quinn believes this was simply a connection exercise of spending programmes to be put together willy-nilly.  In fact, a long consultation process has been ongoing for the past 12 months, not only with the social partners but with the regional authorities, local authority members and many business groups in the context of the Estimates process and the social partnership programme.  Many representations, ideas and priorities were put forward by various interest groups which the Government had to pull together.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>People talk about the size of the plan at &euro;184 billion but it is a much broader and comprehensive plan in terms of setting out social inclusion objectives as well as simply economic or capital investment programmes.  It is right that we should do so since the vision the Senator talked about that we are trying to bring about is set out in the Towards 2016 document, with all the resonance that provides.  It is an opportunity, over the next ten years, for us to make good some of the historic infrastructural deficits that are with us because we did not have the resources in the past to make those sort of investments.  We can build on the future and on many of the important improvements we now see in the implementing agencies, whether it is the National Roads Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency or the proposed Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
        <P>The Senator talked about a vision but there is a quadrupling of investment in public transport.  When this Government came into office it took over from an Administration whose political colour was such that one would expect some commitment to public transport but the investment in the previous year was nil.  We are now quadrupling the level of investment in this plan compared to the 2000 to 2006 plan.  That vision will provide a modern transport infrastructure not only for this city but throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 has been assessed through the DTO.  The CIE strategic rail network was independently assessed.  The idea put forward by some opinion formers in the private sector that there has been no analysis or appraisal or assessment of Transport 21 is nonsense.  Under the capital appraisal guidelines, any projects over &euro;30 million require cost benefit analysis and they will be dealt with in that way.  Individual projects over a certain figure must get individual Cabinet approval but when a ten year investment programme is set out, a cost benefit analysis is not done on each individual project.  That is done according as the programme is rolled out but it is <Col N="1910"/>an integrated one.  It is a transport plan that stands the test of scrutiny.  For example, we are rolling out a national road network which will be achieved by 2010.  There are 22 major projects under contract currently which are coming in on time and on budget and which are withstanding all the tests and appraisals people want.</P>
        <P>The Senator said this plan has no vision.  This plan is about five basic points.  It is about the fact that we must invest in human capital through a strategy for technology, innovation and science that we have put in place and that has been agreed at Cabinet level and between myself and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and approved by Cabinet.  It is an unprecedented investment in third and fourth level education.  It has the backing of the science community.  It refers to doubling PhDs and making sure we have the knowledge based industry that will be required for us to compete in an increasingly difficult and competitive international environment for jobs and investment in the future.</P>
        <P>We need to build an economic infrastructure.  We need a transport system.  We also need to proceed with the ambitious targets in the NESC report on housing, which we are putting forward.  In the last plan we had &euro;9 billion for housing.  Over &euro;22 billion will go into housing, not because I want to spend money but because we need the houses.  We must build 60,000 affordable houses and 40,000 social houses.  That is what NESC said we have to do based on the demographics as it saw them.  Given the successful policies we are implementing, the success of which appear to be taken for granted, and the resources that are now available to Government, we can proceed with that ambitious housing programme in full, quite apart from the expanded capacity of the construction industry, which is now providing 80,000 housing units per year.  Ten years ago it could only provide 35,000.</P>
        <P>I hear many people on the other side of the House talking about the problems with housing.  If some of their local authority members got their act together at local authority level&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and used the same rhetoric they are using in this House and elsewhere to talk about building some of these houses and facilitating local authorities to build houses on the basis that the resources are now available, that would be a far more positive contribution towards dealing with housing problems of many people than is the case currently.  I had to listen in the other House to people talking in a derogative manner about builders.  Who builds houses?  I thought builders built houses.  Are we supposed to denigrate the builders and still have the houses built?  I do not know what they are talking about and I do not believe they know themselves.  That sort of politics of envy and nonsense does not do any service.  If that is the vision the Opposition wants <Col N="1911"/>to bring forward, we have a vision that far expands our horizons than what it has to offer.  People are talking about the vision.  This year alone we are spending &euro;56 billion in Exchequer funded services.  If that is multiplied by seven and do not put in an inflator, that is &euro;390 million.  We are spending money.  It is an investment.</P>
        <P>Regarding the mid-term review of the ESRI on the last plan, which is not as ambitious or as comprehensive as this one, the return on that investment was 14%.  When the finalised amounts come through under the community support framework in mid-2008 and the full term review is done, I guarantee that the return will be of that nature also.  How will we make sure that we have a country that can continue to grow jobs and have a vision for full employment here unless we expand the productive capacity of the economy?  We either do it or we do not.</P>
        <P>Other people tell me we should only spend so much.  If we want to avoid inflationary growth and ensure we can build more capacity and deal with the commute problem that has occurred as a result of the social changes and the advance in accelerated economic development we are now experiencing, we must deal with those problems but that will cost money.  The fact is we are able to do them in a way that is within budget and that is robustly analysed and appraised.  If we want to appraise everything <i>ad infinitum</i> and let opportunities pass, we can do that but it will be dearer to do these projects next year.  We must get on with the job and do it.  We have a ten year transport programme that is working.  We will have a metro and additional Luas lines in this city.  We will have an integrated transport network in this city.  Dublin city will have an integrated transport network.  All the naysayers can say what they like.  They have been saying it since we began the public transport programme but the Government will deliver it.  The Government will also deliver a national motorway system and continued investment in the rail network.</P>
        <P>The framework of the national development plan is based on an average 4% to 4.5% annual economic growth in the next seven years, imminently achievable according to every finance house and financial commentator.  The last plan was based on an annual average economic growth of 5.2%, placing the new target in a moderate range and within the bounds of possibility.  An inflation rate of 2% can be achieved under the harmonised index inflation because there will be more balanced growth.</P>
        <P>Balanced regional development is being brought to the centre of our priorities.  The 2002 national spatial strategy will be implemented.  Regional guidelines had to be put down to ensure the regional planning guidelines were in line with the spatial strategy.  County and local area plans, plus the gateway concept, have been put forward.  All gateway needs studies have been completed.  This was necessary work as a precursor to imple<Col N="1912"/>menting the overall national spatial strategy and ensuring the best return on the investment.  The gateways are in place because we want to effect regional development.  To do so, critical mass must be created in the regions.  The national spatial strategy sets out the physical development of the country by 2020.</P>
        <P>We must also ensure Ireland has an adaptable, flexible and educated workforce for future employment.  IDA Ireland has many future industrial projects in the pipeline because companies still want to invest in Ireland due to the quality of the workforce.</P>
        <P>Investment will continue in our social infrastructure.  We will have a modern hospital system, schools that will meet the challenges of the 21st century and broadband rolled out to every part of the country.  We have set out the way in which these objectives can be achieved.  The resources are available to do so because of the economic policies we have implemented.</P>
        <P>Those who claim the Government has no vision can go off to tell the L &amp; H at Belfield.  The Government&rsquo;s vision is based on reality.  There is a transformation taking place in this country that has never been seen before.  The past ten years are proof positive of it.  The next ten years can also be proof positive of it if the right policies are in place, public finances are sustained and people have the experience, will, wit and opportunity to implement the programmes.</P>
        <P>The idea that the national development plan is a conglomerate of spending demands could not be further from the truth.  One does not simply get one&rsquo;s way with the Department of Finance.  If one did, we would not have a Department of Finance.  The Department is there to robustly suggest what the priorities are.  The building blocks have been established for social infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals to ensure sustainable growth and provide for a better quality of life.  Towards 2016 confirms within the social partnership model that economic progress and social progress are complimentary and mutually dependent.  It is not a question of growth for the sake of growth.  There, however, seems to be some feeling that we do not need growth as we have reached some state of Nirvana.</P>
        <P>Environmental sustainability is another feature of the national development plan.  By introducing these sectorial strategies that have been agreed and priced, communities will become more environmentally sustainable.  We have greatly improved our EU commitments under the wastewater and increased recycling directives.  The Government&rsquo;s record shows it has outstripped any other of its predecessors in making environmental sustainability an important economic component for sustainable growth.</P>
        <P>This development plan should not be seen on its own.  It is part of a continuum with Towards 2016.  When we reach 2016 we can feel we have built a State of which the founding fathers would be proud.  It is not a case that we will solve every <Col N="1913"/>problem.  One absurdity of current political discourse is that no progress has been made if a problem can be pointed out.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

	<P>In the past we had problems because of failure and mediocrity and policies that did not work.  We have full employment when other generations did not.  Is that a sufficient vision?  Young people can get a job in Ireland, commensurate to their skills and abilities.  Is that a worthwhile vision?</P>
        <P>Through the social inclusion programme, totalling &euro;50 billion, we will mainstream people with disabilities and bring the marginalised into full society.  I am proud of the record I have as a former Minister for Health in bringing about this expansion of opportunity which is fundamental to building a republic and giving equal citizenship to all.  To those who want to talk about vision, I am willing to debate it with them all night.  The reality, however, is that we have the economic resources and sustainable growth patterns.  Regional development will be effected through the national spatial strategy.  We must ensure the resources are in place to get the best possible return on that investment.</P>
        <P>I defend this development plan as having all the hallmarks of what is required for this State over the next seven years.  The demographics are such that we have the opportunity to meet these infrastructural deficits in the next decade, which may not be possible in the future.  Due to changing demographics, social expenditure may increase in, say, care for the elderly which may leave less discretionary expenditure.  For every person over 65 years, there are six in the workforce.  We will, however, move to the European norm where they cannot achieve economic growth of more than 2% and populations are diminishing.</P>
        <P>The global village we live in is bringing about real challenges of integration and immigration.  Many migrant workers come to our shores because of the economic success we have achieved.  Their contribution not only benefits them and their families but improves our economy&rsquo;s competitiveness.  The plan assumes an increase in labour force growth of 2.5%, which is <Col N="1914"/>eminently achievable.  Parameters have been set out with achievable targets only if we continue with the successful polices we have had up to now.  Many involved in political discourse would prefer to come up with another idea and have no continuity in policy.  The policies, however, are working in meeting the basic needs of the people.</P>
        <P>One of the great challenges for social partnership in the next several years is to ensure public services can be provided with an improved public service ethos.  It is not about providing more resources for the public service.  If that was the solution to the problem, it would have been solved by now.  This is not a question of a Government resting on its laurels and sleepwalking through the next seven years, as the Opposition suggests.  There is an agenda of change which will test the maturity and vibrancy of social partnership.  It will test the quality of leadership of not only the trade union and political system but that of the community.  The ability to adapt to new circumstances will determine the success of the national development plan and the quality of life it seeks to achieve.  This is the real challenge for Ireland.  The Government and this party has the best political capacity to ensure we maintain social cohesion, consistency in economic policy and provide the resources for priorities to achieve the vision of Towards 2016 that was agreed by all social partners.</P>
        <P>The national development plan is an ambitious blueprint to transform Ireland and produce a better quality of life for all.  It will help us to sustain our economic success, secure the gains already made and underpin our competitiveness into the future.  These economic effects are critical to our well-being.  However, the plan will deliver even more by boosting the quality of our environment, enhancing our national transport network, investing in our schools and hospitals and building social inclusion.  It recognises and acts on the potential of all-island co-operation.  It will encourage balanced and sustainable development in every region and will make our country stronger and fairer in the interests of every citizen.</P>
        <P>The new plan is a fully costed, multi-annual blueprint for sustainable development.  It builds on the progress made over recent years and sets out the strategy to tackle our infrastructural deficits, boost our enterprise and productive sector, equip our people with the skills and qualifications appropriate for a modern dynamic economy, and spread the benefits of our recently attained prosperity more widely among our people.</P>
        <P>This is the fourth national development plan since 1989.  When the first plan was launched, Ireland was a different country.  Unemployment was at 15%, the national debt was 107% of GNP and more than 200,000 people had emigrated in net terms over the previous decade.  By contrast, the backdrop to the new plan is one of virtually full employment, a debt-GNP ratio of 25% and a <Col N="1915"/>population increase of almost 609,000 in the last decade.</P>

	<P>The Minister tells us with certainty that there will be investment in rail services.  Again, the Leader, as Minister, told us there would be a feasibility plan for the Cork commuter route and that the Galway route would be examined.  She also said that the Maynooth route would be expanded, which has only just happened, and that the Kildare route would be expanded, something we are still only talking about.  Likewise, we are still considering the provision of rail services to Navan.  The 2000 commitment to increase the number of carriages on DART trains to eight has only just been fulfilled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister tells us with certainty that we will have a national road network.  A commitment was made in this respect in the last plan and those improvements should already be in place.  The reality is that we have approximately one third of a national motorway network.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we have learned much in the last ten years but there was clearly an awful lot to be learned.  The Minister must, if he is reasonable, accept that it is not unreasonable for Opposition Members to say we are sceptical that he can do in the next six years what he did not in the last six years.</P>
        <P>I will now return to my script.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1918"/>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem with the plan is that it includes much that we have heard before.  One example is the provisions in regard to the health service, an area with which the Minister is particularly familiar.  I have read the full section on health and find it deliberately dodges the two major issues in health, both of which require significant additional infrastructural investment.</P>
        <P>It dodges the issue of bed capacity by simply saying that two studies are being conducted, as there have been many before.  This means we do not know whether there will be additional investment in acute bed capacity because we do not know whether the Government believes it is required.  This is despite the fact that the health plan produced by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in 2001, indicated that 3,000 extra beds are needed.  Six years later, however, the jury is still out on this issue.</P>
        <P>The section on the health services also dodges the issue of the Hanly report.  Not only do we not know whether additional investment will be made, we also do not know how it will be structured, as the Acting Chairman observed during her contribution.  To muddy the waters even further, as the Department of Finance likes to do, the plan states that any implications for current expenditure must be within the scope of the multi-annual arrangements the Department of Finance chooses to make.  Moreover, any implications it might have in terms of public sector numbers must also conform with Government policy in this regard.  Reading the section on health, I do not see beyond some generalities with which nobody could possibly disagree.  It does not add anything new to our knowledge and gives no specific or meaningful commitments on the issues that matter.</P>
        <P>Both the Minister and Senator Brian Hayes referred to the fact that the entire plan is contingent on economic growth and tax revenues into the future.  It is not reasonable to say that it should be so.  Net debt is now down to 15% or 16% of GNP.  We are in a position where we have effectively been putting money aside for years by running down debt.  This allows us to give a commitment that is not contingent, in the way the plan seeks to make it, on tax revenues and economic growth of 4% or 4.5% per annum in the next six or seven years.  We must be clear that this is more than merely a wish list that is contingent on the fiscal prudence which the Department of Finance will dictate from year to year.  We must be able to say with clarity that the resources are there and will be utilised.  We are in a position to do so.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to respond to my next point if he is still here at 7 p.m.  I understand he has said, as Dr. Michael Somers has done, that the way has been cleared for the national pension reserve fund to invest in infrastructural projects.  We know, however, that there is virtually no such investment.  What is the cause of this blockage?  Is it a lack of political will or capacity?  Have the <Col N="1919"/>trustees of the fund decided they do not want to make such investment?  Despite the political commitment in this regard, there is clearly no delivery.</P>
        <P>The Dublin gateway proposals are also decidedly lacking in specifics.  Most of the commitments were made long since, and we are also committed to an entire series of studies.  One study, for example, is considering whether the eastern bypass is appropriate, while another is examining the proposed orbital route.  There is also an interesting one-sentence commitment to invest further in Dublin Port, &ldquo;with due regard to locational issues into the future, taking into consideration the all-Ireland dimension of Dublin Port&rdquo;.  I have a constituency interest in this issue.  We must make a policy decision as to whether we will continue to invest in Dublin Port where it is currently located or invest in locations closer to Dublin which would, in effect, primarily serve the city.  Dublin Port currently serves virtually the entire country.</P>
        <P>There are many good proposals in this plan, the Towards 2016 agreement and the various other plans being produced.  There is a lack of belief, which is not confined to these benches, that it will be delivered.  I hope we have learned the lessons over the past six years or more which will allow us to better deliver in the future but I am far from convinced that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  It was a breath of fresh air to hear him speak.  Once he spoke I was convinced it would be very easy to speak on this motion.  I listened to all the negative things said by those opposite and I was getting depressed.  I drove to Mullingar this week and I have driven to Galway, Cork and Waterford and it is so easy to get from A to B.  From where did the money come to build these roads?  This is our success story.  As a result of our economy&rsquo;s success, I am very pleased we have &euro;184 billion to invest in the future and to create a vision for the next ten years.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on social infrastructure, about which the Minister did not speak.  I refer to investment in social and affordable housing, primary care, sports infrastructure throughout the country, including Lansdowne Road and Abbotstown, the arts and in cultural facilities.  I want to see that investment because I do not wish to see the decline of the social infrastructure throughout the country.  Much of this infrastructure is located in Dublin and in the major cities and it must be extended throughout the country.  We must invest in rural development.  We know what is happening in rural areas.  I welcome the fact the Minister is putting so much money into this area.</P>
        <P>There are many disadvantaged schools throughout the country and there are literacy problems in primary schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator McDowell in what I thought was a very generous tribute to the Minister on the manner of his presentation.  It was a <i>tour de force</i> and it showed clearly the command he has of his brief. That should make everybody in this House happy.  There is something particularly edifying when credit is given where it is due.  For example, Senator Brian Hayes paid a compliment to Deputy Perry on the role he played in securing the transatlantic agreement for Knock Airport.  I was present in Sligo at the invitation of Deputy Perry when the Mayor of New York visited for the unveiling of the monument for the fighting 69th regiment.  Credit should always be given where it is due.  Likewise, credit should be given to the Government on what it has achieved to date.</P>
        <P>What we are really talking about in the plan is an acknowledgement and celebration of unprecedented success for this country.  I believe there is a new national game where if something goes wrong, no matter how infinitesimally small, people blame the Government but when something goes right, they look up and thank the stars or the gods.  We are creating a divided personality for the nation.  That is not to say anybody has all the answers.</P>
        <P>Let us look at some of the issues covered in the national development plan.  Nothing gives me greater satisfaction than to see the huge progress in the peace process in the North.  We are within months of seeing a final conclusion to that process.  Is it not wonderful that it finds an echo in this vision which is before us, in other words, the cross-Border co-operation?  We have already seen it in Tourism Ireland and when we have travelled abroad with the island operating as one.  It is true we are heading towards a united Ireland at least when it comes to the economy.</P>
        <P>There is &euro;50 billion to address social inclusion, or social exclusion.  That is very important.  Some &euro;1.13 billion is being given to cultural infrastructure, which is very important.  It is a very carefully thought out plan.  I do not believe it is right to suggest there was not consultation.  How could one come up with an infrastructure plan for culture if consultation had not taken place?  How could one come up with a plan for the Gaeltacht and the islands if we had not consulted in advance?  How could one come up with a plan for <Col N="1921"/>cross-Border projects if there had not been consultation?</P>
        <P>It is vital we all embrace the potential we now have.  I associate the words &ldquo;prudence&rdquo; and &ldquo;vision&rdquo; with this plan.  We are celebrating what we have done but we must not rest on our laurels.  We would blame the Government if it rested on the oars having brought the ship into a safe port and opening up the opportunities we now have.  It is an occasion for celebration and I do not like to see any viciousness in the debate because ultimately, it is something for us all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>What we heard from the Minister would be wonderful if we were at a pre-election final rally in the square in Tullamore.  That is how entertaining it was.  The plan has been called visionary but we must consider what &ldquo;visionary&rdquo; means.  It means something for the future but the reality is that most of the money allocated to programmes in the plan has been announced previously or has been spent.  There is very little additional money for this vision.</P>
        <P>The Minister said we have a better health service and education system as a result of the previous plan.  He seems to forget the increasing number of people on waiting lists.  People now realise the health service is worse despite all the money which has been put into it.  This morning I highlighted a case, over which the HSE and the Minister have stood, where someone with cancer was denied a particular treatment recommended by his consultant because it was too expensive.  The Minister referred to the Department of Health and Children as Angola and nothing has changed since he was Minister in that Department.</P>
        <P>While the Minister referred to education, I remind him that in 2002 his Government declared that no child under nine years of age would be in a class of more than 20 pupils by the time it left office.  Yesterday I provided this House with statistics to the effect that 25% of students are in classes of 30 pupils or more, 50% are in classes of between 20 and 29 pupils and 85% are in larger classes than was the case in 2002.  While this is the reality, the Minister has asserted he cannot be challenged in this regard.  This is what some would consider to be the most wonderful delivery on the part of a Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the IDA and the provision of jobs and Members are grateful that Galway city is thriving.  Were the Minister elsewhere in the west, he would know that in east Galway, apart from those jobs that have been created privately or through Enterprise Ireland, not a single IDA-supported job has been created.</P>
        <P>In the Minister&rsquo;s absence, I acknowledge his partial extension of the pilot scheme for the upper Shannon region to the middle Shannon region, which was of major importance.  Regrettably however, the plan in operation in the upper Shannon region was not fully extended.  I examined the scheme before entering the Chamber <Col N="1922"/>and the area around Portumna and towards Woodford. as well as the other district electoral divisions mentioned are all areas of declining population.  In respect of the CL&Aacute;R programme, no new funds have been made available for areas of declining population in the west of Ireland, which is sad.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by citing a statistic that proves the reality regarding gateways for development and an equal spread of development throughout the State.  As of 2006, only 76% of the expenditure forecast in the previous national development plan was spent in the Border, midlands and western region, in contrast to a figure of 108% in the east and south east.  Such statistics provide the answer in respect of balanced regional development and any Minister who can state that this plan contains a vision is being revisionary rather than visionary.  Such a Minister is going forward while looking backwards at the same time.  The statistics show this is not a plan with vision.  It is a pre-election restatement of expenditures that have already been made.</P>
        <P>The Minister should mention one statistic in particular that is a reflection of his own constituency and should consider the consequences for Birr of the collapse of decentralisation.  The Minister shares this constituency with his Minister of State, Deputy Parlon.  A total of two people have decided to transfer to Birr and Members should consider the waste of money involved.  No accountability was available in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The sad reality is that only three minutes are available to me when the Minister could prattle on for 30 minutes.</P>
        <P>As for the launch of the national development plan, I tend to be sceptical of such massive launches.  In the past, although the privatisation of eircom involved a massive launch, we now face all kinds of telecommunications problems and have no real competition within that industry.  Some years ago, Members witnessed the major launch associated with the national spatial strategy.  What has happened since?  The national development plan is again discussing gateways and hubs.  Most recently, the national development plan was launched at a cost of &euro;340,000.</P>
        <P>The Government is disappointed because the plan does not appear to have gone done terribly well with the electorate.  There has not been much talk about the national development plan because people are sceptical and realise the plan incorporates much rehashing of promises made in the past.  If one took a red biro to all the repeated promises contained in the plan, it would contain much red ink.  For example, the transport element has been announced thrice by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.</P>
        <P>Lest one might consider that it was only Opposition Members who are not being constructive in this regard, I will mention three newspaper references that appeared following its launch.  An editorial referred to a reversion to the same old fan<Col N="1923"/>ciful promises, a headline called it a masterclass in brazen and dishonest public relations while another described it as being a road map to heaven and higher taxes and referred to the cash the Government plans to spend.  It is worth bearing in mind that following the plan&rsquo;s publication, the ESRI stated that attempting to implement its contents on a massive scale would fuel inflation.  Naturally, this was ignored blithely because, as all Members are aware, an election approaches and consequently this plan is important to the Government.  If it divvies out funds to all parts of the State, particularly the marginal constituencies, beneficial effects for the Government might ensue.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke of full employment in Ireland.  However, in County Limerick, the food processing industry has come to an end within 18 months and a total of 450 jobs have been lost.  Has any Minister visited those who lost their jobs before Christmas in Castlemahon?  I have spoken to the workers and they are facing difficulties in finding jobs.  All is not well in the garden.  While I could continue in respect of many elements of the plan and many concerns that pertain to my constituency, three minutes is insufficient and I will conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I wish to take up a point made by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding this plan.  He divided it in a quite interesting fashion, namely, into the past and the present.  He stated that this debate was a recognition of the great success enjoyed by the Government in the past and I believe he referred to it as being a celebration of the future.</P>
        <P>While I agree with the first statement I do not agree with the second.  Although they regard it as being their duty, it is fatuous for Members of the Opposition to tackle the Government on the grounds of past mismanagement of the economy.  When they refer to the waste of money or value for money, they are clutching at straws that are perfectly legitimate, albeit reasonably minor in the overall context.  Members should recognise that overall, the economy has been superbly managed by a succession of administrations that happen not to be of the Opposition view.  Many Independent Members have done so in the past.  The Government has done well, the fruits are there for all to see and it did not make a mess of a situation in which there was a potential to so do.  This should also be recognised.</P>
        <P>However, some might suggest this plan is visionary.  To me it is pretty fanciful and resembles a spending programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1924"/>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that has been taken up at a timely point in the electoral cycle.</P>
        <P>An aspect of such plans with which I have difficulties is that they are built on certain assumptions, none of which can be taken for granted.  I gather that this plan is based on the assumption that Ireland will achieve an average growth rate of 4.5% for the next eight years.  While I do not know the source of this assumption, it has been plucked out of the air.  There is no reason whatever for believing it except that it constitutes pure guesswork on the part of an economist in the Department of Finance.  A real plan would not simply assume a growth rate of 4.5%.  It would proceed on the basis that in the event of the achievement of a particular growth rate, this, that or the other would be done.  This plan reveals the Government&rsquo;s intentions in the event of a growth rate of 4.5%.</P>
        <P>However, what will happen if such growth rates are not achieved?  What will happen if the Government suffers the same problems as those faced earlier this week by the auctioneers?  The latter decided that because house prices were falling, their revenue would drop and that consequently, they would raise commissions.  This is an outrageous thing for them to do.  It is completely non-competitive and I presume it will not work.  However, were the Government to adopt the same attitude, it would increase, rather than reduce, stamp duty.  It would note the fall in revenue from stamp duty because of the decline or stabilisation of the housing market and the associated reduction in turnover and would increase stamp duty to prevent a collapse in revenue.  This plan assumes that everything, particularly in the construction industry, will continue in the same prosperous way it did in the past and that turnover will remain stable or increase.  I do not know whether this is true and neither does anybody else.  Absolutely no provision is made for a situation where we are not as well-off as we might be, only an assumption of a flourishing economy.  I hope it is true.  However, it is fairyland to present a plan and state it is the only possible situation which can arise.</P>
        <P>I was also struck by the loudly lauded rhetoric produced by the Minister when he departed from his supplied script.  I listened to it on the monitor.  As Ministers always do, he continuously gave credit for much of the economic boom to the social partners.</P>

	<P>Even the Labour Party does not wish to do this.  It is the only split we can identify between it and its brethren.  However, it is important.  Why must we continuously refer to the strong men of old Ireland when the boom comes from new Ireland?</P>
        <P>It is significant the Minister referred to social partnership.  By this he means trade unions because IBEC does not matter but must be included to keep it happy.  Why must he defer to them when we all know a future boom will come from people who are not part of social partnership, namely, the multinationals?  I would like to have seen more concentration on them in the national development plan.  I am sick and tired of hearing about social inclusion, the social partners and such verbiage which is old Ireland and the old economy.</P>
        <P>Did anybody in the Department of Finance read the US Chamber of Commerce submission on the national development plan?  I sometimes wonder.  It was full of dire warnings about the Irish economy.  It warned that US and other multinationals would not come here unless certain priorities were observed.  I do not see any of those priorities in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.</P>
        <P>I see tokenism where the Minister mentioned an amount of &euro;20 billion to be invested in the promotion of enterprise, science and innovation.  It is a wonderful figure.  I do not know where it came from.  He also mentioned various matters which to me fall under the category of grants.  It is giving money away to keep a few vested interests happy.</P>
        <P>He ought to have considered what will keep the economy buzzing according to the wishes of the multinationals which are, whether we like it or not, fuelling the boom on which we depend.  They will provide the 4.5% growth he wrongly assumes will happen for the next six or seven years.  It might be 8%, 3% or 1%.  It might be negative.  Nobody knows.  It is a convenient figure for a pre-election programme.  It sounds reasonable and neither too big nor too small.  One can spend a great deal of other people&rsquo;s money when one assumes 4.5% growth.</P>
        <P>I feel split on this motion and do not know what is the right way to vote.  The Government has done a wonderful job on the economy which should be recognised.  However, I fear this programme is not visionary.  It is a purely aspirational spending programme and a fantasy.</P>

	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate beginning with the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke.  I thoroughly approve of the <Col N="1926"/>restoration of the Athlone to Mullingar railway line which would help restore the interconnectedness of the rail system.  The plan is not only for the future, it is being implemented as we speak.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan tried to present the Fine Gael amendment to the motion as merely offering scrutiny.  None of us object to scrutiny.  However, as the language it uses includes &ldquo;failure after failure&rdquo;, &ldquo;abhors&rdquo; and &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; it is nothing of the kind.  It is straightforward denunciation.</P>
        <P>In reply to Senator Quinn, the previous national development plan received top marks from the EU Commission and the ESRI.  Since the late 1980s we spent our moneys well, unlike other countries and the results show for it.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s delight that we will have transatlantic connections from Knock.  I am happy to pay tribute to anyone who contributed to it, particularly Deputy Perry.  It is extraordinary to have Mayor Bloomberg come to Ireland to attract Irish tourists to New York.  It always used to be the other way round.</P>
        <P>Much was stated on Government incompetence and dreadful management.  I have been on the doorsteps and no one buys that line.  No one outside the country believes it.  During the past 20 years we had outstanding economic success.  I do not state everything was perfect.  However, it is greatly admired and we are regarded as a model.  We have gone far beyond what we had and what those among us who are older expected in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
        <P>Sometimes the private sector is held up.  The private sector is not universally competent, brilliant and a shining contrast in all respects to the public sector.</P>

	<P>In many respects little distinguishes the public and private sectors.  They have different roles.</P>
        <P>I entirely agree with Senator White.  Partition has been an impediment to economic development in the North.  Significant improvements were made in Northern Ireland railway rolling stock which I welcome.  The lack of a motorway from Belfast to Derry would not have happened if the country was independent.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Decentralisation was mentioned by Senator Henry.  It is an entirely voluntary process.  Across the water, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced a large decentralisation programme and if people did not participate they lost their jobs.  In the senior levels of the French public sector it is taken for granted that high-flyers will serve in the prefectures throughout the country.  I wish certain senior civil servants here would adopt a more positive attitude to the gains and experience of being located in various parts of the country.</P><Col N="1927"/>

	<P>In many ways, the plan is a grand synthesis.  It is good to pull these matters together.  The prosperity of this country 50 years ago was based on the first programme of economic expansion.  Of course it was not a plan in the Stalinist sense of the word.  It was a programme such as others which have served us very well, as has the participation of the social part<Col N="1928"/>ners, a fact which has been internationally recognised.  Some people of a neoliberal-conservative persuasion disagree.  For example, Samuel Brittan of the <i>Financial Times</i> came to Ireland and could not understand social partnership as it did not fit into his vision of the world.  Nor does it fit into the vision of the world of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, which would love policies which landed us in industrial conflict on a grand scale.  It misses the fact that we did not have a Thatcherite industrial relations policy.  </P>

    <Title>Statute Law Revision Bill 2007: Order for Second Stage. </Title>
        <P LI="1">Bill entitled an Act to promote the revision of statute law by repealing certain statutes that were enacted before 6 December 1922 and which have ceased to have effect or have become unnecessary, by identifying those statutes primarily of a public and general nature <Col N="1928"/>that were so enacted but are not being repealed by this Act, by assigning short titles to certain statutes in order to facilitate their citation and by amending certain statutes in so far as they relate to short titles, to provide for <i>prima facie</i> evidence to be given of certain statutes, and to provide for related matters.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to launch this Bill in the Seanad.  From previous experience, I know that Members of the House have a keen interest in statute law reform and I am sure that the Bill will have as interesting and thorough a debate as others of its kind.</P>
        <P>The Bill is the greatest single statute law revision measure undertaken in the State.  It will repeal 3,188 statutes, more statutes than have been repealed by any Act before or since the foundation of the State.  For the first time, clarity will be provided to the Statute Book because the Bill contains as its central feature the &ldquo;white list&rdquo; of all statutes that will continue in force after its enactment.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been devised within the better regulation agenda, which the Taoiseach has pursued vigorously in recent years, and represents further delivery of a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s 2004 White Paper, Regulating Better<i>.  </i>At the core of the better regulation programme is the opinion that we need to address the flow of new legislation and the existing stock of legislation.  The flow of new regulations is being tackled through a regulatory impact analysis, which was introduced across all Departments in June 2005.  This approach requires Departments to consult more widely before regulating and to analyse in greater detail the likely impacts of Acts and significant statutory instruments before presenting them to the Oireachtas.  In this way, proposed legislation will benefit from being subjected to comment by interested parties and will be more comprehensively evaluated in terms of potential downstream impacts.</P>
        <P>As we work to improve the quality of legislation moving on stream, we must tackle the substantial body of existing laws and regulations, which is where this Bill fits in.  Statute law revision means the process of removing the deadwood from the system, that is, legislation that is obsolete or has lost any modern purpose.  Unlike the process of statute law reform, the revision process does not change the substantive nature of the law itself.  Its primary objective is to facilitate users of the law &mdash; the Judiciary, citizens, business &mdash; and to provide greater clarity regarding the legislation that remains in force and pertinent.  All Government Departments, legislative drafters and we, as Members of these Houses, stand to gain from statute law revision processes.</P>
        <P>The issue of statute law revision is an important element of better regulation, particularly in the Irish context.  Our complex history has led to a situation whereby there is considerable uncertainty as to what legislation from prior to independence even applies to this State.  We have many laws passed by various parliaments sitting <Col N="1930"/>in Ireland between the Norman invasion in 1169 and the Act of Union in 1800 but because records have been lost or destroyed over the years, and particularly during the Civil War, it is impossible to say with absolute certainty what all of these are.  We also have laws which were not Acts of Parliament in the modern sense, but are regarded as being of statutory force.  We have laws passed by various Parliaments of England and Great Britain that also applied or were subsequently extended to Ireland, even though Ireland had its own Parliament from at least the 14th century onwards.  We have laws passed during the period of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but it is not clear to what extent many of them applied to Ireland.</P>
        <P>These and other factors leave us in a position where it is at the moment impossible to say with absolute certainty which laws from before the foundation of the State actually apply in Ireland at the present time.  That situation is clearly not in line with our modern regulatory principles of clarity and transparency.  That is why we have moved from previous models of statute law revision &mdash; which tend to lists those statutes to be repealed &mdash; to a new model.  This new model is one by which we can clarify exactly which laws continue to apply.</P>
        <P>The need for this clarity is the genesis for the current statute law revision process.  For the past two years, researchers based in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office have been analysing all of the laws made by those authorities that made laws governing Ireland.  These include the various Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom.  This research has allowed the compilation of a detailed database recording the status of more than 26,000 public general statutes.  Of course, many of these have been repealed over the centuries, and many never applied to Ireland in the first place, but they all had to be assessed to find out which was which.  More than 4,500 statutes were found that were or still might be in force to some extent.</P>
        <P>These 4,500 statutes then had to be assessed in greater detail to determine which of them had any modern relevance.  This was a painstaking process involving detailed research and the compilation of voluminous files.  Initial decisions were made as to which statutes might still have some modern relevance and which ones were obsolete and could therefore be repealed.</P>
        <P>Detailed rounds of consultation then followed, in which Government and outside bodies, as well as members of the public, made representations.  This consultation process was facilitated by publication of the lists of statutes on the Attorney General&rsquo;s website.  Those lists were in effect the draft Schedules to this Bill and were open to public consultation for a period of several months on two occasions during 2006.  The Department of the Taoiseach also published newspaper notices regarding the process and hard copies of the lists were made available by the Office of the <Col N="1931"/>Attorney General.  Hundreds of representations, on matters large and small, were received, replied to and recorded on the database.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us today provides that statutes predating 6 December 1922, where there has been any doubt, or where there is a credible argument that they may still be in force and may still have continuing relevance, will be preserved in the white list set out in Schedule 1.  This cautious approach is necessary to ensure this Bill does not inadvertently repeal a statutory provision, which might still have legal effect.  However, I emphasise that it is the Government&rsquo;s policy that all of these retained Acts ultimately will be repealed.</P>
        <P>In the case of this white list it will be necessary for substantive modern legislation to replace the provisions of these older laws; the old laws can be then repealed.  This is a distinct and separate process from statute law revision, which is restricted to repeal without replacement.</P>
        <P>The process of substantive replacement of the old legislation, which we describe as the process of repeal and re-enactment or statute law reform, is already underway in a number of areas.  For example, almost 10% of the 1,348 statutes on the white list will be retained only for a very short time.  This is because 133 of these statutes will be repealed when the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 is enacted.  Senators will recall the provisions of this Bill, which passed this House before Christmas and is now before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s overall programme combining statute law revision under this Bill, together with a co-ordinated series of repeal and re-enactment measures, will ensure that within a short number of years all the legislation on our Statute Book that predates independence will have been replaced with modern laws more appropriate to our modern democracy.</P>
        <P>In addition to the clarity which will be conferred by this Bill when enacted, it also will have a dramatic effect on the volume of material on the Statute Book.  This Bill will repeal 3,188 statutes, far more than any previous statute law revision measure.  In fact, it is more than the entire number of public general Acts of the Oireachtas enacted since Ireland achieved independence in 1922.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that the decision to list an Act in either Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 has been based on purely legal reasoning.  Where an Act has or may have continuing legal effect, it is preserved by listing it in Schedule 1.  Where it is entirely obsolete or has ceased to have legal effect, it is repealed by omitting it from Schedule 1 and it will instead appear in the list of repealed Acts in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of an Act in one Schedule or another should not be taken as being a positive or negative comment on the content of that Act.  By repealing an Act we are not necessarily saying we disapprove of it, some of the Acts being repe<Col N="1932"/>aled were very progressive and positive in their day but they have long since served their purpose.</P>
        <P>As I have previously indicated, statute law revision Bills are concerned with removing only laws that have become entirely obsolete.  There is a complementary process, statute law reform, that involves changing the content of laws to modernise them.  In respect of the Acts on the white list, that process of statute law reform is already under way but will be effected by other legislation.</P>
        <P>As I have made clear, this Bill is not the end of the process of modernisation of our Statute Book.  It is an important step in that process and will provide a blueprint for future measures, not just of statute law revision but also of substantive statute law reform.  Our ultimate objective is to provide the Irish people with a single legislative code which is clear and accessible.  This code will contain only laws enacted by the democratically elected Oireachtas, or under European law where Ireland is a member of a community of equal nations.  This Bill will be a major step along that road towards clarity and democratic credibility in our Statute Book.</P>
        <P>Members may wish to note that while the present Bill deals only with public general Acts, the Government intends to give attention to analysing legislative measures going beyond that category.  It is intended, subject to progress with the present Bill, that proposals can be developed to deal with local and personal Acts, private Acts, and statutory rules and orders, which complete the picture of pre-independence statute law.  An examination of post-independence law would also fall to be addressed.  Obviously, review of these areas would necessitate the bringing to the House of further legislative proposals in due course and I hope that I can look to the support of Members for our ongoing work in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will now explain in detail the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides a broad definition of the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill in order that it includes royal ordinances and similar documents that are recognised as having the force and effect of an Act of Parliament.  The reason for this broad definition is that the parliamentary system was evolving for many centuries.  In early times laws were enacted in ways somewhat different from the modern system and some of them would not conform to the definition of an Act of Parliament as we would understand it.  However, these laws were regarded under the constitutional systems of those times as being valid, and they have continued to be recognised as having statutory effect.  It is appropriate, therefore to use the term &ldquo;statute&rdquo; to cover all these kinds of laws.</P>
        <P>Section 2 is the central provision of the Bill.  It will provide a fundamental clarification and simplification of the Statute Book by drawing a line at 6 December 1922 and repealing the majority of the statutes passed prior to that date except for certain statutes that are to be specifically preserved.</P><Col N="1933"/>
        <P>The first category of exceptions is provided for by section 2(2)(<i>a</i>) which preserves in force the statutes listed in Schedule 1.  These are the 1,348 statutes which have or may have some modern relevance.  These cannot be repealed until they are first replaced by modern legislation.</P>
        <P>The other main category of exceptions is local and personal and private statutes.  These are statutes enacted and-or published under different mechanisms from the normal.  Local and personal statutes were statutes which were public in the sense that everyone was deemed to be on notice of their content but not general because they only related to specific places or persons.  They were published in separate series between 1797 and 1922.  Private statutes are statutes enacted under a different mechanism entirely than the normal public general statutes and also relate to specific persons and places.  This mechanism is still in use to this day and, as Senators will be aware, a private Act was enacted as recently as 2003, namely the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003.</P>
        <P>As more than 33,000 local, personal and private statutes must be assessed, in addition to the 26,730 public and general statutes already assessed, it was thought appropriate to preserve these statutes as an entire category at this time.  They will be assessed at a future stage and will be the subject of further statute law revision measures.</P>
        <P>Section 2(3) has the effect of repealing a part of the Bill of Rights 1688.  This is the only partial repeal contained in the Bill.  It arises because some provisions of the Bill of Rights may be of continuing legal relevance and, therefore, the entire Bill cannot be repealed.  However certain elements of the Bill of Rights are discriminatory, such as between different religions, and these elements are being removed for obvious reasons.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for the listing in Schedule 2 of the statutes repealed by the Bill as a consequence of the fact that they have not been preserved by section 2 and Schedule 1.  These comprise the 3,188 statutes which did apply or may have applied to Ireland, have not been fully repealed and do not have any continuing relevance.</P>
        <P>Section 4 assigns Short Titles to all public general statutes that are in force, are not going to be repealed by this Bill and do not have Short Titles.  Sections 5 to 7 amend Short Titles conferred by a number of earlier Acts.  These are Short Titles which are unconventional or misleading.  The effect of this Bill will be to standardise the Short Titles of all surviving statutes to facilitate and simplify the making of references to those Acts.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for certain of the early statutes to be proved in court by being produced in certain official publications or in copies from such publications as certified by a specified institution.  At present, the only institution specified will be the National Library, although the Taoiseach may specify other institutions.  This provision is neces<Col N="1934"/>sary because of the difficulty, or in many cases the impossibility, of producing original copies of very old legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 9 is a savings clause, which is standard for Bills of this type, with some additional provisions.  The savings clause is designed to ensure that no unintended consequences arise from the repeals effected by the Bill.  One of the most important effects of the savings clause is the provision that where we are now repealing an Act which had itself repealed an earlier Act, our repeal through this Bill does not have the effect of reviving the earlier Act.  They will both be repealed.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for a Short Title and collective citation of the Short Titles Acts.  Schedule 1 lists the statutes that are being retained, while Schedule 2 lists the statutes that are not being retained and, in consequence, repealed.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a major and historic step toward our ultimate goal of completely modernising the Statute Book.  It will allow us to give democratic legitimacy to the body of laws in our Statute Book by giving the approval of the Oireachtas to those laws which are to continue in force, while also cutting out more than 3,000 laws which serve no further purpose.  The Bill provides, for the first time in our history, complete clarity as to exactly which laws apply in this State.  I hope Senators will enjoy an interesting and productive debate on this subject and I commend the Bill to the House.  Finally, I express my appreciation of the people involved in helping us through this interesting process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House and commend the officials from the Office of the Attorney General who have dedicated themselves to this initiative over the past several years.  The Minister of State has previously come to this House on a similar mission of obliterating non-applicable historic legislation.  I find myself in the extraordinary and historic situation of repealing more legislation than was ever enacted in post-independence Ireland.  We are taking on ourselves an astonishing and near dictatorial power.</P>
        <P>Many of the difficulties outlined by the Minister of State with regard to assessing which of the laws passed prior to independence were relevant to this process could have been avoided had the Four Courts not been burned in the first act of the Civil War.  I will say no more except to note that almost 90% of the records, including many ancient ones, were destroyed over a very short period during that episode of our history.</P>
        <P>I do not underestimate the task faced by the Minister of State and his researchers in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office with regard to assessing the potential relevance of historic Acts and statutes to modern Ireland.  Clearly, the majority were part and parcel of our history, but it could be argued that a small number of the laws we accepted on independence, despite having <Col N="1935"/>been at war with Britain, could have had a marginal effect on domestic legislation.  The Minister of State and his colleagues had, therefore, to tread carefully and meticulously research each and every Act and statute, regardless of whether it contained one or 100 sections.  This House is indebted to the work done behind the scenes over the past several years to bring this project to fruition.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State noted that in excess of 1,000 statutes remain in force and have not been included on the list.  We will learn in the future whether these will be addressed in similar legislation to this Bill and the Act that preceded it.</P>
        <P>Every modern democracy imposes a responsibility for achieving high standards of regulation.  Systems have to be put in place whereby ordinary citizens can be fully aware of the law of the land.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is beginning to roll out new codified criminal justice legislation which will amalgamate virtually all the statutes affecting the criminal justice system, so that matters such as sentencing are clearly outlined.  We need to take that approach on a range of other issues because citizens must be able to comprehend the law without reference to previous legislation.  As legislators, we often face the challenge when amending legislation of trying to review several Acts at the same time to make sense of the law.  We need to establish unified codified legislation so that practitioners and citizens alike can identify precisely the status of legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our ultimate objective is to provide the Irish people with a single legislative code which is clear and accessible.  This code will contain only laws enacted by the democratically elected Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am aware of the progress made on pre-independence legislation but how far have we travelled in terms of achieving the ultimate objective?  In the course of his remarks he said that one of the few delicacies of this House is our ability to put in place Private Bills.  As he rightly reminded the House, the last Bill enacted in that way was the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Act 2003.  In such Bills, a Senator acts as a sponsor for a private institution or company that makes a petition to the Seanad as a means of bringing the legislation through the House.  Even though in recent years we have had few examples, it is an important role of this House.</P>
        <P>I will make some general observations about the process of legislation.  The Oireachtas got a very severe reprimand from the Supreme Court some years ago and was correctly given a rap across the knuckles for the way in which ministerial orders and statutory instruments in particular are routinely signed off by Ministers without recourse to debate in this House.  We have far too much primary legislation in both Houses of <Col N="1936"/>the Oireachtas, which leaves very little time to debate secondary legislation &mdash; statutory instruments and ministerial orders.  The Supreme Court rightly pointed out that the process of decisions by Ministers not being debated in the House either by way of a 21-day rule or resolution must be checked.  Where government becomes more sophisticated and complicated and has more application in terms of EU law, there is a responsibility for secondary legislation to be debated in this House and the other House in a much more substantial way than is the case now.  We must take heed of the Supreme Court warning.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear what the Minister of State said about the review of post-Independence legislation.  It must also be the case that many of the Acts passed since 1922 no longer have particular relevance and application and have been outdated by either new Acts or significant amendments.  I would be interested to hear how the Minister of State is doing on that project.  The entire revision of our Statute is not just a matter relating to pre-Independence Ireland but also a matter for post-Independence Ireland.  On Committee and Report Stages we will have the opportunity to go the various statutes listed in the Schedule, which in effect is the substance of the Bill.  At this stage I welcome the ongoing project.  This side of the House will always welcome any codified statute that puts to one side redundant statutes and Acts of a previous Parliament.  The Minister of State deserves to be congratulated because it is always difficult for the Government Whip to get time on the legislative calendar between his myriad of meetings with Opposition Whips and his duties in the other House.  We welcome today&rsquo;s efforts and I give particular congratulation to the staff in the Office of the Attorney General and the unit that has been dealing with this project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very exciting legislation.  As the Minister of State was talking I thought about all those centuries ago when clerks would have been bent over desks with very bad light thinking how they would write a Bill, whom it would affect and whether it would be beneficial to the people.  I am well aware that the legislators of the time would have been of the elite class and would not have been elected by democracy &mdash; or at best by a rough form of democracy.  Certainly women did not have much of a say in the Parliament, in the making of the Bills or as voters.  I think back to the people who drafted the Bills and the pressures that led to the need for the Bills.  There must have been riots, marches, petitions, lobbying, etc., before Bills were produced.  It is interesting that these two countries were governed for so long by properly enacted laws, which is also exciting.  A country governed by statutes has a certain authority and stability.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State hoped that we would continue to support him and his office in what he <Col N="1937"/>is doing.  I wholeheartedly say that we will.  If he has 20 more Bills, either in his present role or in some future manifestation, we will be very pleased to take them here.  I congratulate Richard Humphreys and his team, and the Attorney General&rsquo;s team.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I used to be a historian before I became a politician.  A Bill like this is exciting and interesting and well worthwhile.  They have only begun to make a small inroad into the mess of old legislation.  For the first time the Bill gives a comprehensive list of the laws predating Independence.  It has two parts &mdash; a &ldquo;white list&rdquo; of Acts retained and as we are not allowed to mention &ldquo;black&rdquo; I will say a &ldquo;grey list&rdquo; of Acts repealed.  There are 3,188 Acts in the &ldquo;grey list&rdquo;, making this Bill by far the largest statute law revision measure ever completed in Ireland.  One would wonder why this and other governments that have been in power since 1922, when we had stopped fighting one another, did not start to address this matter.  I know we were trying to live, build houses and schools, and get people sorted out.  However, this matter should have been ongoing because we are governed by laws.  It is the bedrock on which we exist.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State said, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, which has been passed by the Seanad and is shortly to come before the D&aacute;il, will repeal 130 of the Acts on the white list.  One modern composite Bill can do that.  In coming years, the Government intends that all pre-Independence legislation will be repealed and replaced with modern laws.  If the awful thing happened and we had a change of government &mdash; that would be on the grey list &mdash; I hope the incoming Government would continue this very fine work.  It is shocking to hear that we do not know for certain, in this modern era, which laws currently apply to this State.  Senator Brian Hayes asked how far along the path we were on this odyssey.  Looking at the titles of the Acts and thinking about them represents a kind of odyssey.  What will be achieved by the Bill is long overdue.</P>
        <P>We are at last moving towards having all of these old laws repealed.  These laws simply do not have the democratic legitimacy we are entitled to expect in a modern democracy.  Many of the Parliaments which passed these laws were made up exclusively of wealthy aristocratic men.  While we can say they were exclusive and elitist, they still passed some very decent laws.  We cannot simply put them in a corner with dunces&rsquo; hats.  They passed laws that were relevant to their times.</P>
        <P>There appear to be many laws from the 13th and 14th centuries which blatantly discriminate against the native Irish and which try to make illegal the Irish language, Irish law and Irish traditions.  It is right and proper that all of these laws should be repealed.  We think of the Penal Laws and other laws that had very sad consequences <Col N="1938"/>for the Irish people.  We learn too of the laws which broke up the Irish monasteries because the English kings decided they were hotbeds of sedition.  They thought that in the middle of their prayers the monks were cooking up plots to shoot everyone they met.  Many laws were discriminatory and reflected prejudices against certain groups in society.  One 11th century statute provides for &ldquo;Frenchmen to pay &lsquo;scot and lot&rsquo; &rdquo;, which was a discriminatory tax applicable only to the French.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Quite right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Senator Norris have liked that? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Definitely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Another Act, the Assise of Arms 1181, forbids Jewish people from owning armour.  The only statute which is being partially repealed by this Bill is the Bill of Rights of 1688.  It is interesting that there was a Bill of Rights in 1688.  Although it discriminated against particular religions, the principle underlying it was fair.  Nowadays we have various UN declarations on rights and years of this and that, and the year to be of something else.  The Bill of Rights contained many provisions, but it granted a right to bear arms to Protestants but not to members of any other religion &mdash; they might go &ldquo;bang-bang&rdquo; in the middle of the night.  What about the Molly Maguires or Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Farrell and all those people who rose up in rebellion?  They were not allowed to have arms.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There are some interesting local Acts and which I emphasise because they are important.  Some statutes relate to Athlone and Westmeath for example Schedule 1, Acts which are retained, including the Meath and Counties of Westmeath Act 1543.  This is the Act which divided the historic county of Meath into the two modern counties of Meath and Westmeath.  It can be described as the foundation of County Westmeath.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1939"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We are with Longford now.  The division into two counties was explained in the Act as being because the western part, which became County Westmeath, was beset by rebels against the King.  In common with many statutes relating to local government, it has been listed in the &ldquo;white list&rdquo; and is not being repealed at this time.  </P>
        <P>Schedule 2 contains the Acts which are being repealed including 1254 (38 Hen. 3) [H.M.D.I.] Dublin, Limerick and Athlone granted to Prince Edward.  I always knew Athlone was up there with the big towns and cities.  They were granted to Prince Edward, the son of King Henry III, the cities of Dublin and Limerick with their counties and the town and castle of Athlone.  History does not record how the people of Dublin, Limerick and Athlone felt about being given to Prince Edward.  He had a lovely castle to which to bring his paramour or whatever they were called in those times.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc28- ?>The Leas-Chathaoirleach, coming from the west,<?oasys _dc0- ?> will be interested in 1733 (7 Geo. 2) c. 19, An Act for repairing the road leading from Kinnegad to Athlone in the County of Westmeath.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Wait, there is more to come.  Many Acts were passed in the 18th century to facilitate the building and improvement of roads, and these are clearly obsolete in the modern day because we have a national development plan which is doing this. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

	<P>No I will not start.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>How many hundreds of years ago was that? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We still have some medieval roads. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This was one such Act.  It was passed because the road from Kinnegad to Athlone had grown &ldquo;so ruinous and bad that in the winter-season so many parts thereof are impassable to carriages and dangerous to travellers&rdquo;.  The Act provided for the collection of a toll of one shilling on certain vehicles travelling on the road and there do not appear to have been any riots or protests about that.  People paid the toll if they wanted to travel. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>They could not go on any other route in those days.  There was no other road. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.  They travelled on the great Esker which brought them around Clonmacnoise.  The toll was taken to fund the improvement of that road.  That is most <Col N="1940"/>interesting about Kinnegad and Athlone.  It is ironic that nearly 300 years later we are still putting tolls on the modern motorway between these two towns.</P>
        <P>Certain kinds of Acts will not be affected by the Statute Law Revision Bill.  These are private Acts by which a person may have set up a charitable trust for a particular purpose, such as education or to deal with indigence or for health purposes.  An example of such an Act is the private Act of 1761 which incorporated Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School in County Westmeath.  This Act was looked at in detail by the Pre-lndependence Project because the school itself contacted the project to ensure that the Act would not be repealed.  I know the school well and it is a fine school in Multyfarnham.  It must be subject to trust funding or something of that nature which, if the Act was repealed, would cut it off from the trust.  The school still plays as important a role in the community of Multyfarnham as it did 250 years ago and the present Statute Law Revision Bill will do nothing to interfere with the founding Act.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and all who work with him have embarked on a long odyssey.  It is necessary in a modern democracy that the project is open and transparent.  I was interested to hear that hundreds of people contacted the website when the Attorney General listed it.  Of course people are interested because we are all subject to law.  The project is time consuming and might perhaps be tedious from time to time, although I would not think so because laws were made by people for people.  We give people greater access to modern laws which are created in full consultation which is also interesting.  I hope the modern road from Athlone to Kinnegad will be completed quickly and the tolls continue to be paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Norris.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House this evening and I am delighted that his officials who were involved in going through the legislation in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office are here.  They must have had a great time.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, wonderful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love to have been with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator would love to have done it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Going through all these ancient Acts and deciding what to do about them must have been fascinating because simply reading the Schedules to the Bill was fascinating.  These include Acts such as that of 1154 stating that sons of &ldquo;villeins&rdquo; ought not to be ordained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear but some of them are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Under an Act of 1166 vagabonds, strangers, were not to stay more than one night <Col N="1941"/>in a house unless they became sick or their horse died.  That was reasonable but not having seen the legislation I do not know why they had to be kicked out so rapidly.  </P>
        <P>Many Acts dealt with marriage, not just between the King and Queen Jane or such matters but more general matters.  It is interesting how important that was because it was connected with possessions.  Widows were not to be forced to marry.  That is a serious problem in some parts of the developing where men die of AIDS and their widows are forced to marry another member of the family, to keep property within the family.  Heaven knows why it was so useful at that time to have such legislation.</P>
        <P>There are Acts to deal with the recognition of foreign marriages, in 1867 Odessa marriages, 1884, Greek marriages.  In 1851 an Act was passed for the removal of lunatics from India.  I hope it was only to remove Irish lunatics from India and that we were not expected to take everyone in.  It must have been a most exciting project and I congratulate the officials involved on their work.</P>
        <P>I am glad to hear that more will be done because when Senator Quinn and I discussed this before the debate he was anxious about some Acts such as that of 1473, on the treatment of foreign merchants which puts them under the protection of the king, whoever he might be.  There is a great deal of legislation that requires further investigation and I am delighted to see that these last two Bills have begun this work so well.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am perturbed however that we seem to be incapable of updating the phraseology we use in some of our legislation.  The Leader will recall that I was very angry when the Prisons Bill was introduced before Christmas and the term &ldquo;persons of unsound mind&rdquo; was again used.  Under that Bill, a person may lose his or her livelihood, even though there is no medical definition of &ldquo;persons of unsound mind&rdquo;.  I thought this extremely unfair and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s excuse regarding its inclusion related to the fact that it is contained in 157 other items of legislation.  That is no reason for continuing to use the term in question.  If we correct these definitions, they can be changed in all the items of legislation in which they appear.  This would be preferable to having terms such as &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo;, &ldquo;moron&rdquo;, etc., appear in statutes.  We should not use such terminology or allow it to remain in place, particularly when we are in a position to take action in respect of it.</P>
        <P>I was particularly interested in the most recent report of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, on vulnerable adults and the law, which referred in particular to the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  The latter is completely out of date but remains on the Statute Book.  The LRC suggests that we should investigate the position and was helpful to include replacement legislation &mdash; this could be modified by the Houses &mdash; in an appen<Col N="1942"/>dix to its report.  The Act to which I refer cannot just be repealed, it must be replaced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be replaced by legislation couched in a modern idiom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  We should be capable of replacing it, particularly in light of the expert guidance provided in the report to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I am glad Senator Lydon is present.  The LRC&rsquo;s report discusses the sort of approach that should be adopted regarding people&rsquo;s capacity to do things.  It states that the status approach to capacity involves making an across-the-board assessment of a person&rsquo;s capacity and that it views capacity in all-or-nothing terms and involves concluding that a person has no legal capacity based on the presence of a disability, rather than an assessment of his or her decision-making capabilities.  The report also refers to the functional approach and states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The functional approach to capacity involves an issue-specific and time-specific assessment of a person&rsquo;s decision-making ability.  It is related to ability to make a particular decision at the time it is to be made.  This is in sharp contrast to the all-or-nothing, one-off nature of a status approach to capacity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The LRC recommends that we should choose the latter approach, whereby an adult&rsquo;s legal capacity is assessed in respect of the making of a decision at the time it is to be made.</P>
        <P>Given that we are being provided with such guidance, why are we being so slow in respect of taking action in this important area?  The commission has recommended that where inappropriate terminology is used in existing legislation in respect of people who lack capacity, such as in the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871, this should be repealed and replaced.  In addition, it provides guidelines as to what action should be taken in this regard.  I recently asked the Leader whether the Minister of State, who is also Government Chief Whip, might add this &mdash; he is lifting his eyes to heaven &mdash; to the already quite long list of legislation to be dealt with before the end of the session.</P>
        <P>Another item of legislation about which I am concerned is the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811.  What is the meaning of that Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It means they were going to get married.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Act in question remains on the Statute Book and relates to people who were wards of court.  We included in the Civil Registration Act 2004 that people who are wards of court must have a certificate from a doctor in order to get married but I do not know what is the intention behind this.</P>
        <P>There is so much legislation similar to that to which I refer which remains on the Statute Book. <Col N="1943"/> It is fine to remove legislation relating to Princess Sophia&rsquo;s naturalisation and the King and Queen Jane.  However, we must address legislation that either needs to be replaced or that should be repealed.  I hope progress will be quick in this regard because it is not right to describe people in terms that no one would dream of using in public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I had thought I would be delayed elsewhere but I would not have missed this for the world because it is fascinating.  I echo the compliments expressed to the members of the team present in the Gallery, who have done a remarkable amount of work.  I am reminded of what Napoleon said with regard to codifying French law under the Code Napoleon.  Before Napoleon took this step, the law in France was, like Paris, chaotic and medieval.  This was at a time when Dublin was being developed as the first fully planned city in Europe.  The work done by those present in the Gallery represents an enormous undertaking and I congratulate them.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Henry that it would have been immense fun to engage in such work.  What we are being presented with is a complete, documented social history.  I will return to that matter later because I first wish to make some reasonable and rational points before indulging myself, as others have done, in the delights of the archaeology of the legal system, which are revealed in this rather large Bill.</P>
        <P>So much work has been done and I hope we have taken a further step and have, or are about to, catalogue these Acts by subject.  The latter would be extremely helpful, particularly if one could browse the entire list of Acts relating to conveyancing or whatever through the use of computer technology.  When new Bills are produced, they always have attached to them a rigmarole of the Acts which must be repealed.  In this Bill, we are being presented with a raft of such Acts.</P>
        <P>My second point is that I hope the important process in which we are engaged will continue.  I recall with great pleasure the Leader&rsquo;s digressive and discursive contribution to the debate on previous legislation in which she commented upon the arcane delights of Acts such as those to which the Bill refers.  This is an immensely interesting subject because it provides one with a picture of the history involved.  The process should continue.  We dealt with legislation of the sort before us on a previous occasion.  May I steal a phrase and state that there is &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;.  Does that ring a bell?</P>
        <P>The Local and Personal Acts have not yet been examined.  There are also private Acts and the Statutory Rules and Orders.  As Senator Brian Hayes indicated, some of the legislation and statutory instruments introduced post-1922 needs to be examined.  Members on all sides are of the <Col N="1944"/>opinion that this work is not finished and we look forward, in the knowledge that a great deal has been already done, to a further tidying up operation.</P>
        <P>A constituent contacted me regarding the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which remains on the Statute Book.  This is an extremely defective item of legislation.  I spoke to the principal adviser present in the Gallery &mdash; he has been already named and rightly celebrated &mdash; who indicated that there are two processes at issue here.  What is being done in the Bill merely involves retaining or repealing legislation.  The other form of Bill in this area involves repealing and replacing legislation.  Let us move on and engage in repealing and replacing legislation because it is ridiculous to have in place an Act from 1911 that does not meet current conditions.  Luckily, we did not experience incidents similar to those which incurred in Britain involving children being savaged by pit bull terriers, Staffordshire pups, etc.  However, there is nothing to prevent them from happening in the future and we need to consider the matter before a tragedy occurs.  I hope, therefore, that consideration will be given to introducing the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>I disagree with colleagues in respect of the Irish language.  It was a wonderful idea to try to extinguish the Irish language by legislation.  We are the most awkward, difficult, rebellious people on earth.  The Irish language has been a total calamity.  The best way to revive it would be to outlaw it and to make the penalty for using it death by hanging in a public place.  There then would be queues of people outside Linguaphone intent on learning the language.</P>

	<P>On the Bill of Rights 1688, the Leader was right to hone in on that.  What interesting legislation.  That was the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, the glorious revolution, and the Bill of Rights was to secure religious liberty because people were terrified that the Stuarts were secretly Roman Catholics.  The libertarian aspects of the Bill have been retained.  The one being got rid of is the one that permitted only Protestants to bear arms.  It is about time that one was repealed.  I have no difficulty with that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is jolly good of the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is rather decent of me.  This is a real compact history of the country.  The first one mentioned is the erection of castle and fortifications at Dublin &mdash; that takes it back to 1204 &mdash; and the establishment of fairs at Donnybrook.  It probably goes on to the extinguishing by Act of the fairs of Donnybrook because they became so outrageous.  They added the word &ldquo;Donnybrook&rdquo; into universal language.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased, as a former member of the board of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, to have the Act of 1474, the Confirmation to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral Dublin of foundation etc. and especially the Constitution called <i>Dignitas Decant</i> etc. retained, and the Marsh&rsquo;s Library Act 1707, also a period of extraordinary religious turbulence, when the great Bouh&eacute;reau came here and donated his entire library.  Archbishop Narcissus Marsh left money to erect that beautiful building in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Close.</P>
        <P>I am most interested in the Whiteboy Act, which is being retained.  Apparently, there was a Supreme Court case in the past 20 years or so which held that it was still active.  That is particularly interesting because this very night there is a television programme on RTE about the whiteboys.</P>

	<P>I believe I have a minute remaining.  I will only take half of it.  The General Post Office Dublin Act, establishing that wonderful building in O&rsquo;Connell Street designed by Francis Johnston, is being retained as is the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act 1884.  We should <Col N="1946"/>be grateful to the RDS because they took over this building from the Duke of Leinster and preserved it.  They had their science reading room, lecture theatre and concert hall and they built the wonderful cultural complex of the National Museum, the Natural History Museum, the National Gallery and the National Library.  This is the Act that led to the foundation of the museum.  We all stand greatly indebted to the people of the Royal Dublin Society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share seven minutes of my time with Senator Lydon.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill which is a fascinating exercise.  I compliment the team involved in it.  We are very much in their hands as they have the opportunity of studying the legislation and seeing what might or might not be relevant.  Most of the legislation served a purpose in its time although there were some dead letters then as now.</P>
        <P>Among the Acts to be repealed is the Freedom of Movement of the French in the Realm Act 1291.  I suspect that was an Act to restrict the freedom of movement of the French in the realm.  That should certainly be got rid of.</P>
        <P>There are a number of Acts Senator Lydon might talk about, including the Freedom of the Church of God Act and the Application to the Lord King if any of his officials are to be excommunicated, not to mention St. John of Jerusalem.  I am glad to see the attainder of my ancestor, Shane O&rsquo;Neill, repealed.  Alas, it did not stop his head being put on a spike outside Dublin Castle in 1566.</P>
        <P>There is one Act that should be examined more carefully because it has an ongoing relevance.  I refer to an adventurer called Erasmus Smith.  To this day, the Erasmus Smith fund is applied, as a result of a legal settlement in the late 1930s, to the Abbey School CBS, Tipperary, but I believe there are also Erasmus Smith scholarships in Trinity College.  It was divided into two halves in the 1930s &mdash; a Catholic half and a Protestant half.  We must ensure the Adventurers Subscriptions Acts of 1640 do not affect that.  I draw that point to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  I notice with interest that the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act of 1922 is to be repealed, something of which I entirely approve.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the Whiteboy Acts are being retained.  I hope it is not to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform denounce the rebels of the 18th century.  One of the great judicial scandals of the 18th century, 1766, was the execution of Fr. Nicholas Sheehy under the allegation that he was a whiteboy.  It is somewhat of a stain on our Statute Book that such legislation should be retained a moment longer than necessary.</P><Col N="1947"/>
        <P>I wish to make one further point of substance.  It is true in general that we should have a Statute Book that is consolidated and codified, similar to the Code Napoleon, sweeping away the clutter of previous centuries.  However, we must remember &mdash; I am mindful of a number of symbolic items of legislation &mdash; that we are not as yet a united country.  We could compare notes with our fellow rebels in America on whether there might be some merit in retaining two of the statutes that are part of the basis of representative government as opposed to democratic government, which are not quite the same.  One is Magna Carta, which is being retained currently, and the other is the part of the Bill of Rights which would have a great deal of meaning to another tradition in this island.  Some care needs to be taken in this respect.  I am mindful of the broader political implications.  This brings to mind philosophical thoughts.  I  would not be an unmitigated Burkean but I would not be unmitigated French revolutionary either.  A balance needs to be found.</P>
        <P>There are many amusing elements of this legislation that I do not have time to go into.  I will hand over to Senator Lydon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank God for the men of 1916 who ensured we can make our own laws and not depend, as we did for 800 years, on those of our nearest neighbour.  It is astounding there are 4,500 statutes that may be still in force and that 3,188 of these may still apply.  As Senator Mansergh asked, because of the inexorable move towards a united Ireland, have we taken into account consulting the people in Northern Ireland about the possible implications of removing some of these laws and statutes  to which they cling and are probably still law in their part of the country?</P>
        <P>Why are some of these laws to be retained?  It beggars belief, as Senator Norris said, that we are holding on to the Fairs Act 1204, whose subject matter is the erection of castle and fortifications at Dublin and the establishment of fairs at Donnybrook, Waterford and Limerick?  Why are we holding on to the City of Dublin Act 1215, whose subject matter is the annual rent for Dublin city?  Why the Sheriffs Act 1293, about the appointment of sheriffs and the Treatment of Foreign merchants Act 1473, which put foreign merchants under the protection of the King?  Members may be interested in the Parliamentary Privilege Act 1471 until they find it deals with the freedom from arrest of Lords coming to Parliament, and their servants.  I see less point of the Courts Act 1476 that lays down that the Lords must wear their robes in Parliament.  It beggars belief that the Marriage (No. 2) Act 1537, which concerned the succession between the King and Queen Jane, has any relevance to the Ireland of today.  The same can be said of the Piracy Act 1613 and the Pawnbrokers Act 1634.</P><Col N="1948"/>
        <P>I am delighted this is an ongoing process.  I believe, however, we should have been given a more detailed explanation of what these Acts involved.  There have been times we have rushed legislation without going into the detail.  We should be informed if the removal of some of these statutes could have various implications.  I am sure the researchers did a good job but sometimes they may make mistakes.</P>

        <P>My first impression about the range of legislation to be repealed and revised was how much of it related to drink.</P>

	<P><i>Plus &ccedil;a change.</i></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the list of statutes I found numerous references to drink through titles concerning either beerhouses, spirits, drunkards or inebriates.  I yet have to meet a lawyer who can tell me the difference between a drunk and an inebriate.</P>

	<P>Among the team of very brilliant people who drafted this legislation is a good friend and occasional adviser of mine.  I hope he will explain to me the difference between a drunk and an inebriate.  I suppose it is the difference between depression and elation.</P>
        <P>It is time we dispensed with so much of the offensive language contained in legislation such as &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo;, &ldquo;imbeciles&rdquo; and so forth.  There is the case for a separate and focussed research group to eliminate this appalling language that is still carried forward.  It is almost 15 years since I heard a Minister for Justice accept that the language was out-of-date but we are still waiting for it to be dispensed with.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Lydon&rsquo;s wonder as to why legislation dealing with the dress of Lords and their right, and that of their servants, not to be arrested on the way to Parliament is necessary legislation to be retained in the Republic.  There are wonderful phrases in some of the statutes such as the question of illusory appointments.  It brings to mind the more recent controversies about appointments to State boards which in some cases appear to be fairly illusory.</P>

      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Another statute dealt with the abandonment of railways.  It makes one wonder how much the world really changes.  I was fascinated by the Tithing of Turnips Act 1835.  I accept the Minister of State may not be able to cast some light on this, unless he has been doing a wonderful amount of reading.  Why is legislation dealing with the tithing of turnips which have been severed from the ground being retained?</P>
        <P>Joking apart, this is a wonderful exercise in learning our social, as distinct from our military, history.  Why does this revision exercise begin with legislation from 1169?  Ireland had a code of law before 1169.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Brehon law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Brehon law is referred to in one of the statutes being given a stay of execution.  Are we effectively saying that there was no rule of law before 1169, the year of invasion?</P>
        <P>Interesting themes can be identified in the evolution of legislation.  One is the gradual progression of the abolition of slavery in which the British Parliament was the most enlightened in the world at the time.  One of the great advocates for the abolition of slavery was the Liberator, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell.  He refused to visit the United States during his political career because of the existence of slavery there.  When he met political visitors from a state in the US where slavery was retained, he refused to shake hands with them.  I did not appreciate until recently the extraordinary consistency of his liberal beliefs.  It was not just about Ireland.  He had extraordinarily enlightened views on slavery and colonialism.  I accept he was not very enlightened about the rights of working people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not enlightened about the rights of women except in a certain category.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but 200 years ago no one was enlightened about women&rsquo;s rights.  Even women were not enlightened about their rights.  The slavery theme grows and one can observe a timeline in the increase of the ferocity of the legislation against it.</P>
        <P>Since I was first elected to the Seanad, I have always argued the phrase &ldquo;vagrancy&rdquo; should not exist in legislation.  It is not as offensive as &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo; or &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo; but it is a product of another time.  It is a judgment and presumption about very poor people.</P>
        <P>I am intrigued by the Irish Musical Fund Act 1794 and legislation concerning disorderly houses.  I presume the latter refers to drink rather than politics.</P>

	<P>A description of one of the Acts being repealed refers to the &ldquo;English not to stir up war&rdquo;.  I am not sure, in view of Prime Minister Tony Blair&rsquo;s activities, whether we are wise in repealing such legislation.  This Bill is not the stuff of high politics or high conflict, but it is an education and privilege to be involved in the debate.  We could go on forever entertaining each other with the peculiarities of the legislation but we will not do so.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in bringing the Bill through the Oireachtas.  I ask him to respond specifically on the issue of offensive language, including words such as &ldquo;imbeciles&rdquo; and &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo;.  We must deal with such language once and for all through one or more Bills.  No legislation should remain on the Statute Book that uses such language.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for the courtesy they have shown in this debate and for their genuine interest in this Bill.  It is always a pleasure to come to this House.  I will do my best to respond to some of the Members&rsquo; specific queries but I cannot deal with all of them.  I give a commitment, however, to respond before Committee Stage with relevant information, summaries of Acts and so on in regard to any queries Members may have.  This type of debate provokes further interest and research, and I would like us all to be as well prepared as possible on Committee Stage.  One Member asked why explanations were not given for all the Acts.  If Members contact my office, I will ensure as much information as possible is made available to them.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Brian Hayes for his comments.  He asked about the review of post-1922 legislation.  The Office of the Attorney General has prepared a database of post-Independence legis<Col N="1951"/>lation and it is hoped to commence preparation of a new Bill dealing with that in the coming months.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s better regulation programme, as set out in the 2004 White Paper, all Departments are working to identify and advance initiatives to reform, consolidate and codify key areas of legislation.  As Senator Hayes noted, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is advancing work on criminal justice.  The Department of Finance is considering a major consolidation of financial law, while the Revenue Commissioners have consolidated much of the legislation under their area of remit and are currently considering a significant initiative to reform customs legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, as usual, provided some interesting observations and expressed her desire that we continue this work.  I thank her for paying tribute to our research team.  She took us for an interesting journey through Kinnegad and Athlone.  I hope she will get credit for all the work she has done down through the years.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry spoke about the process of updating and simplifying legislation.  The Interpretation Act 2005 updates and simplifies the interpretation of statutes in a way that allows for legislation that uses more accessible language.  In response to Senator Norris&rsquo;s query, the Office of the Attorney General recently commenced a process of classifying the white list into various subject matters.  This will provide a blueprint for future law reform measures.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also asked about how the programme of legislative reform will be continued.  As part of the better regulation programme, the Government is committed to ensuring the Statute Book is up-to-date, modern and accessible to all citizens.  As such, work will continue in researching, removing and, where necessary, repealing any more recent Acts, as appropriate.  Work will also continue to modernise and reform the post-1922 legislation.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the Protection of Animals Act.  I advise Members that this legislation is not suitable for repeal as it is still in use.  Section 1(1), as amended, provides the current legislative definition of cruelty to animals, an important issue for all of us.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh asked about the Whiteboy Act.  Taking the view that much work has been done and much remains to be done, this is a good example of an Act in respect of which there is work to be done.  I understand it may still be relevant to the laws on riots and tumultuous risings.  I will convey Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is currently examining this area for the purposes of undertaking a project to codify the criminal law.  Members will appreciate there is so much work involved that it is virtually impossible to go <Col N="1952"/>into all the detail that is necessary.  We all agree that progress has been made and that significant work remains ahead of us.</P>
        <P>Senator Lydon asked why the Acts in Schedule 1 are being retained on Committee Stage.  Some are old but still relevant.  An interesting example of this is the Marriage Act 1537, to which reference was made in the High Court last November.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan mentioned Brehon law.  This was an oral tradition rather than a statute law.  After the Norman-English introduced statute law to Ireland, the Brehon Law was suppressed during the 17th century and no such laws survived in the legal system.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for participating in this short debate.  More time is required for debates of this nature.  I remind them to let me know if they have queries on any particular Acts.  There were many queries to which I cannot respond because of time restraints.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge, as Members have done, the work of the team of officials in the Office of the Attorney General who engaged in detailed and considerable research to identify both the statutes for retention and those for repeal.  It was a complex task to identify these Acts and all of us, including myself, would like to be involved in this fascinating process.  Much work remains to be done.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to respond to Members.  I also thank Members for giving this Bill the attention it deserves and for their detailed and insightful comments.</P>

      <sTitle>Domiciliary Care Allowance.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the matter of the payment of domiciliary care allowances in County Westmeath.  Perhaps this pertains to many other counties but I am dealing with the problems in County Westmeath.  Apparently, the position is that domiciliary care allowance claims received in the latter part of 2005 are being assessed and the waiting time for a decision is at least 18 months. <Col N="1953"/> Nobody can understand why it is taking so many months for a decision.</P>
        <P>Many people are waiting for this payment, principally mothers with children who require particular care &mdash; that is the reason for the domiciliary care allowance.  It is a very useful payment because often a mother must get somebody into the home if she has to go somewhere or special materials must be provided.  It is scandalous that people must wait a year and half to be assessed as to their suitability to be granted the domiciliary care allowance.  I am not blaming the Minister of State but the system.  That is the nub of the problem.</P>
        <P>A medical assessment must take place but surely it should not take 18 months to decide if a child is eligible and for the parent or guardian to be given the domiciliary care allowance.  I told those with whom I spoke that I would raise this issue in the House because I was quite gobsmacked, to put it mildly, that it should take 18 months for a decision.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Rourke for raising this matter on the Adjournment which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and for outlining the position in regard to the domiciliary care allowance.</P>
        <P>The domiciliary care allowance is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  The condition must be likely to last for at least one year.  Where medical confirmation is supplied which pre-dates the actual date of application and the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s senior area medical officer is satisfied that the child required continual or continuous care and attention, substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age, then payment may be made from the date the senior area medical officer is satisfied that such additional care and attention was required.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for domiciliary care allowance is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to the means test.  It is a matter for the HSE medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether or not a child qualifies for domiciliary care allowance on medical grounds.</P>
        <P>The current rate of payment for domiciliary care allowance which came into effect on 1 January 2007 is &euro;281.30 per month.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an increase of 12.1% on the rate of payment since June 2006.  Recipients of domiciliary care allowance also receive a respite care grant payment during the first week of June each year.  The rate of payment for 2007 will be &euro;1,500.  This is an increase of 25% on the rate of payment since 2006.</P>
        <P>In regard to the current situation in the Longford-Westmeath local health office area, I understand that the post of principal medical officer was vacant for some time and this resulted in a considerable backlog of applications for domiciliary care allowance.  I have been informed that this post has now been filled and the principal medical officer is endeavouring to clear this backlog as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>At present the area medical staff providing services in the Longford-Westmeath local health office area are also involved in dealing with the provision of immunisation services, nursing home inspections and child health assessments.  The Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a recruitment process for two additional senior medical officers for the Longford-Westmeath area to ensure adequate service provision in the local health office area and to deal with outstanding applications for allowances and other services.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the problems raised by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke.  The position is certainly not satisfactory.  I will try to ensure the senior medical officer is appointed as quickly as possible.  I understand the allowance can be backdated following examination of the application.  I know that answer is not satisfactory for the parents whom Senator O&rsquo;Rourke represents but it is an administrative problem.</P>

The Minister of State has stated he understands this can be backdated.  If parents or guardians are found to be eligible for domiciliary care, will it be backdated to the date of application for the domiciliary care allowance?</P>
        <P>My main request is to be supplied with this information tomorrow as I will attend a meeting of the parents in question tomorrow night.

      <sTitle>Genetically Modified Organisms.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House this evening.  I am trying to consider the issue regarding genetically modified food, crops and so forth from an economic point of view.  While I am sure the Department also considers it, I wonder whether it does so sufficiently seriously.  There is an increasing demand for food that is either organic or what members of the public would consider to be healthy, traditional and so forth.  I do not consider GM foods are likely to make me ill or to cause other people illness.  Unfortunately, we have had some issues in the past that have caused great lack of confidence among the public in respect of food.  I refer in particular to the development of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, in cattle due to bonemeal being fed to the animals and the subsequent development of new variant Creuzfeld-Jakob disease in humans who ate that meat.</P>
        <P>People have become highly suspicious of the assertions given to them that food is safe.  This is unfortunate because although the majority of food produced in Ireland is safe, it takes a long time to reassure people after something like that happens.  I had never heard of prions before the BSE scare or the development of the disease.  Interesting however, in the early 1970s, a vet in Trinity College suggested that these were possible vectors of disease.  He appreciated that even though they lacked nuclei.  However,  I do not believe much attention was paid to his findings.</P>
        <P>While I do not believe I will contract a terrible disease by eating genetically modified foods, there are those who are really put off by the idea of eating such foods.  As one person put it, while it is all well and good to assert that it is all right, one does not want to eat dog, as they do in China.  I do not believe it does them any harm.  Moreover, in west Africa, people eat agouti, a large rodent and people there have tried to feed it to me, claiming it tastes like a cross between chicken and rabbit.  I have declined, stating that I would manage myself.  While I am sure it would not do any harm, I do not necessarily wish to eat it.  Consequently, we must ensure people have the choice of what they wish to eat.</P>
        <P>The most recent complaint I received in this regard followed questions regarding animal feed put to the Minister for Agriculture and Food by Members of the Green Party on 1 December.  The lady who complained to me stated that apparently 75% of the corn imported to Ireland for ani<Col N="1956"/>mal feed is genetically modified.  She stated that she wanted choice as to the kind of feed consumed by the animals she was eating and she has a point in this respect.</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, used to agree with me that the fatty acids produced in grass-fed cattle are far more healthy for humans than the fatty acids produced in corn-fed animals.  I repeatedly told him &mdash; he agreed with me &mdash; that we should make selling points of such issues in Ireland and that it was economically important.  My complainant told me she wanted to have choice in respect of the food consumed by the animals.  However, being familiar with the findings regarding fatty acids, I could not tell her she was necessarily wrong, regardless of whether the corn was genetically modified.  While this subject may be rather esoteric, people are becoming increasingly careful about what they eat.</P>
        <P>I believe we should promote Irish food as health food and I am sure the Minister of State and all at the Department of Agriculture and Food would agree.  However, I wonder whether the Department has considered the economics of this issue sufficiently carefully.  I do not refer to the health aspects, which have been covered adequately, but to the economics of it.  Cheap food policies have driven the production of food since the close of the Second World War.  The proportion of people&rsquo;s income devoted to putting food on the table is now much less than was the case 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  While this is good, it does not mean necessarily that our nutrition is better.  As Members are aware, Ireland has experienced an explosion in obesity and type-2 diabetes.</P>
        <P>The outbreak of avian flu in the turkey farm in England, in which people have seen the battery farms that house poultry numbering in the hundreds of thousands and that are confined to a small area is also significant in making people think about what is going on in this regard.  One issue that concerns me greatly is that in such battery farms, the feed contains what are described as growth promoters, which are in fact antibiotics.  While they are not antibiotics eaten by the Minister of State, the Acting Chairman or me, they remain antibiotics.  As evident from the soaring sales of organic or traditionally reared chicken, many people consider the feeding of such growth promoters to poultry to be a serious problem.  Some people do not wish to eat them and people should be given choice.  Why can we not capitalise on this market?</P>
        <P>Apart from the fact that apparently nut allergies can pass through genetically modified corn, I am not particularly worried by its health implications.  However, I am seriously concerned about the fact that cross-pollination with organic <Col N="1957"/>and traditional crops in Ireland may be easier than we had realised.</P>
        <P>I am aware the EU legislation does not allow us to ban such items.  However, Austria, Germany, France and some other member states have cordoned off areas in respect of what can be grown there.  I wonder whether the economics of the increased demand for traditional or organic foods have been investigated thoroughly.  Ireland is a small island nation with a great agricultural tradition and I wonder whether this niche market has been properly investigated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this important matter in the House and I propose to address the topic in three distinct parts.  The first relates to the question of excluding GM crops from Irish agriculture, the second to cross-pollination between GM and non-GM crops and the third pertains to the issue of the economic value in respect of the GM crops.</P>
        <P>Before doing so, as the Senator referred to animal feed, I will clarify the figures in that regard for her friend.  While GM crops are not grown in Ireland, it imports a considerable amount of GM maize, soya and rapeseed for incorporation into animal feed.  I refer to import statistics from 2005.  A total of 464,000 tonnes of GM maize were imported, which constituted 95% of total imports.  The figure for GM soya was 204,000 tonnes, which also constituted 95% of total imports.  The figure for GM rapeseed was 4,300 tonnes, or 3% of total imports.  The aforementioned figures in respect of these GM foods might be even greater than Senator Henry thought.  While I do not know whether that is any consolation, I wanted to provide her with the figures as they are.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has stated in this House on a number of previous occasions, the rules governing the production and the use of GM crops within the European Union are set out in EU legislation.  The Senator also referred to this point.  The legislation has been jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council and is binding on all member states.  This legislation does not provide for the unilateral declaration of a GM free country or region as Senator Henry stated.  In effect, this means it is illegal for any competent authority to prohibit the cultivation of GM crops authorised under the stringent EU authorisation procedures and listed on the EU Common Catalogue of Agriculture Plant Varieties, should a farmer wish to cultivate such crops.  However, it should be noted that at present only one GM crop is authorised for cultivation within the EU and that is a GM maize variety only suitable for growing conditions in southern Europe, particularly Spain.</P><Col N="1958"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Notwithstanding that, options are available within member states and regions to restrict the growing of GM crops.  One option is the concept of voluntarily developed GM free regions, where a voluntary agreement is reached among all growers in a region not to grow GM crops.  Another option is to seek a derogation from the European Commission that, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, co-existence of GM crops with non-GM crops is not possible in certain regions in respect of certain named crops.  The cultivation of these crops can then be legitimately prohibited if the case made is accepted by the Commission.</P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to address is the question of GM crops cross-pollinating with non-GM crops.  The Senator may be aware that an interdepartmental working group established by the Department presented a report and recommendations on how best authorised GM crops could co-exist with non-GM crops should the Irish farming community decide to cultivate such crops.  We are considering the measures proposed by the working group in conjunction with observations I received in a public consultation process held early last year on the recommendations made.</P>
        <P>The proposed co-existence measures will focus on creating conditions during the cultivation, harvest, transport and storage of crops that will make it possible for conventional and organic growers to keep the adventitious presence of GMOs in their crops below the labelling thresholds established in community law.  Measures are also proposed to provide redress to an organic farmer who suffers verifiable economic loss as a result of admixture of GM crops with non-GM crops.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Minister for Agriculture and food, Deputy Coughlan, Teagasc carried out an evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the agrifood industry from the use of GMOs in crop and livestock production.  Teagasc based its study on the economic implications of allowing the importation into Ireland of certified GM-free soyabean and maize livestock feed ingredients only and the economic implications of GM-free crop cultivation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the first scenario, the study showed substantial additional costs would be placed on the livestock sector, particularly on specialist dairy and beef farmers, if they were to use certified GM-free soya and maize only in feedingstuffs.  In the second scenario, the study examined five hypothetical GM crops which could be grown here, including herbicide tolerant sugar beet, septoria resistant winter wheat, fusarium resistant winter wheat, rhyncosporium resistant spring barley and blight resistant potatoes.  This evaluation showed increased profits could be generated for growers of these GM crops compared to their conventional equivalent.  However, the evaluation also <Col N="1959"/>showed a significant cost would be incurred with regard to identity preservation for conventional growers in a co-existence arrangement.</P>
        <P>In a report prepared by the Irish Council for Bioethics in November 2005, Genetically Modified Crops and Food: Threat or Opportunity for Ireland? Opinion, the question of Ireland losing its &ldquo;clean green&rdquo; image if GM crops were grown in this country was addressed and it concluded, &ldquo;...fears over the loss of Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;clean green&rsquo; image, solely on the basis of the introduction of GM crops, would appear to be somewhat misplaced.&rdquo;  The need for further evaluations on the <Col N="1960"/>production and use of GM crops will continue to be monitored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply which I find extremely encouraging.  I hope we will not focus on short-term profits.  If she sees the former Minister, Deputy Walsh, in the corridors of power she might discuss with him the livestock sector, particularly fatty acids in beef.  A major selling point is that grass-fed beef is better for one than corn-fed beef.</P>
