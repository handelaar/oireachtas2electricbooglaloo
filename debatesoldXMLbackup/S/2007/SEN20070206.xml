	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate a timeframe in which she will enter into discussions with the patrons of Seamount College, Kinvara, County Galway with a view to ensuring provision is made for the enrolment of first year students in September.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify her response to the new information supplied concerning the provision of second level education in Kinvara, County Galway, following the announcement that first year students will not be admitted to Seamount College, Kinvara next September.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an up-date on the application by Scoil Etchen, Kinnegad, County Westmeath, for a proposed building project which is urgently required to facilitate the demand for places at the school caused by the increased population levels in Kinnegad.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to halt the spiral of decline in Ireland&rsquo;s native wildlife, and to ensure an effective national system is in place to monitor a range of protected species in the light of the recent European Court of Justice ruling on the matter, and <Col N="1722"/>the obligation under a UN resolution on sustaining biological diversity.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to initiate moves to provide a train service from Dublin to Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to indicate the steps she is taking to assess the economic advantages to Irish agriculture if GM crops which may cross-pollinate with conventional and organic crops are excluded.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene with a company, details supplied, in Roscrea, County Tipperary in order that it offers an enhanced redundancy package, other than the standard package, to workers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Ulick Burke, Kitt, Coghlan, Ross, Bannon and Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Ulick Burke and Kitt, who will share time, and Senators Coghlan and Bannon and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ross and Henry may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator O&rsquo;Meara as the Minister has no official responsibly in the matter.  It is a matter for the employer and employee.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Consumer Protection Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 6.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes each, those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes each and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 2, Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 6.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 8.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes each, those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes each and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We accept today&rsquo;s Order of Business as proposed by the Leader.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask her colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to come to the House <Col N="1723"/>and set out in clear, unambiguous terms what is the response of the Department of Health and Children to the incidence of the MRSA bug in our hospitals?  I make this request in the context of yesterday&rsquo;s statement by a senior microbiologist who was giving evidence at an inquest in Dublin that &ldquo;MRSA is endemic in every Irish hospital&rdquo;.  There is genuine public concern on this matter and people are frightened to go to hospitals, many of which leave much to be desired in terms of hygiene.  Crowds of people pass through the facilities every day.</P>
        <P>The Government can surely put in place a screening programme which would identify and monitor the particular virulent strain of MRSA of which some people are carriers, irrespective of the community strain to which this microbiologist referred yesterday.  This is a serious issue of public concern.  The Minister for Health and Children has raised the matter and has put a programme in place.  Clearly, however, we are not winning the war on infection.  In the context of the microbiologist&rsquo;s remarks, especially his contention that this particular strain of MRSA is spilling out into nursing homes, I call for a debate as soon as possible to hear what progress, if any, is being made by the Government in tackling this problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Tuairim agus m&iacute; &oacute; shin, d&rsquo;eisigh an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta foilseach&aacute;n nua le 10 bunriail chun an Ghaoluinn a chur chun cinn.  Ba mhaith an rud &eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht orthu si&uacute;d anseo.  T&aacute; siad an-r&eacute;as&uacute;nta agus an-phraitici&uacute;il, which is surprising, coming as they do from that Department, agus ba mhaith an rud &eacute; d&aacute; bpl&eacute;if&iacute; anseo iad.  Bheadh seans ag an Aire iad a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an T&iacute; chun iad a l&eacute;iri&uacute; agus a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; d&uacute;inn.  Phl&eacute;igh muid ruda&iacute; eile a raibh baint acu le cur chun cinn na Gaoluinne i rith na bliana seo caite, agus ba mhaith an rud &eacute; if we could pick up on all those issues relating to supports for the development of the Irish language.  The Leader indicated at one stage that such a debate might be useful.  I would appreciate if time could be allocated for such a discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On at least three occasions during the last term, Members on all sides of the House raised the issue of mandatory sentencing, and the Leader indicated that she might consider a debate on that matter.  I have expressed my view in this House on the constitutionality of mandatory sentencing.  There is a general view that the Judiciary is not imposing the mandatory sentences decided by the Oireachtas.  The only mandatory sentence that is always put in place is the life sentence for murder.</P>
        <P>Does it strike anybody else as strange that it is we, as Members of the Oireachtas, who are responsible for striking down sentences and facilitating early releases?  We have retained the situation where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can reduce the term of a life <Col N="1724"/>sentence.  Moreover, we all know a life sentence does not equate to a life sentence in reality.  The only reason this is so is that we, as politicians, intervene in these matters.  We must remind ourselves of this reality when we discuss mandatory sentencing.  Members of the Oireachtas are doing exactly what we insist the Judiciary should not, that is, interfering in mandatory sentencing.</P>
        <P>I bring this to the attention of the House in the context of the document we received this week from a former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, president of the Human Rights Commission.  This document deals with the determination of mandatory sentencing and makes clear reference to the separation of powers.  There is now a fresh reason that we should consider this matter.  We politicians continue to insist that the legislation we agreed on mandatory sentencing is not being implemented by others.  There is now a clear indication, however, that such sentences may not be in agreement with the Constitution, as is my view, and may also not comply with European human rights legislation.  It is crucial that we debate this matter during this session to consider our position and how we wish the system to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes on the issue of MRSA infection.  Reports in today&rsquo;s media relate that the consultant microbiologist to whom Senator Hayes referred claims that 30% of people now carry the MRSA bacteria but that it is a hospital-acquired infection.  It is clear that adequate steps are not being taken to ensure people do not contract this deadly virus and die as a result.  People have presented at hospitals, received whatever treatment they required and while the procedures they received were successful, they have died from MRSA.  That is totally unacceptable.  People are afraid to go to hospital in case they contract MRSA.  It is endemic in every hospital in the country and it goes back to the issue of hospital hygiene.  The Minister needs to look at who carries out that work in hospital.  Traditionally, the ward sister ensured hygiene standards were adhered to but now it is contract cleaners.  In some hospitals in the Cork region, contract cleaners come in at 7 a.m. and are gone before 8 a.m.  Can one honestly say that within that period of time sufficient work has been done to assure people and allay their fears that this type of bug or infection has been dealt with?</P>
        <P>Given the current climate, I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure there is no complacency in terms of how we respond to the outbreak of avian flu in the UK.  We must not be complacent but we must also ensure consumer confidence in our industry is not affected and do everything we can so that we do not suffer the same fate as our counterparts in the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal by Senators Brian Hayes and McCarthy.  MRSA is a major threat.  We dealt with foot and mouth disease and <Col N="1725"/>prevented it from spreading throughout Ireland but we cannot solve the MRSA problem.  Senator McCarthy is correct in this regard.  I call on the Minister to make a statement to the House on this issue.  People are terrified to go into hospital because they go in with one ailment and come out worse than they went in.  I have met many people who went into hospital for hip operations and came out with MRSA, which is worse than the hip problem.  It is a major threat.  </P>
        <P>We are concerned about avian flu and actions are being taken in that regard but MRSA is in our midst.  It is being carried into hospitals.  There is no control of hygiene or of visitors.  People visiting very ill patients are bringing MRSA to hospitals but nobody is taking any action.  The Minister will have to make a statement to the House in this regard.</P>

	<P>The HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are paying 36 cent per litre more for petrol in a station in Dublin than they would a few miles away on the other side of the city.  This is a rip-off of the HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1726"/>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002 the Government in its programme for Government declared that no child under nine years of age would be in a class of more than 20 pupils yet, tragically, 25% of children are in classes of 30 plus.  Some 50% of children are in classes of 20 to 29 children and 85% of children in national schools are in classes with pupil numbers greater than they were in 2002.  The Minister declared that she has revolutionised education.  All the measures she has taken have cost nothing.  This is one proposal which would have cost money and the Minister has failed to deliver.  As with Senator Leyden a few moments ago, I am sure Members will hear promises again as to what will be done in the near future.  However, in this instance this constitutes failure.</P>
        <P>A survey of 220 schools last November indicated clearly that despite the small increase in capitation grants, half of the schools in question are obliged to raise 50% of their running costs.  At present, we have cut price education and in many primary schools, parents and teachers are obliged to make substantial fundraising efforts to provide for the bare running costs.  The Minister for Education and Science should come before the House to indicate clearly whether she has a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools and what action she has taken this regard.  Members have learned of the welcome appointment of special education teachers.  However, classes have become larger and the students in such classes who need special education attention do not receive it.  This is the problem and the Leader should ask the Minister to come before the House as a matter of urgency to indicate her plans for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>While joining with other Members to express concern about the spread of avian flu and bearing in mind the possible restart of the World Trade Organisation negotiations following various private discussions at Davos involving Commissioner Mandelson, it is vital to have an effective and vigilant Minister and Department for Agriculture and Food, as we do.  Consequently, I am highly concerned by comments made by a handful of influential people in the media suggesting that agriculture does not really matter any more in an Irish context.  For example, last Saturday&rsquo;s issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> suggested there was no longer any justification for agriculture having a separate Department or ministry.  I completely reject such thinking and do not believe that any Government, or whatever composition, would fail to appoint a Minister with responsibility for agriculture, as its popularity would plummet forthwith if it did so.</P>
        <P>On the subject of agriculture, I draw Members&rsquo; attention to a subject on which they might hold a debate.  I refer to a report all Members will have received from the Trinity Development Initiative at the Institute for International Integration Studies, which has been conducting a two-year study on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. <Col N="1727"/> The key finding is that the benefits from reform would be highly skewed and that most benefits would be captured by a relatively small group of competitive developing country exporters, such as Brazil and Argentina.  As the really poor countries have preferential access to EU markets, such reform in developed countries might not bring significant gains to some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.</P>
        <P>Voices in this House have argued that we need CAP reform for the benefit of the poorest countries.  This study shows clearly that such reform would not be for their benefit and I ask Members to take note of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Mansergh has provided me once again with the opportunity to partly disagree with him.  While I am in favour of CAP reform, the Senator is correct to state that agriculture is a very important element in Ireland and should continue to be so.  On the other hand, I have no sympathy whatever for the proprietors of the Matthews factory farm.  Such places are concentration camps for animals and are extremely dangerous.  If we lose respect for other creatures on this planet, we quickly lose respect for ourselves and for our fellow humans.  Avian flu spreads like wildfire and the virus is capable of mutating within these horrible places, in which hundreds of thousands of birds are stuffed.  Yesterday, I mentioned this matter to my colleague, Senator Henry, who indicated that in some places the birds are so overfed their poor unfortunate legs cannot hold them up.  Therefore, I have no sympathy for the Matthews company.  Last April, employees were filmed playing bat and ball with live turkeys.  There is no respect whatever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Norris have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not get the single payment yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s call for a debate on this matter.  The unfortunate people with a good organic farm next door are the real victims.  I have no sympathy whatever for the Matthews farm.</P>
        <P>I have been reasonably patient on the matter of domestic partnership legislation.  The Civil Partnership Bill 2004 replaced the 2003 Bill.  An amendment was tabled in the name of the Leader which proposes delaying the Bill until further circumstances are met.  These are the resolution of current litigation regarding the recognition of foreign same-sex marriage, the finalisation of the report of the All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and the publication of the report of the Law Reform Commission on the rights and duties of cohabitees.  All of these have been done.</P>
        <P>I am fed up with this legislative constipation on the part of the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and <Col N="1728"/>the T&aacute;naiste.  It is time for movement or to get off the pot.  We waited long enough for this and people are tired of it.  If they have any intention they should move on it now and the Bill before the House meets every requirement.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I support Senator Brian Hayes in his call for a debate on health.  The MRSA situation is worrying.  It is endemic.  Yesterday, a radio report told of a woman who was so disgusted by the condition of the curtains around a relative&rsquo;s bed she took them home and washed them.  Patients also have responsibilities.  From contacts in the nursing business I know of patients in hospitals who do not observe high standards of cleanliness.  Everybody ought to be aware this is an extremely dangerous bug.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the call for a debate on MRSA and other hospital-acquired bugs and viruses of which we hear.  I bring to the notice of the House the fact that three wards closed in University College Hospital Galway because of such illnesses.  More than one year ago, I gave to the HSE the names of products which could deal with these issues.  However, I received no response from the HSE on whether the products are suitable.  Surely those working in HSE laboratories have had enough time to find a solution to the issue.  I suggest the use of these products is one way to deal with it.</P>
        <P>Other Senators raised the issue of visiting hours in hospitals.  People should co-operate with management.  However, the HSE has the responsibility to state what action it proposes regarding disinfecting wards and hygiene in hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>When speaking about crime it is easy to blame the Judiciary, which is why I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Politicians do not have a role after the Judiciary has made decisions.  In this context, I remind the House of a time when most politicians were troubled by people with road fines and other such issues.  They approached politicians to write to the Minister of the day to request him or her to examine the situation.  Often, it took up to two or three years for it to be processed.  The person involved could show the letter at the local Garda station as evidence of a petition to the Minister.  A judge in the west did politicians a huge favour when he criticised those who got involved in such decisions.  As a result, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, wrote to all politicians informing them that such an approach would no longer be countenanced.  In unique situations the persons concerned could directly petition the Minister themselves.  The Minister and the judge in question did us all a service on that occasion so I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s statement about our becoming involved in the decisions of the Judiciary.  It is not right. </P>
      
      </Speaker><Col N="1729"/>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the concerns expressed by colleagues over the MRSA bug.  Infection control officers should be employed in all major hospitals but is that the case and, if it is, what is happening in that regard?  The control and disposal of waste, especially human waste, have always been a nursing role, because of the high risk of infection.  I also share the concerns expressed over visitors.  I remember visitors to Mullingar General Hospital, now Mullingar Regional Hospital, being stopped at the door.  If there were two or three visitors, only one would be allowed in at a time.  What became of that prudent practice?  It has regrettably been discontinued.</P>
        <P>I realise that Chambers such as this are heat-generating but I hope corrective measures have been taken over the temperature in the House today, as it is somewhat lower than usual.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago Independent Senators tabled a motion which was agreed by the House and which resulted in a commission on auctioneering being established.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Members may have heard what auctioneers are saying now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission reported approximately two years ago, following which legislation was supposed to be introduced.  Can the Leader of the House say is the status of that legislation?  What programme is proposed and will it be forthcoming before the D&aacute;il is dissolved?  Two current issues make that legislation urgent.  One is yesterday&rsquo;s press report of a group of auctioneers announcing they intended to raise fees because house prices had plateaued.  I never noticed them reducing fees when house prices rose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

	<P>That is shameless advertising.</P>

	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The second point is important and also concerns auctioneers.  The week before last <Col N="1730"/>a court found an auctioneering firm at fault for misdeclaring in its brochure the size of a commercial property, resulting in an award against the firm of &euro;350,000.  Its defence illustrates what a scourge auctioneers can be in this society.  The company said it had included a get-out clause in the brochure stating that it was not responsible for anything incorrect shown therein.  That is a ridiculous situation, meaning a firm of auctioneers can tell as many untruths as it likes as long as it puts a disclaimer at the bottom of its brochure.  It is time for legislation to be introduced in this House to regulate this group of cowboys who have done such destruction to the housing market.</P>

	<P>This matter relates to the unfortunate animals and birds referred to by Senator Norris, which are so filled up with antibiotics that we are building resistances.  An MRSA strain outside hospitals is being brought into them.  We should take account of these facts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Alarm bells are ringing concerning climate change.  We have one of the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per head of population in the world, exceeded only by the US and Luxembourg.  Action must be taken urgently.  Our planet is being destroyed.  A debate is needed and I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the House on this issue.</P>
        <P>Next week, the EPA will produce a report that will damn the Government and our country because it will show that greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 25% since the 1990s.  We should be the lead players in trying to establish a global treaty on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  A small nation has a role to play.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s size, a debate on the matter could lead to something significant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to support the Senators who have called for some measure to be taken against filling stations that charge in excess of prices available elsewhere.  One could rightly <Col N="1731"/>say that people have a choice in where they can shop, but the filling station in question has a prime location.  It charges 38 cent per litre or &euro;1.72 per gallon more than other filling stations.  Per barrel, that is &euro;103 or $170, almost three times the price of a barrel of oil.</P>
        <P>The reason this is happening at that location is simple.  If I was travelling from England to Ireland and wished to fill my car&rsquo;s tank, I would wait until reaching Dublin.  Getting off an Irish Ferries ship, the first station one would come to if following a map or GPS to get outside Dublin would be one of the Republic&rsquo;s most expensive filling stations.  One would pull in and be charged more than anywhere else in the locality.  Should we re-examine the issue of a maximum prices order?</P>
        <P>In fairness to auctioneers, one such agency paid out a hefty sum recently for misadvertising the amount of space available in a property in Gardiner Street, which it overstated by 1,800 ft.  While the disclaimer in the small print stated that the agency was not responsible, the courts found otherwise and the agency paid out almost &euro;300,000 plus costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Maurice Hayes, I would like to see the debate on MRSA widened, as the bug is a serious issue.  While poor hygiene allows MRSA to spread, the issue is one of the overuse and abuse of antibiotics.  This ties into the issue of factory farming, particularly in respect of poultry because the feed used contains substances called growth promoters, which are antibiotics.  While they are not those given to humans, we must examine the issue in terms of the development of numerous human and animal resistant strains, not just resistant staphylococcus aureus.  I would support a debate on the issue, but we must broaden it.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.  I was slightly distracted by local electoral considerations.  In light of the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Middle East, could we have an update from him on activities in the area?  As we speak, it is hoped that Egypt is brokering an arrangement involving the two factions in Palestine to create a unity government.  The Minister also met Prime <Col N="1732"/>Minister Olmert of Israel, which gives the lie to the perception in this country that Ireland is anti-Israel.  This Government has taken an even-handed approach, as has been expounded in this House on all sides on numerous occasions.  In light of the visit and ongoing political developments, it would be instructive for the House to be kept informed and engaged in the most important international issue facing us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney has just pre-empted me, I was going to ask the Leader for a debate on the Middle East in view of recent events.  I second his request.</P>
        <P>There was no MRSA in the hospitals when they were run by the nuns.  That is the trouble.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator but unfortunately the nuns are gone.  Senator Brian Hayes asked for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House for a debate on MRSA, which a consultant yesterday said is endemic in every Dublin hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>He said it is endemic in every hospital in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was an alarming statement.  This is a virulent strain and it should be monitored.  It is, as Senator Henry pointed out, about more than washing our hands as often as possible, although cleanliness is part of it.  This week and next week we must deal with legislation, as was the case last week.  We have a mountain of it.  We will note this, however, and the Minister had promised to come to the House after Christmas.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole called for a debate on the Irish language, with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs coming to the House to outline developments.  He also mentioned the issue he has made his own, namely, mandatory sentencing, and asked why the Judiciary was not putting in place life sentences.  The Senator pointed out that the situation had arisen because politicians were interfering.  He also mentioned the salutary report from former Senator Maurice Manning and called for a debate on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator McCarthy said that people are afraid to go to hospital because of MRSA.  That is true and we have all heard people saying they will not go to hospital when they are ill.  The hospital in Mallow, the Senator&rsquo;s own area, received the top award for the second year running for a low instance of MRSA.  The Senator also mentioned avian influenza, noting how we are coping with that but MRSA, another virulent bug, cannot be combated.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden also called for action on MRSA.  He also raised the price of petrol in a particular service station, which charges 40 cent more than everyone else.  It must not want any business, which I find very odd, because we all <Col N="1733"/>hunt for petrol at 96 cent and 97 cent a litre and usually we get it.  Every petrol station is doing well because the price of oil is falling.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the pupil-teacher ratio.  Does life ever change?  This was an issue at the start of my political life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not an issue for this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>As he noted, several pages are devoted to the issue today in a certain newspaper.  The Minister for Education and Science appointed up to 500 special needs teachers on the premise that they were needed for those who were least academically inclined and required special help.  I believe everybody is glad of that.  Special needs assistants are available in every school for every child who needs them and special teachers are also employed, so we will hopefully be able to make progress on the pupil-teacher ratio.  However, I receive letters which describe alarming class sizes.  The conditions seem most harrowing, even when compared to my own time.  We will endeavour to have the Minister come before the House to debate the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh referred to the reopening of the WTO talks and noted that some in the media claim agriculture no longer matters and that we should not have a separate ministry for it.  That will not happen in Ireland, irrespective of who enters Government.  The Senator also mentioned the report compiled by the Trinity development initiative at the IIIS, which suggests that CAP reform will not help smaller or poorer countries.  That is amazing, given that everybody is of the opinion that reform will be of benefit to such countries.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the concentration camp-like conditions in which turkeys are being reared by a certain firm in the UK.  The turkeys have become so plump through over-feeding that they cannot stand up.  The Senator also inquired about the status of his Civil Partnership Bill 2004, which we will endeavour to determine.  The Bill is not proposed to be taken in this House within the next few weeks and I have seen no sign of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator also addressed the issue of MRSA.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt referred to the closure of three wards in University College Hospital, Galway, and the failure of the HSE to reply to the issues he has raised with it.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of fines.  A fines Bill will be published within the next two weeks.  The Senator also noted that a certain judge and Minister did everyone a service by making a decision about petitions to Ministers.</P><Col N="1734"/>
        <P>Senator Glynn stated that every hospital should have an infection control officer to deal with MRSA.  He also noted that the control and disposal of waste was part of the practice of nursing staff.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;referred to the commission on auctioneering and to plans by auctioneers to increase their fees because the price of houses has plateaued, despite the fact that their fees did not decrease while prices were rising.  I found the auctioneers&rsquo; claims to be humorous, although a Mr. Alan Cooke, who appeared on the radio at lunchtime yesterday, tried unsuccessfully to make sense of the issue.  With regard to the auctioneer who was fined &euro;300,000 for inaccurately describing the size of a building, pointing to the small print did not do any good in terms of avoiding penalties.  I wish Senator Ross well in his auctioneering career.</P>

	<P>Visiting Castlepollard would do no good for him.  The Senator sought a debate on climate change, which I would welcome.  However, he should understand that we will be dealing with legislation over the forthcoming three weeks, so we will not be able to hold general debates.  We will arrange to debate the issue when we have a lack of legislation.  </P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about a particular filling station.  Perhaps it is time again to have a maximum prices order, which would stop such activity.  Senator Henry spoke about the overuse of antibiotics, which clearly is one of the strongest factors in the spread of MRSA.  Senator Mooney referred to the great success of the Minister for <Col N="1735"/>Foreign Affairs and requested that the Minister come to the Seanad to discuss the findings of his visit.  Senator Mooney trumped Senator Lydon, but the latter still had his say on the matter and told us that hospitals have not been the same since the nuns departed, to which we say &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Consumer Protection Bill 2007: Order for Second Stage. </Title>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Bill entitled an Act to give effect to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive No. 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005), to establish a body to be known as an Ghn&iacute;omhaireacht N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Tomhalt&oacute;ir&iacute; or, in the English language, the National Consumer Agency and to define its functions, to make new provision in relation to pyramid selling schemes, to amend the Industrial Development Act 1993 and to provide for related matters.</P>

    <Title>Consumer Protection Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of the national consumer agency, the transposition into national law of the unfair commercial practices directive and the rationalisation and updating of the existing body of consumer legislation.  It also updates and significantly strengthens the law on pyramid selling.</P>
        <P>The Government has identified the development of national policy in the area of consumer protection as a priority for legislative reform.  Our aim is to ensure that such policy is fully synchronised with practices in a modern economy.</P>
        <P>This Bill implements one of the key recommendations of the Consumer Strategy Group, whose final report, Make Consumers Count &mdash; A New Direction for Irish Consumers, was published in May 2005.  The group was strongly of the view that a new agency should be established with a robust and expanded mandate to protect consumer welfare and represent the interests of consumers.  The group recommended that the new agency should have specific statutory functions in the areas of consumer advocacy, research, information, enforcement and education and awareness.</P>
        <P>To begin this process without delay, I established the agency on an interim basis in June 2005 <Col N="1736"/>and appointed a board and interim chief executive to begin putting in place immediately the infrastructure of the new organisation and building a rapport with consumers.  This Bill represents the next logical step towards a fundamental re-focusing of national consumer policy by providing the agency with all the statutory powers and functions it needs to do an effective job on behalf of consumers.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the Bill includes provisions allowing the agency to advocate the consumer&rsquo;s case forcefully in public debate.  These provisions are designed to ensure that the new agency will be a strong advocate for consumers within the policy-making arena, thereby ensuring that consumer interests are brought to the forefront of the national agenda.</P>
        <P>The agency shall also conduct, commission and publish research on consumer issues.  This reflects the strong view of the Consumer Strategy Group that well founded research is an essential prerequisite to enable the agency to act as a vigorous advocate for consumers.  By being well informed, the agency will be in a position to debate issues from a position of strength.</P>
        <P>The agency will also promote public awareness, conduct public information campaigns and promote educational activities and initiatives.  The aim and intention behind this shift in consumer policy is to empower consumers, make them better informed about their rights and allow them to be more assertive in exercising those rights.</P>
        <P>The Bill also incorporates important statutory protections for consumers by outlawing a wide range of unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices.  In this respect the Bill transposes the European Union&rsquo;s unfair commercial practices directive and also updates and modernises our existing national consumer protection code.  A total of nine existing statutes are repealed and replaced, the oldest of which dates back to 1887.</P>
        <P>This new body of law will ensure that consumers can have confidence that they will be treated fairly in their commercial dealings with traders and that the relationship between consumers and traders will be based on fairness and respect.  To enforce these statutory provisions, the agency will inherit the existing enforcement functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs but will also be armed with a number of additional and novel enforcement options.  In addition, the legislation provides for significant penalties for traders found guilty of offences under the Bill.  I will deal in detail later with these enforcement provisions.  Specifically, however, the Bill will ensure that the national consumer agency has all the necessary powers to enforce actively the statutory protections afforded to consumers and to pursue aggressively those traders who do not comply with their obligations.  The Bill further provides specific protections for persons who report offences to the national consumer agency.</P><Col N="1737"/>
        <P>I will now summarise the main provisions of the Consumer Protection Bill.  Part 2 provides for the establishment of the new national consumer agency.  Many of the provisions of this part impose standard corporate governance type powers, duties and obligations on the agency and its staff.  If there are particular issues I fail to mention, I will be happy to expand further on them when replying and I would welcome the contributions of all Senators in that regard.</P>
        <P>Within Part 2, section 8 is key because it sets out the agency&rsquo;s functions.  The agency will have a general function of promoting consumer welfare and will also be responsible for investigating, enforcing and encouraging compliance with consumer law.  The agency is given specific functions relating to advising and making recommendations to the Government and Ministers in respect of any policy or legislative proposal impacting upon consumers.  It will be empowered to recommend new legislative proposals to Ministers and will also be entitled to submit recommendations to any other public body regarding any matter impacting on the welfare of consumers.  The national consumer agency will also promote the development of alternative dispute resolution procedures as a means of resolving disputes arising out of consumer transactions.  Such arrangements are increasingly seen internationally as an alternative to expensive court proceedings.  Section 8 also makes the agency responsible for carrying out the functions previously exercised by the Director of Consumer Affairs and which are transferred to it by section 37.</P>
        <P>Section 9 allows the Minister to consult the agency in respect of proposals for legislation specifically aimed at consumers.  The section obliges it to keep existing consumer protection legislation under review and to submit to the Minister and other Ministers appropriate proposals regarding such legislation.</P>
        <P>Sections 10 to 13, inclusive, relate to the appointment of the members and the chairperson of the agency and set out the procedures with regard to meetings of the new national consumer agency.  They also provide for the manner in which the agency shall carry out its business.</P>
        <P>Sections 14 to 17, inclusive, provide for the appointment, and certain terms and conditions of employment, of the chief executive officer of the agency.  For example, these sections prohibit a former chief executive from acting as a consultant or taking employment where he or she may be likely to use or disclose information acquired in the performance of his or her functions as chief executive for a period of 12 months after the person ceases to hold the office.  The chief executive will be obliged to give evidence before Oireachtas committees.</P>
        <P>Section 20 obliges the agency periodically to prepare and submit to the Minister strategy statements and annual work programmes.</P>
        <P>It is critical that the State and the taxpayer should obtain maximum value for money from <Col N="1738"/>the resources employed in protecting consumer interests.  Thus section 21 provides that the agency shall enter into co-operation agreements with other public bodies to be prescribed by the Minister.  The purpose of such agreements shall be to facilitate co-operation and avoid of duplication of activities, while simultaneously permitting consultation and the conducting of joint studies and analysis between the agency and those other bodies that are parties to such agreements.  However, the inclusion of these provisions will also enable the agency to provide a strong consumer voice to complement the work of the various sectoral regulators and to question their decisions if they are seen to act against the interests of consumers.  Copies of co-operation agreements must be available to the public.  I intend to consult other Ministers before prescribing any other bodies in accordance with these arrangements.  However, I envisage that existing sectoral regulators will be among the bodies to be so prescribed.</P>
        <P>Section 22 requires the agency to provide the Minister with a copy of its annual report and requires such reports to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 23 obliges the agency to keep proper accounts and to submit its accounts for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Copies of the accounts and of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report shall be presented to the Minister who shall lay copies of them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Sections 25 to 29, inclusive, provide important administrative powers and obligations in regard to the staffing of the agency and the conduct by it of its business.  This includes, for example, provisions in regard to the disclosure by board members of beneficial interests, the power of the agency to recruit consultants, have a seal of office and borrow money.</P>
        <P>Section 30 provides that the agency may appoint authorised officers for enforcement purposes.  Authorised officers employed by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs who were appointed under the Consumer Information Act 1978 will be transferred to the new agency.  The section sets out the powers of authorised officers to enter, inspect and search premises in investigating alleged breaches of the Bill.  Officers may be accompanied by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.</P>
        <P>Section 31 and 32 relate to the circumstances in which confidential information, including that relating to the commission of offences, may or may not be disclosed by the agency.  The agency will, for example, be permitted to disclose such information to, and receive it from, certain prescribed bodies, including other enforcement agencies.</P>
        <P>Among the remaining sections of this Part of the Bill, I draw particular attention to section 35, which allows, among other things, for the transfer of existing staff of the Office of the Director of <Col N="1739"/>Consumer Affairs.  These staff are currently civil servants employed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  At any time within 24 months following the establishment of the agency, they may opt to return to the Department and preserve their Civil Service status.  There will be no change to their terms or conditions of employment.</P>
        <P>Sections 37 to 39, inclusive, provide for the effective transfer of functions, property and agreements vested in the Director of Consumer Affairs to the agency on establishment day.  This will allow for the smooth transition from one public body to another without any interruption in the public services provided.</P>
        <P>Part 3 moves away from the administration of the new agency.  Its main focus is on prohibiting a wide range of unfair, misleading or aggressive trading practices.  This part also transposes the EU&rsquo;s unfair commercial practices directive.  The aim of this directive is to harmonise the laws of European Union member states and provide a high level of consumer protection.  Consumers will enjoy similar levels of protection for purchases made throughout the European Union, while business will benefit from having a common framework of rules instead of a host of disparate national regulations.</P>
        <P>Studies undertaken by the European Commission show that Irish consumers make higher levels of cross-border purchases and Irish business has higher levels of cross-border sales than the European Union average.  The harmonisation effected by the directive will, therefore, benefit both consumers and business in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This part of the Bill introduces a number of new elements to Irish consumer law.  Ireland, for example, is one of the few EU member states that do not have a general legislative clause dealing with fair and unfair trading towards consumers.  Section 40, which gives effect to a general prohibition of unfair commercial practices, fills this gap in our consumer protection code.  It provides that a commercial practice is unfair where it is contrary to the general principle of good faith in the trader&rsquo;s field of activity and the standard of skill and care that a trader could reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers.  The main advantage of a general clause of this kind is that it can be used to combat novel commercial practices that are not covered by specific provisions in consumer legislation as well those that are consciously designed by unscrupulous traders to fall outside the scope of such legislation.</P>
        <P>Sections 42 to 44, inclusive, prohibit misleading commercial practices.  These provisions have some elements in common with those of the Merchandise Marks and Consumer Information Acts on false and misleading trade descriptions and advertising.  However, they go further than the existing law by providing a non-exhaustive list of such practices.</P><Col N="1740"/>
        <P>Section 45 provides that the omission of material information to consumers is a misleading practice.  This is not expressly provided for in existing legislation and is a useful addition to it.</P>
        <P>Section 47 allows the Minister to make consumer information regulations to specify certain information that should be provided to consumers in specified transactions.  The section is broadly similar to the provisions of the Consumer Information Act on marking and advertising orders.</P>
        <P>Sections 49 to 51, inclusive, relate to aggressive commercial practices and bring a further new element in our consumer protection law.  Aggressive commercial practices are defined as those involving harassment, coercion or undue influence that impair consumers&rsquo; freedom of choice or conduct and affect their purchasing decisions.  They include pressure sales tactics that seek to intimidate or coerce consumers and practices that seek to take advantage of consumers who are vulnerable by virtue of misfortune or circumstance.  The practices described in the these sections are prohibited only in circumstances where they would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that he or she would not otherwise make.  The intention behind this test is that a practice should not be regarded as unfair, misleading or aggressive unless it actually impinges on consumer decisions.</P>
        <P>Section 52 contains an extensive list of commercial practices that are prohibited in all circumstances.  These are not subject to the same test on the basis that they are deemed of their nature to impair consumer decision making in all cases.  These practices include prize promotions where there is either no prize or consumers must make a payment to claim a prize, claims that products can cure illnesses where they cannot, false claims that a product or trader have an endorsement or authorisation or that a trader is about to cease trading or move premises, and persistent unwanted cold calling.  While some of these practices might well have been covered by the provisions in our existing legislation, others most certainly were not and it is helpful to have them dealt with by means of clear and specific prohibitions.</P>
        <P>Sections 54 to 57, inclusive, relate to price display regulations, the provision of weighing facilities in grocery retail outlets and the prevention of persons from reading prices.  These provisions are based on provisions in existing domestic consumer legislation which still have a useful role to play.</P>
        <P>Before discussing section 58 and section 59 that deal with the fixing of maximum prices during a state of emergency affecting the supply of a product, I would like to refer to the extensive range of other price-fixing powers that are being repealed by this Bill.  The Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 confer seven separate powers on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to fix maximum prices.  The only one of these that is <Col N="1741"/>being retained is that dealing with emergency situations.  The Consumer Strategy Group recommended the repeal of the price control provisions of the Prices Acts, and this view is supported by the Competition Authority, the ODCA and the NCA.  Our experience with price controls, particularly in the period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s when extensive recourse was had to them, strongly supports the view that they are a wholly ineffective way of restraining prices.</P>
        <P>Emergency situations can arise, nevertheless, in which normal competitive forces do not apply and it is prudent to make provision for such circumstances.  Factors such as the volatility of oil supplies, the increased likelihood of extreme weather events and the lengthening of supply chains for many products underline the need for such a provision in my view.</P>
        <P>Section 59 amends the provision at section 16 of the Prices Act 1958 by providing that orders fixing maximum prices during a state of emergency should be made by the Government and not by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am doing this to emphasise the exceptional nature of these powers.</P>
        <P>Part 4 deals with pyramid schemes.  It replaces the Pyramid Selling Act of 1980, which has proved ineffective in dealing with modern manifestations of pyramid selling.  It also expands considerably on the relatively brief provision on pyramid schemes in the unfair commercial practices directive.  It prohibits participation in pyramid schemes as well as the establishment, operation or promotion of such schemes.  It also seeks to close off the loopholes in the existing law that the promoters of these schemes have exploited by, among other things, seeking to depict payments to the schemes as &ldquo;gifts&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The penalties for offences relating to pyramid schemes are also being increased to a fine of up to &euro;150,000 and a prison term of up to five years.  I see pyramid schemes as an exploitation of human weakness and I am determined that the law should take a tough approach to those who promote and participate in them.</P>
        <P>Part 5 deals with civil and criminal enforcement.  Under existing law, the Director of Consumer Affairs effectively has just two ways of getting businesses to comply with their legal obligations.  The director could use his or her influence to seek voluntary compliance from traders or could take criminal proceedings against them.  Although the Act gave the director power to seek an injunction against misleading practices, such injunctions could only be obtained in the High Court, a factor which made them a difficult option in the majority of cases.</P>
        <P>The efforts of successive directors and their staff to secure voluntary compliance with consumer legislation have achieved a great deal over the years and will continue to be an important part of the work of the national consumer agency.  Modern regulatory thinking, however, emphasises the need to provide enforcement bodies with <Col N="1742"/>a wide and flexible range of powers and sanctions to secure compliance with the law and, where necessary, to ensure that those who flout it are dealt with firmly and effectively.  Thus, the Bill provides for a number of intermediate steps which may be used before taking legal proceedings against an errant trader.</P>
        <P>Section 70 provides that where the agency considers there is a case for seeking an injunction or prohibition order against a trader in respect of a prohibited act or practice, it will have the option of accepting a written undertaking from that trader containing whatever terms and conditions the agency considers appropriate in the circumstances.  If the trader subsequently fails to comply with the terms of the undertaking, the agency may then apply for a prohibition order.</P>
        <P>Section 72 similarly provides that when the agency considers that a trader has been engaging in prohibited activity, it will have the option of serving a compliance notice on the trader concerned directing him or her to remedy the prohibited act or practice.  If the trader does not appeal the notice, it takes effect within a specified period.  Failure by a trader to comply with the terms of a compliance notice is an offence and may lead to the taking of criminal proceedings against him or her.</P>
        <P>These provisions have clear advantages for the agency, which will have new options for dealing with traders where costly and time-consuming recourse to the courts may not be necessary.  It has advantages for traders who are given the opportunity and incentive to correct their behaviour and comply with their obligations without having to face court proceedings.  Businesses that enter into undertakings with the agency, however, or accept compliance notices served by it and then proceed to ignore the terms of those undertakings or notices will face legal proceedings and whatever sanctions may result from those proceedings.</P>
        <P>Section 82 will permit the agency to impose on-the-spot fines on traders for offences relating to price display.  This is in line with a recommendation of the Consumer Strategy Group and again reflects the view that, where it is practicable to secure effective enforcement of consumer law by means other than going to court, this should be done.</P>
        <P>Many businesses spend a great deal of money building a reputation for themselves and their products. Bringing to public attention the names of those traders who breach consumer legislation, therefore, can be a powerful sanction and a compelling incentive to compliance.  This is especially so for large businesses for which fines may represent a negligible sanction.  Section 79 permits a court, on the application of the agency, to require a trader convicted of a number of specified offences to publish, at his or her expense, a corrective statement in respect of the facts relating to the offence.  Section 83 requires the agency to maintain a list of traders convicted of criminal <Col N="1743"/>offences, subject to court orders, giving an undertaking, served with a compliance notice or subject to a fixed payment notice, and to publish this list at any time and in any form it considers appropriate.</P>
        <P>A further element of this part of the Bill to which I would like to draw attention is the enhanced provision made for redress for consumers.  Section 71 gives consumers aggrieved by a prohibited act or practice a right of action for relief by way of damages against the trader who has committed the act or practice in question.  In some cases it is sufficient that a practice detrimental to consumers is halted whether as a result of civil or criminal proceedings.  In others cases where consumers have suffered loss or damage as a result of such an act or practice, it is right that they should have an opportunity to seek redress for that loss or damage.  Section 79 further permits a court to require a trader convicted of an offence under the Act to pay appropriate compensation to a consumer who has suffered loss or damage as a result of the offence. Such a compensation order may be instead of, or in addition to, any fine or penalty the court may impose on the trader.</P>
        <P>Part 5 provides for tougher penalties, particularly for repeat offenders.  Section 76 maintains the existing maximum fine of &euro;3,000 for summary convictions and &euro;60,000 for convictions on indictment.  However, the section also provides for a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 for a subsequent summary conviction for the same offence and of &euro;100,000 for a subsequent conviction on indictment.  The section also provides for additional penalties for continuing contraventions by persons convicted of offences.  It is right in my view to penalise more heavily those traders who repeatedly breach the law.  A substantial part of the overall detriment suffered by consumers results from the activities of a small number of hard-core transgressors, and these should be a particular target of enforcement action.</P>
        <P>Sections 85 and 86 give recognition to codes of practice drawn up by traders or groups of traders, allow the agency to approve such codes and for the provisions of a code to be admissible in court proceedings.  Section 87 allows the agency to issues guidelines to traders and consumers alike in regard to the practicalities of transacting business.</P>
        <P>I also alert the House to the fact that I will be introducing a number of mainly technical amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to tidy up some residual drafting matters.  I also propose to introduce some additional powers in regard to product safety and casual trading, two matters of particular concern to consumers.</P>
        <P>There is one non-consumer provision in the Bill.  Section 93 amends the Industrial Development Act 1993 to give retrospective effect to an assignment of powers made by Forf&aacute;s to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland on 26 May 2006. <Col N="1744"/> The assignment of powers is being made retrospective to 25 July 2003, the date the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 came into effect.  This provision is necessary because the 2003 Act consolidated provisions dealing with employment grants that had been included in the 1986, 1991 and 1993 Acts.  As a consequence, a new assignment of powers to the agencies to make employment grants under section 25 of the 2003 Act was necessary.  However, this assignment was not made until 26 May 2006 with the result the agencies were acting <i>ultra vires</i> in approving employment grants between 25 July 2003, when the 2003 Act was commenced, and 26 May 2006.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General has advised that primary legislation is necessary to make the assignment of powers retrospective to 25 July 2003.  While any potential financial liability arising for the State on foot of the delay in assigning the powers is judged to be minimal, I am of the view that any potential risk should be closed off by introducing the necessary validating legislation at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a fundamental realignment of national consumer policy by establishing a new agency with much expanded and enhanced powers and creating a forceful new consumer advocate, a role lacking in public debate and policy-making in recent years.  The Bill replaces nine existing Acts with a single statute.  This represents a significant gain in the accessibility and transparency of our consumer protection code and one that I am determined to extend to the remaining areas of that code.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party will support the Bill on Second Stage but will seek to amend it on later Stages.  The Bill is frightfully late and shockingly weak.  The national consumer agency has nothing like the powers it needs to protect consumers.  The Fine Gael Party has been calling for a strengthened version of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for over two years.</P>
        <P>For the past eight years Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have played a cruel, <i>laissez-faire</i> game with consumer&rsquo;s rights.  They sat back as the economic boom they inherited let rip and every scam artist and rip-off merchant made a mint.  Consumers were treated to the highest inflation and prices in Europe with the worst value for money.  After years of this hardship, the Government comes up with a new agency.</P>
        <P>When Fine Gael attempted to create a consumer rights enforcer through a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen referred to &ldquo;comprehensive measures and policies already in place and envisaged, both domestically and internationally, to protect and represent consumer interests&rdquo; and instructed Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Deputies to vote down our <Col N="1745"/>proposals.  I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to abolish staged payments, a most unfair practice and contrary to the consumers&rsquo; interests, but it too was voted down.  Staged payments are counter to the EU directive on unfair commercial practices and an existing provision in Irish law, recently brought to my attention.</P>
        <P>During the launch of the rip-off Ireland campaign, my fellow Kerryman, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, condemned Fine Gael for even raising the issue, asking what rip-off.  I am glad he has been shouted down at Cabinet and the Government has started to acknowledge the problem.  Senator Leyden claimed that Fine Gael was single-handedly destroying Irish tourism by even mentioning this issue.  When we launched the campaign, he asked the Seanad, on 10 November 2004:</P>
        <P LI="1">Why is Fine Gael trying to jeopardise employment and tourism by discouraging people from visiting Ireland? I have travelled in different parts of Europe and, irrespective of the costs, Ireland is relatively competitive in many areas.  This has not been recognised on the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Government is the father of rip-off Ireland.  No fewer than 50 stealth taxes have been introduced by the Government since it won the last election.  From ESB bills to passport fees, the only way has been up.  Ireland has become a consumers&rsquo; graveyard with annual inflation at its highest level for four years and further electricity price rises on the way.  The price increases in the 12 months to December 2006 are the highest for four years.  Prices are up 4.9% and the electricity price increase has yet to bite.</P>
        <P>A comparison with prices across Europe shows that Irish prices have risen in the past 12 months at a rate 26% faster than in the rest of the euro area.  Put simply, Irish price increases in Government-regulated sectors and sheltered service are more than twice that in the rest of Europe.  Yet, in contrast, price increases in Irish goods markets have been far slower.  These trends are continuing a prevailing pattern making Ireland the dearest country in Europe.  This is all as a result of poor public policy promoted by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.  Goods in our shops have not increased at all in price over that entire period.  The prices of services delivered by companies exposed to international competition have actually fallen.  Yet prices in sheltered service sectors have grown by 24%.  This is the main driver of inflation over the past five years.</P>
        <P>While the Bill will establish the national consumer agency on a statutory basis, it has been in a state of semi-existence since last year.  The Fine Gael Party has been singularly unimpressed with it.  Take for example the strange events surrounding the exit of BUPA Ireland from the health insurance market.  That decision highlighted the complete ineptitude and powerlessness of the structures and bodies set up by the Government <Col N="1746"/>to protect consumers&rsquo; interests.  It was extraordinary that the national consumer agency and the Competition Authority responded so weakly.  The agency&rsquo;s silence was shocking but not surprising.  Even the Minister&rsquo;s most enthusiastic supporters could not believe his claims that the agency is more than window-dressing.  The Government may think it can substitute the odd radio commercial for a proper consumer policy but consumers, and voters, know differently.  They will remind Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats of that.</P>
        <P>For the past two years my party has been calling for a consumer rights enforcer with real power to root out blockages to competition and ensure consumers get the fair deal they deserve.  Under our proposals, the new body would have the same status as the Ombudsman and would cut the umbilical cord with Departments that represent vested producer interests.  The office of the consumer rights enforcer would replace the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and be a pro-active champion, watchdog, defender and advocate of consumers&rsquo; rights and interests.  A key feature of such an office would be its independence.  To be properly effective it would need to be a stand-alone office with its own staff and a secure budget.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Specifically, a consumer rights enforcer would conduct regular price surveys that highlight good value and name and shame those charging excessive prices; create a price league website with tables on all major products; develop codes of conduct for service providers and retailers on issues like passing on exchange rate movements; devise and promote a good practice provider quality mark for suppliers of goods and services that agree to be bound by relevant codes of practice; work with local authorities to drive a pro-consumer agenda at local level involving regular price surveys and measures that protect consumers&rsquo; interests against local cartels; and represent the consumer in national partnership agreements.  It is clear that recent agreements have been dominated by the producers with consumers given little thought.  These are the proposals the consumer needs and should be in this Bill.  We look forward to the Government including them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his team of senior officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I compliment them on bringing this comprehensive Bill before the House.  The Minister established the interim national consumer agency in 2005 in response to recommendations in the report of the Consumer Strategy Group.  This interim arrangement was worthwhile because it got the process moving.  The agency is already a well established body and I commend it on its current initiatives.</P><Col N="1747"/>
        <P>The Consumers Association of Ireland, a voluntary organisation whose chief executive is Mr. Dermot Jewell, was in place before the establishment of the national consumer agency.  This organisation was funded by the Department and I assume it will continue to receive some level of support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It might have been better if this body were amalgamated with the new national consumer agency to prevent any duplication of functionality.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment, the national consumer agency has put in place a highly informative and accessible website which clearly outlines consumers&rsquo; rights and updates them on relevant consumer news, including developments in regard to PIN number technology for credit and debit cards, customs charges on on-line Internet purchases, hidden charges by banks, telecommunications companies and so on, procedures for switching telephone companies, and details of the &euro;50 million of Dublin Bus refunds that remain unclaimed.  These are all worthwhile initiatives.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the progress of Fine Gael&rsquo;s campaign on consumer issues.  I was delighted when that party followed my initiative in naming and shaming those service providers who do not offer consumers good value.  I raised the issue of variations in petrol prices throughout the State, a problem that persists.  In the latest edition of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, for example, we are told that a filling station at Usher&rsquo;s Quay in Dublin is charging &euro;1.35 for a litre of petrol, some 36 cents more than the average price of 99 cents.  I wish to alert both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive to this issue because this petrol station is a designated fuelling location for both organisations in the central Dublin area.  The price it is charging represent an enormous rip-off that is taking place under our noses.</P>
        <P>Why has the national consumer agency not responded to revelations about this petrol station&rsquo;s practices?  The agency should take a proactive approach by interviewing those involved to ascertain the circumstances in which any State agency, whether the HSE or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can commit themselves to purchase diesel and petrol from this outlet?  It is a Statoil station, which company has recently been taken over.  This is an important issue.  I am surprised there are no members of the national consumer agency in the Chamber today.  When a Bill of this nature is being discussed, I would expect a representative to be in attendance.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan is confident about the Fine Gael strategy on consumers and, in particular, its website, <i>ripoff.ie</i>.  However, the information included on this website on taxi prices dates from August 2005, while the cost of disability infor<Col N="1748"/>mation relates to November 2005.  It seems there has been a lull in which Fine Gael has given up the ghost as far as quality is concerned.  Data on fresh food prices were last updated in July 2006.  Information on funeral expenses, meanwhile, died a death in July 2005, and car rental figures have not been updated since Christmas 2005.  A section detailing news items about rip-off Ireland has not been added to since June 2005.  It is case of RIP for rip-off Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems there was a flurry of activity which suddenly came to a halt.  Perhaps Fine Gael&rsquo;s backroom boys will pay heed to this debate and examine the party&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>We cannot rely on any one party to guide us in this area.  That is why the national consumer agency was established.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan proposes major amendments to this Bill because, Fine Gael claims, the measures it contains are not strong enough.  The out-of-date data on Fine Gael&rsquo;s website suggest an inactive organisation.  The Fine Gael Party must provide more up-to-date information if it wishes to get into power.  Perhaps it accepts that rip-off Ireland died in 2005, coinciding with the establishment of the national consumer agency.  I presume Fine Gael is satisfied the agency has taken over its responsibilities in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.  As far as the Minister is concerned, however, it is difficult to prepare a Bill of this size and complexity.  Instead of waiting for the Bill to go through, he wisely established the body on an interim basis in 2005.  This Bill is so complex it is vital it is passed without delay.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1749"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It includes many effective provisions, as I will outline presently.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to elaborate on his reference to a non-consumer provision in the Bill.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 93 amends the Industrial Development Act 1993 to give retrospective effect to an assignment of powers made by Forf&aacute;s to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland on 26 May 2006.  The assignment of powers is being made retrospective to 25 July 2003, the date the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 came into effect.  This provision is necessary because the 2003 Act consolidated provisions dealing with employment grants that had been included in the 1986, 1991 and 1993 Acts.  As a consequence, a new assignment of powers to the agencies to make employment grants under section 25 of the 2003 Act was necessary.  However, this assignment was not made until 26 May 2006 with the result that the agencies were acting <i>ultra vires</i> in approving employment grants in the period between 25 July 2003, when the 2003 Act was commenced, and 26 May 2006.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Attorney General has advised that primary legislation is necessary in order to make the assignment of powers retrospective to 25 July 2003.  While any potential financial liability arising for the State on foot of the delay in assigning the powers is judged to be minimal, I am of the view that any potential risk should be closed off by introducing the necessary validating legislation at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is suitable that this provision be included in this legislation rather than having to bring forward another industrial development Bill, necessitating a further delay.  We should note this important provision.  I do not see how any liability could arise because we are talking about the provision of grant-aid.  Science Foundation Ireland has done great work since its establishment and has been an enormous success.  Representatives of that body gave evidence before the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business last week of the work it is doing and the amount of assistance it has provided.</P>
        <P>As well as providing for the establishment of the national consumer agency, the Bill also gives effect to the unfair commercial practices directive and allows for the prohibition of unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices.  A blacklist of 23 misleading and eight aggressive commercial practices are set out, including pyramid schemes, false claims about products and bid advertising.  Pyramid selling was highlighted in Cork city &mdash; in an area perhaps close to the Minister&rsquo;s constituency &mdash; and I believe throughout the county.  As far as I recall, it was highlighted on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with Joe Duffy.  A number of people have been misled by pyramid selling.  It is strange how people can be taken in by a scheme <Col N="1750"/>which was very active in the 1960s and 1970s.  Legislation was introduced but, apparently, it was not strong enough to prohibit pyramid selling.  The Minister has strengthened the provision in this Bill.</P>
        <P>It is very important the National Consumer Agency forms a network of support throughout the country in regard to consumer issues, for example, obtaining and preparing information on supermarket costs.  Has the Minister detected a decrease in the cost of products in the supermarket chains since the ban on below cost selling was removed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is down by 1.6%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is certainly a vindication of the Minister&rsquo;s stand in that regard.</P>
        <P>There is great competition among retailers.  All the major retailers, including Dunnes Stores and Tesco, are in my home town of Roscommon.  All the local shops are still competing very effectively against the multinationals.  When the ban on below cost selling was removed, I was concerned it could put them in jeopardy but that has not been the case.  It has not been brought to my attention, although Senator Coghlan may have found otherwise.  The drop in the cost of products to the consumer, as indicated by information from the Department, has vindicated the Minister&rsquo;s stand in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am anxious the Bill is passed as quickly as possible and that is why I do not wish to spend much time discussing all the details.  The Minister outlined the facts and figures in great detail.  Everyone must be particularly vigilant as far as consumers and prices are concerned.  While there is good competition, I highlighted the cost of petrol at various filling stations in Dublin.  The display of prices outside filling stations was brought in by a previous Administration and it has been very worthwhile.  People can see the cost of diesel, petrol and unleaded petrol and they can drive around to get better prices.  The consumer agency will have to monitor the situation in regard to price fixing.  It is no coincidence that if the price of a litre of petrol is 99.9 cent in one filling station, it is the same price in all filling stations in a town.  Few companies will buck the system.  It may not be price fixing as such but the filling stations keep to the same price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a lot fewer filling stations than there used to be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a factor too.  There are fewer stations and that is a major concern.  There are property deals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The retail outlets have opened filling stations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The retail outlets have opened filling stations, so it balances out.</P><Col N="1751"/>
        <P>It is vitally important prices are clearly displayed in stores.  The requirement to display the price of petrol and diesel on large signs is being adhered to 100% by filling stations and that has been of major assistance.  The same should apply to supermarkets.  Going through supermarkets, I sometimes notice prices are not as clearly displayed as they should be.  Sometimes the product is not directly above or below the price.  People should be aware of the cost of products before they leave the supermarket.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill which has full support.  I am delighted the Minister will be able to get it through in this session because it is important.  I suspect the National Consumer Agency does not believe it has the teeth to work until it has the power of this legislation behind it.  I note staff will be assigned and re-assigned to it.  I wish the Minister and his officials, who put much work into this Bill, well.</P>

I congratulate the Minister on producing the legislation, although it is a bit like the Taoiseach&rsquo;s slogan &mdash; some done, more to do.  I have a strong feeling part of the motivation for this Bill is the fact we are required to implement an EU directive.  The Minister is shaking his head but he referred to this EU directive several times and it is inescapable that it is part of the motivating factor.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this Bill is welcome.  The National Consumer Agency was set up some time ago but not on a statutory basis.  There is much exaltation here such as forcefully advocating the consumer&rsquo;s case.  That is fine but it is a bit wishy-washy.  It is stated that a commission will publish research.  This Government is committed to committing, commissioning, researching and so on but there is far too much dithering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is summing it up well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad this Bill does not remain in the land of dither in that it actually produces penalties.  Some of the penalties are fairly significant but again we must rely on the courts to implement them.  There is a case in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency about which I cannot say too much because I do not believe the sentence has been passed.  It concerns Ford dealerships and price rigging.  That is very anti-consumer.  There has <Col N="1752"/>been a conviction in the case but the sentence has not been passed.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to these quiz games, prizes or whatever.  They are in every bloody newspaper nowadays.  One scratches a card and wins a prize.  These prizes are not worth a damn but they gull one into making a telephone call.  People make money out of the enormous number of telephone calls made.  Consumers are entitled go be protected against this because the language used is totally inflated.  I have done research in this regard.  I wasted my unfortunate secretary&rsquo;s time, because I would not waste my own, getting her to dial up.  It was very unfair of me.  One is kept waiting and waiting.  It is dreadful the way this is done.  The prizes are a mirage.</P>
        <P>People also receive letters congratulating them and, in tiny letters, they are told they are in a draw to win &euro;500,000.  The letter will contain a certificate, a gold key or sometimes one has to scratch a card, but one wins sweet damn all.  These games are unfair.</P>
        <P>Worse still is something the Minister mentioned, namely, these unscrupulous, heartless people who have quack remedies and who claim they are able to cure diseases such as multiple sclerosis and cancer.  That really should be stamped out.  I believe this is considered by legislation under the Department of Health and Children as well.  There has been a good initiative in regard to the alleged qualifications of these people, their right to practice and so forth and it covers quacks.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister believe a sufficient amount has been drawn into this Bill because the power is scattered around a number of different agencies and ministries, including, for example, ComReg, the telecommunications regulator?  I will say a little about the telephone situation which is appalling.  Eircom is an absolute disaster.  I refer also to the financial regulator which has powers in this area.  I am glad pyramid schemes are being addressed.  They are also cruel because there is absolutely no way they can work without the majority of people engaged in them losing very heavily.  Very often they operate in housing estates of the poorer levels of society.  While some people will make money, a great number will be defrauded.  They join the schemes because they are gulled into thinking they will make money.</P>
        <P>Will this legislation address the question of moneylenders, which has never been addressed satisfactorily, as it ought to be.  While scandalous rates of interest are being charged, people who go to moneylenders simply do not know this is the case.  Allied to this is the credit card scam operated by the banks.  While on the subject of banks, I wish to make two points.  Everyone knows they are crooks who have been dipping their hands in our pockets.  They are also liars who lied about the late Mr. Haughey, thus causing severe disruption to the career of a good journalist who wrote an article to the effect that AIB was owed &pound;1 million by Mr. Haughey.  The <Col N="1753"/>bank flatly denied this, which was an outrage.  However, it got away with it.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>The Minister should also examine the issue of equity releases.  Elderly people, who are drawn into flogging off part of their interest in their houses, do not realise it could be highly disadvantageous to them.  For example, such people must secure permission from the relevant bank to modify their houses to install something like a chair lift.</P>
        <P>Members should also consider the manner in which such advertisements are couched.  They portray individuals who had never envisaged they could spend their declining years on the island of Barbados, or similar tripe, and this is unfair.  Moreover, Members should consider the manner in which advertisements for many financial institutions include warnings that they are subject to this, that and the other.  However, it is all muttered quickly and one cannot hear it.  How are the advertising authorities protecting the consumer?</P>
        <P>I note my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, has entered the Chamber.  How much time remains?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Half the time, or seven minutes, remains.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>May I speak for another minute?  I have some other points to make.</P>
        <P>As for rip-off Ireland, the Minister should accept he was wrong regarding the groceries order.  He was misled and prices did not drop.  The consumer was not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they did not.  The consumer was not protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should consider people like me, who are unable to deal with computers properly.  Given airline fare structures, one must be an Einstein to get a proper fare.  Why not have some kind of standard fares from airlines that claim to operate scheduled flights?  The seats are all flogged off to tour operators and one must scramble months in advance, or pay four times the price, to get a seat from an airline.  The question of price fixing also arises.</P>
        <P>While I should allow my colleague to make his contribution, my final point is that I wish the Minister well and I will not be partisan in this regard.  However, my hopes are not high.  Like the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i>, Members are watching because the Government&rsquo;s record in looking after consumers&rsquo; interests is poor.  For example, Members should consider the e-voting issue.  Mr. John McCarthy has stated he gave evidence to an Oireachtas committee some time before the Minister signed the order for the machines that are not worth a tuppenny damn.  Members have <Col N="1754"/>now discovered that the Minister for Health and Children was warned about the BUPA situation, whereby any number of insurers will float in to get a free ride in respect of risk equalisation.  The concept of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies to both the ordinary individual citizen as a consumer and to the Government, which represents the people on our behalf.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for allowing me to share time with him.  Before the Minister leaves the Chamber, he should note the three questions that must be answered, namely, how much, how many and when.  To make the new agency work, how much money will it get for its budget, how many people will it be able to appoint and when will it receive its money?</P>
        <P>I have witnessed this process many times previously.  I serve on a number of bodies and am director of several agencies on the State&rsquo;s behalf and, inexorably, the following sequence takes place.  Initially, there is great hoopla and brouhaha about establishing the body in question.  As soon as it has been established by the Oireachtas, the parent Department, which in this case is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is given the job of setting up the authority or agency.  At present, this agency is working on an interim basis. However, this has become a four-year process and I propose to take the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, through the steps.  There will be at least six months of arguments regarding the chief executive&rsquo;s pay, followed by another six months deciding how many people will be allowed to work.  The process will then move from the interim board to the Department, which will argue, do whatever it can and thereafter will take up the matter with the Department of Finance.  The argument will then start up again with the Department of Finance, which will include the budget for the new body in the budget of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Consequently, this will create other constraints every year.</P>
        <P>Matters within some of what one might call quasi-Government Departments are appalling.  The State should set up such agencies and allow them to work on their own.  However, this will not happen, which will be the death of many bodies that work with a parent Department.  This is not a reflection on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In respect of some of the bodies with which I am involved, it has been completely supportive and progressive in terms of getting things done.  However, matters run into the sand within the Department of Finance and this is what will happen in this instance.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset, there are only three questions to be answered about this body.  It has been set up because the previous body lacked the resources to carry out the purpose for which it <Col N="1755"/>was established.  While the previous consumer body had many plans to undertake initiatives, it did not receive the funds to so do.  This Bill is a political response and its purpose is to be seen to be doing something by creating a brand new office with a brand new set of support structures.  No one can oppose it, as the announcement of the establishment of a new consumer protection agency or Bill will meet agreement from all, as though it were motherhood and apple pie, as it is a great idea.  However, Members should not forget that a good system existed previously that did not get sufficient resources.  This agency will not be able to do its work if it does not get the requisite resources.  How much money will it receive for its budget?  How many people will it be entitled to appoint and when will it be allowed to so do?</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to respond to my next point regarding a problem the new national consumer agency will face as it sets up its structure.  Everyone appointed to it will have a salary related to Civil Service or public service grades, probably the former.  Hence, all salaries will be based on those enjoyed by higher executive officers, assistant principal officers, principal officers, assistant secretaries or whatever.  Problems will arise subsequently, because this agency will need some professionally qualified people.  It should be permitted to recruit them at levels that pertain in the private sector.  I repeat that it should be allowed to recruit on the basis of what is being paid in the private sector.  If Members want people who can examine tight situations within several different industries to join the agency, they should note this will not be done by paying generalists.  I use the latter term to refer to people without qualifications.  While such people may be highly committed and so on, one must be able to recruit professional support and expertise when needed, which entails paying the market rates.  This agency will not operate successfully if it is told otherwise by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The chief executive will be paid at the first point on the pay scale of the grade of assistant secretary within the general Departments of State.  I guarantee this will be the first question to arise and I guarantee it will restrict the level of people who can be recruited into this market.  Why does the Department of Finance always do this?  It pertains to some internal structures that no one else understands.  This constitutes another problem.</P>
        <P>As for dealing with issues, Members respond politically to issues pertaining to the consumer.  For example, members should consider briefly the groceries order.  I spoke in this House on the groceries order a number of times.  I also spoke on the committee that dealt with it, on which Senator Coghlan and I both served.  My view was that the Minister had no choice and made the cor<Col N="1756"/>rect political decision in abolishing the groceries order.  I also stated it would make not one whit of a difference to prices which would go up and down as they always did.  It has not really changed matters.  Certain prices were decreasing before the groceries order was introduced and others were not.</P>
        <P>Prices in Ireland are not as bad as politicians state they are.  Every time I travel abroad I check the cost of certain items common to countries, including a ten-mile or 15 km taxi ride and a box of Mach 3 razor blades.  This country is not as overpriced as we are led to believe.  We need a certain element of support to ensure people are paid fair prices.</P>
        <P>Today, the issue was raised of the filling station on the quays at Usher&rsquo;s Quay.  I used it twice during the past year because I was stuck.  I am sure other people do the same.  Just because newspapers hold the view that Departments and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fill up their cars there does not mean they pay &euro;1.35 per litre.  The way it was covered in the newspapers last week is grossly unfair to those bodies.  It is the only place one can fill up in town.  I presume it was tendered and they obtain it at a competitive price.  Otherwise, someone should be sacked.  I cannot believe anyone in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Health Service Executive is stupid enough to pay &euro;1.35 for a litre of diesel or petrol.</P>
        <P>I wish the national consumer agency well.  It can be a great success.  I will finish with the same point with which I began.  It will only be a success if it can recruit at private sector rates and is provided with enough of a budget to do so.  The Department of Finance must be told if it does not provide a budget, it will undermine the political direction determined by the Oireachtas.  The agency must also have sufficient staff.  How many staff are foreseen?  When will it receive money and staffing and when will it be operational?  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the Consumer Protection Bill.  The idea of such legislation is fortuitous at this time.  With so much money and affluence in the country, we must ensure people receive value for money, are not mislead and that even companies with a good track record are kept in line.  We know &euro;10 billion will come on stream through the special savings incentive accounts shortly.  However, many issues continue to require attention and it is good this Bill has been introduced.</P>
        <P>I check the Internet daily and receive an offer from a poor country in west Africa where a recent coup has taken place.  It states if I supply my bank account details, vast sums of money will be forwarded because the new government will <Col N="1757"/>take it off the incumbent.  It is a simple offer, many different types of which exist and we all receive them.  Even though it is international and borderless, I would like to see the new national consumer agency act in conjunction with other agencies to ensure fewer such offers are received.  Unfortunately, people will fall for unscrupulous scams.  We saw it recently with pyramid selling in Cork.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions today, oil prices were mentioned.  In particular we discussed the service station on Usher&rsquo;s Quay which was mentioned twice during this debate.  If oil is sold at &euro;1.35 per litre on Usher&rsquo;s Quay and is available at 95 cent in Urlingford, it means a 40 cent differential per litre.  This amounts to &euro;1.70 or &euro;1.80 per gallon or approximately &euro;100 per barrel.  This means a price of $130 per barrel, which is twice its price.  Why is this allowed?  Rather than imposing a price order, it should be examined.</P>
        <P>As I stated previously, it is the first service station met by a lorry or a car coming off a ferry.  Many people will wait to buy petrol until they arrive in Ireland because it is supposed to be significantly cheaper given the sterling differential.  They are salted by the first filling station they come across.  This has created a great deal of annoyance.</P>
        <P>Recently, auctioneering firms have been criticised.  I gladly note one auctioneering firm was made to account for misstating the size of a property by 1,800 sq. ft.  It was brought to court and made pay.  We are becoming more conscious of our rights under consumer legislation.</P>
        <P>Moneylending was also mentioned.  The least well-off in our society are those who still pay extortionate rates of approximately 20% at a time when European Central Bank rates are 3.5% and 4%.  Technically, these people can least afford such high rates but seem to manage to afford it.  It is no surprise that the Nobel peace prize went to a man who provided funding for people with little or low income in countries with a percentage of Ireland&rsquo;s wealth.  We should ensure that moneylenders give the full extent of the cost of lending money and seek alternatives.  They are in it for a profit and must be making a good one.  Perhaps State agencies could provide the money at a lower rate and provide a public service.  I am certain the sums involved are small.</P>
        <P>Interesting and positive guidelines were published today by the Financial Regulator.  It warns homeowners to consider their options and obtain independent advice before using an equity release scheme on their home.  The guide to equity release explains the different types of equity release products available and the main issues to consider.  Lifetime mortgages and home reversion schemes are designed for homeowners over 60 years of age and give people the option of getting a lump sum or regular income without having to move out of their home.  When these <Col N="1758"/>were first launched I thought they were an excellent idea.  However, people must be made aware and one of the benefits of this Bill and the establishment of the national consumer agency is that it will educate people.</P>
        <P>According to the consumer director, Mary O&rsquo;Dea:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our research shows that almost 4 in 10 consumers aged over 50 would consider releasing equity from their homes at some point in the future.  The benefit of these schemes is that they provide you with cash to meet your current needs, which is particularly appealing if you are living on a tight budget and your home is worth a lot of money now.  But the risk is that you may not have enough money in the future to meet your long-term health or care needs.  If you want to release some of the value of your home, consider the cost carefully and remember there are different risks than with other financial products.  Any financial decisions you make at 60 can look very different when you are 75 and your needs and circumstances may have changed.  Make sure to get independent legal and financial advice and consider whether you should talk over your plans with a family member.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Think carefully about the long-term costs and risks.  With a lifetime mortgage the longer the mortgage lasts the more it costs.  You could end up owing over &euro;245,000 in 15 years time on a lifetime mortgage that would give you &euro;100,000 in cash today.  This is because with this type of equity release you make no repayments until your home is sold and the interest is added to the amount you owe, so it builds up quickly and the amount you eventually owe could be close to or equal to the value of your home.  If you needed money for long-term care later on, you could find that there is very little value left in your home to pay for it.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Home reversion schemes involve selling part of your home for a cash price.  You are not borrowing against the value of your home but are actually selling part of it to raise cash now.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Typically with a home reversion scheme you will get less than the market value of the portion of the house you sell.  For example if your home is worth &euro;500,000 and you sell half of it you could get between &euro;112,000 and &euro;146,000 in cash rather than the &euro;250,000 market value of a half share.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Financial Regulator urges people considering equity release products to make sure they consider the following main issues and risks:  First, any lump sum or income raised through an equity release scheme could affect entitlement to State benefits such as the means-tested State pension.  Second, the money may not last for one&rsquo;s lifetime, and its value will gradually fall due to inflation.  There is a need to consider future financial needs <Col N="1759"/>and also long-term health and care needs.  Third, raising cash through equity release will mean there is a lot less, or perhaps nothing at all, left for beneficiaries.  If this is a cause of concern it should be discussed with one&rsquo;s family or a solicitor.  Fourth, there is a need to consider how much money is really needed.  Not all of these points will affect everybody but they will affect some, therefore, I welcome that part of the Bill which concerns education and the dissemination of information, which is opportune.</P>
        <P>This consumer protection legislation will extend new protection for consumers and will overhaul structures in what will be the biggest reform in this area for 30 years.  It will help to ensure Ireland has one of the strongest and most modern consumer protections in the world.  The Consumer Protection Bill 2007 includes bans and tough sanctions for 31 anti-consumer activities including pyramid selling, prize bond scams and persistent cold calling of consumers, for which some communications companies, particularly telephone companies, are particularly at fault, having caused much concern to people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It will also formally establish the new national consumer agency, which will have the funding and power to act forcibly on behalf of consumers.  It is the first major consumer legislation in 30 years and will replace legislation which is long outdated, including two Acts which have been in place for over 100 years.  A total of ten older Acts are being repealed or modernised by the new Bill.  The consumer agency will be a powerful advocate on behalf on consumers because it will have the resources to contribute on all issues of real concern to consumers.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I broadly welcome the Bill.  Members will forgive me for being a bit churlish at the beginning of my contribution but some of the rhetoric used by the Government side in welcoming the Bill was a bit over the top.  The Bill, in effect, consolidates existing legislation and transposes into Irish law the unfair commercial practices directive of 1995.  It also gives significant additional powers to the new agency, which it very much needs if it is to be an effective advocate of consumer rights and an effective protector of consumers.</P>
        <P>I am probably not a great consumer.  If I want a blue shirt I typically go into just one shop and buy a blue shirt.  I do not shop around for the cheapest or the best value, nor do I inspect every blue shirt in Grafton Street or Henry Street.  I am not very price sensitive though I do not allow myself, or do not think I allow myself, to be ripped off.  I do not much welcome the assistance of shop assistants and am unlikely to complain afterwards.  I say that to make the point that I do not regard myself as unusual.  Quite a few men and, no doubt, some women, are like me.  Irish <Col N="1760"/>people generally are not great consumers.  We are not great complainers and are not very familiar with our rights.  If we do complain, it will be weeks or months later, in the privacy of our own homes or the pub.  If my blue shirt turns out to be a dud I simply do not return to that shop for another blue shirt, but I do not complain.</P>
        <P>This is an important point because the culture of consumerism is critical.  We can and should put in place the proposed new agency.  It is important we have all the rights set out in this and other consumer legislation but, if we do not know about them and do not seek to enforce them, they are hardly worth the paper on which they are written.  A very important aspect of the new agency is that it does not rely on the individual consumer to protect consumers.  One of the great faults of the core Act, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, is that it puts the onus on consumers to enforce their own rights.  We are entitled to have products that are fit for purpose and of merchantable quality but, if we do not get them, the obligation is on the consumer to complain and enforce his or her rights in the Small Claims Court or another court.  In many cases that costs too much or is too much hassle so we do not bother.  One of the potential advantages of the proposed new agency is that while it does not become involved in individual cases, it has powers to proactively protect consumers by carrying out research, publish its results and name and shame.</P>
        <P>The power to name and shame could prove the single most important power of the new agency.  The agency has enhanced powers to impose fines, which will be used in cases coming to court, but the power to name and shame is crucially important.  We have seen its effectiveness with health and safety legislation and, perhaps more important, with food safety legislation.  Where courts publish the names of individual restaurants which have transgressed regulations it has a powerful, coercive effect on restaurateurs, as it should.  I hope the power will be extensively used because it is an important part of the armoury of the new agency.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said earlier.  He is more expert than most in the mechanics of setting up an agency of this kind.  The agency has existed on a non-statutory basis for some time so perhaps some of the hurdles he identified have been cleared, which I hope is the case.  It is hugely important that we recruit the right people but also that it is properly resourced.  One of the flaws in the current Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is its lack of appropriate resourcing.  A new office will always take time to get up and running but it is crucially important the new consumer agency be appropriately resourced to put into practice what we are setting down in law.</P><Col N="1761"/>
        <P>The major complaint from individual consumers, as we have heard this afternoon, is about price inflation.  I saw the programme featuring Dr. Luntz the other night and price inflation was raised, though not on very many occasions.  I hope Members will forgive me for using the phrase, but we have had a very unintelligent debate about inflation in this country.  We take into account headline prices but scarcely anything else.  We pick out bad examples and highlight them, which is right to do, but we must also look at the underlying picture, which is much more complicated.  There is, for example, a huge difference between the rate of inflation of goods manufactured in Ireland and that of imported goods.  There is a huge difference between the rate of inflation for services and that for goods.  It is, unfortunately, axiomatic that goods produced in Ireland are likely to be more expensive than those produced abroad.  The rate of increase in domestically produced goods, such as still exist, is much higher than for imported goods, the most obvious example being clothing.  We now produce virtually no clothing but the clothing we import has, for the most part, come down in price in recent years rather than risen.</P>
        <P>I will digress for a moment to introduce a different element into the discussion.  Energy exercises people greatly, not least because it is, directly or indirectly, affected by Government decisions.  We should seek to keep the price of energy low and it is incumbent on regulators to do so.  Indeed, in so far as it makes decisions directly affecting prices, such as in setting excise duty, it is also incumbent on the Government to do so.  We must, however, stand back for a moment.  We have embarked on an interesting debate on climate change in the past few months.  The greatest contributor to carbon emissions is unquestionably the use of energy.  One of the proposals for reducing carbon emissions from energy is to activate the price mechanism.  Are we speaking out of both sides of our mouths?  We argue that we must keep energy prices low to sustain economic growth in the interests of consumers on the one hand, but most of us genuflect in the general direction of the climate change agenda by suggesting an increase in the price of energy on the other.  I am trying to sort out this dilemma because climate change and what Ireland can contribute are worthy of a more intensive debate.</P>
        <P>I did not support the abolition of the groceries order.  It provided a minimal but useful element in ensuring that competition in the supply of groceries sector, the supermarket sector, continued.  It would be fair to state that the jury is still out.  The Minister claimed that he could point to a reduction in prices.  If there is a reduction, it is slight and based on the November or December consumer price index figures.  This is an important issue.</P><Col N="1762"/>
        <P>I am not a fan of price-fixing and the relevant powers are retained in the Bill.  Nor am I a fan of maximum price orders, a power that the Bill also retains.  To ensure that prices are within reasonable ambits, we need competition in all sectors, including supermarkets.  The groceries order was a clumsy but useful way to maintain competition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will revert to my basic point.  Many of the measures in the Bill are good.  The list of restrictive, unfair or aggressive practices to be outlawed numbers 26 or 30, which is impressive.  If it can be done successfully, we and the European Parliament will have done a good day&rsquo;s work on behalf of consumers.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the Bill becomes a reality, we must resource the agency and people must know their rights.  A long list of outlawed practices is of no use if the general public is unaware of it.  For example, the Bill will outlaw the bait and switch practice.  A wonderful phrase, it involves bringing people into shops to sell them products at low prices, those products becoming unavailable suddenly and asking the people to buy something that is not as cheap or as good a bargain.  The last of the cheeky Charlie arguments is pretending that one is running out of a particular product.  We can agree that such aggressive or excessive trading practices should be outlawed, but people must know of it.  One of the first jobs the agency must take upon itself is to ensure that it informs people of their rights by way of the Internet, leaflets or so on.</P>
        <P>I was struck by Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s remarks regarding the Internet, which poses a growing problem, but no effort has been made in the Bill to tackle Internet shopping.  It is difficult to police the Internet, but since an increasing amount of shopping is being done through it, we must find a mechanism to police it on a European-wide basis at least.  I am not sure whether any moves are afoot, but it is a lacuna in our regulations on consumer protection that must be addressed.  I welcome the Bill and will support it on Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House and I am glad to contribute to this welcome Bill.  The explanatory memorandum refers to provisions on pyramid schemes.  I assume the provisions are new, as there have been many warnings on this issue, particularly in respect of last year&rsquo;s scam in County Cork.</P>
        <P>In terms of consumer protection, advertising is of concern.  Senator Norris referred to problems encountered when banks tell elderly people in particular that they can release their houses&rsquo; equity.  In the lunchtime news, some of the finance houses stated that elderly people are smart and can make up their own minds, but that advertising is over the top compared to what is available.  It is not the only type of questionable adver<Col N="1763"/>tising.  Credit cards have been hyped considerably, but we all know of the charges imposed if people do not clear their credit card bills in time.</P>
        <P>Like Senator McDowell, I do not shop around.  It is not as easy to do as some believe, particularly if one lives in rural Ireland.  This is not a matter of being the poor mouth.  Regarding investigations into the price of home heating oil, I wonder how many operators are involved in so-called cartels.  I have investigated the matter and found that people have been brought to court and prosecuted on home heating oil sales.  Often, I have heard that there is little difference between the prices at which a town&rsquo;s pubs sell pints of Guinness.  If one examines the price of drink in nearby towns and villages, the price is much the same.</P>
        <P>This issue was brought to my attention by last weekend&rsquo;s debate on a petrol station on the quays that sells petrol at &euro;1.35 per litre, approximately 35 cent dearer than most filling stations.  As most filling stations charge less than &euro;1 per litre, one could claim that they are involved in price-fixing.  There is a strong argument concerning the location of petrol stations.  More and more, stations are being closed and turned into property developments and apartments.  As I find when travelling around my county, one does not have the same choice in terms of shopping around for petrol and diesel as one used to.</P>
        <P>Last week on the national consumer agency&rsquo;s website, I read about a multi-million euro Spanish lottery scam that was becoming prevalent.  Several consumers contacted the agency about the scam, which was intended to get people&rsquo;s financial information.  Consumers were warned to be vigilant, advice that pertains to any Internet offer of millions of euro requiring one&rsquo;s financial information to be provided to unscrupulous people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>People are concerned about where they should go with their queries.  The national consumer agency has had an interim board and an interim chief executive, but when people with particular concerns approach the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, they are told that such matters are dealt with by a new agency, the Financial Regulator, ComReg or another body.  I brought a simple scam to the attention of the Minister.  People were taking the numbers of car insurance certificates from the windscreens of cars and if they were involved in an accident, they would quote someone else&rsquo;s policy certificate number.  I made a practical proposal that the insurance certificate number should be on the back of the disc or elsewhere in the car.  The certificate number is a matter between the customer and the insurance broker.  I have met people who saw their premiums increase because someone had used the number displayed on the disc.  The Department should investigate this.  When I raised the issue I was told it is a matter for the financial regulator <Col N="1764"/>but I am yet to receive a response from either the regulator or the Department to my inquiries about this scam.  The law could be easily changed to address this; the car registration, engine capacity and make is already on the insurance disc and there is no need for the policy number to be displayed.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>My colleague, Senator Cox, has long advocated changes in the way charges are imposed on credit card transactions.  All young people know about the extra charges for tickets to concerts or sporting events or on other purchases.  Previously, if someone made a booking with a credit card, he or she could pick up the tickets but now people are charged way over the odds just for the privilege of reserving a ticket.  It is time to introduce legislation to change the way credit card schemes are operated.  If the Department does not do it, a Private Members&rsquo; Bill may be introduced to make the changes because fraud is taking place, with ticket touts involved, and it is not good for the consumer to have to pay over the odds when making a credit card booking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Without much apology to the Minister of State or the House, I find this Bill particularly unsatisfactory.  I am astounded there has been so much fuss for so long about a Bill of this nature; it is the emperor in new clothes.  The reaction to it demonstrates political cowardice.  There is a refusal to confront the reality that it will not address the problem.  It is a snow job, a smother.  This Bill produces yet another quango in order that politicians can tell people not to worry about prices because they have set up a super-quango to deal with them and an agency with a board of a dozen people will look after everyone&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>We only have to look at the details in the Bill to see that the agency has no meaningful powers.  It takes the powers of the Director of Consumer Affairs but the Director of Consumer Affairs had one major problem &mdash; she did not have the power to address any problems.  This supersedes the Director of Consumer Affairs with the same powers.</P>
        <P>The agency will have other powers and functions, there is a long paragraph in the explanatory memoranda which tells us what the agency can and cannot do.  The paragraph is a puff of smoke.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">In addition, the Agency is given specific functions in relation to advising and making recommendations to the Government, Ministers, Ministers of State in relation to any policy or legislative proposals impacting or likely to impact upon consumer protection and welfare.  The Section also provides that the Agency may submit proposals to the Government, Ministers, Ministers of State to amend any existing enactment.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I can do the same myself.  Any citizen can do that.  What great powers are being vested in this agency <Col N="1765"/>when anyone walking down Grafton Street can do the same today?  It can refer issues to the DPP but in itself the agency is a complete umbrella excuse.  The Government is aware, and it is not necessarily to blame, that the price increases, the scandals in the financial services industries, the cartels and the rises in the cost of living cause great public anguish but it is at a loss as to what to do about them.  Therefore, it does what all Governments do in this situation, it establishes another agency.  This is just another agency that will achieve virtually nothing, like all other agencies that have been set up to tackle consumer problems.  They never appear to work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have referred to the Director of Consumer Affairs and that was bad enough.  She could find out things but then could do nothing about them.  She did not have the power to prosecute.  This will be the same but there will be a few more people.  It will have a board with a chief executive.  Who will appoint the board and the chief executive?  The Minister of the day.  Let us wait and see what happens when the board is appointed, be it by this Government or the next.  It will be full of political puppets, like every other agency.  They will not, however, all be political puppets, some of them will be other types of puppet: a social partner, a trade unionist, a representative of consumer affairs, a couple of people from the Department and then a few cronies from the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, whoever the Minister is at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The board has been already appointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what always happens.  They will be re-appointed and, with any luck, by a different regime from Senator Leyden&rsquo;s.  That is the pattern of experience with consumer agencies.</P>
        <P>As an example, I will mention IFSRA, the great god of consumer agencies, which issues press releases almost every day to say what a great job it does and to issue warnings, as it did this morning about equity release.  What has IFSRA ever done to discover some of the great scandals which it is so fast to step in upon when they are rumbled?  IFSRA is the great publicist but did it discover the foreign exchange scandal in the banks?  No, a whistleblower did.  It moved fast after it had happened.</P>
        <P>The problem with the agency established by this Bill, as with all agencies, is that it will discover nothing and then move in very late after any discovery.  The institutions which are guilty of so many offences against the consumer need someone to sit on their backs.  Why does the Minister not impose on the banks, which are the worst of the offenders, an external compliance officer who would act truly independently and who could move around the banks and demand <Col N="1766"/>at will information on their practices?  Why must we always wait until someone else discovers something is wrong for the Government or the agency to move in so late in the day?  It is no accident that one of the most prominent of the appointments made to the agency to which Senator Leyden referred was somebody who was very close to running a cartel in this country.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the criticisms made of the financial services industry by independent organisations based overseas.  The EU has constantly cribbed about the cartels which operate in Ireland, but the multitude of agencies which exist here have managed to do nothing about it.  The cartels get away with it here, there and everywhere.  The agencies have done nothing about the charges imposed by banks, stockbrokers, investment managers and auctioneers.</P>
        <P>On this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business, I raised an issue pertaining to auctioneers.  It is outrageous that auctioneers should be allowed even to suggest they will crucify the public by increasing their prices merely because their income is coming down when they did not reduce their prices while their income was increasing, yet that extraordinary suggestion, which in effect would entail running a cartel, was made by one of the auctioneers&rsquo; bodies.  As the Minister of State will attest, cartels are not operated in a formal manner, so it is difficult to catch people price fixing.  Cartels are operated by people who nod and wink at each other before coincidentally and suddenly charging the same price.</P>
        <P>What will this agency, with its politically appointed board, do to solve the problems in the auctioneering business, which crucify poor house buyers and sellers, in the stockbroking industry, whereby people are being charged outrageous fees because they know no better, in the banks, which have not been addressed by any other agency with any degree of credibility or in the investment management industry, whereby pensioners are being charged outrageous amounts by people with fewer skills than a monkey walking up a wall?  We do not need an agency to solve these problems.  We need someone with independence who can sit on these people&rsquo;s backs.  We do not need the Government to continue to produce bodies which lack power or credibility to solve a political problem.  This Bill will get the Government through the next six months but the scandals and overpricing will continue and the financial services will remain largely unpoliced by independent bodies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to Senator Ross, I began to ponder what I was about to say.  I intended to speak positively about the proposed agency and, after hearing the negative opinions expressed by the Senator, I remain intent on emphasising the positive ends this legislation will achieve.  A national consumer agency will be <Col N="1767"/>established which will make consumers count because they need a new direction which will address the concerns that have been expressed about certain practices.  This legislation provides for a general prohibition on sales tactics which could be considered unfair, aggressive or misleading and addresses key areas of consumer concern, including making false claims about products or services, baiting customers by advertising for sale products which are not available, pyramid selling, price draw scams, certain types of advertising directed at children and persistent or unwanted cold calling.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross is correct that financial services, cartels, bank charges and information on financial products should all be regulated.  It can be the case that the information provided on certain products is inaccurate or deliberately misinterpreted.  The new statutory agency should have the power to enforce root and branch changes so that I, as a consumer, will be able to telephone it, say what happened to me and easily learn my rights or be facilitated in starting a public debate.  If this legislation can do that, I will praise it.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross is correct that regulators have lacked teeth.  However, the powers provided in this Bill must be made clear to the public through awareness raising campaigns, research, education and creating links between traders and consumers, so that all can understand the penalties which will ensue from breaches of the law.  It is welcome that the Bill is being debated in this House but will the public know about it when it is passed in two weeks&rsquo; time?  Will it be made evident to every trader, shopkeeper, auctioneer and bank that this legislation has the power to regulate their behaviour?  If that will be the case, I will welcome it.</P>
        <P>The establishment of this agency will give consumers enhanced abilities to make complaints.  Senator Ross has spoken at length about auctioneers who vary the information they provide according to the demand for houses.  That must stop.  If I am buying an expensive product, I will not shop for it on my own because I am aware the seller will see me coming but I would be happy to go on my own if I felt this legislation was behind me and that if my purchase did not work out, I could bring any complaints I may have to the national consumer agency.</P>
        <P>I am a positive person and am not overly concerned about what happened in the past, as long as we correct our mistakes and the Minister is aware the legislation must count.  The consumer must be confident and there must be confidence that the consumer agency has powers to take action resulting in penalties when offences occur.  We should not need to have recourse to the courts in such cases.  With this legislation in place it should not be necessary to take matters that far.  I will be happy if that is the outcome of the <Col N="1768"/>legislation, which I welcome.  The agency needs to be given teeth and I want to see the reform implemented.  If that happens, we will have got it right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Bill before us is very weak from the point of view of consumers.  It is too little and too late.  My party has highlighted the concerns of consumers with its website, <i>www.ripoff.ie</i>, which was established several years ago.  Fine Gael recently launched a new consumer charter to highlight the shocking increases in the costs of household utility bills.  The key to ending the rip off in these utilities is by injecting new much-needed competition into these markets and making sure consumers have the protection they deserve by hurting those service providers who do not provide them with a decent level of service.</P>
        <P>The proposed charter will compensate consumers who lose their utility service for more than three hours in a 24-hour period by forcing providers to deduct the cost of one day&rsquo;s service from the bill.  This applies to electricity, gas, telephone, Internet and cable television providers.  It will also limit Government and regulator-driven price increases to at or below the rate of inflation, unless a clear public interest case can be proven.  It will also ensure competition in these markets by instigating a full review of how regulation works, merging all non-financial regulators into one powerful, efficient and less wasteful organisation, and taking steps to promote new entrants into markets.  It will empower the Oireachtas to force the new regulator to instigate a review of prices when it deems fit.  Such a scenario might have prevented the massive increase in gas prices that occurred late last year.  It will establish a consumer rights enforcer to replace the weak and toothless NCA.</P>
        <P>These measures will put it up to service providers, the Government and the regulatory regime to give consumers the rights and representation they need to get better and cheaper services.  Fine Gael has championed the rights of consumers for some years and will continue to do so in the run-up to the general election and beyond, when we will be in government.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will propose a new law to tackle rip-off practices in professional services such as estate agents, dentists, solicitors and insurance brokers.  The consumer protection (professional services) Bill will demand greater transparency in pricing, better representation of consumer interests where a conflict of interest exists and introduce tougher fines or demand compensation from service providers that are in breach of the new guidelines.  The Bill will also propose to extend the remit of the existing financial services ombudsman to cover professional services.  It will protect consumers, put professional services on a <Col N="1769"/>proper regulatory footing and punish the minority of practitioners who do not uphold their responsibilities to their clients.</P>
        <P>The Bill will impose three key responsibilities on these professions.  All providers of professional services covered by the Bill will have a statutory obligation to ensure they employ all reasonable skill, diligence and expertise in the provision of professional services to clients.  Where the provider of professional services believes that he or she may have a conflict of interest in respect of a consumer of that service, the provider will have a statutory obligation to alert the consumer in writing within seven working days and to desist from taking any further action on the matter without the consumer&rsquo;s express consent.  Remuneration for professional services should be charged on an open, transparent and comprehensible basis and outlined to a consumer in advance in such a manner as to allow the consumer to make an informed choice about the value for money and competitive alternatives available for the service concerned.  This will, for example, ensure that doctors and dentists display their prices properly.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also provide for the payment of compensation in respect of service that is below a required standard and will provide for penalties and fines to be levied against professional service providers in respect of certain defined offences.  To ensure these responsibilities are met, the Bill proposes to extend the remit of the existing financial services ombudsman to cover professional services.  The new financial and professional services ombudsman will be a champion for consumers of these vital services and will have the power to order a service provider to pay compensation in respect of the provision of a service to a consumer that is below the standard which should reasonably have been provided or where the service provider otherwise breached these provisions.</P>
        <P>These are some of the consumer protection proposals that Fine Gael has made.  There is no doubt that the consumer has been ripped off in many areas.  I recently read my mother&rsquo;s gas bill.  For two months&rsquo; service it had a &euro;56 or &euro;58 standing charge.  A similar charge appears on ESB bills.  Although the gas had not been used for a few months, she was charged an additional &euro;19 for having the pilot light on for two months.  The consumer is being ripped off in so many areas that we need legislation.  However, the legislation before us is not strong enough to protect consumer rights.  I urge the Minister to introduce strong amendments if it comes before us again before we go to the country.  We need much stronger consumer legislation.  We have been discussing rip off for too long.  It is time to take action and this Bill does nothing to give consumers adequate protection.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1770"/>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Consumer Protection Bill.  Senator Kitt mentioned an area on which I wish to focus my attention, namely, credit card charges and surcharges.  Members will recollect that I proposed to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment a Private Members&rsquo; Bill for consideration.  It proposes to abolish credit card charges and surcharges by companies providing event tickets, airline tickets etc.  All Members of the House would agree that any definition of consumer protection must provide that all consumers are treated equally, regardless of whether they live in the far end of Connemara, the centre of Galway city or the centre of Dublin.  We must also ensure that to protect the consumer everything is transparent.  The consumer must at all times be aware of what he or she is paying for, how much it will cost and that he or she will not suffer any additional hidden costs half way through the transaction.  I am aware that the Bill deals with misleading advertising and suggestions that something costs a given sum.  I refer, however to the growing practice of companies which sell services on the Internet or over the telephone that impose a surcharge for the use of a credit card.</P>
        <P>We want to move from a cash to a plastic society in which people will use credit and debit cards.  In recent months the newspapers have reported a spate of bank robberies and kidnappings.  We need to reduce the amount of cash revolving in society.  Cash is not necessary but if we do not protect the consumer in using an alternative to cash, we facilitate the continued growth of the cash industry.  We must encourage people to use credit and debit cards to pay for goods and services and stop any practice that might act as a disincentive to that practice.  When one books a ticket on the Internet from Ryanair or Aer Lingus, one pays airport taxes, security charges, surcharges and a credit card charge per ticket.  That charge might be &euro;2.50, &euro;5.50 or &euro;6 depending which is additional to the price of the ticket.</P>
        <P>The advertising of 1 cent flights to America or Europe is misleading.  This also creates inequity.  People in rural Ireland are increasingly forced, by virtue of their location, to make bookings on the Internet.  In the old days there were post offices everywhere but these are closing down, as are bank branches, and it is even becoming more difficult to do one&rsquo;s business in the city centres.</P>
        <P>As more people use the Internet to buy goods and services, they are charged extortionate sums for doing business with these companies.  It does not make sense.  Ticketmaster is my delight but it charges a fortune for booking concert tickets.  When I bought tickets recently for a concert in the Point Depot for 12 children and three adults, I paid more than &euro;80 in credit card surcharges.  It is ridiculous that I must pay more money just <Col N="1771"/>because I am paying the company for concert tickets.  This probably should have been dealt with under the legislation to deal with the Financial Regulator.  It may be a financial matter for which the Department of Finance should be responsible.  Neither the legislation for the Financial Regulator nor the consumer credit legislation dealt with this issue.  We now have an opportunity to deal with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State consider where an amendment could be placed because if he is not in a position to do so, I will have to try to find an area and table an amendment or, as Senator Kitt said, we must introduce a Private Members' Bill.  We as a Government should tell companies that if they want to do business here they must comply with certain rules, and that we will protect consumers who are entitled to do business with these companies without paying more money because they use their credit or debit cards on the telephone or the Internet than if they walk in off the street and pay cash.  Restaurants and shops do not charge an extra 20% because one uses one&rsquo;s credit card.  If businesses on the high street and corner shops do not do this, the likes of Ticketmaster and Ryanair and even the GAA, which is beginning to take Internet bookings, also need not do it.</P>
        <P>When I was at a Christmas concert in the Helix in Dublin, I noticed that as and from 1 February a new booking fee would be introduced for on-line bookings.  Presumably the theatre decided that if everyone else was imposing these charges, it might as well jump on the bandwagon and make that extra money.  We consumers subsidise and contribute to profits for these organisations which have lower costs because the transaction takes place on the Internet, with fewer people involved, less employment, less tax going to the Government and more profits for large organisations, yet the Government condones this.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to look at the consumer rights in this area  and say that the Government will stand up to Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Ticketmaster and not allow them to profit from the public.  The Government should make this illegal.  It can tell these companies to make their profits another way by taking the money back from U2 or Westlife or from their shareholders to make an equitable profit rather than on the backs of consumers.  We can create and protect such a society.</P>
        <P>I doubt that I am the person to suggest where the Bill could be amended to achieve this but there are sections in Part 3 which might accommodate the amendments.  We could propose a new section to deal with this on Committee Stage.  We should not be frightened away by the big guys who think we should not take more money from them.  This is not good enough for our society. <Col N="1772"/> The Government is in charge of the country and it is for us to make the regulations and rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This has been an interesting debate because one can hear different views expressed on all sides.  The Bill further strengthens the consumer&rsquo;s legal powers in the marketplace and its objective is to ensure that the consumer is protected against sharp practices.  We should not, however go overboard on this.  I have some difficulty with Senator Cox when she says that the Government runs everything.  The marketplace is the answer to the problem.  We must maintain competition there.  We should recall the Latin phrase <i>caveat emptor </i>&mdash; let the buyer beware.  If I am stung once I do not return to that place.  I am very careful in that respect and am therefore shy of saying that the Government should legislate to cover everything.</P>
        <P>I am concerned too that the agency replaces the Director of Consumer Affairs because I have been very impressed by successive directors.  The public had a relationship with the director, perhaps because the office was held by an individual.  I am not sure that it is easy to sustain the same relationship with an impersonal agency instead of a director.  To what extent is it possible to ensure that whoever is in charge of that agency can establish the link with customers?</P>
        <P>We must protect the public from sharp practice but let us not try to protect it from everything.  When I started in business in the 1950s, there was a practice known as re-sale price maintenance.  Those of us who went into business at that stage were trying to take business from the traditional traders.  When we cut a price below the recommended retail price, some long-established business people told me that it was unethical to do business that way.  It is for this reason I am concerned by the use of the phrase &ldquo;A trader shall not engage in an aggressive commercial practice.&rdquo;  That is wrong; people should engage in aggressive commercial practice because that is how competition is created.  If traders did not engage in such practice, they would all sell at the same price and would not try to take business away from each other.  I have no difficulty with Chapter 4, which refers to prohibited commercial practices and provides a list thereof.  Using the phrase &ldquo;A trader shall not engage in an aggressive commercial practice.&rdquo;, gives rise to the danger that the level of competition might be reduced.</P>
        <P>The price of petrol was referred to by approximately six previous speakers.  The introduction of legislation a number of years ago obliging the owners or operators of petrol stations to display their prices on signs of a certain size was extremely helpful.  Senator Leyden referred to a petrol station located close to the quays in Dublin that sells petrol at a price that is approximately 35% above that charged at other stations.  I am of <Col N="1773"/>the opinion that it is fine to do this because most people will not be stung a second time by someone operating in this way.  It may be that the operation to which I refer is geared towards trapping tourists arriving off the boat and has, therefore, a captive market.  One of the things we must do in this legislation is ensure there is increased competition.</P>
        <P>I referred to petrol on previous occasions because a large number of petrol stations in the area on the northside of the city in which I reside closed down.  As a result, one is often stuck and has no choice regarding where one buys petrol.  It would be incorrect, however, to state that traders should not charge different prices.  If I travel to a five-star hotel to attend an important event, I know that I will be obliged to pay more than I would if I were staying at a two-star establishment.  If I go to a lounge bar, I know I will pay a higher price than I would in an ordinary bar.  Let us not try to control everything; let us ensure we encourage competition and that we do so in a manner that ensures consumers are given a choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important there is a sufficient number of outlets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  However, we must also ensure the behaviour in which people engage is fair and that they do not engage in misleading practices.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal now with airline and hotel prices.  When low-cost air travel first appeared, members of the public were mislead with regard to the prices they would be charged.  Some airlines advertise extremely low fares but consumers often end up paying a great deal for flights because they are often faced with a plethora of additional costs such as Government taxes, airport charges, fuel surcharges and, most recently, new baggage charges.  If a person is not anticipating such charges and is caught by surprise, it is clear the practices involved are misleading.</P>
        <P>Some years ago when people operating in the business in which I am involved still sold by the pound, one company introduced a 15 oz. pack of butter &mdash; as opposed to the regular 16 oz. pack &mdash; which was misleading.  A number of traders indicated they would refuse to handle the product in question and the Government of the day introduced legislation or whatever which stated that butter had to be sold in packs of a certain size.  This development made a great deal of sense.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty with the argument Senator Cox made in respect of credit cards.  Such cards cost considerable sums of money and there is a cartel in existence among the banks which forces a lack of competition in the area in question.  Two weeks ago, the Polish competition authority stated it intended to make illegal the interchange fee that banks insist on charging.  I am sure the banks in Poland will argue against this develop<Col N="1774"/>ment.  However, when a cartel exists between the banks &mdash; as I believe is the case in Ireland &mdash; regarding the interchange fees they charge, traders and customers have no choice but to pay such fees.  It should be legitimate for traders to indicate the prices they would charge people for paying by credit card and for paying by some other means.  I can understand that argument against such behaviour, particularly if it misleads the public.  However, at least indicating prices in this way would be open, above board and visible.</P>
        <P>The situation is not the same in respect of other cases.  When value added tax was first introduced 20 or 30 years ago, some traders insisted on showing value added tax as a separate charge.  This meant customers believed they were purchasing something at a lower price and it was only when they came to pay the real cost became apparent.  There is no easy solution to this matter.  However, what we are attempting to do in the Bill is to avoid misleading customers and ensuring there will be increased competition in the future.</P>
        <P>The Bill is worthwhile and is aimed in the right direction.  However, I have a number of concerns about it and perhaps we might be able to tease them out on Committee and Report Stages.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the ideal solution in terms of a customer obtaining a fair deal is providing that customer with choice.  We must maintain competition and, to ensure that this happens, we must encourage as many traders as possible to remain in business.  We must also ensure people cannot engage in many of the sharp practices to which previous speakers referred and to which the Bill alludes.</P>
        <P>We are nowhere near the end of this process and there are a number of further steps that must be taken to encourage increased public awareness.  A great way to assist members of the public is to provide them with information.  When such information is hidden from people, we deprive them of the ability to make rational and reasonable decisions.</P>
        <P>I began by using the Latin term &ldquo;<i>caveat emptor</i>&rdquo;.  I wish to conclude with another Latin phrase, namely, &ldquo;<i>Obesa non iam cantava</i>&rdquo;.  The Minister of State may not be too sure as to the meaning of this phrase but I can inform him that it translates as &ldquo;The fat lady has not sung yet&rdquo;.  We have not yet reached the end of our journey and we have a long way to go.  What we want to achieve with this legislation is ensure that everything will be open and above board, that there will be competition and that members of the public will be presented with choice and with the knowledge relating thereto.  We must ensure ways are not found to hide such knowledge from them before they make their decisions.  However, I am also of the opinion that most people cannot be fooled a second time.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; Bill that was voted down in the D&aacute;il some time ago.  That Bill did not go as far as the proposal currently before the House.  Furthermore, it would have done nothing to effectively transpose the unfair commercial practices directive and would have left us in breach of our obligations.</P>
        <P>Other Senators referred to the rate of inflation and accused the Government of contributing thereto.  I am not sure what national governments are expected to do about external factors &mdash; such as increases in oil or commodity prices &mdash; outside their control.  There are, however, instances where we can do something.  For example, we took action in respect of groceries order and costs were brought under control as a result.  The cost of groceries has declined by 1.6% since the order was removed last March.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan is being unfair to the NCA in suggesting it did nothing in response to the closure of BUPA.  The NCA was first into the fray and within 24 hours had placed extensive advice for consumers on its website.  Perhaps the Senator was unaware of that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in that proposal that is any different or better than what is being proposed in this Bill.  If the Senators read the Bill carefully they will understand that the national consumer agency has a wide range of powers to decide what is of most concern to consumers and to employ its resources to most effect.  That is a more effective approach than legislating in a prescriptive manner which allows the agency little flexibility in the way it responds to a particular set of circumstances.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the price charged for petrol by a garage in Usher&rsquo;s Quay.  This is an interesting case.  The most powerful sanction against businesses that charge excessively for its products is for consumers to bring their custom elsewhere.  Customers must be assertive in their reaction to such practices but I do not agree that a national consumer agency has an important role to play in bringing such matters into the public domain.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred also to display of prices.  I agree that the law in this regard is of great benefit to consumers.  That is the reason the <Col N="1776"/>Bill retains existing legislative provisions in that regard.  Indeed, the power to extend price display regulations is reinforced by this Bill.  Consumers are well advised to make use of the information and report it to the consumer agency when business fails to comply with its obligations in regard to the law.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris regarding his comments on prize draw scams, which do nothing but cost the consumer money.  The Bill seeks to tackle such practices.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also referred to the role of other regulators.  He mentioned ComReg and the financial regulator in particular.  The Bill requires the NCA to enter into agreements with other regulators to avoid duplication of activities.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris was wrong when he said that the groceries order had failed to bring down prices.  As I mentioned previously, since the order prices have come down by 1.6% at a time when the headline rate of inflation is 4.9%.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to this issue but he did not give due credit to the impact of the removal of the order.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole wanted to know the amount of money the NCA would have to spend.  It will have a budget of &euro;8.4 million in 2007 when combined with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  That is almost twice what was available to the ODCA on its coming into being in 2006.  Funding in future years will be decided as part of the Estimates process.  Staff numbers have increased from 62 to 69.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin referred to requests from overseas for people to provide their bank account details.  That issue is probably better tackled and prosecuted under fraud and theft legislation.  The likelihood is that regardless of the legislation in place, the perpetrators of such practices, who are often located in foreign parts far removed from these islands, will never be located or prosecuted.  The best way to deal with the issue appears to be to educate consumers not to be taken in by such scams.</P>
        <P>Senator McDowell referred to the consolidation of existing law.  He admitted to not being a good consumer, one who is not price sensitive and does not shop around.  Senator McDowell was right when he talked about changing consumer culture.  That will be a key task of the national consumer agency.  He was right, too, when he referred to the powerful sanction that is a name and shame policy.  That is a key part of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt and a significant number of other Senators referred to financial services, be it money lenders, equity release, which should really be called borrowing, credit cards and so on.  These all fall under the remit of the financial regulator.  However, the provisions of the Bill also apply to financial services and arrangements will be put in place under the Bill to ensure co-oper<Col N="1777"/>ation between the national consumer agency and the financial regulator.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross said the Bill is particularly unsatisfactory, that it was a snow job producing another quango with no powers.  I reject such suggestions.  The Bill will have extensive powers and it is in these uses that those powers will be critical.  Much of his commentary was directed against the financial services sector &mdash; auctioneers, stockbrokers, banks, investment managers, etc.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross missed much of the point of the Bill.  We must change a culture and the approach to doing business.  Senator Ormonde spoke of a new direction for consumers, and that is the point.  Business must see consumers as an asset, not as a target to be ripped off.  Consumers must be educated and helped to understand how they can help themselves.  There is a world of difference between buying a loaf of bread or a pair of shoes and buying stocks and shares or an investment policy.  Traders in all sectors must treat consumers fairly and with respect.  Consumers must know their rights and stand up for them where they are denied.  That is a culture shift that the legislation and the national consumer agency can help bring about.  Prosecutions and enforcements are only part of a much bigger picture and I urge Senator Ross to check his facts in that regard.</P>
        <P>I thank the other Senators who also contributed to the debate and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2006: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Defence Forces are one of the fundamental pillars of a democratic society.  Every member of our Defence Forces has volunteered to serve the State.  They undertake to obey all lawful orders issued to them and to submit to the unique code of discipline, an essential part of military life.  From time to time they are asked to undertake dangerous and difficult missions on our behalf, both in the State and while engaged in peace support or humanitarian missions abroad.  Over many years the Defence Forces have rightly earned the high respect and regard of the people.  Around the world Irish military personnel are widely admired for their outstanding commitment and professionalism.  Our Defence Forces are highly trained and well equipped.  Military personnel have consistently shown the highest standards of courage and discipline in responding to the call of duty.</P>
        <P>The ability of the Defence Forces to continue to maintain this high standard demanded of them requires complete clarity with regard to the exercise of command authority whether at home or abroad.  For challenges and dangerous missions to succeed, the chain of command must be clear and unambiguous at all times.  This is critical to the maintenance of unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.  Discipline is of the essence in a military force.  Commanding officers are responsible for discipline within their units.  They exercise authority primarily through leadership and by inspiring the confidence, loyalty and trust of their subordinates.  Officers and non-commissioned officers receive a world class military education which emphasises leadership, teamwork and a sense of responsibility for the welfare of the individual soldier.  As a result there is a high standard of discipline and offences are rare.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces, however, must have the ultimate power to enforce discipline through its own unique code of discipline in the military justice system.  The disciplinary code must sup<Col N="1779"/>port operational effectiveness and be efficient and effective.  Above all, it must be fair to the individual.  The primary purpose of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is to modernise the code of discipline by amending and updating the provisions of Part V of the Defence Acts, having due regard to prevailing human rights norms.  The Bill provides for new structures, scope, procedures, punishments and appeal processes governing both summary investigations and courts-martial.  New measures include the establishment of an independent military prosecuting authority and an independent military judicial office, the appointment of a court-martial administrator, the establishment of a new summary court-martial and the restructuring of general and limited courts-martial.</P>
        <P>In modernising the disciplinary provisions of the Defence Acts, regard was had to recent developments in the military law of other common law jurisdictions and in ordinary criminal law.  Most importantly, I want to ensure the Irish military disciplinary system is fully compliant with modern European and domestic human rights norms.</P>
        <P>Part V of the Defence Act 1954 provides for disciplinary procedures under military law for members of the Defence Forces.  Apart from the establishment in 1983 of the Courts-Martial Appeals Court, the introduction of a legal aid scheme and some updating of punishments for breaches of military law, the system has remained largely unchanged since.  However, during the past 50 years several important developments have impacted on military law and disciplinary procedures.  These include case law decisions of the Irish Courts-Martial Appeal Court; various important statutory developments and case law decisions in criminal law; case law decisions emanating from the European Court of Human Rights, particularly those in respect of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights; and significant developments in the military justice systems of other common law jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the European Court of Human Rights has benchmarked the independence of military courts by reference to several key indicators including the mode of appointment and terms of office of the court members, protections provided against external influence and the provision of a manifest appearance of independence.  It has also stated that to satisfy an impartiality requirement, military courts must be subjectively free of prejudice or bias and must provide sufficient objective guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this matter.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, in July 2001, the military authorities established a military law review board to review the adequacy, effectiveness and fairness of the military justice system as laid down in Part V of the Defence Act.  Particular regard was had to <Col N="1780"/>decisions of the European Court of Human Rights as they related to the administration of military justice.  The board reported to the military authorities in April 2002.  It recommended amending 76, out of a total of 134 sections, within Part V, all of which were reviewed.  The recommendations were fully approved by the Office of the Attorney General in July 2003.  It recommended incorporation of the recommendations by appropriate amendment of the Defence Act 1954.</P>
        <P>Ireland is an original party to the European Convention on Human Rights since it came into force in 1953 and the convention has been incorporated into Irish law by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, with effect from 31 December 2003.  Since then, there is an explicit obligation upon every organ of State to operate in a manner compatible with the convention.  Rights under the convention can be pursued primarily and directly before domestic courts.</P>
        <P>Pending the introduction of the Bill, non-statutory interim measures were implemented with regard to the summary investigation of offences and the conduct of courts-martial under the Defence Act.  These measures were designed to substantially satisfy the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights in the conduct of military legal proceedings.  However, I am now proposing to put in place a comprehensive range of pro-active statutory provisions, aimed to meet with, or exceed, international best practice and human rights norms in this regard.  The Bill contains many new arrangements and procedures to achieve that objective.  The members of our Defence Forces, who serve our State so loyally both at home and abroad, deserve nothing less than that.</P>
        <P>Since the report of the military law review board was submitted, several legal challenges to the old system have been taken to the High Court.  I will not refer to any of these cases other than that they will take their course in the normal way.  However, I believe the measures which I am now proposing will address any concerns which have been raised by serving personnel in recent times.  I also believe the measures contained in the Bill will be welcomed by all members of the Defence Forces.  The measures will ensure that the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act relating to summary procedures and courts-martial comply fully with best practice and human rights norms.</P>
        <P>The general scheme, as approved in June 2005, contained 141 heads of Bill.  However, because of the importance in bringing forward modernising legislation as soon as possible and the complexity and extent of the proposed legislation, it was decided to focus initially on the more urgent amendments to the provisions of Part V.  Several other less urgent amendments, which are relatively straightforward, have also been included.  I <Col N="1781"/>will not detail the remaining proposals to amend the Act which were in the general scheme but not included in the Bill.  They will, in due course, contribute to the further improvement of the military justice system.  These further proposals are complex in nature and are not yet ready for inclusion in this Bill.  Instead, I propose to include them in a separate Bill at a later date.  I intend to commence work on preparing the new general scheme of Bill for these deferred amendments in the second half of 2007.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the 1954 Act were largely influenced by the Canadian and British systems then in place.  The approach taken in this Bill is that which best suits the Defence Forces&rsquo; needs and resources having due regard to current human rights norms and other common law jurisdictions and systems.  A comparative study of the Canadian, British, Australian and other common law systems, as well as careful consideration of human rights norms and the ordinary criminal justice system in Ireland, influenced the formulation of these proposals, which, in some aspects, will be unique to this country.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of the Bill is to overhaul radically the procedures for the summary disposal or trial by court martial of offences against military law.  The amendments are extensive and time does not permit me to explain every provision in detail.  I will focus only on the main provisions.  Sections 12 and 14 provide for the revision of the time limits for the bringing of prosecutions.  The time limit for the bringing of a charge against a person who has left the Defence Forces is extended from three to six months.  For serious offences the present three-year time limit will be increased to six years.  For minor disciplinary offences, dealt with summarily, the time limit will be reduced from three years to one year.  Time limits for trial by court martial will not apply to civil offences committed while serving outside the State.</P>
        <P>Section 13 amends the existing law in regard to a limited range of circumstances in which a civilian may be subject to military law.  I propose to extend to them the option of being dealt with summarily, with a right of appeal to a summary court martial.  By being dealt with summarily, they are exposed to the possibility of a lesser punishment, which cannot include a custodial sentence.  Sections 15 to 19, inclusive, make necessary amendments to five of the offences against military law provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 20 provides for the scheduling of offences of a disciplinary nature which can be dealt with summarily by an authorised, commanding or subordinate officer, as appropriate.  These offences are in respect of matters which, although vital to the maintenance of discipline in the military context, are considered suitable for summary disposal.  The summary disposal of the potentially more serious disciplinary offences <Col N="1782"/>requires the prior consent of the director of military prosecutions.</P>
        <P>Sections 22 to 30, inclusive, make extensive amendments to the existing law dealing with the investigation and summary disposal of charges against officers by authorised officers, men by commanding officers and privates and seamen by subordinate officers, respectively.  The aim of the summary procedure is to deal fairly and swiftly with minor disciplinary infractions within the unit and to return the member to normal service as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Included in these sections are the provision that a person charged with an offence will have a right to at least 24 hours written notice of the date, time and place at which the charge is to be investigated, a copy of the charge sheet, a list of witnesses and a copy of any available evidence.  In every case, a person charged with an offence will have a right to elect for trial by court martial at the outset and an opportunity to obtain legal advice, if required, in that regard.  The summary disposal of charges is limited to offences that are disciplinary rather than criminal in nature, that is, scheduled offences.  A person charged with an offence, which is being dealt with summarily, will have a right to have an &ldquo;assisting person&rdquo;&rsquo; present at the investigation.  The commanding officer&rsquo;s power to award detention will be abolished.  Where a charge is dealt with summarily by an authorised or commanding officer, there will be an absolute right of appeal to a new summary court martial, against the determination and-or the punishment awarded.  Where a person is remanded for trial by court martial, the case will be referred to the director of military prosecutions for his or her directions.</P>
        <P>Section 32 provides for the appointment of a court martial administrator.  His or her function will be the management and control of the administration and business of courts martial, the convening of courts martial, on the direction of the director of military prosecutions, and the appointment of members of court martial boards.  He or she will be independent in the performance of his or her functions and will not be in the same chain of command as the person charged.  The court martial administrator replaces the convening authority.  This provision provides a statutory basis for the current practice.</P>
        <P>Section 33 provides for the establishment of an independent military prosecuting authority, to be called the director of military prosecutions.  He or she will decide, as the Director of Public Prosecutions does in the ordinary criminal legal system, all issues relating to the prosecution of offences before courts martial.  He or she will have primary responsibility for the direction and conduct of prosecutions at courts martial.</P>
        <P>Section 34 provides for the establishment of an independent military judicial office with the appointment, by an independent authority, of one <Col N="1783"/>or more military judges.  A military judge will have security of tenure and a judicial role similar to that of a civilian judge.  This role replaces that of the existing judge-advocate.</P>
        <P>Section 38 provides for the establishment of a new class of court martial called the summary court martial.  It will be a permanent court, composed of a military judge sitting alone.  The summary court martial will have jurisdiction to deal with less serious cases remanded for trial by court martial, appeals from summary cases and applications for legal aid.</P>
        <P>Sections 39 and 40 provide for the restructuring of general and limited courts martial.  These courts martial will consist of a military judge and a court martial board.  The military judge will preside over the trial, as a civilian judge does in the ordinary courts.  He or she will determine all legal issues and decide sentence.  Military judges will neither be involved in nor have a vote in the deliberations of the board.  The board will make findings of fact, as a jury does, and will have no role in sentencing.  Where the accused is not an officer, a senior non-commissioned officer may be a member of the board.  Section 41 expands the list of persons who may not be members of a court martial board.</P>
        <P>Section 42 provides for the general jurisdiction of the new summary court martial.  It also amends the existing jurisdiction for limited and general courts martial.  Specified serious offences are excluded from the jurisdiction of both the summary and limited courts martial in all circumstances.  When exercising its original jurisdiction, the maximum punishment that can be awarded by the summary court martial will be six months imprisonment.  When acting as an appeal court, a summary court martial cannot award a custodial punishment or any punishment greater than that which could have been awarded at the summary investigation.  The jurisdiction of the general court martial is amended to include a case of rape or aggravated sexual assault, where the person in respect of whom the offence was committed is, or was at the time, subject to military law.  This jurisdiction is conditional on the consent of both that person and the DPP.</P>
        <P>Sections 43 to 47, inclusive, deal with matters of procedure at courts martial.  Section 48 amends the existing law, which requires a simple majority for decisions of a court martial.  I am proposing a new requirement of a two thirds majority of a court martial board to make a finding of guilty.  If less than two-thirds of the court martial board vote for a guilty finding on any charge, the accused shall be acquitted of that charge.</P>
        <P>Sections 50 to 52, inclusive, deal with necessary amendments to the existing provisions regarding issues as to the mental state of an accused person either at the time of the commission of an offence or at the time of trial.  Section 53 makes new pro<Col N="1784"/>vision for victim impact statements in the case of certain offences of a sexual or violent nature.  Sections 54 to 56, inclusive, deal with further procedural amendments.</P>
        <P>Sections 57 and 58 make adjustments and additions to the scale of punishments awardable at court martial, including new monetary provisions.  The existing mandatory requirement on a court martial to sentence an officer to dismissal, when it awards him or her imprisonment, has been limited to situations where the term of imprisonment awarded exceeds six months.  In line with this, the term of imprisonment, above which a court martial must also sentence an enlisted person to discharge from the Defence Forces, has been reduced from two years to six months.</P>
        <P>Section 60 makes new provision that a person cannot be sentenced, by a court martial, to imprisonment, or dismissal or discharge, if that person has not had legal representation at some time after the finding of guilt and prior to sentencing.  This is a useful additional safeguard, in circumstances where a person charged is represented during the trial, at his or her own request, by a military officer, who may not have any legal background or training.  This section also stipulates circumstances where this provision will not apply, including where a person specifically declines to be legally represented.</P>
        <P>Section 61 makes provision for the suspension, by a military judge, of custodial sentences, with or without conditions attached, other than in the case of a mandatory term of imprisonment.  This effectively replaces and expands the existing law, which provides for the suspension of custodial sentences, for enlisted personnel only, by a specified &ldquo;superior authority&rdquo;, which is obviously no longer appropriate.</P>
        <P>Section 62 makes new provision that, in certain circumstances, the director of military prosecutions, similar to the DPP, can appeal unduly lenient sentences to the courts martial appeal court.  Sections 63 and 64 modify existing provisions regarding compensation orders and fines.  Sections 65 to 69, inclusive, deal with post-trial matters, including the implementation of a custodial sentence.</P>
        <P>Section 70 modifies existing provisions relating to rules of procedure.  Section 71 provides for the establishment of a new courts-martial rules committee whose function is to make court-martial rules, governing the practice, pleadings and procedures generally of courts-martial on a similar basis to the Circuit Court rules committee.  In the existing Act, the power to makes these rules is vested in the Minister under section 240.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains a number of Schedules which deal with such matters as transitional provisions and miscellaneous amendments to other statutes.  The Bill also provides, through the repeal of sections 215 to 222, inclusive, of the existing Act, <Col N="1785"/>for the abolition of the processes of confirmation, revision, mitigation and remission of the findings and sentences of courts-martial.  Since the introduction of the court-martial appeals court, there is no requirement for the continued retention of these processes.</P>
        <P>In addition to the disciplinary-type provisions I have described, section 8 amends section 61 of the existing Act to provide for greater flexibility in the transfer between service corps of personnel enlisted into the Permanent Defence Force after the commencement date of this section.  Currently, personnel who have served more than ten years in one service corps can only be transferred to another service corps in particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>Although matters relating to discipline are outside the scope of the representative functions of the associations, both RACO and PDFORRA have been fully briefed on the contents of the Bill and have welcomed the measures contained therein.  PDFORRA has specifically stated that the new right of appeal to the summary court-martial is a major step forward.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased to submit this legislation for the consideration of this House.  The changes to the Defence Act are both necessary and desirable to ensure that the military law justice system is expeditious and fair to the individual, contributes significantly to the maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces, complies with the Constitution and, most importantly, to ensure that the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act relating to summary procedures and courts-martial are fully compliant with prevailing human rights norms.  I look forward to hearing the views and contributions of Senators in their deliberations.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for presenting the Bill.  I commend his hope that he will still be in office in the second half of 2007 to bring forward the new general scheme of the Bill.  He might even get a promotion following the general election.  One never knows.  However, I commend his bold assertion that he will be in office throughout 2007 to bring this a step further.</P>
        <P>When speaking on defence matters in the House, I always ensure we put on the record our appreciation of all Defence Forces&rsquo; personnel for their continued contribution to this country and the way they perform their duties at home and abroad in our names.  I have made a habit of doing so since I was appointed defence spokesperson for my party in the House.  It is important other Senators do so too.</P>
        <P>It is very important that whatever changes we support in this Bill, which, in effect, modernises existing law in this area dating back to 1954, we understand that neither House of the Oireachtas can introduce a law which is repugnant to the <Col N="1786"/>Constitution.  It is, therefore, important to state that although the Defence Forces have a special place and special rules apply to them, all the rules in the primary legislation and the amendments proposed in this Bill must not be repugnant to the Constitution and they must comply, in every sense, to our constitutional law because, in effect, some of the changes being made limit rights.  One understands, in the context of the Defence Forces and of people following specific orders, it is a requirement that sometimes those rights must be limited.  Nonetheless, it is important we ensure these special provisions, which will apply to a group of citizens who have signed a contract to work in our Defence Forces, are totally<i> ad idem</i> with all aspects of the Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister said he had discussions with the various organisations representing the Defence Forces, which I welcome.  Has he had discussions with Irish Human Rights Commission?  He said one of the reasons we are amending the primary legislation 50 years after it was introduced is because of developments in human rights legislation not only from a European perspective but from a domestic one as well.  When discussions on this Bill were taking place at Attorney General level in 2003 or when the scheme was being put in a more concrete form, did the Department have discussions on the provisions with the Irish Human Rights Commission?  If that did not happen, I wish to state why it is important that it should have.  We cannot lecture other jurisdictions, whether on this island or in other parts of the world, on recourse to human rights legislation if we bypass the very institution which both Houses of the Oireachtas established.  It should be a matter of course in the drawing up of any Bill concerning the human rights of any group of citizens that the Irish Human Rights Commission is involved in the process and that its views are made known.  I would be interested to know whether that happened in this case because it is important we get into the habit of doing that when dealing with human rights.  I accept what the Minister said that many of the amendments are based on that new human rights code, domestic law and military justice systems in other common law jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>There is little information in the public domain on this issue.  How many courts martial take place annually?  Are proceedings recorded?  Is there a written transcript which one would get in a court room or in this House?  It is important to establish that for the record, particularly when debating a matter such as this which has not been debated for a long time.  Will the Minister also elaborate on the appointment of military judges?  How are such appointments made?  Although we will have the chance to go through this on Committee Stage, I would be interested to know.</P>
        <P>It is important there is not a two-tier system within the Defence Forces and that it is clear to <Col N="1787"/>all serving officers and non-commissioned officers who is in control of this process, how they are appointed and that the chain of command in terms of the decision-making process is not only based in law but that it is transparent and above board.  We do not want a two-tiered system.  I am not suggesting we have such a system but the fact we are debating these matters allows us to at least look at the existing system and comment on it.  I would be interested to know how a person is appointed to this position in the military because it is important we get it right.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports this Bill in principle and we will go through it in more detail on Committee Stage.  It is important this legislation ensures that whatever system of justice applies to the Defence Forces, it is compatible with all human rights provisions, domestic and international.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael also believes it is important for the statute to be comprehensive and comprehensible for all members of the Defence Forces who are charged, as well as for those who are charged with the Defence Forces&rsquo; management.  In addition, it is vitally important that all such provisions are straightforward, fair and equitable for those who involve themselves in the process.</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding serving officers abroad.  The issue regarding the occurrence of alleged offences abroad has been highly contentious for military establishments in other jurisdictions.  I refer to the question as to whether the officers involved should be charged under domestic law in the country in question or are subject to courts martial in their own jurisdiction.  I wish to tease out this issue further because, as the Minister is aware, a significant number of Defence Forces personnel now serve abroad.  They frequently do so in a third world environment in which the level of jurisprudence and the operation of the courts may not be as advanced as it is in the domestic setting in Ireland.  When Irish soldiers serve in such conditions, it should be abundantly clear as to where the chain of command lies in respect of their accounting for their behaviour abroad.  I do not make any negative comments in this regard.  I am simply stating this has been a problem in other military establishments in which the question has been posed as to whether people should account for themselves at home or abroad, where the actual incident occurred.</P>
        <P>I presume I am correct to state that ultimately, in respect of a question of law, any Defence Forces member can take his or her case to a higher court and ultimately to the Supreme Court.  I refer to the question as to whether they have been given fair and natural justice.  It is important to state that while these special provisions exist within the military to deal with the issue of a chain of command and with discipline within the Defence Forces, ultimately the <Col N="1788"/>Supreme Court remains the final court of appeal regarding any aspect of Irish law and specifically when citizens believe their rights have been infringed, in terms of a point of law.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister referred to free legal aid and I presume that if a charge is laid against a serving member of the Defence Forces, he or she can select his or her defence.  I am unclear as to whether the defence must come from within the military legal establishment, as opposed to a defence barrister or advocate who comes from outside that system and the Minister should clarify this point.</P>
        <P>In general, Fine Gael is supportive of this Bill and its Members will work with the Government to ensure that when passed, the legislation will be an effective and modern piece of law to deal with a special circumstance existing within the military.</P>

      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and his officials to the House.  I thank the Minister and the Government for bringing this important legislation before the Seanad for its first reading.  This demonstrates the importance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I hope this Bill receives the approval of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Defence Forces represent a major and important pillar of the State.  The Naval Service, the Army and the Air Corps all have roles to play, both domestically and in the global arena.  All Members are aware of the Naval Service&rsquo;s recent involvement in the operations in Dunmore East and Mine Head and its outstanding work in that area in the course of a major tragedy.  It is frequently involved in assisting the Garda and in thwarting drugs smuggling and the protection of Irish waters.  The Air Corps is regularly called out to assist in search and rescue operations, as well as its day-to-day duties, including maritime surveillance, the operation of the air ambulance and ministerial transport.  Members recognise how the Army has come to the aid of civilians during recent major flooding problems and has been involved in assisting the Garda in efforts to halt serious gun crime in certain localities.  Internationally, the Defence Forces have taken part in missions throughout the globe and have been involved in peacekeeping, crisis management, and humanitarian relief operations in support of the United Nations for many years.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces constitute a massive asset to the State and the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2006 reflects the changing nature and development of the armed forces.  The proposed legislation seeks to marry the unique nature of military operations and military justice with a clearer and fairer system for handing down sentences.  In turn, this will make our armed forces more efficient, more capable and better equipped to meet the needs of a changing Ireland and a changing world.</P><Col N="1789"/>
        <P>There have been many recent instances of military justice being tested internationally, including the US army&rsquo;s operations in Iraq, the Deepcut bullying scandal within the British army and even allegations of UN peacekeepers abusing local populations they were sent to protect.  Such examples demonstrate clearly the need to have a solid and effective disciplinary system in place.  The aforementioned scandals have adversely affected the image and integrity of the respective armed forces, which in turn has led to a serious lack of credibility and trust in their ability to function.  While I hope sincerely that the Irish military will never be embroiled in such scandal, it is imperative that the Irish armed forces should be in a position to act decisively to punish any wrongdoers and to so do swiftly.</P>
        <P>As we embark on the 21st century, disciplinary procedures and processes of the Defence Forces require comprehensive examination and review in order that they reflect the values and strength of the State and of the forces themselves.  This legislation, which will amend and extend the Defence Acts 1954 to the present, represents a significant stepping stone in the modernisation of the Irish forces.  It will allow the implementation of markedly more streamlined disciplinary procedures while enhancing the ability of the forces to function as successfully in future as they have done heretofore.</P>
        <P>The maintenance of discipline is an integral component of an efficient and effective military organisation.  This Bill will improve the military prosecution services by overhauling radically many of the procedures involved in punishing offences against military law.  The Bill seeks to develop the independence, administrative efficiency and transparency of military investigations and prosecutions.  The Bill will also widen the options open to the servicemen and women who face trial or who have committed offences.  For example, it will allow them legal representation or advice before making a decision.  The need for fairness in the provision of justice is as important in the military, as in the civilian, sphere.  This legislation should be welcomed as an opportunity to put in place a modern process that couples humanitarian needs with the requirements of the military.  In the civilian sphere, both the Government and the President will be involved in the appointment of officers and judges, who will be subject to review in the same manner as would a civil judge.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to establish greater independence in disciplinary procedures through the establishment of a military prosecuting authority to be known as the director of military prosecutions.  Staffed by qualified officers, it will decide on issues relating to prosecutions before courts martial take place in much the same manner as does the Director of Public Prosecutions in civil society.  An independent military judicial <Col N="1790"/>authority will be also established which will include one or more military judges with relevant legal qualifications.  The Minister for Defence shall appoint an officer of the Permanent Defence Force.  This recommendation will be made on the basis of a committee established to identify and assess the suitability of officers to the appointment.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the director of military prosecutions will consult from time to time on matters pertaining to functions of the director of military prosecutions.  On the recommendation of the Minister, the President will appoint as a military judge an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who is a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years&rsquo; standing.</P>
        <P>Expertise, experience, qualifications and independence must be recognised in the system of justice.  These proposed measures and safeguards will go a long way to ensure success.  A court martial administrator will be appointed to manage and control the business of prosecutions.  This will improve administration in military judicial systems.  The process will be quicker and more effective through referring matters for trial by summary court martial and selecting members of the court martial boards.</P>
        <P>The standing court martial will deal with less serious cases remanded for trial, thus reducing the need for many offences to proceed beyond the initial stage.  A court martial will make findings on the facts but will have no role in sentencing.  Greater efficiency will mean quicker processing and greater clarity and transparency.  This will benefit all members of the Defence Forces and will mean fewer delays in the military judicial system.</P>
        <P>Not only will this legislation revise disciplinary procedures from the top down, it will also enhance the options of the accused servicemen and servicewomen.  The system will resemble more the legal system existing in civil society.  A list of offences which can be dealt with without the need for court martial will be drawn up and certain offences will warrant certain statutory punishments.  However, the accused will be given the right to choose to be tried by court martial if he or she so wishes.</P>
        <P>Also included in the Bill is the right to appeal a sentence handed down by the court martial.  Those provisions closely mirror civil legislation where a person has the right to elect to plead his or her innocence to a judge or accept the punishment on the spot and where a citizen can appeal the decision of the court.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes to adjust the scale of many punishments at court martial.  While investigations are being carried out a commanding officer will no longer be empowered to award detention and confirming authority will no longer <Col N="1791"/>be needed to confirm the findings and sentence of a court martial.</P>
        <P>The Bill will make it easier to transfer personnel between service corps.  Currently, personnel who have served more than ten years in one service corps can only be transferred to another in particular circumstances.  These stipulations will be amended to provide greater flexibility in movement of personnel and resources, which must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>This Bill will strengthen our armed forces and make them a more balanced and responsive organisation.  The need for effective organs of justice in the armed forces are just as pressing as the need for justice in civil society.  Although norms and conventions exist which are unique to the Defence Forces, the need to reform them and provide for present and future generations of servicemen and servicewomen is as pressing in today&rsquo;s environment as it was when the Defence Forces were established.</P>
        <P>This Bill will allow the Defence Forces continue their strong tradition of integrity and honesty in the face of danger and will allow for greater discipline among the ranks.  I foresee this as being of benefit to the continued protection of the Irish State and in the service of the other international bodies under whose colours our men and women proudly serve.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister, his staff and all Defence Forces personnel for their outstanding contribution to the State.  I am delighted the Minister outlined that RACO and PDFORRA were fully briefed on the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House and I hope it gets a speedy passage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to make a brief contribution.  I welcome the Bill.  My party spokesperson, Senator Brian Hayes, spoke previously and we commend the Bill.  Will the Minister clarify one point from his speech regarding section 42?  It states the jurisdiction of the general court martial will be amended to include cases of rape or aggravated sexual assault where the person who committed the offence is or was at the time subject to military law.  The jurisdiction is conditional on the consent of both that person and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  When I examined the Schedule, I did not see what would be the penalty.  It mentions six-month sentences for various offences.  What would be the penalty for such a serious matter?  Will the Minister clarify this in his reply to the debate?</P>
        <P>I am glad RACO and PDFORRA were consulted on the Bill.  My party supports the main thrust of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in welcoming the Minister and his officials to the House.  I welcome the Bill.  In recent years, we had many changes in our Defence Forces with the modern<Col N="1792"/>isation of equipment, training and facilities.  It is only right and proper that we also have the modernisation of the legal system.</P>
        <P>Military law is a distinct legal system to which members of the Defence Forces are subject.  Most countries have special, additional laws and often a legal system applicable to members of the military and not usually to civilians.  Military law deals with issues such as the procedures for military discipline, what is a lawful command and obligations of service personnel.  It is important that military law is kept in line with civilian law and developments in civilian law.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend and update the disciplinary provisions of Part V of the Defence Acts having due regard to prevailing human rights norms.  The Bill provides for the summary disposal of charges, the establishment and jurisdiction of summary courts martial and the appointment of the court martial administrator, the director of military prosecutions and a military judge.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the constitution of courts martial and membership of the court, the procedures before courts martial, the award and execution of punishments by courts martial and the suspension of sentences.  As a former member of the Defence Forces, I partook in the military legal system, both as a commanding officer and as a member of courts martial.  I defended people when directed or requested to do so.  Thankfully, I was never a defendant myself.</P>
        <P>I have a certain amount of knowledge and experience of military discipline procedures and the uniqueness of how it operates.  When one transfers into political life and is on the other side of the fence when dealing with cases, one can see a great need for fairness in the administration of military law to ensure it is kept in line with the norms of civilian life and, more particularly, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights which is now enshrined in Irish law.  I welcome the Bill as being both progressive and positive.  It is based on the best international practices and human rights norms.</P>
        <P>Summary disposals of charges by commanding officers will now be confined to charges mainly of a disciplinary nature.  This is very important and is one of the major steps in this Bill.  The United Kingdom updated its system some time ago but did not go as far as we and, earlier this year, was found wanting in this regard by the European Court of Human Rights.  The 1954 Act was badly in need of review and modernisation and I commend the military authorities for taking the initiative in 2001 to establish a review board to that end.  The Minister said a number of cases were being put forward for judicial review and, as he rightly said, they will take their course.  However, we should acknowledge that this action is not in response to those cases but was in train <Col N="1793"/>before they were initiated.  The initiative of the Defence Forces in the area of criminal law and courts martial is proactive and in keeping with national and international norms.</P>
        <P>I will deal with a couple of points in the Bill.  The punishment awarded by a commanding officer can now be appealed to a summary court martial and the defendant will not be at risk of a custodial sentence should he or she decide to do so.  That is an important step as we have moved on from the time when a soldier could be marched off the square for a minor indiscretion, such as having dirty boots, and suddenly find himself in front of a commanding officer, being tried and sentenced in a matter of an hour.  The defendant now has the right to see the charges and the list of witnesses and to take advice and that is a step in the right direction.  The removal of the power of detention at that level is vitally important.  Detention and the removal of liberty are major steps and should only be carried out after due process and a fair legal hearing.  This Bill enshrines the principle that detention as a result of military discipline will happen after due process.</P>
        <P>The provisions for a defendant to be allowed time to elect for trial by court martial in advance of the summary trial, as distinct from after the summary officer has found guilt and passed sentence, are also important rights.  The fact that a defendant can be accompanied by an assisting person during the process is also important.  It is right and proper that a soldier in a military disciplinary procedure has somebody present to provide advice.  The fact that he or she can ask for an adjournment for 48 hours to consider the case is also welcome.</P>
        <P>Legal aid is also an important issue and was raised by Senator Brian Hayes.  It is not acceptable that a member of the Defence Forces go through the legal system, particularly a court martial, without proper legal aid.  My understanding is that legal aid will be provided in courts martial but not in summary trials.  The option to elect for court martial protects legal rights.  I hope the Minister will mention the legal aid system in his reply.  Will outside lawyers be available, paid by the State?  I presume they will.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that senior NCOs, such as sergeant majors and battalion quartermaster sergeants, will now serve on a court martial.  It will help military discipline, avoiding a them and us scenario of officers versus enlisted personnel.  I also welcome the fact that senior NCOs form part of the disciplinary process.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to refer to section 42 in his reply.  It provides that, when acting as an appeal court, a summary court martial cannot award a custodial punishment or any punishment greater than which could have been awarded at the summary investigation.  That strikes me as a message to defendants to appeal everything and I am con<Col N="1794"/>cerned about it.  If a person appeals, he or she must take on some risk of a greater sentence.  What is to stop everyone appealing a summary decision if they do not run the risk of a greater sentence?  It strikes me that every summary trial will now be appealed, though that may not be the case.</P>
        <P>The new system will increase the workload of the legal branch of the Defence Forces.  I wish it well, however, because the changes are necessary.  We must ensure that the legal system within the Defence Forces is adequate and that there are adequate numbers of trained legal personnel.  As Senator Brian Hayes pointed out, Irish troops currently serve overseas and it is important we are able to stand over our legal system and that it is in keeping not only with our national laws but with best international practice.</P>
        <P>The fact that both representative bodies have welcomed this Bill must be a positive step for the future of our Defence Forces and for military discipline.  I particularly welcome the appointment of one or more military judges, which is a positive move.</P>
        <P>This is not a brief Bill.  It is comprehensive and I congratulate those associated with its drafting.  I congratulate the Defence Forces on the work they do at home and abroad.  They are the true ambassadors of this country on the international stage, a fact about which we do not speak often enough in these Houses.  A telling remark was made to me by a politician visiting our troops overseas some years ago to the effect that they were the best kept secret from the Irish people.  If that is the case, we should ensure they do not remain a secret and avail of every opportunity to congratulate them and highlight the tremendous work they do, both at home and abroad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill.  My principle reason for contributing to this debate is to express my respect for the role played by the Defence Forces and the pride that I and practically every other citizen take in them.  To the best of my knowledge, historically, and certainly since the mid-1920s, they have never disgraced the name of this country.  Discipline and its maintenance are a very important element of the high regard in which they are held.  As Senator Minihan said, when serving abroad they are, in a sense, ambassadors of this country.  There have been contingents, even of our own Defence Forces, in which isolated individual soldiers have not always behaved well.  However, if a soldier is trying to re-establish the rule of law and prevent conflict, impeccable behaviour is necessary.</P>
        <P>In the context of domestic security, it is important the public sees a disciplined force and has confidence in it.  Conditions may have become more difficult in that regard.  We no longer live in an hierarchical society.  Most organisations do not <Col N="1795"/>rely on the issuing of orders and instructions; persuasion and motivation are used more.  I am sure this change has spread to the Defence Forces.  I remember the debates that led to the establishment of RACO and the other representative organisation.  I am glad that difficult bridge was crossed because it has worked well.</P>
        <P>Since the end of the Second World War, we have not expected blind obedience to orders.  Rather, we expect an enlightened carrying out of reasonable instructions and people, right down to privates, to take responsibility for their actions and to exercise discretion responsibly in many situations.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;persons&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;men&rdquo; in the language of section 58.  While there may be a good reason for this, I do not understand it.  As we have seen on parades, such as at the 1916 commemoration, women serve in the Defence Forces.  I understand that legislatively speaking, &ldquo;men&rdquo; may be taken as comprehending women, but why is it necessary to phrase it in a gender-specific way given our contemporary Defence Forces?</P>
        <P>My next point may be more fundamental, but I do not know whether it has been considered.  We are discussing modernising military law and the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;military courts&rdquo; several times in his speech.  Should we consider modernising our language?  As a member of the public, the term &ldquo;courts martial&rdquo; conjures an image of summary justice and executions at dawn.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It conjures up what Voltaire described as &ldquo;<i>pour encourager les autres</i>&rdquo; when Admiral Byng was shot.  Why can the legislation not refer to military courts?  We are not discussing the drastic punishments of the past.  It is almost as if the church or ecclesiastical courts still called themselves the inquisition.</P>
        <P>One could argue that a name that increases fear is not bad, but the term &ldquo;courts martial&rdquo; carries much historical baggage and imagery.  Given our civilianised military and human rights culture, could we not use the phrase &ldquo;military courts&rdquo; as used in the Minister&rsquo;s speech?  I will leave him to reflect on this question.  If he says in his wisdom that &ldquo;courts martial&rdquo; is the term with which people in the Defence Forces are accustomed and it does not alarm anyone unduly, I will accept his word.</P>

	<P>I echo the comments made on all sides of the House in welcoming the Bill, which <Col N="1796"/>is significant in terms of its content and how it updates legislation dating back to the Defence Act 1954.</P>
        <P>I have no wish to keep the House from hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply on Second Stage, but I would like to trail on the historical coat-tails of my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Mansergh, in respect of the imagery the Bill conjures up among those of us with an interest in military history.  In reading the Bill, I agree with Senator Mansergh on the language used to some extent.  For those of us involved in the Shot at Dawn campaign, the language conjures up images of young Irish men being taken out and shot.  While those images are far removed from the reality of today&rsquo;s legislation, I am influenced by them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One section provides that sentences cannot be passed unless legal representation is provided for the defendant, which is welcome.  I could not help but reflect on how many young Irish lives would have been saved had such legal representation been mandatory under the rules of courts martial before the establishment of the State.</P>
        <P>I do not expect the Minister to give me a lesson on military jargon for slow learners, but there are references to &ldquo;court martial&rdquo; and &ldquo;courts martial&rdquo; in the same sentences.  What is the distinction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>One is plural.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew a clever Member would tell me, but will the Minister put it on the record?  I know the latter is plural, but it sometimes can be confusing for a lay person.  It is not a significant issue and I am grateful that my colleagues corrected my inadequacies in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to change &ldquo;ignominy&rdquo; to &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo;.  I presume the original Act referred to a dismissal from the Defence Forces with ignominy.  Speaking as a lay person, why did the Minister not include the international phrase &ldquo;dishonourable discharge&rdquo; in the Bill?  Perhaps I watch too many Hollywood movies and it is a uniquely American expression, but &ldquo;dishonourable discharge&rdquo; carries a cachet understood by everyone.  I appreciate that &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; carries a similar cachet.  I may be corrected on whether the former is an international norm, but I have been always of the opinion that when dismissed from the defence forces or army of any country, it was a dishonourable discharge as distinct from with disgrace.</P>
        <P>Section 42 refers to the various offences treated by a general, limited or summary court martial, namely, manslaughter, rape under section 4 within the meaning of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 or aggravated sexual assault within the meaning of the same Act.  Will the Minister indicate what sentences would be imposed for those offences?  I could not find a <Col N="1797"/>specific reference in the Schedules.  I presume those offences would be outside the normal military discipline, namely, those that can be committed by anyone whether he or she is a member of the Defence Forces.  Would they be dealt with differently because the people in question are subject to military law?</P>
        <P>In the legislation, the president referred to is the president of the military court, but what is the role of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces under the Constitution?  She is not mentioned in the Bill and there is no reference to any role she may have.  I am showing once more my lack of intimate knowledge of the operation of courts martial but in an ordinary appeal, procedures are in place while the procedure here appears to be limited to within the military court and its president.  Could a convicted member of the Defence Forces appeal directly to the President, as the Commander in Chief of the armed forces?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lasting feeling in most people&rsquo;s minds following the spectacular commemorative ceremonies we witnessed last year, for both the 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising and the subsequent 90th anniversary of the battle of the Somme, is the pride we felt when the Irish Army marched proudly down O&rsquo;Connell Street and when it rightly took its place with the armies of the allied nations that fought in the First World War.  There is to this day a division of thought about whether Irishmen fighting in a British uniform in the First World War achieved anything much and I have strenuously argued with some people that they did not serve any great purpose ultimately.  Having said that, they did it for the noblest of reasons and, in the context of the Defence Forces today, I could not help but reflect on the continuum.  There are those in our society who suggest that our Defence Forces are not the legal, legitimate army of this country but no one who saw the displays last year would have any doubt that not only are they the legitimate Defence Forces but they make up an army of which we are all proud.</P>
        <P>The point has been eloquently made about our overseas commitments and the Army is a matter of pride to those of us who travel a great deal and engage in dialogue with those from other countries.  Our Defence Forces act as a benchmark for peacekeeping operations throughout the world.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill to the House.  We must acknowledge the work done by the military law review board, which came up with much more than is contained in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will be able to act on those other matters too.</P>
        <P>This debate allows us to reflect on the wider aspects of military life and the role of the Defence Forces.  There have been occasions in the past when people have questioned the need for <Col N="1798"/>the Defence Forces but I do not subscribe to that point of view.  We need them for several reasons, including the support of the civil power and the preservation of law and order and for peace and stability within the island, something they have achieved with great distinction.</P>
        <P>It is a fascinating aspect of Irish history that there was such a smooth transfer from the Cumann na nGaedhal Government to the first Fianna F&aacute;il Government, because it would have been understandable for many in the Army not to have supported the smooth transfer.  It is testimony to their commitment to the State that it happened so seamlessly.</P>

	<P>The true democrats on the political side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other aspects.  My own town of Newbridge has benefitted from the presence of the Defence Forces at civil level and the town has enhanced the lives of the members.</P>
        <P>We have unique qualities that have been beneficial in our United Nations service.  I was in the Gaza Strip and observed the work of some of our personnel and saw that can bridge the divides that more powerful countries cannot, an important aspect of the work of the Defence Forces.  I would like to see them play a full role in the European context and I welcome the rapid reaction force.  I hope we will contribute fully to our obligations within that context.</P>
        <P>High standards are required and that is why military law differs from civil law in what it asks of members of the forces.  I agree with Senator Mooney, however, that it is appalling that people were taken out and shot because they were shell-shocked.  If a sentry falls asleep and his comrades lives are put at risk it is a serious matter but execution is not the way forward.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned service abroad and the civil law, as covered in sections 14 and 42 of the Bill.  If someone serving in the Army with the United Nations committed an offence such as murder in an Islamic country where it is a capital crime, what would happen?  Even though the person has committed a heinous crime, we must protect his life.  When would we not hand someone over to the civil authorities in the state where the crime was committed?  This is a fraught area that we must address.</P>
        <P>There are different standards in peacetime and in time of war.  What happens in a peacetime situation would warrant a lesser penalty than a similar offence in a wartime situation.  When I was growing up in Newbridge, the main offence before courts martial was bicycle theft, which was a result of personnel from the Curragh going to local pubs and then being unable to get home late at night &mdash; they would steal a bicycle from outside a shop to get back.  I often wondered why they did not stay in the messes where the drink was <Col N="1799"/>much cheaper but then I remembered the lack of women in there.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions on time limits, administration, the independent authority and an independent military judicial officer.  They clean up many of the areas that needed to be examined.  The Bill has done a good day&rsquo;s work in that regard.</P>
        <P>Where the summary court martial operates, the subject of the court martial must make the election.  That is how it should be.  There should also be a system of appeal.  The worst situation could arise where the immediate line commanders or commanding officers of those charged are the judge and jury.  It is to the Bill&rsquo;s benefit that will not happen unless someone elects for the summary court martial to be dealt with by the commanding officer.  The two-thirds majority in coming to a decision is also important.  That independence for those adjudicating the court martial, so they are at a remove from the subject, will prevent cases like those in the past where direct prejudice and animosity resulted in defective judgments, something we must strive to avoid.  It is very important that judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are taken into account.  We are somewhat casual in Ireland about the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the ECHR&rsquo;s judgments.  Before Christmas, I visited Austria, where a strong line is taken on implementing the ECHR&rsquo;s judgments in domestic law.  I am glad the Bill takes a similar line and am happy to lend it my support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill, partly for the opportunity it presents to pay tribute to the Defence Forces&rsquo; fine peacekeeping record across the world, the credit they have brought to this country and what appears from the outside to be their generally high level of discipline and behaviour.  The Minister will be relieved to hear that I speak from a position of profound ignorance of the subject and I am grateful to Senator Minihan for the insights he has offered on how the system operates.</P>
        <P>I would like to link the points raised by Senator Dardis with the efforts made earlier by Senator Mansergh to demystify the loaded terms used when discussing this subject and to emphasise civilian processes to symbolise the change in the status of military personnel in a democratic society.  I am anxious that human rights norms are respected in these matters.  We ask soldiers to risk their lives to ensure the democratic rights of others, so the least we can offer them are the standards they are being asked to defend.  Irrespective of the system introduced, the right of soldiers to be treated as similarly to civilians as possible should be upheld, and they should be given full access to the protections offered in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European <Col N="1800"/>Court of Human Rights.  In that regard, why is it necessary to try a soldier accused of rape in a military court rather than a civilian one?  I acknowledge, however, the arguments made by Senator Dardis regarding crimes committed in countries which sanction the death penalty.  No soldier should be allowed to face any court or process in which the protections and penalties are not commensurate with those offered by Irish courts.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of a director of courts martial and related officers.  Appointees are required to be solicitors or barristers of ten years&rsquo; standing, although I note they can be deemed to have been practising if they have had a job which required similar qualifications.  That is a somewhat diluting provision, however, because the people acting in this capacity should be <i>au fait</i>  with the ordinary criminal and civil courts so that separate standards are not developed.  I wonder if there are sufficient personnel in the Defence Forces to fill this explosion of appointments or whether a civilian barrister or solicitor will have to be commissioned as an officer.</P>

        <P>One of the oldest manifestations of the ombudsman institution in Sweden is the office of the military ombudsman, which was established in 1713.  A similar office in Ireland might be worthwhile to help ensure ordinary soldiers have an external means of recourse.  Like earlier speakers, I hope for assurance that legal aid will be made available in appropriate cases.  I congratulate the Minister on this very progressive Bill and I am sure the Seanad will give it a fair wind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this interesting discussion.  Some of the points raised have already occurred to me, although I confess I had not considered others.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes asked whether I was satisfied that all the provisions of the Bill were constitutional.  Before we publish legislation, the Attorney General examines it for constitutionality and we do not pursue any aspects which do not receive a clean bill of health.  This Bill has been approved by the Attorney General.  With regard to the Senator&rsquo;s question of whether the Department has had any discussions with the Irish Human Rights Commission, we have <Col N="1801"/>referred the Bill to the commission and are awaiting its response.  The Senator also asked the annual number of courts martial.  I understand that approximately 12 are held per year, although that number will increase as a result of the provisions of this Bill on the right to appeal and other matters.</P>
        <P>With regard to the appointment of military judges, section 34 sets out that judges are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister for Defence.  We can debate that section on Committee Stage if anybody is unhappy with any aspect of it.</P>
        <P>Several Senators asked whether it will be possible to appeal judgments of the military justice system to civilian courts.  Every decision of a court martial can be appealed to the Courts Martial Appeal Court, which is a division of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If somebody wishes to go further under ordinary criminal law, he or she can take a case to the Supreme Court on a point of law, and the same procedure will apply in respect of courts martial.</P>
        <P>Several Senators raised the issue of access to free legal aid.  When availing of free legal aid, military defendants can select civilian solicitors and barristers from a panel, in addition to military officers.</P>
        <P>I welcome the comments made by Senator Dardis and Senator Moylan on the reputation enjoyed abroad by members of the Defence Forces.  That reputation is certainly well deserved, as I have seen at first hand and hope to see again when I visit Lebanon shortly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator Cummins asked the potential penalty for rape or other serious sexual assault on conviction by a court martial.  Sections 57 and 58 provide for a term of imprisonment at the discretion of the court martial up to and including life imprisonment.  There is no difference between that and the ordinary criminal law.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Senator Minihan asked whether the State would pay for legal aid and it will.  I answered the question about outside lawyers.  The Senator raised an interesting point about the provision whereby a court martial&rsquo;s appeal court cannot award a higher penalty.  I take his point and we may need to reconsider the wording, as it may not be absolutely clear.  If it is not clear enough we may need to amend it.  The intention of the provision is that if the court of first incidence applied the maximum penalty it could apply, that penalty could not be increased on appeal.  However, the court of first incidence might apply a much lesser penalty, which, of course, could be increased on appeal.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh asked about the reference to the word &ldquo;man&rdquo;.  This comes from the 1954 Act, upon which this legislation is dependent &mdash; both need to be read together.  There is a certain amount of case law regarding that phraseology in <Col N="1802"/>the 1954 Act.  If we were writing the legislation from scratch we would not need to make that reference.  I can assure the Senator that &ldquo;man&rdquo; includes woman for the purposes of this legislation.  The point he made about court martial and modernising the language is worth considering.  One note of caution is that the term &ldquo;court martial&rdquo; is used in the Constitution and we would need to be careful.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney asked about the use of the word &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;ignominy&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Counsel regards &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; as a more modern term than &ldquo;ignominy&rdquo;.  The Senator also asked about the role of the President.  The only mention of the role of the President that I can find in the Bill is that the President appoints the military judge on the recommendation of the Minister for Defence.  In ordinary criminal law there is no appeal to the President.  A person exhausts the appeal system and that is it.  I believe the Government can award a pardon.  There is the system of presidential pardon.  The same presidential pardon rules apply to people convicted by court martial as apply to people convicted in the ordinary criminal courts.</P>

        <P>Senator Dardis asked whether we would be able to commit to the rapid reaction force.  I have just concluded discussions on a memorandum of understanding with the Nordic Battle Group.  We will be making a very significant contribution to that battle group, which will be on standby from 1 January 2008.  Senators Dardis and Maurice Hayes also asked about an Irish soldier who commits a serious offence while abroad in a country where the maximum punishment for an offence might be far greater than the maximum punishment here.  In that case the Irish system has seisin of that.  It is an established convention that they go for the Irish legal system.  If, of course, the person does not want to opt for the Irish legal system, he or she can opt for the Islamic system or whatever applies in the particular country.  I believe they will usually opt for the Irish system.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes also asked whether we had sufficient bodies.  I am assured that we have.  The Senator made the valid point that the Bill contains no whistleblower provision.  I only noticed its absence when the Senator mentioned it.  In this regard it differs from the Garda legislation and we will consider it.  We already have an excellent military ombudsman, Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn.  We should be safe enough if she finds out that the Senator did not know that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this item for debate this evening.  I wish to share the matter with Senator Kitt. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, to the House.  He has a personal interest in this item.  The Minister of State is aware that since Senator Kitt and I first raised this matter here on 18 October 2006, the Minister for Education and Science and the Department have made very little progress in determining what can be done for Kinvara.  The parents and management board, and all concerned in the south Galway community have made a submission to the Department of Education and Science and the Minister asking for the continuation of second level education in Kinvara rather than the closure of a school.  While the Minister and Department did not close the school, the ball is in the Minister&rsquo;s and Government&rsquo;s court to deliver second level education and not to allow the crisis to develop in south Galway that will follow the closure of this long-standing and esteemed school.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Department received a full and comprehensive report about Kinvara which has been well documented.  It is unfair on all involved, parents, staff and students in the Kinvara area to be left in limbo because no decisions have been taken.  The review has, we believe, been undertaken and hopefully is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk.  It now behoves all to make a decision that there will be second level education in Kinvara.  It is a growth area.  How is it that the recent national development plan promises large expenditure on roads, rail services, water and sewage systems and so on yet we are closing a school in South Galway?  The Minister of State, as a representative of that constituency, has an obligation to nail his colours to the mast and say this cannot happen.  The Minister for Health and Children approached the Minister for Education and Science for a school in her constituency and <Col N="1804"/>it was delivered immediately.  That is what we expect from the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>How can a Minister for Education and Science preside over the dissolution of the board of management for a viable working school in Kinvara?  The board was dissolved when it was due for renewal.  I cannot understand how the Minister allows the school to continue to function without a board of management.  It is urgent that she reinstate a board or provides for one to be elected.</P>
        <P>On 7 December 2006 I wrote to the Minister for Education and Science asking her as an interim step to lease the facilities from the Sisters of Mercy at a reasonably attractive rate to ensure continuity of intake in September of this year.  I was a member of a deputation which included the Minister of State and members of the local community, of the staff and board of management, and parents.  I have received only an acknowledgement of the letter but not the reply which was promised although this proposal could be a useful solution.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State knows the people of the area as well as I do.  They want continuity of intake in Kinvara September so that there will be no gap in education provision.  The surrounding schools in Gort and Callasanctius do not have the space to take in the students from Kinvara if the school there closes.  They have applied to the Department over the past three or four years for extensions which have not been granted.  This is one of the biggest growth areas in the country, as the Minister of State is aware.  In Ballindereen, where there is a school catchment area, there is 48% growth which is accelerating.  That is only one figure.  I ask the Minister of State as a representative of the constituency to make the proper representations to the Minister to ensure that an early solution to this problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach has allowed me to raise this issue because it is unique for him to allow two Members from one constituency to raise a common issue.

	<P Just="Left">We held a meeting with the Minister for Education and Science on budget day, 6 December last, with parents, teachers, and public representatives from Galway and Clare because this problem affects north Clare too.  I wish to raise a slightly different point from that raised by Senator Ulick Burke.  We brought what I believe was new information to the Minister that day.  I would like the report to be made available as quickly as possible.  There is a significant increase <Col N="1805"/>in population in this area as census figures for housing development there indicate.  There is no space for these students in the Callasanctius college in Oranmore or in Gort community school.  The Minister for Education and Science and her Department have a responsibility to find places for students if there is no intake for them in Kinvara next September.</P>
        <P>Any information provided to the Department is fact.  There has been no attempt to pillory the Sisters of Mercy or to blame the Minister or the Department for what has happened.  A diplomatic mission is required to try to get the college to agree to take in first year students next September, or to have the college leased or, better still, sold to the Department if that were possible.  This college has a fine track record and has won many awards and its transition year has started.</P>
        <P>I hope education will be very much to the forefront in the national development plan and in the context of any investment that is made.  The part of south Galway to which I refer is badly in need of investment in education, which is clearly evident in primary schools in Kinvara and the surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>A public meeting is to take place in Kinvara on Friday next.  The people that will attend would like answers to the questions we have raised.  I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House and I hope he will be able to provide an update on what is happening in respect of this school.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Kitt and Ulick Burke for raising this matter.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of post-primary education in Kinvara, County Galway.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who is out of the country on official business.</P>
        <P>In October 2006, the trustees of Seamount College, namely, the Sisters of Mercy, announced their intention to withdraw as providers of education in the Kinvara area and to close the college.  Seamount College is a voluntary secondary school and decisions such as this are within the remit of the patron body, the Mercy Sisters.  The trustees informed the Department of Education and Science that closure was to be on a phased basis, with no intake of first year pupils from September 2007, culminating in a full closure in 2012 and thus allowing the junior students to have a transition year, if feasible, and complete their leaving certificates thereafter.  The trustees also confirmed directly to the Department that the current site at Seamount College will not be available for the provision of post-primary education once the college closes after 2012.</P><Col N="1806"/>
        <P>Following the announcement of a phased closure by the trustees, a group of local parents met the Minister and representatives of the Department of Education and Science and outlined their concerns.  Officials of the school planning section of the Department also met separately with representatives of Gort community school who outlined their concerns in relation to the trustees&rsquo; announcement.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s main role in respect of a decision by a patron body to close a school is to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are catered for in the period leading up to the closure and that there will be sufficient places in existing schools in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.</P>
        <P>The examination of the information received is currently under way in the Department of Education and Science.  As part of this examination, an analysis is being carried out on matters such as population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the immediate demand for pupil accommodation.  I assure the House that it is being dealt with as a priority matter by officials in the Department at the direction of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.</P>
        <P>This is a complex matter and it can be resolved only by flexibility on all sides.  In particular, the Mercy order has made a unique contribution to the development of education for over a century, including in the Kinvara region.  I publicly appeal to the order on behalf of the students, teachers and parents in the wider Kinvara area to ensure the necessary space and time is provided to ensure that second level education remains a permanent and integral part of the community there for the century ahead.</P>
        <P>I again sincerely thank Senators Kitt and Burke once again for raising this matter in respect of our constituency.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this motion, the purpose of which is to highlight need for the provision of an update on the status of the application by Scoil Etchen, Kinnegad, County Westmeath, for a proposed building project, which is urgently required to facilitate the demand for places at the school caused by the increased population levels in the Kinnegad area.  Everyone who has moved into the area is welcome to the constituency.</P>
        <P>Kinnegad is a rapidly expanding area, with a population that has more than doubled,  from 652 in 1996 to 1,429 according to the 2002 census &mdash; it is still rising &mdash; as a result of increasing pressure for housing in the area from Dublin commuters.  Housing estates are springing up to accommodate the increasing overspill from Dublin and because those houses are primarily occupied by families, there is a much great demand for school places than was the case ten or even five years ago.</P>
        <P>St. Etchen&rsquo;s is the main provider of primary education in the area and urgently needs to commence a building programme for extra classroom and other facilities.  I understand that two extra prefabs have been approved for the school by the Department but it is essential to the continued expansion of the enrolment at the school that more substantial and long-term accommodation be provided.  The parents and board of management want a substantial and new school building to be provided.</P>
        <P>The building programme for this school has been the subject of questions in both Houses of the Oireachtas since the early architectural stage was initiated in 2002, when more than 200 people were accommodated in prefabs.  It is now 2007 and the school is still awaiting suitable accommodation.  That is not good enough at a time when successive Ministers state the country is awash with money.  There is a great deal of annoyance in this and other areas in my constituency regarding the lack of school facilities for primary and post-primary students.</P>
        <P>The school authorities are anxiously awaiting approval of stage 3 documentation &mdash; detailed drawings, cost plan and reports &mdash; which were submitted to the Department in April 2006 in order to seek planning permission and to bring the project to tender and construction, as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I have been engaged in networking and canvassing in the area in question and every person to whom I spoke referred to the lack of places in the school in question.  I urge the Minister of <Col N="1808"/>State to do whatever is in his power to ensure that the project is delivered on.  Perhaps I might be in a position to deliver good news to the people on Kinnegad as I return home this evening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I admire Senator Bannon&rsquo;s enthusiasm in the context of his already being out knocking on doors.  I have been Member of the Houses for almost 25 years and I have yet to knock at a door before an election was called.  I hope he is not too early.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Science regarding Scoil Etchen, Kinnegad, County Westmeath.  In 2005 the Department of Education and Science announced details of 89 primary schools and 33 post primary schools that were allowed to progress to tender and construction.  St. Etchen&rsquo;s, Kinnegad, was among the primary schools listed in the announcement.</P>
        <P>In February 2005 representatives of the school attended a meeting in Tullamore organised by the building unit of the Department, which outlined the steps that a school should take to advance a building project through tender and construction phases.  In September 2005 the Department received a stage 3 &mdash; developed sketch scheme &mdash; of architectural planning from the school authorities.  The brief for the project is to provide adequate accommodation for a principal and 16 classroom teachers.  This involves the construction of eight additional classrooms and ancillary accommodation, plus upgrading works to the existing school.</P>
        <P>In November 2005 a letter issued from the building unit to the board of management of the school requesting a revised stage 3 submission.  A revised submission was received in March 2006.  At the end of that month, a further letter issued to the board of management requesting detailed information in relation to the mechanical and electrical element of the stage 3 submission.  A response was received from the school in April 2006.</P>
        <P>In July 2006, following a comprehensive examination of the revised stage 3 documentation, the building unit issued a further letter to the board of management requesting additional information in relation to a number of matters.  A response was received in late October 2006 and was examined by the Department.  A meeting was held on Monday, 5 February 2007 between officials of the Department of Education and Science and the school authorities and their design team to try and resolve any remaining difficulties with the stage 3 submission.  As a result of this meeting, further information must be supplied to the Department by the school and its design team on or before Tuesday, 20 March 2007.</P><Col N="1809"/>
        <P>Once the stage 3 submission is approved by the Department, the school will be given devolved authority to seek planning permission, prepare tender documentation and, finally, invite tenders.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator Bannon that the Department of Education and Science is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Scoil Etchen at the earliest possible date.  I again thank him for raising this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Senator is right about 20 May as well, and the day after that also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I have every confidence in the board of management.  We will forward any outstanding recommendations to the Minister of State.  I hope the Department will not be found wanting in delivering this project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to welcome to the House my old St. Brendan&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  He is aware of my interest in these matters.</P>
        <P>I understand a range of different species, including primarily the Kerry spotted slug, whales, bats, otters, the natterjack toad, the pine martin, the red squirrel and others are under threat.  It should be said, however, and I have noted this, that the endangered pine martin thrives in Killarney, as does the natterjack toad, in Dooks and Castlegregory, both on and off the golf courses.  Some people thought they would be threatened by those beautiful courses, which are played on frequently by many visitors, but they have thrived.  I am glad of that.</P>
        <P>The concern is that while many of these species are unique to this country, they are now believed to be under pressure.  The allegation is that they were not properly protected under old legislation and newer laws were not properly implemented, putting them at risk.  That is my understanding.  The European Court of Justice has ruled that Ireland has not been protecting its wildlife and habitats and, accordingly, I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I further understand the ruling was comprehensive in nature and I look forward to the Minister spelling out the consequences.  I confess I have not seen the judgment but I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view on it.</P>
        <P>What, if any, monitoring system is in place regarding the various species alleged to be at risk and their breeding grounds?  I understand there are some action plans in place covering the Irish hare and some other species.  I look forward to hearing what further plans, if any, the Minister has in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Coghlan for raising what is an important matter to those of us in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>As a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, Ireland published a national biodiversity plan in 2002 containing 91 actions aimed at securing the conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of biodiversity in Ireland.  A key concept of the plan is that we all share responsibility for biodiversity, that it crosses into a number of Departments and that it needs cross-Border co-operation.  I am happy to tell the House that an interim review of its implementation was carried out in 2005 and demonstrated that excellent progress had been made.</P>
        <P>In January this year, my Department launched a public awareness campaign on biodiversity, entitled Notice Nature, to raise awareness of biodiversity issues among the general public and within the agriculture, tourism and construction sectors.  It will promote action for the conservation of biodiversity.  The campaign is also accompanied by a dedicated website, <i>www.noticenature.ie</i>, which gives information on biodiversity, the legislation, the policy governing biodiversity and, more importantly, the actions individuals and organisations can take that can assist in conserving biodiversity.</P>
        <P>The national biodiversity plan specifically recognised the need for action to protect species of particular conservation concern.  Four all-Ireland species action plans were published jointly with the Northern Ireland authorities in November 2005.  Three more all-Ireland draft species action plans are in the process of interdepartmental consultation and these will be published during the course of 2007.  Further plans are being prepared to cover other species such as the Kerry slug.  It is intended that these also will be published in 2007.</P>
        <P>The Irish hare action plan, for instance, identified the need for baseline data on the hare.  The Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service is in the second year of a national survey with the final report due in July 2007.  This will include a full assessment of the conservation status of both the Irish hare and the brown hare in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My Department has also established a national bat monitoring programme, if Senators will forgive the pun.  Five of the bat species found in Ireland are now covered under this annual programme.  Additional surveys planned for 2007 will bring in the remaining species.</P>
        <P>This work, along with additional proposals regarding marine species, will ensure Ireland meets the concerns raised in the ruling of the <Col N="1811"/>European Court in January of this year.  My Department is committed to this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State confirm his first course of action will include the lesser horseshoe bat, which is so prevalent in my part of the country?  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response and look forward to the surveys in 2007.  Does the website the Minister mentioned contain the full judgment of the European Court and, if not, where would one obtain that?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1812"/>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding, which I will confirm for the Senator, is that it contains the main rulings of the European Court.  If there is any deficiency in terms of the information the Senator requires, my Department will be only too happy to supply it to him.</P>
