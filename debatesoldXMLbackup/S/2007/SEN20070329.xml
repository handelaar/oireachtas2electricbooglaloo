	<P>I have received notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make provision to support Drumnigh Montessori primary school, Donaghmede, Dublin 13.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator White of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the rationale behind the omission of systemic lupus erythematosus and other forms of lupus from the long-term illness scheme, given that this illness shares the major characteristics of the other illnesses on the long-term illness scheme, namely, that it is both long-term and debilitating.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to encourage and support the joint efforts of the trustees of Muckross House and the National Parks and Wildlife Service in carrying out a comprehensive botanical survey of Innisfallen Island with a view to obtaining the fullest information on the ancient monastic settlement and the lives of the monks, particularly in regard to their cultivation of the island gardens thereon detailing the plants, shrubs and herbs with medicinal properties.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will time be provided next week for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House to make a statement and take questions on the controversy surrounding legal letters sent to victims of sex abuse who came through the national school system over many years?  The Acting Leader will be aware of a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on this subject last week.  It is worrying that needless anxiety is being caused to hundreds of sex abuse victims who seem to be put to one side simply because they attended national school.</P>
        <P>I am the first to admit that the rainbow Government made mistakes in the McCole case, but at least a compensation mechanism was put in place for victims in that situation.  The Government should realise that public administration and politicians often make mistakes but we need to learn the lessons of that mistake.  The manner in which the Department is dealing with this matter is suspect.</P>
        <P>An opportunity should be afforded to the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House because the Seanad has a role to ensure the Government can rethink its position and not repeat past mistakes.  Colleagues on both sides of the House have raised this matter over the past week.  I request that debate to ensure we do not make the same mistakes again concerning people who have been traumatised by the most grotesque sexual abuse, including rape allegations.  Just because they went through the national school system, they seem to have been put to one side, and that is unacceptable.  Can time be provided next week for that debate?</P>
        <P>There is much in the Criminal Justice Bill which I and my party colleagues would support, but we need to have a significant period of reflection between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  I am not sure whether the Bill is coming to the House next week, but if it is, will the Acting Leader give a guarantee that Committee Stage will not be taken until after the Easter recess?  This would give us more time to consider the legislation which deals with basic issues such as the criminal justice system and fundamental rights.  We need to get it right and ensure the balance is firmly in place in the legislation as it goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on that issue.  Some 150 families are now under threat from the Department of Education and Science.  They have been told by the State Claims Agency that every single case will be fought.  They have also been told their houses could be at risk if they lose the case because the State will force them to pay their legal expenses.  I have no <Col N="1732"/>doubt that colleagues on the Government side of the House will feel exactly the same as we do on that issue.  I think the Government&rsquo;s legal advisers have lost the run of themselves.</P>
        <P>The State Claims Agency is run by the National Treasury Management Agency which is in the business of saving and making money.  Going back to where we were long ago, they will frighten, charge, punish and pursue people for the sake of an extra shilling.  In all these cases, no one is trying to take the State for anything.  They all concern people who seek some form of redress having suffered appalling physical or sexual abuse, or people who seek some form of special education for their children.</P>
        <P>We may agree or disagree with some of the issues, but these matters must be raised with the Minister for Education and Science and the Taoiseach.  This is not the way to do it and it does not reflect any Minister&rsquo;s view.  It would not reflect the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin&rsquo;s, view.  It is no longer acceptable, however, for Ministers to say this is the legal advice and this is what they are doing.  It is not acceptable and the matter must be discussed in this Chamber.  The Minister should attend the House for such a debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister should also take the opportunity to spell out what the Taoiseach meant last Saturday when, in a most welcome development, he indicated that thousands of extra teachers would be made available to improve class sizes.  I have raised previously the question of primary school class sizes, but the same applies to post-primary schools where thousands of pupils attend classes of more than 30.  The Taoiseach said he looked forward to improving class sizes, especially for English, mathematics and Gaeilge.  The Minister for Education and Science should explain to us what she intends to do in this respect.  There is a great deal of aggravation about class sizes.  If the Government has a solution in hand, let us hear it and reduce the pressure by implementing it.</P>
        <P>We had arranged a number of extra seats on the cross-benches today in expectation that some Government Members might cross the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No show yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a no show, however.  Perhaps the Government Whip will indicate whether we should make arrangements for additional Members on the cross-benches.</P>

	<P>I have called Senator Brendan Ryan on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The behaviour of the legal people, operating on behalf of the Minister for Education for Education and Science, towards victims of what can at best be called State neglect &mdash; people who were sexually abused in primary schools &mdash; is nothing short of disgraceful.  The Members opposite were probably among the most vocal in the country when a previous Minister for Health was blamed for similar letters.  I would like to hear them rediscovering their voices now.  When they do so, they might ask the Minister why she stated that she has no legal responsibility towards these people when we know the Government had no legal responsibility towards the religious whom it bailed out to the tune of &euro;1 billion when they were being sued.  Maybe that was the correct decision, although I do not want to go down that road.  It is clear, however, that the State had no legal obligation to do it.  Are we to take it from the Government that the religious orders are more important than sexually abused children in primary schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be an appalling statement of priorities for our society and the country at large.  I would like to hear something about that matter from the Members opposite.</P>
        <P>Although the media did not make a big fuss of it, the Arab world yesterday offered Israel a deal.  If it returns to its pre-1967 borders, the Arab world will give Israel full recognition.  A statement in this regard was issued from Saudi Arabia yesterday on behalf of the Arab world.  I want to hear an immediate and generous response to this from our Government and from the European Union because there will be no immediate and generous response from Israel if nobody stands up to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Acting Leader to arrange a debate on mental health services, although I know time is short.  I am concerned at utterances made by Dr. Finnerty, the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  I have been involved in this issue for many years and have always advocated the devolution of the service from the hospital to the community.  The community can provide a better <Col N="1734"/>service for staff and patients, but it is more expensive.</P>
        <P>I read an article on this subject in one of the national newspapers this morning and one thing that came to mind was that we recognise that additional resource have been devolved, rightly, to this area.  I cannot help noticing, however, that many of the issues reported by the inspector are operational matters.  The painting of a building is not a matter to concern the Minister or any Member of either House.  It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the people it employs.  I do not propose to have this debate now but I ask the Acting Leader to organise a debate on this matter, if possible, in the short time we have left as I have many points to make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have often raised the issue of electricity costs and the lack of activity when the market was liberalised some years ago.  I pointed out that domestic consumers have no option but to pay the enhanced rate while commercial users may enjoy a degree of competition.  I welcome the decision to separate the grid from the main service provider in this country to stimulate competition.  People realise and the Government recognises that if we do not do this the European Commission will insist we do it to liberalise the electricity market.</P>
        <P>I believe the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, workers and unions are going in the wrong direction if they are threatening to stop this happening.  High energy users met our committee and told us bluntly that escalating energy costs in the country will deter employers and threaten jobs unless a degree of competition is introduced.  I think making such threats before the general election is the wrong road for the unions to take.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I think a debate on the issue of local radio would be timely.  When I was spokesman for Fianna F&aacute;il, I brought a Bill through the House relating to the establishment of local radio stations.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The media group East Midlands Allied Press, EMAP, is selling the local radio stations Today FM, FM 104 and Highland Radio.  The local radio station, Shannonside &amp; Northern Sound, was sold to a Kerry group in which my colleague, Senator Coghlan, has an interest.  My point is that the State gave these licences that are being sold as commodities from which people are making fortunes.  Local radio should be local, not a national radio service, and I will not get much coverage on local radio for saying that.  I hope the Acting Leader can arrange a debate on the future of local radio stations before the election because they are no longer local; they are multinational commodities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that we discuss fishing either in this session or in the session after Easter because I see that the European Union is introducing a ban on the dumping of fish.  Between 30% and 90% of the catch off the west coasts of Ireland and Scotland is dumped and this an appalling waste of resources, especially as our fish stocks are threatened.</P>
        <P>Despite the fact that I was knocked off the electoral register for a while in North Great George&rsquo;s Street, I was polled.  I have now received a letter from Bertie.  I can call him Bertie because he signs his name so and he calls me David.  He tells me that owing to the level of security in my flat complex, it is not always possible for him to meet me so he invites me to meet him at his clinic in Drumcondra.  Could the Cathaoirleach tell him that I am too busy in this House and will have to await his visit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think that is relevant to the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s pardon and I am sure he will find the next item entirely relevant.  Although we are graced by the presence of the Acting Leader, Senator Dardis, today, it is a pity the Leader cannot be with us because she is a woman of international celebrity, as we learn from the property pages of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support the calls made by Senator Brian Hayes and Senator O&rsquo;Toole seeking the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to attend the House.  I was disturbed when I saw the programme on letters sent to victims of sexual abuse regarding their legal situation.  I do not doubt the Minister is working on this matter and will come to the House during the next week, if she can find time, to discuss the issue fully.  I was unhappy with the manner in which the letters were sent out, according to the programme, and we must get a clear picture on what is happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of Senator Brian Hayes on the Criminal Justice Bill.  After all, 140 eminent barristers made their views known to the Minister yesterday.  I do not suggest that these barristers are automatically right, but we should give credence to the their views and we must, as Senator Brian Hayes suggested, weigh things up properly to ensure the correct balance is struck.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have learned that long-term credit card debt has reached a new high and half of consumers do not know the interest rates they are being charged.  The Financial Regulator published proposals two years ago aimed at prohibiting credit card providers from increasing credit limits unless requested to do so by the customer.  This measure has not been introduced and is crying out for redress, so I call on the Acting Leader to take up this matter with the appropriate Minister.  An essential measure in the consumer protection code is the banning of such actions unless requested specifically by the customer.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to calls for a debate on the letters sent to victims of abuse.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement at my party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis on the appointment of an additional 4,000 teachers.  Given that the Green Party has indicated to INTO that it is committed to recruiting an extra 2,400 teachers, I am sure Senators from all parties and the Independent Members will support proposals for more teachers.</P>
        <P>Having attended many meetings on class size, I find it difficult to understand the reason <Col N="1737"/>teachers are still being appointed on the basis of enrolment figures for the previous September.  This is a frustrating practice for schools, some of which will have lost a teacher because the number of enrolments declined by one pupil over the previous two years but increased above the threshold in the current year.  This issue should be debated in future partnership talks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Taoiseach to come before the House to debate whether democracy is an overrated concept?

	<P>I regret the Government decision not to reduce the fees for lawyers involved in the tribunals, which will continue to be paid at a rate of &euro;2,250 per day for senior counsel and &euro;1,500 for junior counsel.  While I fully understand that the issue would probably have become a major political football in the lead-up to an election, I call for a debate to be scheduled to discuss it.  The scandalous rates paid to lawyers must be tackled by an incoming Government.  Senators have raised the issue of rape but allowing these fees to continue is professional rape of taxpayers.  They should be halted as a matter of urgency. </P>
        <P>The more serious issue arising from the letters sent by school authorities to people who have been abused is the low rates of reporting and prosecution of those who have abused children.  Obviously, people other than teachers are involved and many of them continue in their functions.  The House should hone in on this issue.  While it may be difficult to legislate in a manner that ensures innocent people are not unjustifiably prosecuted, none the less it is a miscarriage of justice that so few cases &mdash; the figure is in single figures in percentage terms &mdash; are successfully prosecuted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>This week, on the Order of Business and during the debate and on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007, Senators raised the issue of children who go hungry.  I ask the Deputy Leader to request that the Minister for Education and Science come before the House to allow me an opportunity to highlight a policy adopted by one school on lunches and the breakfast club, which is unacceptable and not in the best interests of children.  Breakfast clubs are for children who, for whatever reason, come to school without <Col N="1738"/>breakfast.  The meal should be provided before lessons start but in the school in question, which is in a designated disadvantaged area, breakfast is served at 10.30 a.m.  The children have been told they may no longer bring packed lunches to school and those who, until recently, brought packed lunches were required to eat them at 10.30 a.m.  This means the children have breakfast at 10.30 a.m. and have nothing else to eat until they go home.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The school, which is located in a disadvantaged area not far from the House, is engaging in unacceptable sharp practice.  It is a matter of teachers not being willing to give up some of their lunch time to supervise the children while they eat lunch.  The children are not allowed to eat in the playground during lunchtime and will go hungry as a result of this policy, which will have a cost to the State.  Other schools may have similar policies in place.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Science address the issue. </P>

	<P>The list did not feature any teachers either. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not one of those who believes that when a body is established, the Minister in charge of the relevant area automatically loses responsibility.  If one reads legislation such as the Health Bill 2006, which will come before the House today, or the Pharmacy Bill 2007, which came before the House last week, one finds that when a Minister appoints people to a new body he or she retains a significant amount of control over the relevant functions.  To give them their due, many Ministers believe they should retain certain powers. </P>
        <P>I return to an issue I and many other Senators raised last week, namely, water pollution in the Galway and south Mayo area.  The Deputy <Col N="1739"/>Leader realises the gravity of the situation, which has worsened since it was acknowledged that the form of cryptosporidium involved can be spread not only by water but also from person to person where hygiene is poor.  Given that the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have not said anything useful on the issue, I ask that the Minister for Health and Children come before the House to discuss the deteriorating problem.  I do not believe she would shirk from a debate.  It is possible the problem will continue for at least six months.  I would like to know how the Minister proposes to address this difficult issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn raised the issue of mental health services.  When I first entered the House almost 15 years ago, I requested a debate on the report of the then Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  These reports had not been discussed previously.  As I prepare to leave the House, I find that the report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, while not as bad as previously, indicates that the necessary improvements have not been made.  The House should discuss the most recent report with the Minister for Health and Children, either before Easter or during the short period in which it will sit after the Easter recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Overnight developments regarding the capture of British sailors allegedly found in Iranian waters are a cause of great concern.  Will the Deputy Leader convey the concern of the House to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has made a public statement on the matter?  International opinion is becoming increasingly critical of the unilateral action of the Iranian Government.  Evidence conveyed by the British Government in the past 24 hours suggests the sailors were not operating in Iranian waters but in Iraqi waters.</P>
        <P>I am concerned not only about the specific incident but also the fundamental human rights dimension.  According to available evidence, the sailors were operating under a United Nations mandate and were not in Iranian waters.  It is particularly disturbing that the Iranian authorities have produced images of a female English sailor wearing a Muslim veil in what appears to have been a choreographed television performance.  This resonates with similar images we saw when Saddam Hussein shook hands with a young boy when a group of people were taken hostage during his regime and the horrific images portrayed throughout the world of unfortunate hostages who have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a concern that Ireland should be seen to be as critical as the international community has proven to be.  In that <Col N="1740"/>context, I ask the Acting Leader if he will convey our concerns to the Iranian authorities, with whom we have very strong trade links, as we have a unique opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Acting Leader&rsquo;s experience of agriculture, will he press the Minister for Agriculture and Food to put pressure on Greencore to drop its case against the beet growers?  I note the company has resolved its difficulties with the former workers, in particular in Mallow, which is welcome.  It is time to take this matter a step further.  The beet growers are due to receive compensation in June this year but, through no fault of their own, will not receive any because of the pending court case.  The Acting Leader knows far more about this area than I, so I ask him to use his experience to put pressure on the Government in this area.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio.  I could never understand why a school which had a walking principal who did not teach was considered as part of the equation, given that it distorts the figures.  We need to get real.  I agree with the Senator who stated that to base class numbers on the figures for the previous September is nonsense.  We need to examine the pupil-teacher ratio and not include walking principals as their inclusion distorts the figures.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the Department of Education and Science sending letters.  Will the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to update us on the progress in the case of those taking actions against the State who could not get a public bed in a nursing home?  I understand there has been some movement on this issue and that the State has settled one case with a person who, through no fault of that person, ended up in a private nursing home.  If so, this has huge implications in terms of cost for the State.  Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children could come to the House before it rises to indicate whether this is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate the report of the independent watchdog on the mental health sector, which does not make for good reading?  The report stated that despite Government pledges to improve community-based treatment, the inspectors found that in most parts of the country there was a lack of staff, poor management and resource shortages.  Also, the necessary staff were in place to provide multidisciplinary procedures in just two of the 32 catchment areas.</P>
        <P>In my area, there was a resistance by HSE management to provide funding for a mental health centre, which would have provided value for money.  The HSE has much to answer for.  It seems to treat mental health as the poor relation of the health services.  Senator Henry has on many occasions in this House highlighted that the <Col N="1741"/>mental health sector has not got the resources it needed.  We need to examine this area more carefully.</P>
        <P>The report stated there is no coherent plan for the next five years.  The <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the provision of mental health services by the Government, and successive Governments in the past 25 years, needs to be addressed.  If one measure is needed, it is the introduction of a five-year plan to address the serious deficiencies in mental health services.</P>

	<P>Senator Dardis will not get around me that easily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Senator Brian Hayes, together with Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan, Ormonde, Kitt, Jim Walsh and Browne, raised matters relating to the Department of Education and Science.  The Senators referred to the correspondence to the families of the victims of abuse and the matter of class sizes, and called for a debate on these issues.  I am sure both issues could be encompassed within a debate.  I will attempt to get the Minister to come to the House.</P>
        <P>As I said last week, it is important that we would have clarity on the issue with regard to the victims.  The person who can provide that clarity is the Minister.  I agree that legal advice, which I am sure is given in good faith, can sometimes lead people to make decisions which, on a humanitarian basis, they possibly should not make.</P>
        <P>I do not believe there is any question of property being put at risk.  All of us who were members of local authorities can recall times when we were told our property would be put at risk if the local authorities were sued.  To my knowledge, it never happened.  It is obviously a very serious matter and one that deserves to be clarified.  I am sure the Minister is anxious to clarify it.  If we can find time for her to come to the House, we will arrange it.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, I reject the proposition that religious orders are somehow more important than children.  That is not the case.  Children are of course more important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why will we not compensate the children when we are compensating the religious orders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of one&rsquo;s political perspective, there is no debate about that.  The matter of the pupil-teacher ratio, as raised by Senator Browne, for example, can be dealt with within the scope of that debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Brian Hayes and Coghlan raised the matter of arrangements for the Criminal Justice Bill.  As I understand it, the Bill will not come to the Seanad until after Easter.  It will stay in the D&aacute;il until we rise and will be taken during the <Col N="1742"/>week we resume after Easter.  It is important &mdash; I am sure the Minister will agree &mdash; that there would be adequate time between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The Minister is on record as stating he is amenable to amendments in the Seanad and that he will bring back the Bill to the D&aacute;il, so obviously it will not be rammed through, if I can use that phrase.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>As to the opinion of 140 lawyers, they are a tiny fraction of the Law Library and the solicitor&rsquo;s apprentices.  I noted the spokesperson for Fine Gael was also of the view this morning that the Bill should not be withdrawn and should proceed.  If the lawyers want to legislate, let them stand for Parliament and come here to legislate.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan referred to Israel and the Arab commitment that if the 1967 borders were respected they would recognise the State of Israel, which is a move forward.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Senators Glynn, Henry and Feighan referred to mental health services.  Over a long period, Senator Henry has repeatedly called for the report of the inspector of mental hospitals to be dealt with and the Senators also referred to the report mentioned in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers.  These matters warrant debate in the House and within the time constraints, we will endeavour to arrange a debate.</P>
        <P>I note the director of mental services of the HSE stated an additional &euro;25 million is available this year for mental health services, an extra 250 staff will be employed within the service and there is an ambitious capital programme, which relates to Senator Feighan&rsquo;s call for a five-year plan, which is a reasonable suggestion.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane referred to electricity costs.  I agree with his point on the use of the grid and the separation of the service provider from it.  The commission will move us in that direction, even if we were not mindful to do it ourselves, which we are.  Obviously, the regulator has a role with regard to the electricity costs, which is an improvement compared to the system that operated previously.</P>
        <P>I noted Senator Leyden&rsquo;s contribution on local radio.  He has a point.  Consolidation is also obvious within the print media at local level.  I <Col N="1743"/>note that under one of the motions before us today, which will be taken without debate, we are referring some of these aspects to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  Perhaps that is the forum where some of these issues could be pursued in greater detail.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the matter of fishing.  It is extraordinary that we operate a fishing policy that compels boats to put back undersize fish that will not survive.  From a practical perspective, I do not understand this.  Iceland has a system of fallowing  whereby one does not fish in certain areas until the fish reach a certain size, which is preferable.  That is something the European Union could examine.  I agree it should be debated, but because of the constraints of time it will be difficult to arrange that.  I noted what he had to say about the queen of the Shannon and I will relay his remarks.  I am glad he is in correspondence with the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the important issue of credit cards, which were discussed on the radio this morning.  The interest rates are very high, well over 20%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They can be as high as 24%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>American Express appears to be the most expensive for those in debt.  Some 45% of people do not clear their debt each month.  The Senator also pointed out that many of them are not even aware of the rate they are paying.  There is a need for greater regulation and clarity.  There was mention of a website this morning, but I cannot remember the address.  It would be worth finding out and logging into it.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy suggested we debate whether democracy is an overrated concept.  I think not, but perhaps the Taoiseach might take a different view on the matter.  If he comes to the House, he can clarify the matter for the Senator.  Senator Walsh is right about the disquiet with regard to the feast of tribunals.  I am not sure of the reason we must continue paying the exorbitant rates being applied other than the possibility that the tribunals might not continue.  That, of course, was not represented as the threat of a strike.  Lawyers would not do that sort of thing or threaten to withdraw their labour.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry raised a matter related to but separate from education, namely, children going hungry.  I cannot comment on the individual case because I do not know about it.  It seems to me a matter for the school authorities.  It is regrettable if the school acts as the Senator suggested it is doing.  The broader question on the arrangements made in schools in general warrants further debate.  I am sure the Minister would be cognisant of that and may discuss the issue if she comes to speak in the House.</P>
        <P>I noted what Senator Mansergh had to say about the three county councils.  In view of the low level of income in Leitrim, Longford and <Col N="1744"/>south Tipperary, the people do not have taxable incomes and they are all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes they do, south Tipperary is quite a prosperous place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all fairly compliant.  I thought it was a well-known and universally accepted fact that farmers do not have a taxable income and, therefore, cannot pay income tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>South Tipperary has a lot more than farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On the basis of what Senator Bannon has been saying over the past few years, one would suspect that none of them anywhere has a taxable income.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry raised the serious issue of water quality in Galway.  It seems the only way to overcome the problem is to take a unified approach involving the local authority and the national agencies.  I have been fishing on the Corrib for 40 years and until quite recently one could take a cup of water from it and drink it in the knowledge that it was safe.  It is extraordinary that local authorities regard many of our waterways as both a source of water and a place to put waste.  The two are incompatible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is glib and superficial to blame the farming community exclusively for this.  The issue is broader and has to do with waste management in catchment areas.  It is also extraordinary that the authorities cannot establish the source of the contamination.  With science at the level it is at, it should be possible to establish the source.  I hope the solutions suggested this morning will be implemented speedily and not bogged down in bureaucracy.  The issue is far too important for that.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of the sailors in Iranian waters.  I agree we should bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Senator Browne raised the matter of the case between Greencore and the beetgrowers.  He has a point and the Minister should be made aware of the issue and encouraged to do what she can to help resolve it.  Senator Bannon also raised the issue of public beds in nursing homes.  Perhaps he will get the opportunity today on Final Stage of the Health Bill 2006 to raise his points with the Minister.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 16, to delete lines 17 to 24.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have said enough on this issue on other occasions.  It is outrageous that Oireachtas Members are lumped in with convicted persons and bankrupt people, etc.  There is no need to include this exclusion in the Bill.  If any other group of people was excluded, people would be outraged and rightly so.  I do not suggest Oireachtas Members should be on the boards, but that every case should be judged individually.  Although Senator O&rsquo;Toole is on the Personal Injuries Advisory Board, that will not get him elected in the next Seanad election.  It is great to see people with his experience coming into the House.  The Acting Chairman too has a wealth of experience in the medical world to bring to bear in debates on health issues.</P><Col N="1746"/>
        <P>The exclusion is unnecessary, breaches equality legislation and is discriminatory.  I would like to see it being challenged in court.  An Oireachtas Member can stand for re-election and if he or she fails to be elected, he or she can qualify to sit on these boards.  However, an elected Member with a mandate from the people cannot.  This seems to fly in the face of democracy.  We are doing our best to encourage people to become involved in politics, which is not easy, but this provision is another disincentive to that involvement.  It should be deleted from the section and from section 85.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I agree with Senator Browne that the exclusion of Oireachtas Members from the board is an attack on democracy.  This has become commonplace as evidenced in other Bills over recent years.  I disagree with the practice creeping in whereby Members are debarred from becoming members of these boards.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>My view on this matter is well known.  Perhaps in his response on these two amendments, the Minister of State will outline the reason elected Members are precluded from membership of the board.  If we pursue the objective of electing the best qualified person to a board, the fact the person is a Member of the Oireachtas or a local authority is not reason enough to preclude him or her.  I would like to hear the reason for the preclusion.</P>
        <P>I would like a full review of the issue of representation on boards in general by elected Members.   It is unfair but it is in the Bill.  It has been in other Bills under other regimes.  The issue needs to be brought centre stage and examined by a committee or commission because I am not happy about it.  Three months from now I will have been a public representative for 28 years.  I and most, if not all, in these Houses and in local authorities have never been convicted of any offence.  People who fall foul of the law are the exceptions.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to this amendment.  I would like an inquiry to examine on what bodies it is appropriate for Members of these Houses and local authorities to sit.  Some people seem to think it is not appropriate for us to serve on certain bodies and I want to know why.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This may not be a question for this Minister of State but he might pass it to the Government and return with an explanation.  Why is the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, exempted from this prohibition?  That legislation was passed by this Government and is one of its positive achievements to try to reduce the large cost of litigation and the large amount of unnecessary litigation for personal injuries.  A Member of the Oireachtas is vice chairman of that board.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is a most competent able individual and an appropriate choice.  Somebody decided that appointment was all right but that it is not all right to appoint public representatives to other bodies.</P><Col N="1747"/>
        <P>This emanates from sections of the political sphere who view politicians as an interference with what they regard as efficient governance because we have a habit of asking awkward questions, which are usually more than justified, and of believing that business should be conducted in an open and transparent fashion.  We are all well able to take responsibility for the consequences of our actions because we act in public.  If there are manifest issues of conflict of interest, let them be stated.  Otherwise let us get rid of blanket prohibitions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Browne for tabling this amendment and giving us an opportunity to discuss this issue.  Since Committee Stage of the Bill, my colleagues and I raised this matter at the meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party on Tuesday.  I spoke about it to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power.  It has been passed by the D&aacute;il but this debate can bring to the attention of the Government the deep concerns of Members of this House about the exclusion of members of the local authorities from membership of boards and committees.</P>
        <P>It was purposely stated that Members of the Oireachtas or possibly of the European Parliament could become members of the PIAB which is an important board.  It is time to review the rights of members of local authorities to be appointed to boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The same is true for Members of these Houses. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it should apply to all elected representatives.  I was a member of the former western health board and when a home in my county came under serious pressure to be closed.  I resisted that to the best of my ability but I was in a difficult situation as a member of the board whose executive was introducing enforcement orders against this well-run home.  The building was not great but the home was good.  At times it may be invidious for a member of a local authority or of the Oireachtas to be a member of the Health Information Quality Authority when a compromise arises, for example, a repeat of the Leas Cross case.</P>
        <P>The Parliamentary Counsel appears to have inserted these provisions irregularly.  I feel so strongly about this that if it goes to a vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I accept that this is the most important part of the Bill but we must be pragmatic about the provision and bear in mind the rationale behind it.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to Members of this House.  Would a barrister, teacher or member of any <Col N="1748"/>other profession be excluded?  The only other exclusion applies to somebody in prison.  I regret that local authority members are excluded from this authority.  This is the difficulty of coalition Government, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach may find out if he is in one soon.</P>

	<P>I spoke on Committee Stage about the fact that a member of a local authority cannot be on the authority.  People talk about the politicisation of these boards but there is political control over them already.  When they are set up, the Minister does not let them go on as they wish.  She can remove all the board members from office if she thinks they are not performing their functions in an effective manner.  There is already political accountability within the system and the Minister can appoint an independent person to conduct a review of any matter that is causing concern.  Given that political control, I do not see why members of local authorities are not allowed to be on this board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by my fellow-spokesperson on health and children, Senator Glynn, for the setting up of a committee of inquiry.  He and I met the Minister for Health and Children the night before last when she was as accommodating as possible on the issue.  She suggested she would consider setting up a group, including her officials, to examine it.</P>
        <P>All Senators feel very strongly that local authority members should not be excluded from bodies established statutorily by the Oireachtas.  Senators have all stated this in various debates, be they on transport, justice or health.  I do not recognise the merit in excluding local authority members from boards in legislation.</P>
        <P>I spoke at a parliamentary party meeting some nights ago about the good education I got as a lay member of the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais, and the value I derived therefrom.  I have said in the House that my feelings on Oireachtas Members sitting on such boards are different from those on local authority members doing so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel from experience that I was put in positions that involved a conflict of interest.  I would like to hear further debate on this before we apply a measure across the board. <Col N="1749"/> I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s call for a group to be established to examine the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power.  I agree with Senator Browne that the lines in question should be deleted.  It is nonsense to include subsections (3)(<i>a</i>), (3)(<i>b</i>) and (3)(<i>c</i>) in the Bill and I do not know what they are about.  It is inferred that a board member would not be ethical and that there would be a conflict of interest.  I was appointed to the board of the Higher Education Authority by former Taoiseach Charles Haughey, to the board of the National Museum of Ireland by the Taoiseach and to the boards of Bord Bia and the National College of Art and Design by former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds.  Owing to my experience in business, I was appointed a second time to the board of An Bord Bia.  When I became a Senator I had to resign and was amazed.  I had to withdraw after having offered four years of service in spite of my having had considerable experience of small and medium-sized business in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is an inference that Oireachtas Members and local authority members do not know how to behave themselves.  Why is the provision included in the legislation at all?  Is it because certain individuals feel they are holier than thou, better than everybody else, squeaky clean and do not want those who are not squeaky clean?  I do not understand it.</P>
        <P>If a potential conflict of interest arises in any part of life, the culture and format ordain that one should resign.  If Senator Feeney felt there could have been a conflict of interest regarding some of the positions to which she was so honoured to have been appointed, she could have withdrawn from the discussions in question.  We are either behind the concept of withdrawal or we are not.  One should be entitled to be a member of a board if one is an Oireachtas Member or local authority member.</P>
        <P>Local authority members have been excluded from the HSE.  I pushed in all the discussions for their having a very responsible role in the fora but this did not come to anything.  The legislation is outdated and archaic and infers elected representatives would not be able to handle themselves, would become involved in conflicts of interest and do something immoral.  I do not understand it.  We need individuals with experience who are close to the communities and constituents.  The Members of the Oireachtas and local authority members have their fingers on the pulse of what is happening in this country and that is why they should be on boards.</P>
        <P>I would love to hear why Senator Feeney feels I had to resign from a board when I became a Senator.  I started a business out of nothing with Connie Doody, I was the first small business person to be appointed to the board of Bord Bia and was able to change its direction during my time as a member.  There is no question about this because many of the marketing grants were being given to companies that would spend money on marketing in any case.  I kept tackling this until I achieved redress.  Certain companies of a certain <Col N="1750"/>size did not need the money to market themselves.</P>
        <P>All of us in this Chamber, if we are good politicians, have our fingers on the pulse of society.  A motion that local authority members should be allowed to participate on boards has been passed at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party that involved Ministers.  I do not understand the provision in the legislation and have difficulty with it.  Is there something wrong with me that I would not be able to handle a conflict of interest?  I resent the implication.  I am passionate on this issue as I was forced to resign from the board of Bord Bia.  I was taken aback when I had to do so after having put myself under severe pressure to serve as a board member.  As a board member, I had to take time out from my business to attend meetings and study all the board papers.  Those appointed to a board are not given glamorous positions.  As Senator Feeney knows, much homework must be done.</P>
        <P>I do not know what the situation will be when we are voting on this legislation.  We should have a free vote.  Roll on the day when it will be possible to have one.  If I am re-elected to the Seanad I will advocate immediately that the ballot paper not be presented alphabetically from A to Z.  There should be a draw at every election.  The system is so undemocratic as most people read from the first candidate to the last and do not understand proportional representation.  I did a degree in economics and politics and it took me a long time to understand it myself.  The public has never been educated on the proportional representation system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The categories of persons who cannot be appointed are listed and it is stated that no Oireachtas Members or local authority members can be appointed.  I, as an Oireachtas Member, would have difficulty being appointed to a board because I would not have sufficient time to devote to it.

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is listening to this debate.  The way it is going, I do not believe the legislation will be passed.  I thank my colleague, Senator Browne, for tabling this amendment.  I tabled a similar amendment to a Bill last year.  I have long advocated this type of section should not be included in legislation.  Why should any person be precluded from being on a board because he or she is a Members of the Oireachtas or a local authority member?  Whether one likes it or not, such people come from all sections of society and they would bring great experience to any board.  I fail to understand why the section before us should be allowed to exclude people from membership of a board.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Browne on tabling this amendment.  The Minister should revisit the Bill and delete this section that precludes local authority members, Members of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament from being members of these boards, as they would bring a vast amount of experience from all sections of society to any board.  To preclude them would make bad law.  It is up to the Minister to do this.  There is no obligation to select them.  I support Senator Browne on this issue.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue and I appreciate the time constraints.  I am not sure the following has been put on record but it is important it should be.  I think I am correct in saying the opposition to this section is Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  However, we are members of Government and it is an extremely difficult position for those of us who are members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad group.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not say policy, but a decision was taken at a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting on foot of a motion from the members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad group, not specifically <Col N="1753"/>on this section or this Bill but about the overall attitude that has been adopted over a period where an <i>ad hoc</i> approach has been taken by individual Ministers.  This applies to all Governments.  I have been in this House long enough to have served on the other side of the House as well as on this side.  I have gone through this argument, not once or twice but several times.  It became apparent from the debate we had at our parliamentary party meeting that this was an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and was not a policy-based decision that was taken by a Cabinet on the basis of collective responsibility.</P>

	<P>I wish to put this on record.  I also wish to put on record the genuine opposition of those of us on this side of the House towards the general approach that is taken whenever local authority members are involved.  This section again debars local authority members from being considered for membership of the boards.  This is not about councillors being appointed; it is about stopping them from being considered for appointment.  That is unacceptable because it introduces political apartheid.  It goes further, in that it puts in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If one is nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, one will have to cease membership of the board.  Senator Feeney was a member of the <Col N="1754"/>Medical Council while serving as a member of this House.  If this provision were in place at that time, Senator Feeney would have had to resign from the Medical Council.  The expertise she had acquired and the knowledge she made available as a member of the board would have been lost to the collective wisdom of that board.  This proposed legislation is wrong.  It is deeply flawed and it sends out a message, not only to local authority members but to the wider population who might be considering politics and public service as a career, that if one becomes a member of a local authority, there one will stay because the Minister will ensure he or she will not have any acknowledgement of his or her expertise when it comes to the appointment of State boards.  That is the nub of this problem.  It is not about anything else other than the attitude that has been adopted at the highest level towards local authority members.  That is why I am against the provision.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The purpose of these amendments is to delete the provisions that state, members of the European Parliament, Members of the Oireachtas or local authority members are not eligible to be appointed to the board of the authority.  Local authority members are not being singled out, the provision also applies to members of the European Parliament and to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.5- ?><P>The provision is a standard one in legislation of this nature.  Most legislation establishing regulatory or development bodies exclude elected public representatives from membership of boards.  It is found in the legislation establishing other bodies such as the Health Service Executive, the National Sports Campus Development Authority, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Commission for Communications Regulation, Science Foundation Ireland, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Railway Procurement Agency and various other bodies involved with the Ombudsman for Children and the Defence Forces.

	<P>Before I deal with the amendment, I wish to respond to some of the comments made on Committee Stage that legislation of this type places elected representatives in the same category as criminals and bankrupts.  I do not accept this proposition.  Legislation by its nature has to be specific and these provisions, which as I said are standard in legislation of this type, deal quite separately with the issue of allowing elected public representatives on the board and the matter of unacceptable behaviour of a board member which leads to the member being dismissed from the board.  For the sake of clarity the two concepts are dealt with in different sections.  The issue of elected representatives is dealt with in sections 13 and 85 and the unacceptable behaviour of a board member in section 15.  I reject the proposition that on reading the legislation anybody could reasonably equate or confuse the two issues.</P><Col N="1756"/>
      
        <P>In respect of the board of the authority, it should be noted that because the authority and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services will perform such highly specialised functions, the legislation specifically provides, under section 13(2), that the Minister must appoint people with the appropriate qualifications and experience to the board.  Given the specialised nature of the authority, all the members of the board of the interim authority have qualifications or backgrounds relevant to its functions.  The membership includes people with a strong management background, medical consultants, including the medical director of the national pharmacoeconomics unit at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, the chief executive of the Health Research Board, a speech and language therapy service manager as well as the chairperson of the National Cancer Registry.  Senators will agree that the board of an organisation of this nature must have its members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <?oasys _cl10.5- ?><Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before commencing, I remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  On Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1756"/>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 46, after line 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">Insert the following section after section 10:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;Provision of information on deferred members.</P>
        <P LI="3">10A.&mdash;The Board shall have the authority to compel relevant organisations and <Col N="1757"/>companies to provide information as to the number of each of their deferred members, and such other information as the board may, from time to time and in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003, require.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not wish to labour this point but we had only a brief discussion on the matter last night so I will finish what I wanted to say.  I wish to impress upon the Minister the importance of including this provision in the legislation.  I welcome the fact that he said the results of the survey would be available tomorrow and he might let me know when I will be able to obtain a copy.</P>
        <P>The amendment does not just relate to deferred members but to other information as required by the board.  A Green Paper on pensions will be published in the middle of April, which may throw up other areas in which further information is required of the Pensions Board.  I do not want to go through the same lengthy process in getting information from the Pensions Board as I had to in getting information on deferred members.  It is grossly unfair to spend 12 years seeking information from the Pensions Board.  If, on reading the Green Paper on pensions, we find we need further information from the Pensions Board the board should be in a position to get that information as quickly as possible from the relevant companies, for Members as well as the Minister.</P>
        <P>My amendment seeks to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board so that it is in a position to ask companies for information.  That is not too much to ask.  The Minister did not answer my question as to why he was not willing to give those powers to the Pensions Board.  He said that companies had co-operated fully with the board but it has taken considerable time, even since Mr. Brendan Kennedy promised to provide the information.  I suspect the delay has been caused by the fact that the Pensions Board has not had the powers in years past to get the information.  Therefore, I again ask the Minister to accept the amendment in the interest of transparency and expediency when we require information.  Yesterday I promised the Minister that I would outline some of the correspondence that individuals have had with the Pensions Board on securing the information on deferred members.  In a reply in 1995 Mr. Horgan from the Department of Social Welfare stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department of Social Welfare in conjunction with the Pensions Board have commissioned a detailed survey of occupational pension cover in Ireland in order to establish the extent and level of pension coverage in this country.  The results of this survey will yield the statistics regarding deferred pensioners and their entitlements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, that survey did not provide the information we require on deferred pensioners.  In 1998 Mary Hutch from the Pensions Board stated, &ldquo;The queries posed by you in relation to deferred frozen pensions will be considered in the context of the next such survey to be carried out by the Board.&rdquo;  We still did not get the results of <Col N="1758"/>that.  I do know whether the Pensions Board got the information, but I have not been able to see the results of that survey.</P>
        <P>In 2000 Mary Hutch from the Pensions Board stated, &ldquo;There has not been any national survey of pensions since the ERSI survey of 1995 and therefore, I do not have any more up to date information since then.&rdquo;  The board either had or did not have the information on the deferred members.  Again in 2000 Mr. Eamon Heffernan of the Pensions Board stated, &ldquo;I am sorry you have not been able to get the information you require.&rdquo;  I am just quoting the relevant points from the letter highlighting my inability to get information from the board.  In 2001 Michelle Cusack of the Pensions Board stated, &ldquo;The regulations require that numbers of active members only be furnished, as it is on the basis of those numbers that the fees payable to the Board are calculated.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It speaks volumes that the Pensions Board is only interested in active members.  While I do not have its mission statement, surely it exists to look after the interests of those who take out pensions regardless of whether they are active or retired.  I imagine it should also include those who are retired.  As they get fees from active members&rsquo; policies or from the industry, it is only interested in those, which is not good enough.  If we want a clear picture of how our pensioners or those about to become pensioners are doing with their pension plans we need to have full information from the board, which needs to be in a position to provide it.</P>
        <P>In the late 1980s and early 1990s when the country was not in a very good economic state many people were being made redundant.  Approximately 400,000 were made redundant in 1990.  All those people will have frozen benefits and will be coming up to retirement or may have already retired.  I want to know what kinds of pensions those people have.  I have a very good idea, because I know many of them.  These are the people I have been trying to represent in trying to establish how well or badly their pensions have served them.  They have frozen benefits and no indexation and yet nobody from either the Pensions Board or the Department seems to be concerned about these pensioners with very poor pensions.  All we hear about is encouraging young people to take out pensions.  How can we encourage people to take out pensions if we do not know how well they are doing?</P>
        <P>Many companies have let down their employees by changing their pension plans from defined benefit to defined contribution.  They also do not provide indexation.  These issues need to be addressed.  I hope they will be highlighted in the Green Paper and that changes will be made in order that young people who decide to pay into a pension plan today do not experience what happened to their parents and grandparents before them.</P>
        <P>Pensions to date have been driven by the industry.  I am not against people making profit &mdash; that is what runs our country.  However, I am opposed to them running their businesses at a profit for themselves at the cost of the ordinary <Col N="1759"/>worker, with the Government and Pensions Board standing by and not addressing the problems.  We know the industry is doing very well and making large profits.  The chief executives and others at the top of those companies are retiring on enormous pensions.  They are getting lump sums of in excess of &euro;5 million and a very nice index-linked pension for their retirement.  While they look after themselves, they preside over a business that does not look after the majority of people who have paid into pensions over the years.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on having published the green paper.  I regret he will not be there to see it through and implement changes that I believe are necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe I will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>While he may be there, I may not be here to keep pursuing it and I seem to be a lone voice.  I will do my best to ensure I return to this House to annoy whoever the Minister might be and see through the matter.  I am doing this in the best interest of the people who have not been well served and in the interest of all the young people who are being encouraged at every hand&rsquo;s turn to take out pensions.</P>
        <P>The people coming up to retirement or who have already retired were compelled to join pension schemes.  Some young people joining companies today are still required to join the company pension plan, which is not right.  I do not believe in compulsory membership where people have no control and are given a false sense of security that their pensions will be secure.  We know that is not the case and something needs to be done about it.  I hope the Green Paper will bring about change in this regard.  We have seen many reports from the Pensions Board that do not address this area, which represents a major flaw in the system.  We need to change the membership of the Pensions Board.  The board needs more ordinary members and workers, who experience the difficulties I have highlighted.  Too many members of the board have a vested interest which is not good for any board.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his interest in the area.  I am concerned we have not achieved anything since I first started highlighting the issues concerning occupational pension schemes.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting my amendment.  It does not just concern deferred members; it is about future information that we may want after implementation of the recommendations in the Green Paper or at any other time.  We are entitled to get that information, which should be made available.  When members of the public write to the Pensions Board or to the Department, they are entitled to an honest answer and not to be fobbed off with the types of responses I read out earlier.  It is a disgrace for such answers to be sent by any Department or by the Pensions Board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being seconded?  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1760"/>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Senator Terry spoke eloquently on her amendment.  It is a matter about which she has spoken in this House for the past five years.  She is sticking doggedly to her task in this area.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to accepting this amendment.</P>
        <P>If not today then at some other point, perhaps the Minister might come back to me on the question I raised about allowing pre-1953 contributions for the calculation of benefits.  There are a very small number of people in that category.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for this amendment.  It is probably better for us to make departures in this area in the context of the Green Paper which I hope to publish some time in the middle of April.  A considerable amount of work has gone into it.  I have had the opportunity to look at some of the early drafts of the Green Paper which is very exciting.  It fully rehearses all the options and does not dodge any of them.  It will be a very strong focal point for discussion on pensions and will lead to very strong and sensible action in the pensions area.</P>
        <P>Lest I do not have the opportunity again, I wish to state that by highlighting these points in my time, Senator Terry has done the Seanad and the country a good service.  I mean this sincerely.  It is a complicated area, but I know Senator Terry&rsquo;s passion and commitment to ensure the industry behaves, the Pensions Board has teeth and consumers are protected.  This is my agenda and that of the Senator and any Minister in this area.</P>
        <P>We have come a long way.  Between us we have  put pensions to the top of the national agenda in recent years.  It was the one of the major items for discussion in Towards 2016 and the subject of a number of national debates, pensions forums and many Government, D&aacute;il and Seanad discussions.  Pensions have rightly come to the top of the agenda.</P>
        <P>We have an expanding workforce of more than 2 million.  In respect of coverage, 930,000 people, of whom approximately 500,000 are women, still do not have occupational pensions, so this is of particular concern.  I saw a figure stating that more than 80% of people in the retail sector did not have any cover.</P>
        <P>I know cover is only one side of it.  There are also the issues of adequacy and security which will be rehearsed very strongly in the Green Paper.  The more other people and I argue for coverage, for example, that those 500,000 women should have pension coverage, the more responsibility we have to ensure that when they get that cover, it is secure.  This is an additional responsibility we have and we must look closely at it in the context of the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>Accepting any amendments today would take me back to the D&aacute;il.  I have a statutory deadline of 1 April 2007 in respect of this legislation.  In any case, I would prefer to make these kinds of changes in the context of a Green Paper.  If, for one moment, I thought that the Pensions Board was not receiving co-operation, I would table this amendment myself.  The board, which is a State regulator, assures me that it is getting a very high <Col N="1761"/>level of co-operation and that it does not see any reason it cannot continue to get this co-operation in the future.  It is incumbent on the industry to co-operate with the State regulator, which is the Pensions Board.  The industry has a duty to do this.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry referred to information in respect of deferred pensions of those in occupational pension schemes who do not qualify for the preservation and revaluation of their pension rights, as provided for when the Pensions Act came into force in 1991.  I am aware that the issue of deferred members of occupational pension schemes has also been raised in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  As I pointed out yesterday, the Pensions Board is finalising its survey of occupational pension schemes with at least 1,000 active members seeking data on their deferred members.  The board expects to be in position to give the results of this survey to the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs tomorrow.  I understand from my officials that this information will be sent by courier to each member of the committee during the course of business tomorrow and I hope they find it useful.</P>
        <P>The survey will provide the information necessary to estimate the cost of extending preservation to those deferred members.  The provision of adequate and timely information is a vital element in enabling the Pensions Board to monitor compliance of national pension schemes.  I call on the industry to continue to co-operate fully and transparently with the Pensions Board and to provide it with full information.  If this is not forthcoming, and I have no reason to believe it will not be, there will be many other opportunities in the context of action on foot of the Green Paper to introduce the kind of amendment the Senator wishes to put through today.  This would be a better time in which to do this.</P>
        <P>I formally say to the industry that it should continue full co-operation.  I have no reason to believe it will not do so, but I and, I am sure, any Minister would not hesitate to introduce this section if it were required because it is Government policy and the policy of, I am sure, of both Houses that the industry co-operates 100% with the board and that members of the public, especially Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, who seek any information will receive it.  I am not privy to the detail other than what was read out by the Senator.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on any State board, particularly a regulator, to treat Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas with full respect and dignity and supply whatever information they are legally permitted to supply.  I do not have any great knowledge of other aspects of the Senator&rsquo;s dealings with the particular board, other than that which was read out by the Senator, but Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas must be treated very respectfully and the information must be given.  I am not suggesting that this did not happen.  I am making a general statement with regard to Members of both Houses.  We are honoured to be public representatives and, as such, State agencies have a special duty to supply in a timely fashion <Col N="1762"/>information we require to enable us to do our work.  Obviously, this must take place within the confines of the law dealt with by the particular State board.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment but I do not have a difficulty with the concept of it.  I have said what I have said about demanding full co-operation with the Pensions Board.  There will be many more occasions with other Bills in the wake of the Green Paper for the amendment put forward by the Senator to be taken into law.  It is probably best to leave it at that on this occasion, given the timescale we have and given that the Senator is about to receive data tomorrow from the Pensions Board.  We will leave it there for the moment.  I ask the industry to take careful note of what I have said in the Seanad today.</P>
        <P>In respect of the question raised by Senator Cummins, to qualify for a contributory pension a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions, including the average contribution test.  An average of ten contributions is required for a minimum payment, and 48 for a maximum pension.  The test is designed to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to the social insurance system.  However, it does give rise to anomalies with people with the same contribution totals possibly getting a different payment, depending on the period over which their record is averaged.  The test can also have a dramatic impact on entitlements where a person has a significant gap in their records.  We have all had our clinics flooded with people who have such gaps in their records.  The Green Paper will examine these issues, including, in particular, where gaps occur.  The matters are fully discussed in the Green Paper and options will be put forward for consideration.  I do not want to kick everything into the Green Paper but its publication is imminent.  It is the result of many years of reports, studies, research, discussion and political debate.  We will shortly have, within two covers, fairly stark choices to make.  The options will be laid out professionally, including the arguments for and against.  It will then be incumbent on the Government of the day to make some fairly tough decisions.  The start of a Government&rsquo;s term is probably a better time to make such decisions than at the end of its period in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I regret that he is not accepting the amendment today but he has said he will consider it in future if necessary.  My amendment should not cause any trouble for anyone, but would strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board.  It would be a good provision when and if the board encountered any problems with a company in trying to secure information.  I have said as much as I can on this matter, however. </P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that the Pensions Board, or any other body designated to act on behalf of the Government, should treat elected Members with respect and dignity.  I am not just looking for answers for myself or other Members of the House, I am seeking more than that because members of the public are also entitled <Col N="1763"/>to such information, either from the Minister&rsquo;s Department or the Pensions Board.  It is obvious that over a period of 12 years the Pensions Board did not want to provide this information.  I still do not understand why the board did not want to do so.  We will now get it and perhaps when we do, it may be clear why the board did not want this information in the public domain.  We must ensure, however, that information is made available when requested.  That is what the board is there for.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money is keeping the board&rsquo;s members in their positions, although I know the board also receives money from the industry, which concerns me.  If one of their paymasters is the industry, then their position is not entirely independent.  I would prefer if the Pensions Board was completely funded by the Government.  In that case, the board may be more accountable to the Government and members of the public.</P>
        <P>I look forward to reading the Green Paper and hope we will be able to make changes.  People should be able to look forward to retirement and enjoy their pensions when that time comes.  Unfortunately, most pensioners today are dependent on the State pension for the majority of their income.  I regret what the Taoiseach said last weekend in his Ard-Fheis speech &mdash; that if returned to Government he would propose a reduction in PRSI contributions.  That worries me because nobody has ever said to me that they would like to reduce their PRSI contributions.  People realise that the social insurance fund is a very good thing and delivers welfare benefits, which I praised in yesterday&rsquo;s debate.  The fund delivers a good State pension to all our pensioners and, while it needs to be strengthened and improved, it has served us well.  I would be concerned by any proposal to reduce the fund at a time when we have a surplus because who knows what the next five, ten or 15 years will bring.  I hope such a step will not be implemented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and other Members of the Seanad for their speedy consideration of the Bill.  I regret I was unavailable to attend the House earlier in the week but I read carefully everything that Senators said during the debate.  I have been in the House as often as I possibly could.  The debate on Committee and Report Stages threw up some enlightening subjects which we can pursue.  I also wish to thank my officials and their staff who have put much work into this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill is enormously detailed and requires a lot of professional expertise.  We are all indebted to the skilled officials who have supported our <Col N="1764"/>work in passing this legislation.  I look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s early signature into law.  The enactment of a major portion of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will start on 1 April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his work in this area since he took over his current portfolio.  It has been a pleasure to work with him as he is always open and willing to listen and has agreed with many of the points I have made.  We will need more time to take on board some of the recommendations that will hopefully come from the Green Paper.  Beidh l&aacute; eile, as they say.</P>
        <P>I also wish to thank the officials.  Any criticisms I may have made of the Department are in no way criticisms of any individuals.  Everybody has a job to do and it is not always easy.  I wish to thank the Minister and his officials for their work on this and other Bills from that Department.  I hope we will all be back here again to continue our work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials and compliment them for having produced what is certainly recognised as an outstanding Bill.  I also thank Senators Terry, Cummins, Cox and others who made fine contributions to the debate on this legislation.  The pension increases provided for are welcome.  The Minister has been a breath of fresh air in his Department.  I can remember pensioners complaining that they did not receive increases until the end of the following year, so the earlier payment dates are welcome.  The Minister&rsquo;s commitment to introduce pension increases that are well ahead of inflation has been recognised by those who require such payments to survive.  During the Minister&rsquo;s term, pensions have stayed well ahead of inflation, which means he has looked after those most in need.  People approaching retirement feel happy that the Minister and his Department are on their side.</P>
        <P>Many important amendments the Minister could not accept were tabled on this Bill but these worthwhile contributions may be considered in future Bills.  This reflects well on members of the Opposition who put forward solid amendments the Minister may wish to consider for future legislation.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 159, before section 102, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;98.&mdash;Any property whose value is less than &euro;450,000 shall be exempt from stamp duty provided that the purchaser is a first-time buyer and he or she retains the property as his or her principal private residence for a period of not less than 5 years.&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will speak on behalf of Senator John Paul Phelan who is unable to attend the debate.  This proposal is part of a number of stamp duty reforms Fine Gael is proposing.  It would help families with day-to-day issues with regard to the cost of living.  It would mark the end of stamp duty as we know it and make it much easier for the many young people who want to get onto the property ladder, as well as for older people who want to trade down.  We know it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to get their feet on the ladder.  More and more people in professions such as nursing, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and teaching do not have salaries that are sufficient to get them on the property ladder.  Stamp duty is one of the areas in dire need of reform.</P>
        <P>I deeply regret the Government&rsquo;s attitude to reform in this area.  It is preventing a large number of people from buying their first homes or from trading down.  The latest interest rates <Col N="1766"/>from the European Central Bank are at a five-year high, which has highlighted the need for reform in this area.  The interest rate hike highlights that the Government has failed to address the issues for many people.</P>
        <P>The Minister had the opportunity in the budget to introduce reforms but he failed to take the opportunity.  The mortgage interest relief measures in the budget were wiped out within 24 hours by an interest rate hike and, with the further increases, we now see how ineffectual his budget measures were.  To reform stamp duty would have been far more beneficial for many people.  It is a shame the Minister did not listen to the proposals put forward by Fine Gael, which I regret.</P>
        <P>The comments made by Deputy Bruton, when he said the Minister&rsquo;s proposals were ridiculous, show the commitment of Fine Gael to reform stamp duty.  The Minister must live with the consequences of his failure to do so and this is being highlighted on the doorsteps.  Our proposals for making the stamp duty regime fairer are simple and measured and will make it easier for people to buy their first homes.  It is difficult to listen to the Minister and members of the Government criticise our proposals when they have failed abysmally to address the problem.  The Minister had the opportunity in the budget but failed to grasp it.  We now see the result, with many people unable to provide themselves with their own homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s position in this area is contrary to that of those in the industry who have welcomed Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals.  For example, the chief executive of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute expressed the view that the market is in a position to take &ldquo;substantial adjustments to stamp duty at this time&rdquo; and that the Fine Gael plan has &ldquo;huge benefits&rdquo;.  The amendment would bring about a method by which people would be in a position to buy their first homes.  I hope the Minister will consider it favourably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s contribution.  I wish to raise a related point which has been raised by some figures in the industry, and I would be grateful if the Minister would reply.</P>
        <P>The current threshold for first-time buyers is &euro;317,500 and no stamp duty applies to a home bought at that price or lower.  The case I wish to raise involves a first-time buyer who purchased a house for &euro;317,000, which was just under the threshold and no stamp duty applied.  However, the buyer had to pay &euro;3,000 for carpets and other fixtures attached to the house.  When this was added to the sale price, it brought the total price to &euro;320,000 and stamp duty applied.</P>
        <P>Can we not put in place a buffer zone to ensure stamp duty does not apply when a first-time buyer is caught in such a situation?  I have been reassured by the person who brought this to my attention that this is not an academic example but actually happened.  A first-time buyer was caught in the stamp duty regime because the additional cost he had to pay for curtains, carpets and the like was added to the cost of the house and gave <Col N="1767"/>a combined sale price of &euro;320,000.  We need to ensure this does not happen.</P>
        <P>I was asked to put the case on the record of the House and to get the response of the Minister.  I want to know whether a more benign view could be taken in respect of the current regime in order that such first-time buyers are not caught with the duty, where the intention is they would not be caught.  I appreciate some movement was made in this regard two budgets back, and more recently, but there are still examples of people being caught when they should not be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have every sympathy for the first-time buyer involved but he was very badly advised by his estate agent if he was not made aware this would be the consequence.  Given that the parties were so close, it should have been a matter of negotiation to keep the price below the &euro;317,500 threshold.  While I am sure Senator Hayes is doing the public a service by warning people of the consequences, this happens whenever there is a threshold or limit for anything.</P>
        <P>On the more general issue raised by the amendment, it needs to be stressed that in the majority of the country, the price of very good new and second-hand houses is well below the generous limit of &euro;317,500.  I accept there is an issue, particularly with regard to Dublin, where a proportion of houses would fall above the limit.  I have a daughter who recently bought a house not too far from the centre of Dublin which was slightly above that price.</P>
        <P>The questions that need to be asked about this proposal or any of the proposals relating to the housing market is where is the real incidence and who will be the real beneficiaries.  If the effect of raising the limit is simply to raise the price of houses by an equivalent amount, the first-time buyer will not be any better off.  Until recently, the market was so heated this would be the consequence.   The &euro;317,000 threshold is pretty generous considering the system operating in other countries where the thresholds for stamp duty are significantly lower.  Senator Terry&rsquo;s proposal would be a very expensive measure.  The State must collect revenue from somewhere because there are constant demands for improvements to infrastructure for schools, roads, etc.  We do not have a property tax, but almost every other country has an annual one.  Seriously diluting stamp duty taxes would not be in the long-term interest.  If there are tax concessions to be made, should they be made in the area of stamp duty?</P>
        <P>What I least understand about the Fine Gael proposal is its stance on older people selling houses.  Older people have seen an enormous increase in the value of their houses, often 1,000% or more over the past 20 to 30 years.  I find it hard to accept the idea that the stamp duty paid by the buyer will somehow deter older people from selling or transferring their houses.  The area about which I have moral reservations is something about which few of us have any control, namely, the redistribution of wealth to the older generation because of the enormous increase in the value of property, especially since <Col N="1768"/>approximately 1970 but very much accelerated since the mid 1990s.  I do not even begin to understand the idea that one should make any tax concessions to people who have already gained enormously or what moral basis there is for that suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment gives her an opportunity to discuss the Fine Gael proposals in this area, in particular the suggestion that we increase the threshold for first-time buyers of second-hand houses from &euro;317,500 to &euro;450,000.</P>
        <P>There is a duty on all of us, in view of the speculation being caused by reason of the fact we are in an election situation and people are setting out their stalls on the merits of such proposals, to be careful of how such measures impact on the property market.  I do not believe anyone in this Chamber has poor intentions in this respect, but the measure has not been thought through sufficiently by the main Opposition party.  The reason I make such forceful comment on the proposal is that Fine Gael is, prospectively, the majority partner in any alternative Administration.  The impact of what has been suggested must be thought about deeply.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons one must calibrate carefully what one does in respect of any intervention in the property market is to ensure it does not have wider implications, whether connected or unconnected with the initiative suggested.  We must also recognise that at the current stage of our economic and social development, this is an area of economic activity that retains, in direct terms, more than 270,000 jobs.  Some 270,000 families depend on the health or otherwise of the sector.  Tens of thousands of others in allied industries that support and supply the sector are also equally dependent on it.</P>
        <P>What we must do is develop stable housing market conditions.  In the past 12 months we have seen a correction take place where the unsustainable level of house price rises has started to decrease.  The continual increase in prices was never a scenario that would be maintained <i>ad infinitum.  </i>One of the reasons for the change, mentioned by Senator Terry, is the fact there have been six European Central Bank interest rate rises in the past 12 to 18 months.  These have caused an increase of 1.5% in our historically low interest rates.  These have had a dampening effect and were introduced to cool a heating property market.</P>
        <P>Another reason for the change is that supply is beginning to meet demand.  We have begun to build the capacity of the housing construction sector annually to 93,000 units, compared with 53,000 a short time ago.  In the past, one of the reasons for rising house prices was that demand exceeded supply.   At the same time, people were on better incomes and were in a position to pay more for houses that were scarcer in relative terms.  Also, as a result of our historically low interest rates, we had greater competition in the mortgage market and this made mortgage finance more widely available on better terms and con<Col N="1769"/>ditions than previously.  In the past 12 months, supply and demand started to even out, which was important in terms of moving towards a soft landing for the market.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael proposal would cost &euro;460 million.  Approximately 50,000 residential transactions take place in the housing market annually and we have more than 1.6 million householders.  All the country&rsquo;s housing stock has seen rising equity because of the buoyant market conditions over the past decade and more as a result of the low interest rate climate and the availability of finance, etc.</P>
        <P>Let us look at what is involved when talking about tax revenue and how to give more money back to ordinary workers.   There has been mention of the 2% drop in the standard tax rate.  The reduction from 20% to 18% will benefit more than 2 million people, PAYE workers, and cost &euro;1.1 billion.  The Fine Gael initiative would perhaps cost 40% of that, but it would only benefit 5% of the number of people.</P>
        <P>There is one simple reason we must be careful when dealing with the property market.  The people we should try to help are those who have little or no equity coming into the market.  The Fine Gael proposal, however, provides benefits for everybody, whether first-time buyers, people buying for the second or third time or investors.  This is because Fine Gael has concentrated on currying favour with the 50,000 involved in residential transactions.  Its proposal has been made without any reference to the wider implications for the other 1.6 million.  This is a serious problem with regard to the proposal.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry quoted the chief executive of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute.  It is not surprising that a person who depends on sellers comes out in favour of an initiative that would benefit sellers.  Other Fine Gael Deputies and Senators have quoted the same valuer in their effort to advance this proposal.  He is the only valuer I know of who supports it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is the well known auctioneer and valuer Senator Ross.</P>

	<P>Se&aacute;n de Rossa.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>He will have to reconcile his distance from Fine Gael with his new profession.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The argument put forward on radio by the gentleman in question is that the Fine Gael proposal is a great idea because stamp duty stops sellers from getting more money for their houses and that the houses would be worth &euro;50,000 or more extra if the stamp duty did not have to be paid.  His client would win but the poor devils at the bottom of the ladder trying to get into the housing market would not win.  I do not expect them to be his concern because they are not his clients.  He gets his commission from the seller, not the buyer and has no brief to see whether the pur<Col N="1770"/>chaser thinks it is a good idea.  Few auctioneers would do business if their reputation was built on being good for the buyers.  One employs them to get the most money they can for one&rsquo;s house.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.5- ?><P>If that is all Fine Gael can point to as suggesting that there is support in the industry, with all due respect, it is not a very broad recommendation for the initiative.  The industry does not support this provision.  As I pointed out at our Ard-Fheis &mdash; and I wish Fine Gael well at its Ard-Fheis this weekend &mdash; the idea of three-year rolling reform of stamp duty has not been thought out.  The Fine Gael Members do not lack intelligence, quite the contrary, but how can one attract a buyer into the market if by staying out he or she can benefit from a better stamp duty regime?  If I were an intending purchaser, why would I enter the market in year one when I could have lower rate of stamp duty in years two and three?</P>
        <P>More important is the effect of this on the market.  The Chairman of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute is not laying bricks but taking the jam when the house is built and getting commission when there are ten people queueing to buy it, which does not take a great deal of skill.  The people building the houses will ask whether they can be sure of a market if there is a better regime coming in the next two years.  It does not make any sense but has obvious adverse effects on the market.</P>
        <P>This is a labour-intensive industry and when activity slows down, as it is doing already on foot of this idea, more people will lose work and fewer people will be employed.  People who come to work in the construction sector in this country rent accommodation, but when the jobs go, they return home.  Investors who have acquired the property that is rented out will put them on the market because there is no one to rent them.  That has an impact on the sale price because of the number of units coming on the market at any one time.  If asked, anyone involved in the auctioneering business in this city will say there are up to 150% more houses on their books than there were six months ago.  They will also say what the level of activity has been in the past two weeks since this proposal came out.  Let us be sensible, these proposals are having an adverse impact on the sector for the obvious reasons I have outlined.</P>
        <P>Taking it that this is the full measure of the Fine Gael proposal, Senator Terry will excuse me if I do not take advice from that quarter.  The carefully calibrated initiative we took in the last budget went exclusively to the benefit of purchasers, not only prospective but also those who had taken out a mortgage in the past six years.  A total of 125,000 people benefited.  Under the present system, first-time buyers are exempt from stamp duty if they buy a new house under 125 sq. m.  We do not emphasise this enough and it is assumed that everyone knows it, but they do not necessarily know it.  I have met some first-time buyers who did not realise this.</P>
        <P>In respect of the stamp duty threshold of &euro;317,500 on the purchase of a second-hand house, the latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that 50% of first-time buyers in the greater <Col N="1771"/>Dublin area were able to get the benefit of the exemption.  These are more likely to be apartments than houses but include some houses.  All first-time purchasers of new houses in normal estates of semi-detached houses are exempt from stamp duty.  The percentages, as Senator Mansergh said, would be higher further from Dublin because of the relative difference in property values.</P>
        <P>That is the present level of support for the measure against a background of a significant rise in equity values in the housing market because of the buoyancy of the market.  The proposal from Fine Gael is that as one goes up, the better it gets.  People talk about the expense of houses and we need to consider this, but we also need to be careful about how we react and come up with so-called solutions.</P>
        <P>In the first ten months of last year, 44,500 residential units attracted stamp duty.  Only 3,700 of those were in excess of the highest threshold of &euro;635,000 which attracts the highest rate of duty at 9%.  We need targeted, affordable initiatives that avoid adverse effects on the market and benefit purchasers, not auctioneers.  The scope and implementation of this Fine Gael proposal is not a good idea compared with Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s proposals about where to use tax resources.  There is no guarantee that revenue in this area will continue to rise.  The sort of dislocation caused in market conditions by the idea that this would become part of a future regime certainly ensures that the increasing level of stamp duty take will not continue.  This has continued, thankfully, because more people have been able to invest in the residential market and move into their own homes than would have been the case in less benign economic conditions.</P>
        <P>For those reasons it is not possible to accept the recommendation.  Its context is only part of a wider panoply of measures which are almost guaranteed to have adverse effects on the market.  While Fine Gael is not setting out to wreck the market but because it has not thought through its position, it could have that effect.</P>
        <P>The dynamics of the Fine Gael proposal could well be such that because people are being offered a better stamp duty deal year on year for three years running, intending purchasers will undoubtedly absent themselves from the market for as long as possible.  It is more likely that sales would not close and the prices of houses would not continue to rise as they have done up to now.  It would also result in serious job losses in the construction sector and, among other effects, have a negative impact on the rental market, with little or no prospect of recovery while the uncertain conditions continued.  It could have a major detrimental impact on one of the economy&rsquo;s most important sources of employment and one of the largest contributors to Exchequer revenue.  One should remember there are 260,000 workers, and their families, whose livelihoods depend directly on a strong construction sector and an orderly housing market, not to mention the many tens of thousands more workers in allied industries.  Any changes made in stable market conditions must <Col N="1772"/>be thought through very carefully in view of the great importance of the sector for jobs in every community in the country.</P>
        <P>Building adequate numbers of new houses has been a key priority of the Government and in the past five years alone the number of new homes being built per annum has increased from 52,000 to 93,000.  We are now at the stage where housing demand is levelling with supply and this is reflected in the slowing down of house price increases to sustainable levels.  There is clear evidence that our policy has been working and that a soft landing is in prospect for the market.  The changes I made were to help those entering the market with little or no equity.  It is therefore not possible to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  I thank her for tabling it, however, as it presented an opportunity to discuss this subject.</P>
        <P>The proposal of the Senator incurs only 10% of the cost of her party&rsquo;s full policy proposal.  The Government&rsquo;s intervention in the past has been to assist those who require assistance in certain conditions.  The system is evaluated and monitored constantly.  The uncertainty in implementing what the Senator proposes, quite apart from the great cost of the overall proposal and the context in which it is set, are such that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  This is obviously not my area of expertise but I will attempt to formulate an answer for him.  The uncertainty in the market has not been created in recent weeks by the Fine Gael proposals because it began earlier when the Progressive Democrats announced their proposals.</P>
        <P>Speculation on reductions in house prices following the implementation of policy by the party or parties that might be in Government after the general election is bound to cause some uncertainty.  People will wait to see whether they will benefit.  I agree with the Minister that it is a question of supply meeting demand.  We are reaching this point and it will have its own stabilising effect on the cost of property.  When supply did not meet demand, prices increased and made matters impossible for first-time buyers.  There was an increase in house prices every month but when supply meets demand, as I believe will occur, it will stabilise them.  It is at this point that we will require stamp duty reform and the abolition of stamp duty will lower house prices for first-time buyers.  This has not occurred in recent years because the increases negated any benefits that accrued from the reduction in stamp duty.</P>
        <P>As supply meets demand, we should realise the benefits of a reduction in stamp duty.  We are reaching this point and need to address how to get young people into the property market.  My proposal is a prudent way of doing so.  The Minister may be critical of Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy but he should note that the interest reliefs he introduced in the budget were wiped out within 24 hours by increases levied by the financial institutions.  Perhaps he did not think about this very carefully either.  When he claims his measures are to benefit those who need relief most, I agree this is necessary.</P><Col N="1773"/>
        <P>We should all try to benefit those who most need our help but I wish the Minister would apply this criterion in the area of pensions.  If he is consistent in his views, he should be consistent in implementing policy across the board.  Our taxation system in the pensions area certainly is not benefiting those who need help most.  The tax relief on pension contributions is benefiting those on high incomes and the system does not benefit those on the lower rate of tax in this regard.  There should be greater equity in the system of tax reliefs for pension contributions so everybody will benefit.  I am not opposed to offering benefits to those on high incomes but we should be realistic and realise those on low incomes do not benefit.  Consistency is therefore required.  I take on board the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to apply a taxation policy that will benefit those most in need.  I must stand over what I have said and the Fine Gael amendment stands.  The Minister will obviously not accept it today, but I hope he will consider it further.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh that older people or those who have had properties for ten to 30 years, or more, have enjoyed enormous increases in their value.  These same people are parents and, as we know, many of them must help out their sons and daughters to buy their first homes.  The sons and daughters whose parents are in a position to help are the lucky ones.  While parents are realising enormous profits from their properties, many are trading down so they can disperse some of this profit to their children to enable them to get their feet on the ladder.  However, many are not in a position to do this.  We have an unequal society and there is great inequity in the property market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Interest rate rises are almost entirely outside the control of the Government and are decided by the European Central Bank in response to pan-EU conditions.  The measures introduced by the Minister effectively cushioned buyers from the effects of some of the interest rate rises.  If he had not introduced these measures, house buyers would have been much worse off after the budget rather than better off or in a similar position.</P>
        <P>My having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s very full exposition and my having had the privilege of listening to him at the Ard-Fheis raised in my mind the question whether stamp duty is the sort of tax on which it is suitable to make any election manifesto promises whatever.  This is because of the dynamic effects.  No party would put in its manifesto that it would radically alter mainstream excise duties on petrol, beer or cigarettes.  Flagging such measures long in advance would allow people to take various counter-measures to mitigate the impact or, if it were going to be beneficial to them, they would hold off.  This gives rise to serious questions about whether it is responsible for a party to suggest in any detail what it intends to do in regard to stamp duty because of unintended effects.  One must distinguish between intention and effect.  Those can be very different.  The Minister has done this and I will try to do so also.</P><Col N="1774"/>
        <P>As Senator Terry stated, some parents try to help their children get on the housing ladder but I suspect this is only a limited number.  Most parents would not be in a position to do so or their children are able to look after themselves reasonably well.  The redistributive impact of the Fine Gael proposals are at the top end of the market.  They would affect people with properties worth &euro;1 million.  The figures were not worked out for properties worth in excess of that figure.  The measure was presented as being for the benefit of first-time buyers, who are a relatively limited number of people.  In large tracts of the country, the stamp duty thresholds are more than adequate.  The impact would be to confer a large benefit on people who have already received significant benefits.</P>
        <P>I respect Senator Terry.  She has a deep social conscience.  I appreciate she is not the spokesperson for finance but she finds herself in the position of having to champion proposals which at any rate, in theory and in intention, are not merely to the benefit of the coping classes but of the classes that are coping extremely well.  As the Minister stated, the effect may be different.  If one destabilises the market, by causing unintended speculative effects, instead of a soft landing in the market, this can have the effect of being conducive to a hard landing.  The people who are the intended beneficiaries of the Fine Gael proposals might find themselves losing quite a lot of equity.  My basic point is whether this type of discussion is responsible.  I will leave the question hang.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>To pick up on what Senator Mansergh stated, I have sought to be circumspect and I have not engaged in any speculation regarding the future of stamp duty and the role it plays in our taxation system for the obvious and valid reasons outlined by him in terms of the budgetary context of how all these matters are handled.</P>
        <P>Now that it has been decided to put out this as a centrepiece of Fine Gael&rsquo;s taxation proposals in the next general election, I have no option but to respond on the merits or otherwise of these proposals.  It is easy to identify the problem with it; the measures have not been thought through at all.  People have built up significant equity.  I will refer to pensions in due course.  Many people have invested in property as part of their efforts to have pensions or increase their assets base.  This proposal does not do anything to secure that.  Quite the opposite is the case.</P>
        <P>I contend that the ESRI will refer in its quarterly review, due out this week, to the fact that there is an issue here that is in the process of taking place through market conditions in an orderly market that needs to be settled on and to feed its way through in a manner conducive to a continued orderly and buoyant market.  This is why I say intervening in this market in the way suggested in this proposal has all of the potential to destabilise the market.  I do not suggest that is the intention of Fine Gael but that is the effect the measure would have.  Many people at the forefront of this market who understand how it works, both in the economic field and in the industry itself, would confirm this.</P><Col N="1775"/>
        <P>If one puts oneself in the position of a person at whom this policy is directed, especially first-time buyers, one can understand why one would hold back.  As has been said, these people are coming to the market with little or no equity and are depending on the financial institutions to enable them to get their first step on the property ladder.  As has also been stated, the proposal seeks not only to reform the rates of stamp duty but the whole methodology by which it is calculated.  Fine Gael has taken an expensive route and it is one which must be seriously examined.</P>
        <P>The issue of pensions was raised, and I wish to comment on it although it is not germane to the amendment.  We have decided to use the social partnership context as a means of resolving this issue.  We must encourage people who in the past would not have made pension provisions because they did not have sufficient disposable income and who, having paid their social insurance, on retirement were dependent on a State pension that gave them some modicum of dignity and allowed them to hold body and soul together.  A significant group of people were on such low incomes that supplementary provisions meant nothing to them because they did not have the disposable income to defer spending on essentials and to invest it in a pension for the future.  We must address this.</P>
        <P>Under the auspices of social partnership, we suggested we are prepared to develop an SSIA-type arrangement that might encourage people to invest in pensions.  I refer to people who in the past did not consider supplementary pension provisions as being for them.  We need to create a sufficiently attractive incentive so that people see the benefits of saving, in the same way the SSIA scheme brought home to hundreds of thousands of people the benefit of avoiding consumption of all one&rsquo;s resources in good times to provide for one&rsquo;s retirement years.</P>
        <P>I have been proactive in this area in an attempt to be careful and calibrated and not give rise to adverse effects.  It is a little unfair to suggest the doubling of the mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers was a minimalist move.  Approximately 125,000 first-time buyers benefited from the improvements to mortgage interest relief in the budget.  There is no specific information on the exact number of individuals who benefitted from the relieving changes in the 2005 budget.  At that time, I increased the threshold from &euro;127,000 to &euro;317,500 to exempt first-time buyers from stamp duty in the second-hand market and to give them that choice.  As far as one can gather, the number of first-time buyers who bought second-hand homes in 2005 was no greater than 16,000.  My approach in the 2007 budget brought a benefit to ten times more people than simply changing the thresholds.  When one changes the threshold, the impact will be felt by prospective buyers.  It does not do anything for those already in the market having to buy at those buoyant prices.  That was the wider social justice argument in favour of the doubling of the mortgage interest subsidy and that is the reason I went with it, although there were many campaigns going on in <Col N="1776"/>the media and elsewhere at the time suggesting I would do something else.</P>
        <P>We must be careful about the best course of action in this case.  I doubled the mortgage interest relief to ensure that in the first seven years first-time buyers are in the marketplace, that would cover the interest on a 33 year mortgage, at 4.75% for a mortgage in the region of approximately &euro;320,000.  That is a significant assistance to the payment of the interest.  We are not paying back the principal also.  That remains the responsibility of the purchaser but we are making a significant contribution.  In that first seven years the interest on such a mortgage for a married couple would be covered up to &euro;16,000 per year.  That is significant.  It was suggested that we had subsequent interest rate rises but the measure had a cushioning effect.  I also increased the thresholds somewhat for those non first-time buyers in receipt of mortgage interest relief, and that too had a cushioning effect.  One has to be careful as to how one intervenes, and these are the considerations and criteria one has to apply.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Hayes&rsquo;s question, as Senator Mansergh said, the couple concerned appear to have been poorly advised.  In determining the applicable rate of stamp duty, both the price of the house and its contents must be taken into account.  Normally, price negotiations would address from the outset what was to be included in the price.  It would be unusual for an add-on to the price to be introduced after a price has been agreed.</P>
        <P>If the law did not require the full proceeds, including payment for contents to be taken into account in determining the stamp duty rate, there would be a strong incentive to over-value the contents to stay within a lower stamp duty rate.  In determining the applicable rate of stamp duty, both the price of the house and the sale of contents are taken into account.  That rate is then charged on the price paid in respect of the house only.  The contents are excluded.  What would happen is that they would pay the rate of the next threshold on &euro;317,000, not on &euro;320,000.  It does not change the actual payment by much; that is just to be technically accurate about it.  The contents are taken into account, therefore, in terms of whether the stamp duty is applicable but then one charges within the threshold value in respect of house only.  The contents are not included in the computation of the tax.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is about Drumnigh Montessori school, in the suburbs of Dublin.  The school has been operating for the past 45 years.  It has been extremely successful but the school is experiencing difficulties.  It has two classes dealing with children aged three to six and one for children aged six to nine.  The school has been in existence since 1962.  It has occupied premises in various locations over the years including Malahide, Baldoyle, Portmarnock and Raheny.  Currently, the school leases three classrooms from St. Colmcille&rsquo;s school in Donaghmede but it has a problem in that it has been asked to vacate those premises.</P>
        <P>One of the difficulties is that of recognition.  I ask the Minister to consider proper recognition <Col N="1778"/>of Montessori schools.  I am aware the Minister for Finance plays a role in that because he holds the purse strings, and very effectively too, but it is his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, a decent, humane woman, who is centrally involved in this matter.  I am sure she would agree with me, particularly if the Minister were able to tell her that this is, as she possibly knows already, the centenary of the opening of the first Montessori school, Casa dei Bambini, in Italy.  It would be a remarkable and appropriate gesture by the Government to mark this international centenary of a great educational movement by recognising for the first time the work done by these schools.  The teachers hold certificates from the Association of Montessori in Ireland, AMI, and that qualification is recognised.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is a decent man who comes from the same bit of bog as my maternal ancestors.  I always like dealing with a midlands man and one who is practical and sensible.  As Minister for Finance he must guard the country&rsquo;s finances carefully but recognition of the school will not cause immense problems in that regard because it involves a relatively small number of schools.  Only eight Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) primary schools in Ireland teach six to nine year olds and only one teaches children up to the age of 12.  There is a small number of St. Nicholas Montessori schools, with which the AMI is allied, and the Montessori Education Centre, which is almost directly opposite my house in North Great George&rsquo;s Street and does very good work.  There will not be a great drain on the Exchequer and it could be even helpful.</P>
        <P>Montessori schools are very valuable in educational terms because children are encouraged to learn at their own pace through self-discovery and project work.  The primary curriculum is completely covered by the Montessori method and the standards of all subjects, including Irish, are equal to that in national schools.  One of the initial hesitations about Montessori schools was that they did not teach Irish but now they do.</P>
        <P>Montessori schools provide very valuable assistance because there are overcrowded schools all over the country in huge new residential developments.  The Montessori education movement can take some of the strain from the school system, particularly in the area to which I refer, where there has been substantial housing development, as the Minister knows.  One only has to fly over Baldoyle, Portmarnock or Malahide to see the enormous sprawl.  There is tremendous pressure on school places which the Montessori system could play some role in relieving.</P>
        <P>Developers are obliged to make provision for community needs in new residential zones and will provide school buildings but can do so only for recognised schools, which is another reason these schools should be recognised.  The principal of St. Colmcille&rsquo;s school, which has been very helpful to Drumnigh school, has made it aware that its accommodation might not be available after this year.  The school has made various heroic efforts to find alternative accommodation but has not been successful.  I wish to record my <Col N="1779"/>admiration for the fact that Drumnigh Montessori primary school is run by a volunteer board of management, comprising parents of the children at the school.</P>
        <P>This year is the centenary of Montessori and the opening of the <i>Casa dei Bambini</i> in Italy.  The school now teaches Irish and its teachers have recognised qualifications.  It can help ease the considerable pressure from residential development in the area and will be provided with facilities by the developers if it is recognised.  I know this is not the Minister&rsquo;s particular area but, as I have already indicated, there is a financial angle and I hope I have been able to demonstrate that, far from being a drain on the Exchequer, recognition of such schools can actually prove cost-effective.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister will reply with a prepared script but I hope he will draw the matter to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science.  I am glad to see he is nodding because the Minister for Education and Science is well-motivated and, like the Minister for Finance, able, gifted and decent.  I hope she will be able to consider it and to meet with a delegation to discuss the matter.  We must give recognition to alternative educational methods which have proved themselves by the production of excellent, well-rounded children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has outlined in detail the situation that applies to Drumnigh school and the wider role the Montessori movement plays in education.  We welcome the plurality of approaches which now characterises the provision of education in Ireland, as exemplified not only by the Montessori movement but by Educate Together and various other providers, in addition to the established, traditional primary school system.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity on behalf of the Minister to outline to this House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for providing support for child care facilities, and to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the application for recognition as a primary school by the proposed patron of Drumnigh Montessori primary school, Donaghmede, Dublin 13.</P>
        <P>The Montessori method of education, among other methods within a very diverse sector, is well recognised and respected and contributes significantly to the development of early childhood education in Ireland.  St. Nicholas Montessori teachers&rsquo; association, which promotes the development of Montessori education in Ireland, is one of the seven national voluntary child care organisations which receives annual funding from the Office of the Minister for Children under the quality sub-measure of the equal opportunities child care programme and its successor programme, the national child care investment programme.  The Montessori teachers&rsquo; association is also represented on the national child care co-ordinating committee, to allow it to feed into national child care and early education policy.</P><Col N="1780"/>
        <P>Capital and staffing grants are made available to child care facilities, including those based wholly or partially on the Montessori model, under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006, and the national child care investment programme 2006-2010.  These programmes are administered by the Office of the Minister for Children, who might have some role in resolving this matter.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science recognises two Montessori qualifications for primary teaching posts such as resource teaching posts, posts in special classes and in special schools.  The two recognised qualifications are the three-year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale College, Mount St. Mary&rsquo;s, Milltown, Dublin 14, and the HETAC-accredited BA in Montessori Education or BA (Hons.) in Montessori Education in St. Nicholas Montessori College, D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Teachers with Montessori qualifications recognised by the Department are also eligible to work as substitute teachers in mainstream primary schools.</P>
        <P>Montessori education, together with other methods in the early childhood field, will continue to contribute to the development of early childhood care and education services in Ireland.  Developments in this sector will be co-ordinated within the overall policy framework of the Office of the Minister for Children, which was established by the Government in December 2005 to bring together, and promote close co-operation among the relevant areas of the Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The application for the recognition of Drumnigh Montessori primary school as a national primary school must be assessed in accordance with the criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools.  It is important to note that one of the criteria requires fully-qualified primary teachers for mainstream teaching.  Under this process, applications for the recognition of new primary schools are assessed by an independent advisory board, the new schools advisory committee or NSAC, on the basis of the facts provided by the applicant in support of the case for the new school and the likely demand for places.</P>
        <P>The proposed patron of Drumnigh Montessori primary school submitted documentation to the NSAC for its consideration.  However, this application did not comply with the formal application procedures in place for provisional recognition of primary schools for September 2007.  This process requires that the notification of intention to apply for recognition and application for registration of patron be submitted on or before 20 April 2006.  This is then followed by a public consultation process and the formal application must be submitted on or before 31 January 2007.  As the application from Drumnigh missed both the notification and consultation deadlines the application could not be considered and the applicant was advised accordingly.</P>
        <P>I recognise the Senator has raised this matter to see if there is any way around the bureaucratic <Col N="1781"/>rule in question.  The rule is there for a reason and the Department must be able to plan for a September intake by making decisions in good time.  The position of the school has been exacerbated by the fact that the existing arrangements may not hold for another year, putting its existence at risk.  It has been exacerbated because existing arrangements may no longer hold for a further year, which might put the existence of the school at risk.  Even if the formal recognition issue cannot be addressed in this year, I hope the problem regarding the physical surroundings of the school that are at risk, because the other principal is not in a position to guarantee their availability for much longer, can be addressed in some way so that the benefits the school is obviously bringing to the educational system can be maintained.  Perhaps next year the formal recognition issue can be resolved meeting the criteria set out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the courtesy of his reply.  In particular he teased out the issue and went directly to one of the points in which I am interested.  Although it is too late for this year, perhaps the school might be able to get in on the next cycle.  The Minister appeared to nod when I asked him to get his colleague involved and pass on the information.  I hope he will do so.  This indicates the difficulty of a Minister having a script prepared in advance.  It is inevitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This wonderful project originated on the initiative of the late Dr. Bill Mangan, who was a trustee of long standing and a former chairman.  This historic island in the lake of learning, Lough Leane, fascinated him as indeed it does us all.  He was particularly interested in the monks&rsquo; way of life and the world-renowned <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i>, which were written there and are now preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.  The annals make reference to the island monastery in the year 1010, even though the monks were known to be on the island for some hundreds of years before that.  The good doctor&rsquo;s main interest however, was in the island gardens and their cultivation.  He had a particular interest in the herbs which were believed to have important medicinal properties and hence this botanical survey and hopefully the significant information it will reveal.</P><Col N="1782"/>
        <P>Innisfallen is famous for the beauty of its woods and among the species found there are oak, ash, holly and arbutus.  It is believed that the Innisfallen community adopted the rule of St. Augustine during the monastic reforms of the 12th century when the monastery became known as the Priory of St. Mary.  The monastery is believed to have survived until 1652 but was finally abandoned with the coming of the Cromwellians.</P>
        <P>The significance of this ancient island with its historic ruins together with its rich array of plants, flowers and trees is of tremendous importance to all.  The island has remained largely undisturbed for more than 100 years and this survey will greatly improve the cultural heritage experience of visitors to Killarney and the kingdom of Kerry.  The island is an integral part of Killarney National Park and managed jointly by the Office of Public Works and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I do not believe we should have two Departments involved and I hope the next Government will decide to amalgamate them again.  It does not lead to best practice and sometimes because of human nature civil servants engage in turf wars, etc.  I am sure that recommendation is in the mind of the Government.</P>
        <P>Valuable repair work has been carried out on the monuments by the Office of Public Works.  In addition to the rare herbs already mentioned, the island also contains many mosses and orchids.  I look forward to the encouraging words of the Minister of State for this project.  To avoid any possible accusation of conflict, I add that I have been a trustee of Muckross House for a number of years and was honoured to have been chairman in the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Roche, and I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I know the Senator has a keen interest in Innisfallen through his role both as an Oireachtas Member and as a past chairman and one of the trustees of Muckross House.</P>
        <P>Innisfallen Island is located at Lough Leane within Killarney National Park, which is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A monastery was founded on the island, reputedly by St. Finian, in the 7th century.  The monastery became an important seat of learning and the <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i>, a major source of information on the early history of Ireland, were written or at least completed there between the 11th and 13th centuries.  In addition to a 12th century oratory with a fine Romanesque doorway, there are remains of extensive monastic buildings, probably from a slightly later period when it became an Augustinian priory.</P>
        <P>The monastic buildings on Innisfallen Island are maintained for public access as important national monuments under the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  National park personnel co-operate closely with OPW staff in order to afford the monuments full protection and to <Col N="1783"/>ensure that the management of the monuments and surrounding national park lands are mutually agreed.  I heard what the Senator said about turf wars.  However, this Administration has been highly successful in having joined-up government despite the obvious temptation at times by some officials to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;consider issues from their own perspective.  Some challenges remain for us all.</P>
        <P>In addition to its historic interest, the island is also known for its many plants, and herbs which, as the Senator said, were thought to be useful to the monks because of their medicinal properties.  There is a suite of old botanical records associated with the monastic settlement, the earliest of which dates from 1756.  There are also old records of very large yew, ash and holly trees that may merit further study.  A group from the Botanical Society of the British Isles visited the island in 2005 to record the species of plants found there.  However, there remains a need to conduct a more comprehensive survey of the flora, vegetation and habitats in the area.</P>
        <P>The Department is working with the trustees of Muckross House on an interesting joint research project at Innisfallen Island which will include, among other things, a botanical survey.  A com<Col N="1784"/>mittee has been established which is being chaired by the national parks and wildlife service and which includes members of the trustees of Muckross House and other experts with relevant knowledge and experience.  Following an open tender process, a contract will shortly be awarded to the most suitable candidate to carry out a comprehensive botanical survey of the island with a view to obtaining the fullest information on the ancient monastic settlement and the lives of the monks, particularly in regard to their cultivation of the island gardens and the rare herbs, mosses and orchids that occur there.  This survey to due to begin shortly and the Minister looks forward to its expected completion by October this year.  Given his long interest and involvement with the trustees, I am aware the Senator awaits the outcome of that survey with great interest.  That should be completed by October.  I thank Senator Coghlan for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  From his involvement with the trustees, it is obvious that this area is of deep concern to him.</P>
