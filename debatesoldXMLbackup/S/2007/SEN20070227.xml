	<P>I have received notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to intervene to provide temporary means of access to allow the Swiss Cottage, a notable heritage site in Cahir, County Tipperary, to open to visitors this year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator<?oasys _jy ?>Cummins of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide adequate resources to allow the City of Waterford VEC continue its programme for adult and community education in Waterford.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide a justification for his repeated failure to provide adequate water treatment capacity for the area that includes Longford town, Clondra, Ballinalee and Edgeworthstown, their environs and rural areas between them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris and Cummins as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Bannon as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  It is a matter for Longford County Council.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Bill 2007 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 5.30 p.m., with spokespersons having 15 minutes on Second Stage, other Senators ten <Col N="530"/>minutes, the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage which will be no later than 5.15 p.m., and Committee and remaining Stages to be taken at 5.15 p.m. and to conclude no later than 5.30 p.m.; and No. 2, statements on the report, Learning to Teach &mdash; Students and Teaching Practice in Irish Primary Schools, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 7 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes and other Senators six minutes, on which Members may share time and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of the statements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is accepted by most people and across all party lines that the level of rights given to victims within the Irish criminal justice system is very limited.  While we saw developments in recent years with victim impact statements, which are welcome, victims are not given full information as cases progress through the courts and regularly feel left out of the loop when it comes to the progress of those cases.</P>
        <P>Last evening, the Irish Prison Service stated it does not have the legal power to inform victims about the imminent release of a prisoner from the Irish prison system.  This issue also arose approximately one month ago when Mrs. Nora Lynch, that very articulate woman, stated victims need to know when someone receives a temporary release or is being released following the conclusion of his or her sentence.</P>
        <P>If we do not have the legislative basis to inform victims of this situation, will the Government consider providing for it in law?  It is a significant issue which arose today and over the weekend in the case of an appalling series of child abuse cases from the past 20 or 30 years.  This matter is raised regularly and not only with regard to the issue in the public domain at present.  Will the Government implement a straightforward change to allow the Irish Prison Service or members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform victims when an imminent release from prison will occur?</P>
        <P>I was not privileged to be in Croke Park last Saturday, unlike, I suspect, many Members of the House.  It is worth putting on the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether this is an appropriate matter for the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it is for the reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it was raised last week on the Order of Business.  Not only was it a fantastic result and occasion but the pluralism, tolerance and good sportsmanship of the entire country was reflected in Croke Park last Saturday in contrast to the more ugly and prejudiced remarks, <Col N="531"/>some of which unfortunately emanated from this House last week, by people who used the occasion for their own narrow political ends.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not go back on last week&rsquo;s business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I make the case that it was the very best of Irish sport.  We should celebrate it and the new pluralism and tolerance which exists in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are very tolerant on the north side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and ensure, whatever the background and country people come from, they are welcome to this country and we can all celebrate in that great achievement.</P>

	<P>It would be nice to welcome back the Cathaoirleach with a note of congratulations to the GAA to be taken on the Order Paper on his return.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows where to send it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We debated the nursing homes question on a number of occasions and the Leader will be aware of the issues raised both on the Order of Business a number of times previously and in discussion through recent statements.  I am of the firm opinion that no one set of inspectors can inspect nursing homes and I have argued as much here many times.</P>
        <P>There are too many aspects to the job, with facets ranging from health and safety to overcrowding to sanitation to medical issues and others.  I have noticed in the debate over the past few days that we see two or three sides arguing, but nobody in this House would know what the argument is exactly about.  Some people may be too intense about it and do not like the way it is being done.</P>
        <P>What exactly are we checking and what boxes are to be ticked?  Everybody in this House would agree there should doubtlessly be an intense inspection regime.  I have previously asked how this can be done and how any one person could have the ability to do it.  It continues to be my view that local doctors might do one aspect of the job, health and safety officers might do another and sanitation workers would also play a part.  The work would produce reports each year or every few months.  This would be a more dependable process.</P>
        <P>It would be worthwhile discussing the issue again, although we should not have an argument about it.  I do not know the answers to these problems but I am unhappy with how they currently stand.  Others would be as well.</P><Col N="532"/>
        <P>I thank the Leader for scheduling the business on at 5 p.m., which we asked for last week.  It is much appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>If they do not we will guarantee the debate will last for the time allocated to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has a little list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a very disturbing report on a subject that has been raised on a number of occasions, by myself and Senator Coonan among others.  It concerns the differentiation between retail prices and farm gate prices and the undermining of farming.  It is nothing to do with my colleague, Senator Quinn, who has left that behind him, but the farming element.</P>
        <P>There is something wrong if foodstuffs are bought at the farm gate for a price but are sold on for exponentially greater amounts.  Clearly there are transport and retail costs, among others, going into it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is VAT.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We must consider how this works.  Farmers are not getting a fair deal.  They are arguing about the wrong issues and perhaps we should argue on their behalf because they need some support in this regard.  They are not getting the value of their work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Some weeks ago I asked for a debate on affordable housing and what constitutes an affordable house.  When it was announced by the Government around 1998, the original idea was that affordable housing could be bought at a cost approximating the expense of its construction.  My local council has sold such houses for about 60% of the market value but more recently affordable housing is 70% or 80% of the market value.  The price of so-called affordable homes is now over &euro;300,000.  It is becoming somewhat of a moveable feast and I would like the issue to be discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Who can now apply for affordable housing?  Some weeks ago, the affordable homes partnership advertised 500 housing units which it bought on the open market, being offered to buyers now as so-called affordable homes.  The minimum income which must be earned to apply for any of those 500 houses is &euro;45,000.</P>
        <P>I looked up the salary scales for teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;, and a person would have to be a member of any of those professions for many years before he or she would get an annual income of &euro;45,000.  That income stipulation also rules out bus drivers, many journalists and other people who should be key members of our com<Col N="533"/>munity but are no longer able to afford a so-called affordable house.  The issue is a bit of a joke.</P>
        <P>This brings me back to the overall issue.  There is another scandal, I believe, in that the affordable homes partnership has asked developers to submit proposals for unzoned land in order for it to get the land rezoned in return for so-called affordable housing.  Developers can buy cheap high-amenity lands, have them rezoned and make many hundreds of millions of euro on their investments, which is a scandal.  We must examine the issue of affordable housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Affordable housing has become the new brown envelope.  Developers get land rezoned and maintain the speculative approach to the housing market and land prices.  We need to revert to what the Taoiseach said, namely, that he would do something about the price of land.  He requested the Joint Committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member, to do a substantial report on that matter, but the report is sitting on a shelf.  Its recommendations should be implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, I was proud and honoured to be in Croke Park for a wonderful occasion and our most terrific result in a game of rugby.  I was proud to be Irish and even prouder to be a citizen on this little island.  Congratulations must be offered to many people, but we should remember the GAA primarily, which did itself proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the GAA for its foresight and application in developing such a stadium.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate the Garda for its unobtrusive, but effective presence on the day.  I would go so far as to congratulate every Irish man, woman and child present for the good humour and respect shown to the various protocols.  It was a great display and result for Eddie O&rsquo;Sullivan, Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll and the entire team.  The result was for sport, particularly Irish sport.  We can hold our heads up and be proud that we do not need to look into anyone&rsquo;s back yard or front garden.  We are a nation in our own right, which was the winner on the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to join with the leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, in his expression of concern and his call for legislation to protect the rights of victims in light of events in recent days.  Someone who abused children in a dreadful way for many years and who served nine years of a 29-year sentence is to be released <Col N="534"/>without any of the victims being informed.  We heard some of the victims expressing on radio their hurt and fear of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Predator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;man returning to the community.  They do not know when or where they will bump into him.  The victims are the people about whom we should be most concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be a system and legislation in place to protect them and to tell them in a timely fashion that the man will be released into the community, where he will live, what restrictions, if any, will be placed on his movements and any information that will help ease their pain.  They will suffer for the rest of their lives, but they have received no compensation.  The case is a debacle involving the insurance company and the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.  Should the Government not move to protect the victims, who are still suffering?</P>
        <P>I support the Senator&rsquo;s statement fully and I call on the Leader to do whatever she can to ensure legislation is put in place to prevent this type of event occurring in future and, if anything can be done at this late stage, to help the victims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not recall a debate in the House in the past five years on horticulture or the production of fruit and vegetables.  On Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point, I was shocked that a fine head of Savoy cabbage would fetch only 40 cent from a supermarket.  If the argument is that this is what the consumer wants, many people go around supermarket shelves looking for fruit and vegetables that could be grown in this climate, but fail to find them.  This needs to be addressed because it makes no energy or environmental sense to bring bulky products from hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away. </P>
        <P>On a related point, I believe I am not alone in being disturbed at what seems to be a ruling by the Competition Authority which prevents a professional organisation, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, from negotiating with the HSE.  This House is founded on vocational principles.  We have social partnership, which has worked very well for the past 20 years and is responsible for much of our prosperity.  We do not necessarily want a totally atomised neo-liberal world where people of like interests cannot come together to negotiate.  That matter should be addressed.</P>
        <P>I should like to come to the defence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was criticised by a <i>bien pensant</i> commentator this morning.  I believe we all agree that legislation to do with civil unions is a very serious piece of endeavour.  However, if there is doubt, <Col N="535"/>as there is because of a Supreme Court case, about what the present position is legally and constitutionally, then of course one waits for the Supreme Court to establish the position before deciding exactly on the changes one will  make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad to have been preceded by Senator Mansergh.  Some weeks ago I raised on the Adjournment the issue of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and got a very dusty answer from the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  This matter also affects Irish Actors&rsquo; Equity, which is far more vulnerable because its members are just doing voiceovers and are among the most meanly paid people.  I thank Senator Mansergh and believe he should contact the Minister in this regard because he is right that it is not fair. </P>
        <P>Let us not fool ourselves in regard to the civil partnership Bill.  There was a delaying tactic by the Minister when I introduced my Bill and there was an attempt to vote it off the Order Paper, which is a disgrace.  We managed to avoid that, however, and then three conditions were put down, one of which concerned the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which has been published, and another which concerned the report of the Law Reform Commission, which has been also published.  It recommends the type of proposal I suggested, largely along the lines of the Bill the Labour Party introduced in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister then established his own commission, chaired by Ms Anne Colley.  This has reported along the same lines and as Senator Mansergh said, there was a Supreme Court judgment to be considered.  There had been a decision of the High Court and the judge reprimanded the Oireachtas for not acting because we continually neglect our duty.  There is no question it is our duty and it was a disgraceful fudge, dishonesty even, to table a motion which stated this matter would be postponed for six months knowing there is to be an election in the meantime.  Those are not the types of standards I want to see in public life.</P>
        <P>I am very glad my colleague, Senator Tuffy, raised the question of affordable housing.  This is another farce.  My friends in Fianna F&aacute;il ought to be very careful about getting too chummy with the building and construction trade, which is a very dangerous area.  They have had their fingers burnt before and they should be careful it does not happen again.  I have what I am sure is the same letter Senator Tuffy received, which was sent to a friend. It coyly states they have some property in Dublin 13.  They do not say how they acquired it and, from reading the letter, one would imagine they had built it themselves.  Yet a single person has to earn between &euro;45,000 and &euro;58,000 to avail of the scheme, when the average wage is about &euro;30,000.  Who are they talking about?  This is supposed to be affordable housing <Col N="536"/>for people such as poorly paid nurses about whom we are still squabbling as regards giving them a decent wage.  A couple must have an income of between &euro;45,000 and &euro;75,000 to qualify for the scheme.  Let us live in the real world.  This scheme was supposed to provide for people who could not afford housing.  We should re-examine it.  There is a possibility of land rezonings being involved and all the rest of it, but the critical factor is that this measure was contained in legislation passed here, providing that a proportion of developments would be allocated for affordable housing, but the developers have been allowed to get away with it.  They have been allowed to weasel their way around this measure and many decent people in Fianna F&aacute;il know that is the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will be brief.  I wish to raise two other matters, the first of which relates to planning permission.  In this instance it concerns an ex-Fine Gael Member of this House, Councillor Farrelly,  who has tabled an amendment to the development plan for Meath County Council to seek to shrink the safety area around a very historic house, Headfort House, in County Meath from more than 700 acres to approximately 50 acres to facilitate the building of houses.  People will have seen the advertisements in regard to the stable yard which was redeveloped, but it is proposed that even that area will be excluded from the safety area.</P>
        <P>Appalling developments have also taken place all around Marino Casino and there are further plans in that respect.  Carton House has been devastated by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am definitely seeking a debate on this issue, particularly as only 30 of 1,500 big houses in existence at the time of the Civil War remain.  I will leave the raising of the other issue I mentioned until tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the sacrifices made at the weekend by Garda Brian Kelleher from Bruree and Michael Liston, a part-time fire fighter, from Foynes who died in the course of their duties.  We should recognise their unselfish approach to their work, the carrying out of which resulted in their untimely deaths.  We all owe them a debt of gratitude and well as all members of the part-time fire fighting service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their unselfish work on behalf of the State.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate on the success of the pilot schemes of the <Col N="537"/>joint policing committees established by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in mid-2006?  They were rolled out in 22 areas.  The joint policing committees proved successful with the participation in them of local authorities members and Oireachtas Members.  It was agreed that such committees would be further rolled out in 2006.  Based on the success of the pilot schemes, particularly given the need for co-operation between the public and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, joint policing committees should be rolled out throughout the country well before the Government is dissolved.  It is important to ensure local policing committees operate in every local authority area and every major urban district to enable local authority members and Oireachtas Members to work with senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the interests of the security of the State, policing and community involvement.</P>
        <P>I hope that the Leader will invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report to the House on the progress made by the policing committees that have been established.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Where were they established?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>They were established in Bray, Dublin, Kildare, Galway and throughout a mix of areas.  They have proved to be successful.  The Minister should be commended on introducing this initiative and, hopefully, on rolling out such committees to every local authority area.  Such a debate would give the Minister an opportunity to outline the progress made in regard to the pilot committees that have been established.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past ten years or more, the credibility of our planning process has taken serious knocks on numerous occasions.  A recent decision of the High Court which agreed a decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that planning permission for a landfill facility in County Kildare be overturned seems to question the credibility of the processes within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It asked that it be quashed because the board had reached the decision on the basis of inadequate records.  There was no record of any meeting of the board about how the planning conditions, as finally prepared, were approved.  We often talk about objectivity, impartiality and transparency, but all of them are absent in this case.  It calls into question the processes within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The inspector made a decision to recommend refusal.  After that recommendation, the board sought further information.  A four-day oral hearing was held and further information was again sought, probably to justify its initial decision.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader call the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government before <Col N="538"/>the House to assure Members he has confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make fair, impartial decisions on planning permission applications submitted to it.  It is unbelievable that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the last arbitrary body able to make a decision, has question marks over its impartiality and credibility.  We must have an urgent debate on the issue so that this case and others like it will be queried from now on.  People are losing confidence in its processes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the important issue of victims&rsquo; rights.  We sometimes forget the terrible trauma and hurt suffered by victims.  It is vital that victims are made aware of the imminent release of the perpetrators of the crimes committed against them.</P>
        <P>I know of a young woman whose husband was murdered on a normal weekend in a quiet, provincial town.  She and her family were deprived of their loved one for all time.  They have been irreparably changed as a result of that crime.  The first time they knew he had been released was when they passed him on the street in that particular small town.  How can we justify adding more hurt and trauma to people&rsquo;s lives?  It is vital that an urgent effort is made to ensure that such a case never arises again.</P>

	<P>I have recently had reason to visit twice the Passport Office on Molesworth Street and I congratulate the officials for a very efficient operation there.  It was announced two or three years ago in Britain that passports could not be handed out to British citizens unless two months&rsquo; notice was given because the technology was too much for its passport office.  My only disappointment here was that when my photograph was being taken, I was told not to smile by a very diplomatic usher.  Why does that rule exist?  Irish people like to be seen to be smiling when they go around the world.</P>
        <P>We are trying to be recognised as a high-tech country.  In recent years, we have put microchips into our passports which are very efficient.  I was stunned to discover that 5,900 passports were stolen last year, while 33,000 Irish passports went missing.  With modern technology, this microchip can be detected in every passport control around the world so that the missing or stolen passport is identified when passing through.  That would provide the opportunity for Irish technology to be recognised as leading edge.  Radio frequency identification, or RFID, exists for products in supermarkets, so it is certainly possible to do it for passports as well.  I congratulate the Passport Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs, but I urge them to go a little further.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Mansergh raised the issue of the importation of products that could well be produced in Ireland.  The solution to the issue is in our hands and those of customers.  Some customers refuse to buy products that have what we call &ldquo;food miles&rdquo; on them, products that <Col N="539"/>have travelled many miles and have what we call a &ldquo;carbon footprint&rdquo; because of the carbon emissions as a result of bringing the product from the far side of the world.</P>
        <P>The solution is in our hands.  We do not have to pass laws to solve the issue.  Customers can say they want a fresh product and producers who label their produce with the names and addresses of the farmers producing the product will give the edge to their produce.  This sort of labelling will give those products an edge and lead.  I urge all producers to do the same rather than let us ask Government to interfere and pass a law.  We should leave the issue to customers and the marketplace and the issue will be solved.</P>

	<P>I am moved by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s intervention because some years ago my wife had a similar harrowing experience.  The Prison Service may well be confusing not having a statutory duty and not having the power to inform victims of prisoners&rsquo; releases. There is nothing to prevent an administrative instruction being given in this regard.  We do not have to wait for legislation.  An administrative instruction should be given that in these circumstances the families of the immediate victim should be informed that such and such a person is being released.  In that manner they would not learn of it from the public press or run the risk of bumping into the person in the supermarket or church and learning about it that way.  Informing them in advance would be a more compassionate way of dealing with releases.</P>
        <P>There is room for a wider debate on the issue of released prisoners, particularly those who have committed sexual offences.  We should debate how they can be treated fairly and in a way that will protect the public and the victims and their sensibilities without turning into a witch-hunt.</P>

	<P>The case mentioned by Senator Ulick Burke is frightening.  It is no wonder An Bord Plean&aacute;la went into court with its hands up.  We should be grateful for the judgment of Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Neill of the High Court on 24 October 2006 in his ruling on the Grealish <i>v. </i>An Bord Plean&aacute;la case.  This judgment was not appealed to the Supreme Court and is now the law of the land.  Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Neill ruled that the board should never again overrule one of its inspectors without setting out in writing all the relevant reasons and considerations and that it was unreasonable and irrational to waiver an inspector&rsquo;s judgment and the board should not do so again.  Objectivity and impartiality are a <i>sine qua non </i>of the planning process which should be open and transparent.</P>
        <P>Reasons and considerations are important and we must always ensure the public interest and the integrity of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is upheld.  The board is the final arbiter of planning matters and must be seen to be above reproach.  As Mr. <Col N="540"/>Justice Kelly said in another famous landmark decision, there must always be sufficient information for the citizen who must always have a reasonable chance of assessing whether he or she could succeed in judicially reviewing a decision.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s call for the Minister to come to the House to debate this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s call for victims of a crime to be notified of when perpetrators of crimes are being released.  Four or five years ago a lady approached me as a result of an assault she had suffered from a young thug.  The same youth assaulted others also and was imprisoned as a result.  Subsequently, he was released, without the knowledge of the victim, the lady who came to me about it, and he moved next door to her as a partner of the tenant there.  It took three years to have him and his partner shifted.  During those three years he wreaked havoc and sought revenge at every opportunity.  This was an appalling situation for the poor old lady living alone and for the other people in the neighbourhood.  It is a potent example of the need for information for victims.</P>
        <P>I am sympathetic to the sentiments on affordable housing expressed by Senator Tuffy.  Those are sentiments I have held for a long time.  If one looks back over the years, those in the professions she mentioned and many other people in steady jobs, such as in Aer Lingus and in the banks, were able to acquire houses within a few years of taking up employment.  That is no longer the case.  Even if one takes the affordable housing criteria to which Senator Tuffy referred, where the minimum requirement is &euro;45,000, she has a forceful argument.</P>
        <P>I have looked at this issue, especially in recent times with constituents coming to me frequently about it.  With the difficulties in frontloading a sufficient number of affordable houses, regardless of whether they are admitted, and the fact that the market is so demand-led, I suggest again that we seriously consider returning to an old concept of the Land Commission and reinvent that commission to acquire land, through compulsory purchase order and otherwise, in order that it can be rezoned by the State and offered in lots by tender to builders.  In that way and despite the best efforts and wisdom of Dr. Bacon who produced several reports on this issue, one would have real competition among builders in the marketplace.  This suggestion has the potential to make a significant contribution to addressing the problems to which Senator Tuffy referred as well as the overall problems of house prices.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the rights for victims.  He stated that it has emerged that the Prison Service does not possess the legal standing to inform victims of perpetrators of abuse that such perpetrators are about to be released and that if such standing <Col N="541"/>could be given to the Prison Service, it would be good.  I, too, heard people speaking on the television who had been victims of a particular person and who now fear his release.  In a way, giving rights all round would be good because arrangements could be made for that perpetrator as well as those whom he has abused.</P>

        <P>Senator Hayes also raised the magnificent spectacle of Croke Park last Saturday.  No matter whether one saw it in one&rsquo;s local pub, at home or in Croke Park itself, as Senator Feeney who was lucky enough did, the hairs tingled on the back of one&rsquo;s head.  It was a wonderful day and we beat them, which is what was really wonderful.</P>

	<P>Apart from everything else, it being a magnificent spectacle and the national anthem and all of that, we trounced the English team.  I found great delight in that, not from any nationalistic point of view but from a sporting point of view, that we won a great game.  With every single person on that team, it was near perfection.  It was a team of perfection, in my view, and one just knew they would not put a foot wrong, but the people did not put a foot wrong either.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of nursing homes inspection.  He has stated often in the House that there are many aspects to the inspection &mdash; medical, social and health and safety &mdash; and there should be a team of inspectors who could combine those skills of inspection rather than adopt a narrower focus.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to farm gate and retail prices.  A debate on the consumer price of horticultural produce, as mentioned by Senator Mansergh, would be well worthwhile.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with Senator Tuffy on the issue of affordable houses.  The term &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo; is becoming derisory because houses are in fact not affordable, as the Senator demonstrated by referring to the salary scales of those who apply for such houses.  The term &ldquo;affordable house&rdquo; has become a catchphrase.  The Senator referred to developers being encouraged to submit proposals for unzoned land.  It would be a good idea to have a debate on the affordable housing scheme.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney mentioned the match in Croke Park, which she was lucky enough to attend.  Good for her.  I did not want to go as I wanted to look at it in the local pub with company.  We raised the roof.  The Senator referred to the GAA, which had the foresight to develop the stadium, and to Eddie O&rsquo;Sullivan and Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll.  All those involved were heroes.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry believes there should be legislation to protect the rights of citizens when perpetrators of crimes against them are released from prison.  I agree that we should be concerned about the victims.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh called for a debate on horticulture and did not agree with the Competition Authority&rsquo;s ruling on the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  He also referred to criticism of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I know the identity of the commentator to whom the Senator was referring because I read the article in question.  The Senator outlined how the Minister wants to remove uncertainty before moving forward with the legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the delaying tactic of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and also referred to affordable housing.  He raised the issue of the shrinking of the safety area around Headfort House to approximately 50 acres to facilitate the building of houses.  If the land is good for housing and if Headfort House itself is protected, I would not lose a lot of sleep <Col N="543"/>over people getting houses on decent land.  We cannot all live in houses such as Headfort House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator said that Councillor Farrelly was bringing this forward.  I just feel it sounds sensible.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the sacrifice made by Garda Brian Kelleher and fireman Michael Liston.  They were in the front line of duty in the service of the State and it is therefore right that their deaths be raised and that we praise them in the House.  The Senator also referred to the joint local policing committees, which comprise Oireachtas Members and the members of the police force.  It would be good to have a review and report on these.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to the credibility of planning.  We would have thought An Bord Plean&aacute;la was the bastion of impartiality but the Senator questioned this and asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government speak on the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned victims&rsquo; rights and recounted a very poignant story concerning the shock of a woman who met her husband&rsquo;s murderer on the street in a small town.  Senator Quinn congratulated the passport office in Molesworth Street on how proficient it has become in the issuing of passports.  He referred to the importation of produce that could be produced here.  Some consumers deliberately do not purchase vegetables if they are from Israel, for example, because of the carbon footprint involved or the amount of fuel used in importing them to Ireland.  This is a fair point but the climate in Ireland does not allow many of the products in question to be planted and reaped here.  The answer is in our own hands in that we can purchase what we want if the goods are made available in a carbon-friendly or carbon-neutral way.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes expressed the view that the immediate families of victims should be informed of the release of the perpetrators.  It would be a better thing to do because of the incitement we see in neighbourhoods when such people move into them, sometimes rightly so.  It would also bring better justice to those concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the impartiality of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Senator Fitzgerald raised the prospect of a convicted abuser moving next door to one of his victims.  Imagine waking up to that.  The Senator also sought a debate on affordable housing.  We will endeavour to have a debate on that issue because, <Col N="544"/>as part of our constituency work, we have all dealt with people who are desperate for housing.  They come to us with their hearts full of hope that they can acquire affordable houses, only to be disappointed because the imponderables that surround the matter are too many.</P>

    <Title>Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Bill 2007: Second and Subsequent Stages. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>A fundamental bedrock of any democratic system of government is access to the courts, which are ultimately responsible for the vindication of people&rsquo;s rights.  That is why this Government has made resourcing and reforming the courts system a major priority.  We have only to consider the great progress made on the ongoing refurbishment of courthouses around the country to realise no one can dispute that our courts system has improved since the establishment of the Courts Service as an independent agency in 1999.  Judges are, of course, an essential part of the courts system and we have been fortunate in the dedication and commitment they display.  They have a difficult job and they do it well.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House is not contentious.  The effect of the legislation will be to reduce delays in the courts and generally speed up the judicial process.  The maximum number of ordinary judges of each court is prescribed by law and can be altered only by way of primary legislation.  Some may ask why we have to enact legislation every time we want to increase the number of judges or may suggest that legislation provide for a cap on the number of judges, with the Government of the day making the determination as to the actual number of judges required.  However, given the central importance of the Judiciary, it always has been the practice for the Oireachtas rather than Ministers or Governments to make decisions on judicial numbers.  Any decision to depart from this practice could give rise to constitutional and legal ramifications and, therefore, would need to be carefully considered.  On balance, it is right that the Oireachtas should make this essential decision.</P>
        <P>Legislation provides that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall not be more than 31.  For clarity, my references to ordinary judges of a court refer to the judges of the court other than the president of the court in question.  I use the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; in this context.  The Bill before the House provides that the maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court can be increased by four to 35.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for increases in the number of ordinary judges in both the Circuit and <Col N="545"/>District Courts, namely, for an increase of four judges from 33 to 37 in the Circuit Court and of six judges from 54 to 60 in the District Court.  This legislation is being promoted because the appointment of additional judges is required to deal with delays and speed up the judicial process in general.  The measure is also being taken to strengthen the criminal justice system in the context of a package of measures now in train to deal with serious crime.</P>
        <P>The following factors have been taken into account in coming to this decision.  The President of the High Court wishes to appoint additional judges to minimise waiting periods in the Central Criminal Court and to speed up judicial review cases, especially those arising from major infrastructural projects.  In the case of the Circuit Court, cases are becoming more complex and, consequentially, lengthier.  The available judges are allocated by the President of the Circuit Court in such a way as to minimise backlogs in criminal cases.  However, this has had a knock-on effect on civil and family law business and, consequently, cases in some circuits take up to two years to reach court.</P>
        <P>The workload of the District Court is also becoming more complex and lengthy.  In particular, additional judges are required to implement fully the provisions of the Children Act 2001.  Moreover, the population of the State is increasing, Garda numbers are at an all-time high and we are living through an unprecedented economic boom, all of which has an impact on the courts.</P>
        <P>I will now make some comments on the courts system.  The establishment in 1999 of the Courts Service as an independent agency represented the most radical reorganisation of court services in Ireland since the foundation of the State.  The mission statement of the agency is, &ldquo;[t]o manage the courts, support the judiciary and provide a high quality and professional service to all ... the courts&rdquo;.  There is probably general agreement that the Courts Service fulfils this task admirably.</P>
        <P>I am responsible for ensuring the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, &euro;102.8 million has been provided in 2007 for the Courts Service.  This represents a 20% increase on the 2006 sum.  Since its foundation, the service has made great progress in improving the stock of courthouses nationwide.  Many county town courthouses have been refurbished and other major upgrading works have been completed in places such as Cork, Limerick, Dundalk and Castlebar.</P>
        <P>The allocation for capital works on courthouses for this year stands at &euro;29.6 million or &euro;10 million more than the previous year.  Courthouse refurbishment projects due for completion this year include those at Nenagh, Tullamore, Fermoy, Thurles and Blanchardstown.  In addition, a maintenance fund for courthouse repairs, comprising &euro;11.7 million, has been allocated for 2007.  This fund includes &euro;4 million for minor works and is <Col N="546"/>designed to ensure that the courthouse stock is maintained in good condition in keeping with its role as the public expression of the administration of justice in the State.</P>
        <P>A new criminal courts complex in Dublin will be the first public private partnership project undertaken in the justice family.  The new state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a State-owned site in Parkgate Street adjacent to Heuston railway station.  It will be developed in accordance with best practice on similar projects elsewhere.  The new complex is due to be completed in 2009.</P>
        <P>The building will be designed to concentrate all central Dublin criminal business in one serviced location.  This will involve the transfer of courts and administrative offices from three jurisdictions &mdash; District Court, Circuit Court and Central Criminal Court &mdash; to the new facility.  The new complex will contain an underground point of entry for prisoners, appropriately equipped holding cells, victim support facilities, separate jury and witness facilities, a press and media centre, consultation and waiting areas and a cafeteria.</P>
        <P>The centralising of all criminal business in the new complex will also mean the Four Courts will be freed up for civil business.  Approval has been given to the Courts Service to proceed with nine other green field court projects, by way of public private partnership, as part of a new envelope of &euro;50 million for such projects over the next two years.  These include full District and Circuit Court services for locations nationwide.  The Courts Service will use a new investment methodology known as &ldquo;bundling&rdquo;. This approach will allow flexibility to the marketplace to bid for group or individual schemes, generating best value for the taxpayer and early delivery.</P>
        <P>Recently, a series of legislative proposals was announced to deal with organised crime.  The legislation proposes combating the abuse of bail, increasing detention periods, restricting the right to silence, lengthening the sentences to be served and providing for the enhanced use of forensic science and it is one of the most comprehensive anti-crime legislative packages ever brought forward. The measures include detention of suspects for up to seven days, which applies in the case of drug trafficking offences.  This will be extended to those suspected of murder involving use of a firearm, use of a firearm with intent to endanger life and so-called &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; kidnappings and similar activities.  The law on the right to silence will be extended through allowing inferences from silences to be drawn in the case of all arrestable offences in line with the recommendations in the balance in the criminal law group&rsquo;s interim report.</P>
        <P>New cautions will be included which will make it clear that withholding information in certain circumstances may be taken into account in determining guilt or innocence.  Changes will be made to make it more difficult for those charged with gangland offences to get bail.  New proposals <Col N="547"/>have been put forward to deal with re-offending.  The legislation will provide for new offences where a person is found in possession of equipment for use in connection with murder or drug trafficking, for example, weighing scales or money counting machines or cash that is the proceeds of a crime or for use in the commission of a crime and where the equipment or the cash cannot be accounted for.  The cash or equipment will be confiscated.  This will ensure that those who assist and facilitate the gangland bosses will be exposed to severe penalties of up to five years imprisonment.  The Government has also agreed to the establishment of a DNA database.</P>
        <P>I refer to a number of related issues in which Senators will be interested, namely sentencing and the judicial council Bill.  Sentencing is a complex matter and many variable factors must be taken into account in each case.  However, to address this issue, the board of the Courts Service established a steering committee in October 2004 to plan for and provide a system of information on sentencing.  The board&rsquo;s initiative is designed to provide a systemic form of information as a reference point for judges.  The terms of reference are to plan for and to provide information on sentencing.  The steering committee has reviewed sentencing systems around the world and decided to establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin.  The objectives of the project are to identify criteria and other information employed by the Judiciary in sentencing for particular offence types in criminal proceedings; to record and retrieve such information in individual cases; to design and develop a database to store the information retrieved and enable its retrieval in accordance with various search criteria; to share or disseminate the information, utilising information and communications technology, via a judge&rsquo;s intranet or other means; and to assemble appropriate material on sentencing for a benchbook and website.  Briefing meetings to explain the project have been held with judges of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and court registrars who are involved in the initial phase of the pilot project.  A pilot project commenced in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in January 2007.  Two researchers have begun to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated courts in accordance with criteria specified by the committee.  It is anticipated the pilot project will run for an eight-week period and that it will be evaluated prior to a further pilot.</P>
        <P>Work on the scheme of the judicial council Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department and it is expected that it will be brought before Government shortly.  The Bill will establish a judicial council with responsibility for a number of matters.  Among these, the council will devise a code of ethics and investigate complaints about judicial misbehaviour.  An important feature of this disciplinary process will be that lay people, <Col N="548"/>that is, people who are not judges or lawyers, will be involved in the process.  The council will also be responsible for judicial education and training and the exchange of information among judges on such matters as sentencing.  The legislation will build on the report of the committee on judicial conduct and ethics chaired by the former Chief Justice, Ronan Keane. The report recognised the need for a procedure to deal with complaints of judicial misconduct which, while serious, might not warrant the ultimate sanction of impeachment by the Oireachtas.  Consultations on the proposed Bill have, as usual, taken place with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Chief Justice has also been consulted.  When the scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government, it is intended to make it available to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  Views that may emerge from the joint committee can be taken into account during the drafting of the Bill, which will proceed at the same time.</P>
        <P>There is little use in having extra judges and a well resourced courts system if many people are priced out of the legal process.  The issue of legal costs is deserving of investigation and that is why the Government established the legal costs working group to examine the issue.  There are three main strands to the group&rsquo;s report.  First, it recommends the replacement of the existing taxation of costs system with a regime that would comprise the establishment of a legal costs regulator-body to formulate recoverable cost guidelines based on an assessment of the amount of work reasonably required to be done in typical cases; a simplified assessment process, based on the recoverable cost guidelines prescribed by the regulatory body, to be carried out by a legal costs assessment office where legal bills are disputed; and, where assessments are appealed, an appeals process conducted by an appeals adjudicator.</P>
        <P>Second, the report calls for significant improvements to be made in the quality and quantity of the information that a solicitor is required to provide to clients and the manner in which it is to be supplied.  Third, the report recommends a number of legislative and procedural changes to reduce delays in court hearings and to expedite the legal process.  Following the Government&rsquo;s endorsement of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, an expert group was established to advise on their implementation.  The implementation advisory group&rsquo;s report has been received and a further announcement on the matter will be made shortly.  Once the new cost arrangements have been put in place, the market for civil legal services will become more predictable, consistent and transparent for consumers.  This transparency will also make it easier for consumers to recognise competitive prices for the services they require.</P>
        <P>Before turning to the provisions of the Bill I would like to mention an exciting development.  The Courts Service has launched its first report <Col N="549"/>on family law proceedings, entitled Family Law Matters.  This will be the first in a series of reports, which is a Courts Service initiative to shine a light on family courts and to dispel myths and misunderstandings that may exist because of an historic lack of information in this relevant and human area of law.  This initiative was permitted by a change in the law on the <i>in camera </i>rule in family law.  Dr. Carol Coulter was engaged to carry out the reporting of family law on a pilot basis.  The staff of the service provided assistance and information to her in producing this report for the public.  The report provides information under three headings, namely, reports, trends and statistics, and judgments.  The reports are newspaper style records of what happened in a bundle of cases across the country.  The identity of participants is protected and the area of law examined is explained in accessible and useable language.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with definitions and need not detain us.  Section 2 provides that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall not be more than 35, an increase of four.  Section 3 provides that the number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court shall not be more than 37, an increase of four.  Section 4 provides that the number of judges of the District Court &mdash; in addition to the president of the court &mdash; shall not be more than 60, an increase of six.</P>
        <P>Section 5 is a technical provision which, simply put, makes the six additional judges of the District Court unassigned judges rather than assigning them to particular districts.  As such, the six additional judges can be allocated by the President of the District Court as he sees fit.  Section 6 sets out the Short Title and collective citation.  Given the size of the Bill, there is little more I can say on its detail.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset, there is nothing contentious in the Bill.  It provides for additional judges and will help reduce delays in the courts and generally speed up the judicial process.  It complements the measures being taken on organised crime, will result in earlier trials and will bring the level of judicial resources to a record high.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Bill because there is certainly a need for more judges.  I noted with interest the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on issues such as judicial training and sentencing and I will deal with these later.</P>
        <P>With the substantial increase in crime in recent years and even with falling detection rates, record numbers of cases are going to court and the waiting lists of cases to be heard are lengthening.  Government policy is to introduce more legislation and more offences into the criminal justice system without assessing whether it is equipped to tackle the current set of offences, never mind the new offences being introduced.  There is a backlog in the criminal justice system due to a <Col N="550"/>lack of judges who can process offences.  When coupled with the lack of a central register, a lack of sufficient training and a lack of clear guidelines, it is no wonder our criminal justice system is perpetually struggling to process criminal offences and to deal effectively and consistently with criminal offenders.</P>
        <P>The courts must be equipped to deal swiftly, efficiently and consistently with the cases which come before them.  What are the solutions?  One solution is to reduce crime significantly but that is unlikely to happen some time soon, especially as crime has increased yearly since this Government came into office.  The second way to solve the problem is to improve the efficacy of the courts system, which involves appointing new judges.  This has been a central tenet of Fine Gael policy for a long time.  We have been calling for an increase in the number of judges, particularly in the Circuit and Criminal Courts, for a long time.</P>
        <P>If we want to change the effectiveness of the Courts Service, there must be an increase in the support staff in each of the courts affected by this Bill.  I learned that the Minister has sanctioned 18 extra support staff but that is inadequate.  It is essential new judges are not frustrated by administrative delays and back office pile-ups.</P>
        <P>When talking about resources, I will be a little parochial.  Waterford desperately needs improved court resources so locals can have the level of service appropriate to a modern, regional capital and a gateway city.  Unlike in Limerick, Cork and Galway, no Circuit Court judge is based in Waterford which merits one given the number and frequency of sittings there.  The accommodation in the city&rsquo;s court house in Catherine Street is inadequate with only two courtrooms available for the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court when it is on the circuit.</P>
        <P>The situation becomes especially congested when the High Court sits for two weeks in March and July to facilitate litigants who would otherwise have to travel to Dublin.  The two judges sit simultaneously in Waterford but because there are only two available courtrooms, the lower courts cannot sit during the four weeks the High Court sits.  There is a chronic lack of courtroom space in Waterford and this seriously inconveniences the public which is entitled to proper court facilities.  It is not possible to access the Waterford small claims court via the Internet as can be done elsewhere.  Again, this is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The lack of courtroom accommodation in Waterford means cases are delayed to an unacceptable extent.  When District Court convictions are appealed to the Circuit Court, the lack of accommodation once more delays the implementation of justice.  What proposals does the Minister have, if any, to appoint a small claims court registrar to Waterford with a fully staffed, full-time office?  How many days per week will the Waterford District Court sit as a result of the <Col N="551"/>reorganisation of the judges in the district?  Is it envisaged that different types of litigation will be heard on different days of the week?  What urgent proposals does the Minister have to deal with the chronic shortage of courtrooms in Waterford?  There is no doubt Waterford people are discriminated against in the facilities provided by the State in terms of the administration of justice and it is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I return to the issue of judicial training.  It is imperative judges keep abreast not only of developments in law but of trends in practice and social norms.  Judicial independence requires a well-trained and well-prepared Judiciary.  We cannot expect judges to be consistent and effective in sentencing if they receive no training or education in the matter.  Few professionals operate in practice without ongoing professional development.  For example, in theory, members of the Bar are expected to submit themselves to a specific number of hours of education periodically.  Judges receive no formal training at any stage in their careers and rely solely on their careers as practitioners, either as barristers or solicitors, to equip themselves for what is a vital public service.  At the very least, to implement international best practice, judges should be obliged to undergo a specific amount of training per year.  While the Judicial Studies Institute runs many worthwhile and valuable seminars, the format of this training is far from focused and it has an <i>ad hoc</i> nature which means it fails to address the important issues of everyday concern for members of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>Judicial training could include a variety of subjects designed not only to improve the knowledge of judges but to change attitudes.  In many countries, judicial education emphasises attitudinal change to improve judicial integrity or to eliminate hidden bias on gender or ethical issues.  Regardless of the course type, managing this type of training is critical.  The overall control and direction of judicial training could be in the Judiciary&rsquo;s hands.  The training could be also provided by separate entities such as law schools or by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There is no question of the need for judicial training.  The matter concerns not only the Judiciary itself but also the general public.</P>
        <P>The current practice of remitting 25% of a sentence is problematic in several respects.  It diminishes the impact and status of a sentence.  If a person is sentenced to four years imprisonment today, he or she will be given a release date of three years from now because 25% of the sentence will be remitted unless he or she behaves badly while in prison.</P>
        <P>It is the decision of the prison governor to reduce the sentence despite the fact that prison governors do not have any legal basis to carry out judicial functions under any law be it constitutional, statutory or common.  This role of the prison governor is potentially vulnerable to legal <Col N="552"/>challenge, given that the setting of legal sentences is a judicial function to be exercised uniquely by the courts.</P>
        <P>A sentence handed down for four years should mean just that.  If a parole board decides factors exists which should lead to a 25% remission of sentence, so be it.  However, the idea of automatically remitting sentences makes no sense.  Fine Gael believes a sentence should be reduced only where specific reasons for doing so exist.  Such reasons should be adjudicated upon by a parole board.  Reasons for reducing a sentence could include compassionate grounds, good behaviour or evidence the criminal has responded well to rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>An argument can be made that automatic remission gives prison officials a carrot and stick to encourage good behaviour among prisoners.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  Automatic remission gives the carrot directly to the prisoner and threatens to take it away at a later date.  The criminal justice system should make it clear to prisoners that certain types of behaviour simply will not be tolerated and being guilty of good, bad or indifferent disruptive or criminal behaviour while in prison will lead to sentences being made longer rather than imposing a sentence the person should serve in the first place.</P>
        <P>Victims&rsquo; rights should be also taken into account when prisoners are released.  This issue was raised on the Order of Business this morning.  Victims should be notified when serious offenders are released.  I do not want to comment on any specific case.  However, it is of concern to the general public and it has been lacking.  We often speak about the rights of victims.  However, when it comes to putting them into practice we are very slow to implement those decisions.</P>
        <P>When a guilty verdict is delivered, a judge will hold a sentencing hearing during which the Director of Public Prosecutions will be asked to make a submission.  At present, DPP guidelines prevent prosecution barristers from making submissions.  Hence, sentencing submissions from the defence are presented in a vacuum and factors of which the judge should be make aware may not be brought to his or her attention.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael believes it is appropriate for the defence to put forward a plea in mitigation at sentencing stage.  It is wholly appropriate also for a plea in prosecution to be put forward.  Such a submission from the DPP is not necessarily with a view to achieving harsher sentences.  Rather, it is to assist the judge in his or her functions.  The DPP can bring to the judge&rsquo;s attention that a particular defendant has a number of previous convictions for similar offences, that a person failed to co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other information felt to be relevant given the facts of a particular case.</P>
        <P>However, the prosecution never seeks a particular sentence or highlights to a judge the importance of a severe or lenient sentence in certain cases.  The very idea that justice demands <Col N="553"/>both sides to be heard should be viewed not only from the perspective of protecting the defendant&rsquo;s right to a fair trial.  It seems ridiculous the defence should be allowed to present unchallenged mitigating factors in court.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the beginning of my speech, I welcome the Bill and support the idea of increasing the number of criminal law judges.  However, we must put in place the resources in the Courts Service and in areas such as sentencing and judge training.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome this short Bill which, although small in content, is not inconsequential in that the number of judges we have has a bearing on the administration of justice, its efficiency and effectiveness.  The Bill will increase the number of judges by four each in the High Court and Circuit Court and six in the District Court.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State outlined in his speech, all Senators acknowledge the Judiciary has played a pivotal role in the development of the State and provides a service which adds to the security of the State which is essential.  In general, the Judiciary has behaved and operated quite well during the period since our independence.</P>
        <P>We had debates about aspects of sentencing and it goes without saying that the Judiciary must be independent of the Executive.  In any democracy this is absolutely essential.  However, unlike some people, I do not subscribe to the notion that this independence means total unaccountability.  This does not follow as a consequence of being independent.  Judges should be accountable.  However, we do not have in place any appropriate mechanisms to deal with this.  I will return to this point later.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service was acknowledged by the Minister of State as having made certain changes which will improve and enhance the system.  The hours worked within the courts and the number of sitting days must be examined.  We can see the salaries paid to the various categories of judges are quite generous.  The argument is often made that because people leave lucrative legal practices salaries should be high to attract them.  Many judges wait until later in life to take up the position and I think it is often a way to provide a pension for themselves after retirement.  There is nothing specifically wrong with this. However, such salaries should command productivity, a word not often referred to in the public service, from the people engaged.</P>
        <P>Benchmarking has been referred to by one of my colleagues as being like going up to an ATM.  Unfortunately he was right as many people got pay increases without having made any greater input into the work or services being provided to the public.  I hope if there is any further benchmarking we will be far more discriminating in the manner in which it is applied.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P>In this instance, benchmarking must consider how the salaries of judges here compare with counterparts in other countries, particularly within the European Union.  For example, I understand the salary of the Chief Justice of Ireland is greater than the salary of the Chief Justice of the United States, which raises its own questions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is relevant right across the public service, and I state this as we now hear of clouds possibly appearing on the economic horizon.  The cost of houses is stabilising, which is good, but the number of units being built is falling.  In our planning we must ensure that this type of current expenditure &mdash; which I would claim as being unproductive because I come from a business background &mdash; is kept on a tight rein.  The future of the economy will depend to a large extent on how we control such expenditure within the public services.  I will not go further into the issue now as it would be inappropriate.</P>
        <P>We can now see high-profile segments of our public service trying to extract even greater payment from the public purse, despite significant increases in recent years being achieved by all.</P>

	<P>I am not speaking about the most productive sectors.</P>
        <P>It is sometimes difficult for politicians to resist playing politics with serious issues like this.  It is a pity if that should happen as ultimately the public will not thank us.  Two decades ago we had an example in this country of a Government which operated with such profligacy that a whole generation of Irish people had to emigrate because they could not get jobs.  It would be a pity if the lessons of those terrible mistakes were not learned on all sides of the political divide in these Houses.</P>
        <P>A question has arisen on matters pertaining to judges, such as consistency of sentencing, sensitivity to criticism, etc.  In the other House, the Minister clearly spelt out his position on the matter.  Those are real issues for people which come back to the accountability factor.</P>
        <P>Nobody would subscribe to the notion that this debate should go on in the media with one side criticising the other.  That tends not to achieve anything.  There should be some structure, forum or system in place to deal with the views of these Houses, as well as the views of the Judiciary, Garda and others involved in controlling crime, maintaining law and order and protecting people. <Col N="555"/> In that regard I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on a judicial council, which is long overdue.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Garda Commissioner visited Massachusetts some years ago.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which included myself and Senator Cummins, were on the same trip.  We all came away very impressed with the judicial commission operating in Massachusetts.  In that state judges can be held accountable for misbehaviour, but we have seen instances of misbehaviour or serious criminal activity here where there was almost no system but a cumbersome approach to correcting the issues.  It is not good enough for such matters to be played out over years in trying to find some solution to what is a very serious issue.</P>
        <P>There should be a judicial council or commission which should be equipped to deal with these issues.  It should be able to reach out, assess fairly and give people a chance to defend themselves.  Ultimately it should be able to expeditiously come to a conclusion and deal with the matter.  We have not yet seen this happen, which shows a serious lacuna within the system of the administration of justice.</P>
        <P>It does not serve justice well either if the public comes to the notion that certain people occupying privileged positions are above the law.  Equally we have seen a case where a judge was perhaps unwise in approaches made to people within the system and was forced to resign.  Most fair-minded people would feel that while the actions were not correct, they did not warrant impeachment or dismissal.</P>
        <P>We must put systems in place but unfortunately it seems to take an interminable amount of time to do so.  I would have thought we have had fair warning with many of these matters and we should really have had them up and running by now.  I hope it will happen.</P>
        <P>There must be a way of having an evaluation within the council or some other structure.  Judges are human beings like everyone else, with some performing to a very high level, others performing to an average level and some failing to perform to a level we feel should pertain to judges.  There should be a process for dealing with that.  Having an impeachment process in these Houses is not the most appropriate or efficient method.</P>
        <P>I have long held the view that the legal and medical professions are the worst for having exorbitant fees, and neither has been seriously tackled by the State.  I hope the Minister for Health and Children will now do so with the consultants.  The language in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was somewhat weak on this, and the tone was almost aspirational rather than determining that legal fees will come down.</P>
        <P>The State has been one of the biggest culprits in this matter.  We have set fees for the tribunals of &euro;2,250 per day for people sitting around for an <Col N="556"/>hour or two or sometimes only for a few minutes before they go to some other case.  Every day the tribunals sit and do not sit the amount is accumulating.  Having recognised the mistake we reduced the target but this reduction has never happened.  The consequence is that taxpayers pay all the money, and it is not as if the State has some finances of its own.  We are also setting the headline rates for private people pursuing legal cases.</P>
        <P>In a republic or any democracy, an essence of citizens being able to participate fully is access to the courts.  Other than for a small minority of the population, people cannot afford to take cases to the High Court or Supreme Court.  That is wrong.  There is no reason this should be the case.  To compare people in professions other than those I have mentioned, people such as engineers are still paid well, but much less.  The State must accept culpability to some extent over many decades for allowing that to happen.  We had a system in which one could appeal fees to the Taxing Master, who was often a barrister in receipt of the same rate as the people on whom he or she adjudicated.  There was no interest on the Taxing Master&rsquo;s part to cut the fees in half, so it never happened.</P>
        <P>I hope this regulatory body will have real teeth and will not be composed of people who protect the legal industry, as has occurred in many cases.  A range of competitive aspects must be injected in the legal profession&rsquo;s fees.  It always struck me as ironic that competition legislation was processed through the courts by barristers and solicitors who were immune from the faintest hint of the requirements of that legislation, which is applied European-wide.</P>
        <P>The Bill may impact on civil and family law cases and it is important that they be given the preferential position they require.  I am not sure that going through the current legal process is a great way to deal with family law.  People should be specifically trained and there should be a strong emphasis on reconciliation.  Many cases are settled before they reach court, but the court system is not a good way to address the matter.  There have been many incidents of irreconcilable marriage breakdowns, in respect of which the court system is fine, but the State should recognise that the more the incidence rate increases, the less it is in the interest of society as to use the courts.  Our policies should pursue this line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the Bill.  The increase in the number of judges at all levels is necessary because there have been inordinate delays in all parts of the court system.  The delays in the criminal courts have probably led to many people committing crimes while on bail because judges realise that considerable time will pass before the criminal case is before the court and a person is entitled to be considered innocent until proved guilty.  It is irritating to see people con<Col N="557"/>victed of crimes committed while on bail.  The Bill will probably lessen that situation.</P>
        <P>As courts try to give preference to criminal cases, they have fallen behind in terms of civil and family law cases, which are just as serious for the people involved.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to the report of Dr. Carol<?oasys _jy ?>Coulter on the family law courts.  It was a necessary initiative because we have relied for too long on anecdotal evidence to determine what was occurring.  I applaud those in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for bringing that initiative forward.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to learn that where a husband and wife split up, joint custody of their children is awarded in most cases, but we have been led to believe by anecdotal evidence that nine times out of ten, the mother gets custody of the children and there is no possibility of the father seeing them.  We will get a great deal of useful information thanks to the change.  While Dr. Coulter went to some family courts, she got a great deal of her evidence from examining the records.</P>
        <P>The way in which drugs are treated by the criminal courts must be addressed.  While the drugs courts have just commenced and are operating on a small basis, it is a project worth supporting.  It is welcome that some high profile cases have managed to keep to the terms laid down by the drugs courts.</P>
        <P>Drugs comprise a serious health issue, but they are associated with crime.  I read an October 2002 article by Dr. Michael Farrell in which he reviewed research carried out in the Dublin metropolitan area by the Garda research unit.  The research was conducted in 1995-96 and is out of line with current trends, but the same figures may apply.  Approximately 43% of those apprehended for crimes were known drug users and known drug users were responsible for 66% of all detected crime in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Some 85% of aggravated burglaries, 84% of detected offences of larceny of the person and unattended vehicles and 82% of ordinary burglaries were carried out by drug users.  The drug of choice was heroin, which was taken by 96% of those involved.  The two main income sources were identified as social welfare payments and crime, particularly burglary, shoplifting and drug dealing.  Some 81% of respondents were in prison at the time of the survey.  Of these, 49% had received treatment for drug addiction while in prison.  The mean age at which members of the group first got into trouble with the law was 15 years.  The first offence of 65% of the sample was a larceny-type offence.</P>
        <P>There is a significant correlation between drugs and crime.  When someone appears before court on a first drugs offence, particularly the possession of drugs, we should try to ensure that he or she appears before the drugs courts.  Every year, thousands of drugs offence cases appear before the courts.  Last year, there were approximately 8,000 or 9,000.  The treatment of the <Col N="558"/>people varies.  Some cases are dismissed, sometimes they are given the Probation Act, sometimes they are fined and the serious offenders are rightly sent to prison, but prison is not constructive when dealing with a person involved with drugs.  Given the progress made, the drugs courts are worth promoting.</P>
        <P>People have called for a debate on what has been described as the legalisation of drugs, but do they mean decriminalisation?  I do not know of anywhere that has legalised heroin.  We are giving people false hope.  That something is legal does not mean there will be no problems.  Prescription drugs, which are legal and controlled, are widely abused.  For example, Ponstan, barbiturates, other analgesics and cough bottles containing codeine are abused by people with various forms of drug addiction, but they are legal.</P>
        <P>If we want to control drugs and people want them legalised, should we start with those in respect of which we have a fair idea of the side effects?  I am not sure this is what is meant by those who speak of legalising drugs.  Rather, they refer to giving addicts access to drugs in controlled circumstances.  For example, heroin clinics were set up in Switzerland ten or 12 years ago and the drugs problem was addressed as a health issue rather than a criminal one, but the results were not much better than those achieved by our methadone clinics.  Transferring addicts from heroin to methadone makes it easier for them to lead less chaotic lives and leads to a reduction in crime because we are giving them the drugs.  They pay about $15 or $20 for an injection if they go every morning.</P>
        <P>The reports from these drug clinics for addicts are interesting.  While the numbers of new addicts have not increased, do we really want persons over 18 turning up at such clinics to be taught how to inject?  I presume those seeking liberalisation of the laws on drugs want the norms to be along the same lines as those for alcohol and cigarettes.  There has to be an illegal trade, at the same time.  The Swiss say they have reduced the number of new addicts because taking heroin does not seem to be such a rebellious act any more.  It seems to be more of a health question.  However, they have attracted addicts from other countries as well which has been a problem.  They have cut down on the incidence of HIV because they have given clean needles and syringes to people, and that is very important.  The idea, however, that this is a solution for heroin addicts is questionable.  It is more of a solution for us as a society.  In the report I read about the Berne clinic, the doctor running it said most of his addicts had tried to come off heroin ten times and had failed.  This is a large number of times to try and give up an addiction and be unable to do it.</P>
        <P>That is an issue that needs to be addressed in this country concerning methadone clinics.  There are long queues of up to nine months to get into them, and that is not good.  I know there is a problem in getting local communities to accept the <Col N="559"/>fact that there is a drug clinic in their area.  I am very fortunate because, when people ask me whether I would object to a drug clinic being set up, I am able to say there is one within five minutes&rsquo; walk of my house.  This has improved the situation greatly because it has meant that drug addicts in the area lead more stable lives.</P>
        <P>We need to address the situation in prison as well because large methadone clinics are located there.  Unfortunately, if people try to come off drugs totally in prison, which should be a good place to do it, there is very little for them in the way of facilities.  There are only about 16 beds in Mountjoy for people trying to come off methadone, which is very small.  A greater opportunity should be taken in the prisons to get people off drugs.  In addition, if prisoners manage to come off drugs, when they leave, they go back into the same milieu they came from where drugs are freely available.  If they fall off the wagon, they must join the queue to get to the methadone clinic, and that really is not good.  Such people should have some type of priority treatment.</P>
        <P>Another example is cannabis caf&eacute;s in the Netherlands.  Certainly, they have attracted an enormous number of addicts to Amsterdam, as I saw the last time I was there.  I could not believe the change in the place.   They tried to keep foreign addicts out of Amsterdam by setting up caf&eacute;s near the borders of Germany and Belgium.  This caused problems with the Germans and the Belgians, however, who said the Dutch were now becoming bad neighbours by starting such caf&eacute;s in the villages in the border areas, so that was not a good ides.  Illegal drugs are still sold within the Netherlands and, apparently, the suppliers to both the caf&eacute;s and the illegal drug trade are the same people, so that is not very hopeful either.  Illegal drug takers, apparently, are not fully tax compliant.  I had not thought this was the main problem with these caf&eacute;s, but apparently they are not paying their taxes into the bargain, and the Dutch are not especially pleased about that.</P>
        <P>This is a particularly difficult issue.  The situation cannot be improved just by legalising drugs and hoping there will be no problems.  I would like a debate on the issue, with people saying what they mean.  Frankly, I would be horrified if there were talk of legalising heroin.  I have had to deal with patients on heroin and it was unbelievable.  The main problem is that, even in hospital where someone may be on various intravenous drips, after a while, the veins become badly damaged.  First, the veins in the arms become damaged and then it is the veins in the legs.  I have had the extraordinary experience of treating people with deep veined thrombosis, some of whom were pregnant, because they injected into the groin, so desperate were they to find a vein to inject heroin into their systems.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear more about what people mean by suggesting legalising drugs would be useful.  After all, cigarettes and alcohol are legal, but <Col N="560"/>there is an enormous illegal trade too.  Every now and then, the Garda manage to apprehend such offenders.  The trafficking of people is also illegal but very lucrative, apparently.  I do not believe this is a simple issue and I would like to see much more help being given to people to try to overcome addiction, for example, by enlarging the drug courts which seem to be having some success already.  I welcome the Bill and believe the Minister of State will get support for it right through the House.</P>

The legal system is central to the notion of what it is to live in a civilised society.  At different times, the laws of the land impact to a greater or lesser extent on every citizen.  We look to the law and the courts to ensure there is a safe and fearless society in which to live.  It is imperative, therefore, we have the best people in these jobs to look after our best interests.</P>
        <P>The demands and pressures of modern society necessitate that the requirements are reviewed and upgraded, and that is basically what this House is doing today.  In that regard, it is perhaps the third time in the life of the current Seanad that we are reviewing this situation.  The Court and Court Officers Act 2002 declared that the number of ordinary judges in the High Court should not exceed 26.  Today, the figure for High Court judges is being increased to 35, a 35% increase approximately, a fair indication of the commitment that exists towards providing a better service within the courts.  As well as that, the Bill allows for an increase in judicial appointments to both the Circuit and District Courts, four for each. It is right that any Government, on reviewing the need, should respond accordingly, especially for something as important as this.</P>
        <P>However, as another Member of the House indicated, it is somewhat cumbersome that new legislation must be enacted every time there is an increase in the number of judges.  I wonder whether a speedier method might not be found to do this.   Where there is a cost to the Central Fund, I know the two Houses of the Oireachtas must pass the legislation.  As we are enacting legislation for an increase of up to 35 judges for the High Court, however, might not that figure be increased to 40 or 45 to give the Minister some leeway so that he does not have to come back for more in another two years?  To increase the figure to 45 is not to give the Minister such a free hand that he might abuse the situation.</P>
        <P>Other Senators alluded to the fact that we are fortunate with the Judiciary we have at our disposal.  Its members are held in great esteem for their integrity, fair-mindedness at all times and independence, which is essential.  It would be wrong for a Government to sit of its laurels when the President of the High Court insists that the Judiciary needs additional assistance and not to <Col N="561"/>grant its wishes where it is possible to do so and resources permit.  These additional appointments without doubt will speed up the legal process.  We know of many bottlenecks at all levels within the courts where there is a need for additional judges.</P>
        <P>I welcome the package of measures the Minister of State said are in train to deal with serious crime.  These will strengthen the criminal justice system.  It is also heartening that judicial review cases that are being delayed, especially those arising from major infrastructural projects, will receive special attention with the new judges coming on stream.  That is important.</P>
        <P>We talk about saving taxpayers&rsquo; money and this is one area where we do can do so.  We are aware of delays that have occurred in the completion of major infrastructural projects down the years, sometimes caused by individuals who did not live within an ass&rsquo;s roar of the areas about which they were concerned.  In one instance a man who lived in Kerry was worried about parts of the extension to the M50.  One must question sometimes whether this process is all a game to some of them.  I am delighted, however, that this exercise will be speeded up in the courts.</P>
        <P>Great progress has been made since the establishment of the Courts Service as an independent agency in 1999.  While that was a radical development, it was most welcome at the time.  Members on all sides of the House welcomed it.  That decision has been shown to have been an excellent one.  Without a shadow of a doubt, it has delivered a high quality and professional service to date.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State said, since its foundation great progress has been made in improving the stock of courthouses throughout the country.  The budget for the Courts Service has increased by 20%.  That is a tremendous boost in any man&rsquo;s language in terms of a revenue allocation.  On top of that, the capital allocation has increased by &euro;10 million this year to &euro;29.7 million.  That will also have a significant impact on the ongoing development of courthouses.  Coupled with that, a maintenance budget has been provided for the ongoing maintenance and upgrading of courthouses.  If a maintenance budget was not provided, the chances are that maintenance costs would be covered by the capital allocation.  Therefore, it is important that two tranches of money have been allocated to be spent on identified areas.</P>
        <P>The new criminal courts complex planned for 2009 is also an exciting development.  I am sure it will free up the Four Courts.  I read that it is planned that the Four Courts will become the administrative block of the courts.  We have spoken in the past of the great distress caused to witnesses who have had to mingle with the perpetrators or individuals against whom they have had to give evidence.  I assume that top of the range facilities will be provided whereby this will no longer happen, and that is important.</P><Col N="562"/>
        <P>The Minister of State said that the issue of sentencing was complex and that many factors need to be taken into account when passing sentence.  There is no doubt about that.  While I accept that judges must take into account a plethora of consequences before they make a decision, members of the public are disheartened to hear in a case that is cut and dried in terms of an offender&rsquo;s guilt that he or she got off on a technicality or with a sentence that a reasonable person would consider was far too light.</P>
        <P>Many individuals also commit crimes when out on bail, of which they have been many examples.  I heard a statistic given in this House some months ago that 24 out of 26 individuals who had committed a particular type of crime were out on bail.  The decisions in those cases were bad calls by judges.  If an individual has the capacity to commit further crimes, he or she should not be released on bail in the first instance.  This is an issue that should be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the issue of judicial salaries and he was right to do so.  While most civil servants work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., I do not know the number of hours worked by judges.  Judges work when they are not in court in that they must read up on the cases before them before they go into court.  One often hears of court cases being adjourned at, say, 12 noon until the following morning and, in those cases, I wonder do the judges go home at that time.  If they do, they are getting well paid for their work.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh also raised the issue of the Chief Justice of Ireland receiving a higher salary than the Chief Justice of the United States.  He did not elaborate on that so I do not know if the Chief Justice of Ireland works twice the number of hours worked by the Chief Justice of the United States.  However, it would seem that the Chief Justice of the United States would have a bigger hole to sit on, so to speak.</P>
        <P>Another issue that exercises me is the remission of sentences.  This should be earned.  To receive remission of one&rsquo;s sentence by virtue of the fact that one is entitled to it, so to speak, is not good enough.  Individuals who receive remission of their sentences should do so based on how they behaved during their sentences.</P>
        <P>We need to examine the subject of tribunals of inquiry.  I do not know the number of judges caught up in this mechanism.  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, was severely criticised when he decided that enough was enough and that we should see some light at the end of the tunnel with tribunals of inquiry.  I agree with him.  It was a brave thing for him to say.  It seems we are afraid to say this in case somebody says we want to get rid of tribunals of inquiry now because we are trying to hide something that may arise.  They cannot continue <i>ad nauseam</i>.  Somebody must call an end to them.  They are ten years in existence.  If they cannot conduct their work within a specified period, they should be shut down.</P>

	<P>Senator Walsh alluded to the level of payments tribunal lawyers receive.  Enough is enough.  I encourage the Minister to follow his heart and mind on this issue and set a date for the ending of the tribunals of inquiry.</P>
        <P>On that note, I welcome this amending legislation and wish it well in its passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome this Bill.  The Minister of State was right in saying it is not contentious or at least it should not be.  He was also right in pointing to the calibre and quality of judges who have served this State well down through the years.  The Bill is a reflection of societal changes we have at present.  The judicial system or judges are no more immune from those changes and pressures than any other arm of State.  For that reason it is important to take account of those changes and the debate on this area which has been raging for some considerable time.  Unfortunately, in these matters, a debate takes place only when some major incident occurs or some controversial item arises.  That is not the best way to have such a debate nor is it the best way to legislate.  At all times, we should monitor the changes in society, the level of crime, the types of crimes, the people who re-offend and the rights of victims.  There are so many issues.  It should be monitored at all times and legislation should be introduced when necessary.</P>
        <P>In this case, it is evident that we need more judges at all levels in the courts.  In a libel case against newspapers on reports about the death of Liam Lawlor, the lady bringing the case had travelled a long distance to Ireland with a full team of people.  She was expecting the court case to take place that morning, but it was not possible to do so because another case had run too long.  There is something wrong when that happens.  While it might not have been possible to have the case at a given time, it should have been foreseen that the delay was going to occur so that people would not have come under that kind of pressure and expense.</P>
        <P>I find current legal fees outrageous and there is no basis for them.  I agree with Senator Walsh that it is not enough to be aspirational about this.  I also know that confrontation will not serve any purpose, but legal fees must be examined because they can have an impact on an individual.  If a <Col N="564"/>person believed that he or she had been defamed but was not a wealthy person, the chances of his or her being able to pay the bill for a defamation action that went to the High Court would be almost nil.  There is something wrong with the legal system and there is a flaw within the democratic system that this has not been examined.  We must speak on behalf of the citizens about legal fees.  If it is essential, we should have some confrontation with the legal world.</P>
        <P>There was a time when the territory of judges was sacrosanct and one dared not make any criticism.  I believe we have gone too far in the opposite direction and there is a media onslaught after every case.  In some areas, the media is crossing the line between the presumption of innocence and the proof of guilt.  Public opinion fuelled by the media can sometimes create a coercive atmosphere for judges.  We want judges to be independent.  We want them to base their judgements on the evidence and not feel they must respond.  Many cases are horrific and there is a great deal of emotion among the public when they arise, especially cases of a sexual nature involving children.  However, it is important to ensure judges believe it is their job to be impartial in all cases.  The same situation would apply to any serious crime that arises.  It was once taboo to criticise judges, but it may now be going the other way.</P>
        <P>The judicial council<b> </b>is a brilliant idea for the citizens and for the Judiciary.  It will provide a certain insulation for judges from public and media pressure.  It is right that lay people will sit on that judicial council.  People do not want professionals examining their own because there is no independence.  Whether it be a Garda inquiry or any other inquiry, it is vital that it is transparent and accountable.  If complaints are made about judicial misbehaviour, it is important they are examined.  I say that in defence of judges as well as the judicial system.  The make-up of that council will be exceptionally important and the involvement of lay people on the council will provide a good perception of it.</P>
        <P>We should not underestimate the great progress made with the courts system.  I can remember reading local newspapers in the middle of winter years ago that quoted the District Court judge referring to the cold or other lack of convenience.  That kind of thing has largely disappeared and we can see the progress that has been made.  There was a time when local newspapers reported what judges said and these statements were often of an eccentric nature.  It was a form of local entertainment.</P>
        <P>I remember a famous case in my part of the world where an application had been made for an extension to a licence because a meal was going to be served.  The judge asked what type of meal would be provided and the hotelier answered that it would be potatoes and chicken.  When he was told how many people would be at the meal, he calculated the amount of potatoes in weight that <Col N="565"/>would be needed.  He asked the hotelier how he could boil such an amount and the hotelier told the judge that he had a four-stone pot.  The judge decided to adjourn the case until the hotelier brought the pot into the court because he wanted to tell his grandchildren that he saw one.  Is that the way we want the judicial system to operate?  In another case involving two ladies who had come before the court following a brawl, a judge criticised the feminist movement because he felt that it was turning the women of Ireland into alley cats.  That was the headline in the evening newspaper.  Many of these humorous cases do not help the system.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that we will confront the gangs.  Dreadful killings have taken place in the middle of the day and not just in Dublin.  Something must be done.  There is a feeling of helplessness that the system does not allow us to penetrate the insulation provided by the gangs.  I am glad to see that these changes will occur, not just in bail but also in the area of silence.  I know the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has come out on this issue and it is right that the council should enter the debate.  However, I would like to repeat what I said this morning when Senator Brian Hayes raised the issue of the rights of victims.  It is time we had a level playing pitch in this area.  When we argue for the criminal, we should ensure the victim is first in our minds.  Victims have not had a level playing pitch where these gangs are concerned.  Many of their victims have not been from the feuding gangs.  Innocent bystanders have been involved and it will not be long before an unfortunate garda will get caught in the middle of one of these shoot-outs.</P>
        <P>The Government and the Minister are showing courage by introducing this measure.  If we do not send out the message that what is happening is unacceptable, the gangs will feel they have immunity.  We all remember the tragic death of Veronica Guerin, God rest her soul.  We responded and we reacted at that time.  We must continue to do that in all cases.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to people out on bail.  Some people are out on bail when they commit an offence.  Unless they have a medical or other serious problem, they are not entitled to our primary consideration.  It is a serious matter when people released on bail reoffend and we must do what we can to ensure that does not arise.</P>
        <P>It was right to take the route of the family law courts and to publish Carol Coulter&rsquo;s reports.  It is important we are aware the headline is not always the reality.  Research on the family law courts shows that in general people are satisfied with the system.  I am not overly critical of the media in general because my experience is it serves a great purpose and has been exceptionally good in the area of investigative reporting.  Many of the shocking issues we have learned about would never have come to light but for the media.  However, where the family courts are concerned, I appeal to the media to ensure privacy is pro<Col N="566"/>tected.  In addition, journalists should not just highlight one bad case without indicating the progress and success that has taken place.</P>
        <P>The final issue I wish to raise relates to tribunals.  I have no axe to grind in regard to the tribunals and do not expect to be brought before one for any reason.  However, what is happening in them casts a shadow over the judicial system.  There is no due process and the characters of many have been ruined.  Whether we like it or not, the shadow is not confined within the tribunals.  I hope we can have an all-party discussion on the  issue, not to gain political points or to scaremonger, but because it is the right thing to do for the sake of justice and the judicial system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I will clarify some of the issues raised.  Senator Cummins referred to the lack of sentencing guidelines and training.  The Minister already referred to the new sentencing information system being introduced by the Courts Service.  In addition, the Judicial Studies Institute makes a valuable contribution to judicial training.  The judicial council will take over responsibility for judicial education and training and for the exchange of information among judges.  When the scheme of the judicial criminal Bill has been approved, it will be made available to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and its views will be taken into account in the drafting of the Bill.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Waterford small claims court, the issues of staffing and sittings are a matter for the Courts Service and the President of the District Court.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Courts Service. The Senator was critical of the 25% remission of sentences.  Remission is given for good behaviour in prison and if a prisoner misbehaves, he or she will not be allowed remission.  Remission is not automatic and must be earned by good behaviour.  The issue of whether the prosecution should have a role in sentencing is something we could consider and I will bring that suggestion to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Government is serious about reform in the area of legal fees.  Reform will empower consumers by making the legal services market more predictable and transparent.  As matters stand, it is difficult for people to make an informed decision on whether to take legal proceedings because of the uncertainty about legal fees.  The reforms are based on bringing legal fees into the open in order that people can shop around more.</P>
        <P>On the question of productivity, Senators may be interested to know reorganisation of the District Court boundaries to reflect changes in population is ongoing.  The objective is to ensure judges will be assigned to districts which, as far as possible, contain similar sized populations.  Cur<Col N="567"/>rently, there is a wide disparity in the populations of various District Court areas.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s comments on the need for judicial accountability.  As I said in my opening remarks, the judicial criminal Bill is being drafted and it will,<i> inter alia,</i> deal with the issue.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s comments to the attention of those drafting the Bill.  The Senator also mentioned judicial salaries.  Judicial salaries are set by reference to the recommendations of the review body on remuneration for higher public servants and the issue is a matter for that independent body.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry referred to the drugs court.  The Minister supports the drugs court project and the move to have it cover the whole Dublin area.  He expects to see the concept further extended in due course.  The Senator also spoke about drugs treatment and is, obviously, very knowledgeable on this complex area.  The issue is difficult to deal with in the context of this Bill, but I will bring her remarks to the attention of the people in the area of drug treatment.</P>
        <P>I understand the intention behind Senator Kett&rsquo;s suggestion to increase judicial numbers to a higher drawdown figure.  The issue was considered by the Department and I outlined in my opening remarks the reasons it may not operate in that manner.  It is recognised that the Oireachtas should decide the numbers on an ongoing basis.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the issue of legal fees and referred to that area earlier in my speech.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  The Government has no hesitation about increasing the judicial numbers required.  Since 2002, the number of High Court judges has been increased by seven, the number of Circuit Court judges by six and the number of District Court judges by four.  Review is not just about numbers.  The Government is of the view that court procedures must be streamlined and simplified to make the system more productive.  Much has been achieved in this regard through the use of new technology.  We must also bear in mind that additional numbers of judges increase the need for court rooms and courtroom staff.  As I outlined earlier, significant resources are now available to the Courts Service.  The establishment of the new Courts Service, as an independent agency, in 1999 has undoubtedly brought forward the entire administration of the courts service in a significant way.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am glad that everybody supports the thrust of this Bill.  We are anxious to have it passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible, signed by the President and have those new judicial appointments made.  I thank the Senators for their contribution today and for facilitating the quick passage of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as ucht an t-am a th&oacute;g&aacute;il chun an tuarasc&aacute;il seo a phl&eacute;.  Mar is gn&aacute;th, b&iacute;onn suim ag na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; a bhaineann le hoideachas.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom teacht isteach anseo.</P>
        <P>The Government has attached great priority to education and has trebled expenditure to &euro;8.4 billion.  The money has been well spent.  There are now 7,000 more primary teachers than there were when we came into office and a further 800 extra primary teachers will be employed next September.  The schools building programme continues apace, with expenditure having risen to more than &euro;540 million this year.  Capital investment in colleges of education also features in the current programme, with a major project on site in Mary Immaculate College and planned developments in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College and the Church of Ireland College, Rathmines, at a total projected cost of almost &euro;100 million.</P>
        <P>All the expenditure and activity in the education system is ultimately designed to benefit the pupils.  Central to this is ensuring that the quality of the education they receive is second to none.  While many factors influence educational outcomes, the quality of the teacher in the classroom is by far the most important.  Well-prepared, committed and motivated teachers are any education system&rsquo;s best asset.  There is no doubt that we have been blessed in this country with the quality of our teachers.  Much of our recent economic and social success is owed to those who have dedicated their careers to challenging young minds and helping them to reach their full potential.</P>
        <P>As Minister, I have always set a high value on affirming the contribution of teachers and supporting them in the work they do.  I am justifiably proud of the fact that the high quality of the Irish education system is well recognised around the world, and Irish students score very well in international assessments.  At the same time, however, I am determined to ensure that we do even better.  I am ambitious for the even greater heights we can reach and I am confident that the high priority this Government has attached to education will lead to even stronger outcomes in the future.</P>
        <P>Much of our success will continue to depend on the quality of our teachers.  We are fortunate in Ireland that the teaching profession continues to <Col N="569"/>attract high-calibre and talented young people to its ranks.  While other countries have struggled to fill places in their teacher training colleges, entry to ours remains extremely competitive.  It is important not only to attract the best people into the colleges but also to ensure that the education they receive therein prepares them well for the challenges they will face in the classroom.  The teaching practice dimension is a core element of this and I therefore believe it is crucial that the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate work with the colleges to monitor and improve continuously the effectiveness of practice in classrooms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the evaluations reported in Learning to Teach was to present an overview of existing practice and evaluate its effectiveness, and present recommendations with a view to further expanding the frontiers of improvement.  The report is based on an evaluation of the teaching of 143 final-year students from five teacher education colleges in Ireland.  This represents a sample of 10% of final-year students who were studying for a BEd degree or for a postgraduate diploma in primary teaching.</P>
        <P>The evaluation examined the work of the student teachers in the areas of planning and preparation, teaching, learning and assessment.  Students were evaluated while teaching a range of curriculum areas across all class grades, and a structured evaluation schedule was used.  Students from Hibernia College were not involved because they had not begun their final period of teaching practice when the evaluations were undertaken.  However, teaching practice evaluations were carried out with final-year students from Hibernia College in 2004, 2005 and 2006 on the same basis as the evaluations conducted with all the other colleges.</P>
        <P>The majority of student teachers, 62%, were found to be excellent, very good or good overall in their teaching.  A few over one third, 34%, were found to be fair or weak, and one in 20,<?oasys _jy ?>5%, was judged to be an ineffective practitioner.  The report also acknowledged the commitment of the colleges to enhancing the teaching practice dimension of their programmes and found that teaching practice was well organised and managed by the colleges.  It also found that the students were carefully supervised and that all the colleges had procedures for ensuring that students experiencing difficulties were supported.</P>
        <P>Consider some of the specific strengths identified in the report.  Seventy-six percent of students were rated excellent, very good, or good for planning; 70% were judged to have effectively used a good range of resources to support their teaching; 76% displayed a confident, assured presence in the classroom and communicated effectively with their pupils; and, in most instances, discipline was good and pupils respected the code of behaviour that had been agreed.</P>
        <P>The report highlighted a number of weaknesses, among which were the following: 35% of <Col N="570"/>students were rated fair or weak in the way they used teaching methods; fewer than half of the students, 41%, employed the best strategies to develop pupils&rsquo; higher-order thinking skills; and fewer than one in three, 31%, were rated excellent, very good or good in catering for individual differences in the ability and learning styles of pupils.  The evaluation concluded that more than a third of the students, 37%, were experiencing some difficulty in managing assessment practices, and a few, 3%, were considered to be ineffective in this aspect of their teaching.</P>
        <P>The report made a number of recommendations.  It proposed that the colleges provide additional exemplars of good planning practice in differentiation and integration to students.  It also recommended that they should ensure that students do not rely on an exclusively whole-class approach during teaching practice but should explore a wide range of methods to foster children&rsquo;s learning.  It was recommended that the colleges provide additional examples for students of strategies that enable pupils to collaborate during lessons and clearer examples of good practice in the area of assessment and learning.  Greater use of information and communications technology in the classroom was also encouraged.</P>
        <P>It is important to put the findings of the Learning to Teach report in context.  In all colleges, teaching practice is deemed a critical aspect of the overall teacher education programme.  College staff take seriously the fact that their student teachers should be challenged to reach the highest standards.  The inspectorate has had a role in monitoring the standards of teaching practice of final year students from the colleges of education since the foundation of the State.  While the findings of these evaluations have always been shared with the colleges concerned, individual college reports were issued for the first time in 2003-04.  Individual reports were first given to colleges where students took part in the learning to teach survey in 2005.  The report published recently represents a composite account of these reports.  Annual evaluations of a sample of students on teaching practice have since been undertaken by the inspectorate and meetings with the colleges were organised in both 2005 and 2006.  In the experience of the inspectors who conducted these evaluations, colleges have consistently sought to address issues raised in previous reports and to bring about improvements.</P>
        <P>Important initiatives have been introduced by some of the colleges to address some of the issues arising from the evaluations of teaching practice during 2003-04 which were reported in Learning to Teach and to develop a closer partnership between colleges and schools.  The greater involvement of experienced teachers in advising, supporting and supervising student teachers in their classrooms is a welcome feature of recent developments.  Following publication of the composite report, further meetings are planned to <Col N="571"/>identify and disseminate best practice across the colleges.</P>
        <P>I want to speak briefly about the dissemination of the report beyond the colleges because that issue generated a surprising amount of interest last week.  As Senators will be aware, I have been determined to make information on education available to a wider range of stakeholders.  To this end, several important reports have been published by the inspectorate in recent years.  As with the initiative to publish school inspection reports on the Department&rsquo;s website, the publication of Learning to Teach was motivated by a desire to disseminate its findings to a wider audience as part of the transparency culture I wish to promote.  This month, copies of the report were distributed to colleges of education, universities, teacher unions, parents&rsquo; organisations, management authorities and support services.  The report was also made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Contrary to unfair and ungrounded suggestions that the report was published to distract from other matters, it was issued by the inspectorate as soon as it was ready.  At no stage was the report leaked and, in fact, a newspaper report on the subject appeared one week after it had been circulated to all the aforementioned bodies.  I am fully in favour of transparency and believe that disseminating the report widely was the right thing to do.  I am glad that the report has stimulated interest in teaching practice and am confident this will help to bring about further improvements.</P>
        <P>In considering the important findings of this report with regard to teaching practice, it is important to remember this is just one part of teacher education and that the processes of probation and induction are also central.  All beginning teachers are subject to a rigorous probationary process, the professional aspects of which are managed by the inspectorate.  Inspectors visit probationary teachers during their first year in schools, advise them on their practice and provide two written reports on their progress.  Until teachers have completed the probationary process and received satisfactory reports, they do not gain full recognition status.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the probationary process, a national pilot project on teacher induction has been funded by my Department.  A core element of this project is the provision of systematic support to newly qualified teachers, thus laying the foundation for subsequent professional growth and development.  In the current school year, 167 primary schools are involved across 12 counties, with 288 newly qualified teachers and 112 mentors participating in the project.  The mentors, who are fully trained under the programme, are experienced teachers who take on the role of guiding, advising and mentoring the newly qualified teachers.  Practical issues regarding class work and teaching are also addressed.  Induction <Col N="572"/>support differs from teaching practice during initial training in that it provides on-the-job support to teachers who have been given full responsibility for teaching and learning for the first time.</P>
        <P>Initial feedback from the project is very positive, with new teachers acknowledging the supports they receive in the all-important first year of teaching.  A defining feature of the pilot project has been its emphasis on exploring the most workable model of structured induction for schools.  I am considering this project in the overall context of teacher education with a view to assessing how it can be expanded further.</P>
        <P>I am also examining the important issue of the content of the B.Ed. programme and the degree to which it equips teachers for the challenges they will face in the classroom.  During last week&rsquo;s debate on Learning to Teach, considerable comment was made about the length of the B.Ed. programme and calls were made for its extension from three to four years.  I have already indicated that I do not intend to change the duration at present because I believe that, rather than lengthening the programme, it would be far more beneficial to student teachers if the content of the existing programme were re-balanced.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the emphasis in some courses on taking academic subjects to degree level.  In one college, 50% of first year and 40% of second and third year course time is spent on two academic subjects.  The time has come to re-assess the learning outcomes required from teacher education programmes and, in this context, to review existing programmes to ensure student teachers develop the knowledge, skills and competence needed for classroom practice now and in the future.</P>
        <P>A restructuring is also needed to ensure student teachers build a solid foundation in areas such as teaching children with special needs and those whose first language is not English.  There is also scope for a greater emphasis on the effective use of information and communication technology in the classroom.  However, I am also cognisant of the caution expressed in the 2005 OECD report, Teachers Matter, with regard to lengthening teacher education programmes at the expense of induction and continuing professional development programmes.  I am of the view that well structured induction programmes, separate from but linked to initial teacher education, should be prioritised.  I also believe strongly in ensuring that teachers have access to professional development throughout their careers to enable them to respond effectively to new challenges.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council has an important role to play in defining teacher education programmes.  It has a statutory remit to review the standards of knowledge, skills and competence required for the practice of teaching and to review and accredit programmes of teacher education provided by higher education institutions in the State.  I look forward to engaging with the Teach<Col N="573"/>ing Council in progressing this work in the near future.</P>
        <P>In addition to improving teacher education, a range of other initiatives have been put in place to improve the quality of education.  I referred earlier to the publication of whole-school evaluation reports to ensure the availability of information on school quality to parents and the public.  A further 140 reports were published today, bringing the total to 600 approximately.</P>
        <P>Another example of my commitment to making information available on the quality of education, especially for parents, is the initiative on standardised tests.  As of this year, schools are required to test each child in English reading and mathematics twice during their primary school years.  A standard report card template is being developed to report each child&rsquo;s results clearly to his or her parents.</P>
        <P>Measures to address under-performance in teaching will be addressed under the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  While the agreement recognises that the majority of teachers fulfil their teaching function and professional duties well, it also acknowledges that there are, as in all professions, a small number of under-performing personnel in schools.  A new system for addressing under-performance is to be put in place by the start of the next school year.</P>
        <P>A wide range of measures have been taken in recent years to improve the quality of education in our schools.  The findings of Learning to Teach will help us to improve teaching practice in the interests of student teachers and pupils alike.  I acknowledge the dedication and diligence of the colleges of education.  The challenge is to build on the high calibre of students entering the colleges and ensure new teachers are equipped to teach all aspects of the primary school curriculum and are familiar with the teaching methods that best support pupils&rsquo; learning across the curriculum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House and thank the Leader for arranging this debate on foot of our learning last week of the report&rsquo;s launch.  The method by which many people learned about the report rang alarm bells and, despite the Minister&rsquo;s best efforts to aver otherwise, most people are clear in their minds that the leaking of the report to certain sections of the media was not the right way to present it to the partners in education.  It must be said that many aspects of the report suggest it was rushed.  A leagan Gaeilge of the report is not yet available.  Although Members have been told that the legislation introduced by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague means that all reports are translated instantly and simultaneously presented tr&iacute; leagan Gaeilge, this has not happened.</P>
        <P>There are grounds for at least being suspicious in this regard.  Most importantly, both the Minister&rsquo;s address and the report completely avoid any mention of class size and the difficulties faced <Col N="574"/>by many of the students who were assessed.  The students were teaching in class sizes that were far larger than the great aspiration to which the Minister referred previously, namely, having younger children below nine in classes of less than 20 pupils.  The Minister stated this was simply a pious aspiration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I did not.  The Senator should quote me accurately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, the Minister has done nothing since.  Although three reports have been produced in the period from 1995 to the present that have urged and demanded a proper review and assessment of the modern needs of teacher training, nothing was done by either the Department of Education of Science or successive predecessors of the Minister.</P>
        <P>When one considers the report&rsquo;s foreword by the chief inspector, Mr. Stack, as well as the inspectors who were involved in its compilation, it can be stated clearly and truthfully that none of them has ever been obliged to teach the revised curriculum in today&rsquo;s overcrowded classes.  None of them has ever been tasked with organising active learning with the numbers of children who attend today&rsquo;s classes.  None of them has ever been asked to meet the special needs of children in today&rsquo;s large classes.  None of them has ever been asked to teach the curriculum to large numbers of newcomer children who do not have English as a first language.  Such inspectors assessed the final year student teachers who were in their final weeks before qualification against that background.  It should be clear to the Minister that from the outset, there were difficulties in this regard that do not appear to have been recognised by the inspectors who compiled this report.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise such issues.  This report should be withdrawn in the best interest of all partners involved in education.  Moreover, an apology is due to some student teachers who were classified.  The method of student selection was not carried out randomly or fairly, as most people might believe.  However, the inspectorate, in consultation with the lecturers and assessors in the colleges of education, examined the students&rsquo; results.  Selections were then made in three bands, namely, excellent, good and fair.  Thereafter, the students were assigned to schools that were selected on the basis of being single sex, coeducational, disadvantaged and so on, rather than at random.  If one considers such factors, it can be see how unfair it was of these people, who are absolutely removed from the modern curriculum, to have made such assessments.</P>
        <P>It was unfair and has inflicted severe damage on young teachers&rsquo; morale.  The Minister&rsquo;s statement noted that 800 new teachers would graduate shortly.  Can she identify the percentage of the teachers graduating this year, who will qualify within a couple of months, who will be within the <Col N="575"/>5% she has mentioned and that this report highlights?  I refer to those about whom scornful remarks were made in the national newspapers.  This is not good enough.  However, it is clear that had the Minister the interests of such teachers and the quality of education they deliver genuinely in mind, she would have made greater progress in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and in providing adequate facilities for those who teach in such areas.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with the Minister on the need for reform of the practices and assessment methods employed by the colleges of education.  However, the Minister should consider another aspect of this matter to establish how unreal is this report.  It can be seen that although the student teachers teach a revised modern curriculum, those who lecture them admit to being from an era whereby they are simply not acquainted with its delivery at the coalface.  Similarly, teachers of 20 years&rsquo; experience who were asked for a genuine and fair comment on this matter would point to great difficulties.  Despite their experience, they would state that they have great difficulties in delivering this modern revised curriculum to their students.  This is not simply because of large class sizes but is also due to its content.</P>
        <P>A section of this report contains criticisms of the lack of individual tuition involved and notes the prevalence of whole class involvement.  There is also criticism of teachers in respect of the quality of education delivered.  A student teacher can enter a class of 30 to 35 pupils, whose capabilities may diverge enormously, and that may also contain children with special needs.  How can the Minister expect a teacher to deliver individual tuition in that context?  Moreover, this assessment was made by the inspectorate within a two session period.  All indications are that this report was produced to be controversial and to remove the focus of attention from the reality of the current problems facing education, over which the Minister has presided in recent years.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Although I welcome some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments, the OECD has raised certain issues.  The Minister has raised a parallel issue, namely, that primary teaching in Ireland continues to attract high calibre students, which is a source of national pride and international envy.  However, teacher education must be continually reviewed to ensure it remains of high quality.  While no one can quibble with that, the Minister now has three reports to hand within her Department.  She now claims she intends do something, will review everything and will invest money.  The Minister has mentioned money repeatedly as the be all and end all of this process.  However, education is not about money.  It is about allowing teachers the facilities to teach in an environment in which there can be absolute confidence in their work and in which teachers and pupils can benefit from such confidence without interruption.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>It has taken a long time for the Department or the Minister to introduce an element of control of indiscipline within the class.  This only came to pass last year.  The inspectors made their assessments without any reference to special needs, disadvantage and the disruption and lack of discipline in certain, if not all schools.  On that basis, how can Members be confident that this report has any worthwhile contribution to make?  I again ask the Minister to withdraw it in the best interests of morale among teaching practitioners, who have received a terrible pasting in recent years from various sections of the media and internally, from several of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors.  I refer to teachers at all levels, and not simply to primary teachers.  If the Minister is serious about this, I ask her to take urgent steps to provide immediate redress through consultation with the management of the colleges to influence the content and delivery of training.  I also ask her to bury the report or withdraw it and replace it with something real and imaginative.  The inspectorate&rsquo;s main function was to enter schools in an advisory capacity but, according to the report, its main function is to criticise.  Reference was made to 63% of colleges being excellent and so on.  Where problems have arisen, I ask the Minister to correct them as a matter of urgency before fatal damage is done.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I compliment everybody involved in the concept of partnership in education.  The teachers of Ireland, through the decades and against formidable odds, have helped to advance the cause of our society and economy.  I also compliment the inspectorate for initiating the report, although I have a number of criticisms.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of primary teacher training, which is vital, and the debate should be ongoing.  I compliment Members who raised the issue of the report on the Order of Business last week, although I was not present until Thursday.  It is important that we continue to debate this issue.</P>
        <P>For a long time education has been widely acknowledged as the key to personal development and the door to life&rsquo;s chances.  It has been universally recognised as playing a pivotal role in Ireland&rsquo;s success over the past decade.  Primary education, in particular, is the foundation stone upon which success has been built.  It is essential, therefore, that the training of primary teachers must strive for the highest standards of excellence at all times.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s spectacular track record across the spectrum of education issues during her two years in office.  She has adopted a holistic approach, which has highlighted her vision, understanding and grasp of the issues and her determination to improve primary teacher training during pre-service and the teacher&rsquo;s first year in the classroom.  The Minister has secured supports for teachers and principals, about which they comment freely and complimentarily.  Princi<Col N="577"/>pals, in particular, are very enthusiastic about the forum she has set up for them.  This highlights the Minister&rsquo;s determination that teachers should be well prepared for the reality of modern classrooms, both at primary and second level.  She has outlined a number of the initiatives she has taken and more are in the pipeline.</P>
        <P>The Learning to Teach report is based on an evaluation carried out during the 2003-04 school year when students were completing their final year of teaching practice in schools.  It was not carried out, therefore, during the Minister&rsquo;s watch and my concerns are not intended as a reflection on her successful Ministry.  On the other hand, there can be no question that the Department of Education and Science has a duty to monitor the quality of teacher training to ensure it is of a satisfactory standard and must respond at all times to the changing demands on the teaching profession.</P>
        <P>In his foreword to the report, the chief inspector sets out a perfectly reasonable and coherent rationale for the survey upon which it is based and the question of justification is fully satisfied.  The only questions that arise are the following.  Was the sample upon which the findings are based scientifically representative?  Were the assessments objective?  Was the scope of the assessments adequate?  Are the recommendations insightful and pertinent?  Other so-called issues referred to over the past week, such as the timing of the report&rsquo;s release into the public domain or the manner in which it was released, are spurious.  The report was intended to be in the public domain from the outset and it states clearly it is for publication and can be obtained from the Government Publications Office.  Any baloney and blather about that is of no relevance and only clouds the issue of the merits of the contents of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The report is significant and there was a sound rationale for its production, but the fundamental question is whether it has served its intended purpose adequately.</P>
        <P>I refer to the four legitimate areas of concern I have.  With regard to the question of whether the sample upon which the findings are based is scientifically representative, the report states on page 8: &ldquo;It was not a representative sample.&rdquo;  I would like that concern to be addressed.  The report also states on page 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">Initially all the colleges provided lists of students, the name and address of the schools where they were on teaching practice, the classes they were teaching and the contact details of the schools.  Additionally, the colleges provided either provisional teaching practice results for the school year 2003/04 or teaching practice ratings for previous years for each student.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="578"/>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That coloured the outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In other words, the assessor was given an impression of the student&rsquo;s competence prior to the conduct of the assessment.  That was prejudicial to any qualitative evaluation of the student.  This is a regrettable departure from the established and respected norms of assessment and scientific research.  If I am incorrect, I would like the Minister to outline why.  This is almost akin to giving the jury the full book of evidence before the trial begins.  I am drawing this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention because I would like it to be addressed.  The methodology used is questionable and if I am correct, what is the status of the findings?</P>
        <P>I refer to the objectivity of the assessments.  The Minister has been committed to objectivity throughout her different careers.  Apart from the impact of prior evaluation marks being known to the assessor, the process employed also seems to be suspect.  The evaluation schedules set out in appendix 1 to the report outline 43 elements of the evaluation process.  Marking is provided for on a graduated scale ranging from excellent to NE, which means no evidence of any component skill.  The report provides no evidence of agreed performance indicators to guide assessment grading.  There is also no evidence that any student had the benefit of a second opinion nor of cross-checking or cross-moderation to ensure the norms expected of each of the nine inspectors were common across the range of assessors.  That should have been a basic standard.  Were some of the assessments rushed and cursory?</P>
        <P>Lines 1 and 2 on page 8 of the report state: &ldquo;It was recognised that there were constraints on the inspectors with regard to the location and the time available for carrying out the school visits.&rdquo;  I must consider this in the context of my former career as a teacher.  Each inspector assessed three students per day.  Given that the school day for each student for the purpose of the assessment was supposed to be five hours and travel between schools must be taken into account, it is unlikely that any student had more than an hour to be assessed on 43 criteria.  Perhaps I have totally misinterpreted this, but if not I would be concerned.  If I have misinterpreted this, I would like to know in what way.</P>
        <P>I am seriously concerned about the adequacy of the assessment under these conditions.  It seems clear it was not adequate.  Apart from what seems to be the rushed nature of it in certain cases, it obviously did not focus on issues such as the socio-economic context, which is extremely important, the cultural norms of the children being taught &mdash; God knows we have dealt with that issue in various projects on the north side of this city in which INTO teachers and sociologists have been involved &mdash; and the discipline issues in the classroom.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the recommendations, which are sensible, encouraging and positive. <Col N="579"/> However, I could not find a challenging recommendation.  It is very important that we improve students&rsquo; understanding of the sociological considerations which cause some children to be highly motivated and easy to teach &mdash; I will not mention places of which I can think, as can other Members &mdash; while others are demotivated, resentful of authority and challenging to teachers.  There is an absence in that regard and that is a fundamental weakness.</P>
        <P>There is also merit in reviewing whether a student teacher should serve an apprenticeship under the guidance of a high quality practitioner.  That is my tuppence ha&rsquo;pennyworth.  I am greatly encouraged by the many initiatives in regard to the first year of teaching.  They are commendable and positive and I very much support what the Minister said.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the report reveals the startling finding that a minority of teachers show a serious lack of competence.  However, the finding is based on that questionable process.  I would be less than honest if I did not say that.  Along with her many other qualities, the Minister is a very discerning and objective person and I am sure she will treat this report as providing <i>prima facie</i> evidence that not all is well.  As distinct from Senator Ulick Burke, I would encourage the Minister towards a more thorough and comprehensive evaluation of teacher training.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the many positive, encouraging and holistic initiatives she has brought to bear on education not only at second and third level, which have been extremely impressive, but also at primary level.  The vision she has shown and the depth of understanding she has of what teaching and partnership in education are about are very commendable.  I commend her on a whole catalogue of initiatives which I do not have time to mention.  However, I am not happy with this report.  I would like clarification of the concerns I have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to comment on this report.  I fundamentally disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s view that it was unfair and ungrounded to suggest this was a diversion from other issues.  I firmly believe it was and I hope I can prove that to be the case.</P>
        <P>The issues not in the report raise questions.  The two previous speakers from both sides of the House mentioned some of the issues and I will not repeat all of them.  However, the Minister cannot ignore the points made very diligently by two professional people.  Why did the Department choose not to tell us the class size in which these student were teaching?  She had that information but somebody chose not to report it.  Surely it was unfair not to deal with it and that is grounds for suspicion.  The report is misleading and flawed.  Perhaps the Minister has not been told some of the background but this sent a ripple through the political and education system last <Col N="580"/>week.  Questions of genuine concern were raised in the House.  My colleague, Senator Quinn, raised one such question, while Senator Jim Walsh went so far as to say there were teachers in every school in Ireland who had chosen the wrong career path, although I would like to hear him back that up.  That is how far the matter went in two days.</P>
        <P>I wish to make it clear how the sample was selected.  Some 143 people were selected, a large enough sample if properly collected.  The sample was put together on the direction of the Department, which should not have been the case.  I thought there might have been practical reasons for this until I discovered that over the past couple of years the colleges of education have selected and asked the Department to accept a random selection representative of students but it refused to do so.  Surely that is unfair.  This report reflects badly on students who hope to be probated by the same people who compiled this report and on colleges of education which are dependent on the Minister to give them a grant for the next building.  Consequently, the only people who can speak freely on it are Members of this House.  There is something wrong with that and I am very upset by it.</P>
        <P>According to this report, 3% of the students should not have been in classrooms.  Should somebody not have asked how many finished up in classrooms?  It took me ten minutes to find out the failure rate in teaching practice in the colleges.  I worked out that probably none of these students ever got to a classroom.  Would it not have been important at least to have looked at that issue or to have presented that possibility to people reading this report?  There is a 2% failure rate which, out of the number of students selected, would give one almost precisely the 3% figure in the report.  That is despite the fact that 85% of students in the colleges are A or B level students and the Department and the inspectorate know this.  A random sample should have reflected that.  However, the Department insisted on three one thirds.  If students had been selected at random, 113 students selected would have been A or B level students and one could not possibly have got these skewed results.  This is wrong.</P>
        <P>While the damage has been done, I would like the report rewritten and the additional information, about which I spoke, included in it.  I very much support the idea of a monitoring system but why did we not see a report last week in regard to what is happening at post primary level?  I would have to come to the conclusion that there is no action in regard to class size at that level at present and no need for a distraction.  That is another reason I came to the conclusion I did &mdash; rightly or wrongly.  At least one can see there is a logical process to my thinking.</P>
        <P>What happened to these students assessed in the classroom?  In some of the colleges, they received ten months of further study dealing with the issues before they got to a classroom.  If these <Col N="581"/>students were so bad, what happened to them when they went into the classrooms?  These selfsame inspectors who wrote this report met them in the classroom and very unfairly applied the same criteria as they did originally.  It is completely skewed to use the same criteria to assess student teachers as one would use to assess teachers.  One would not do that to doctors or to anybody else.  That was wrong and very flawed by any standard.</P>
        <P>The students were met by these selfsame inspectors.  It took me five minutes to find out that 95% of that cohort of teachers were probated by the same inspectors in their first year of teaching.  Perhaps half the remaining 5% were people whom the inspector did not have a chance to inspect.  That would mean that approximately 2% only were not probated in their first year.  As far as I know, they were all probated in their second year, although I cannot be sure about that because I did not get the information.  One can see why we are deeply suspicious about this.</P>
        <P>This information did not come out in the report.  On four occasions, the Minister mentioned her commitment to information.  We did not have the information and had to look for it.  That information, which is germane to our discussion, was not available to enable us to give a fair reflection of what the students and colleges are doing.  I would be the first to support the Minister if she found something in the education system which needed to be corrected.  If this report had revealed something which needed to be corrected I would have stood by her, but it revealed nothing.</P>
        <P>The Minister raised a valid point about the percentage between liberal arts and education subjects in the colleges.  As we know, it varies between 40% to 60% or two thirds to one third.  A critical mass of knowledge and academic subject study as opposed to education study are required by teachers to give them confidence and understanding.  The Minister cannot change that critical mass.  It has to be there.  There is only one way to have the balance which the Minister discussed and it is an easy bit of maths.  It is a four year course.</P>
        <P>I cannot sit here and listen to the Minister discussing a reduction in the standard of academic study.  I do not want teachers to be less academically advanced.  I could not live with it.  Allow them to reach the same level but give them a fourth year and they will have everything.  It would provide more education time with which I agree.  I am sure the Minister knows I supported a fourth year for many years and did so at a time when many of those in favour of it now were opposed to it.  I always thought it was important and had to be done.</P>
        <P>Teachers state the students in the report were in classes of more than 30 and 85% of them were in classes greater than what was promised when they started in their colleges of education.  These are realities.  I am not making this up.  It is what <Col N="582"/>teachers state and it is why people jump to conclusions.  It would be helpful if the Minister simply took the report back and rewrote it to provide all the information.  I support the idea of this being done every year.  In future, a commitment should be given that it will be done through a properly randomised sample.</P>
        <P>The Minister may not be told that the Department of Finance is always critical of the fact that 85% of students graduate from colleges of education with honours degrees and it costs the State money.  The same people who make this statement then turn around and state somehow there is a problem with teachers going into classrooms.  If there is a problem let us deal with it.  However, the report does not indicate a problem.</P>
        <P>The report is demoralising for young teachers and the colleges of education and it undermines the trust and confidence of politicians.  During the past week, I spoke to people here from both sides who asked me about the report with a genuine interest.  They wanted to know what it is about and how bad it is.  They were concerned, apart from Senator Jim Walsh who was ready to use the opportunity to have a go at teachers.</P>

	<P>Otherwise, everybody else wanted to get to the bottom of it.  Let us do so.  I ask the Minister to pull back the report.  It will allow us to deal with the issue of class size.  Why cannot the Government give a commitment on future class sizes and take the steam out of this?  If it will be done let us hear how.  Provide trust and confidence and let people plan for next year if it is put in place.</P>

        <P>This report should be withdrawn, rewritten and amended with all the information which both sides of the House ask for this evening.  A commitment should be given that in future it will done through randomised sample.  The Minister should give a commitment on how she will introduce class sizes of 20.  A group of people should be established to advise the Minister on the fourth year.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and I was a student.  I taught in my other profession.  Legitimate concerns were raised in some of what I heard this evening.  However, in all walks of life assessment which allows one to build on one&rsquo;s strengths and work on one&rsquo;s weaknesses must be welcomed.  We can talk about semantics, we can change methodology and we can reduce from 76% to 72% and up 34% but we will not get away from the core point which is that we have strengths and weaknesses.  Weaknesses were in the design and if the methodology has to be changed in compiling the next report let us change it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it does not get away from the basic findings of this report.  I, as a non-teacher but as a parent and a teacher, have seen fantastic teachers and horrific teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The report is wrong.  That is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The bottom line is that we have a problem and the Minister, her Department and officials must put forward proposals to deal with it.  In-house reports and under the table reports seen by selective vested interest groups achieve very little.  It is only when they come out in the public domain that we get real action and I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not get any action.</P>

	<P>Her timing was perfect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving my opinion and Senators Ulick Burke and O&rsquo;Toole do not have to agree with it.  I certainly know Senator Ulick Burke will not agree with it but that is regardless.</P>
        <P>During the past ten or 15 years, the educational system has seen major challenges and changes.  We all acknowledge that.  We had social changes which affect every family in the country.  We have multiculturalism, different nationalities in classes, special needs and integration.  These are major challenges for any one profession to cope with.  We responded quite well in dealing with it.  More challenges are ahead and we must yet go full circle.</P>
        <P>Regarding the academic standard of a teacher, one can be a brilliant academic but not necessarily good at imparting that knowledge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must look at the balance, particularly in training colleges, and ensure that academia is not the be-all and end-all.  I would prefer somebody who is not as well-qualified academically but is far better in communicating the <Col N="584"/>skills at a lower level to the students.  The teaching profession must question and face up to how in the past teachers who did not perform were protected.  Teachers were carried within the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>And soldiers and politicians.  They are everywhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  However, we discuss other professions often enough.  This evening we will talk about the teaching profession.  If weak teachers are being carried, we must look at them not only at student level but we must have ongoing assessment throughout their careers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the findings of the report, one of the issues mentioned is that of class sizes.  It is fair to ask the Minister what was the size of the class on which the students were assessed.  On the general principle of class size I wish to make a number of points.  The average class size in 1996-97 was 27.  It is now 24.  The pupil-teacher ratio in 1996-97 was 22.  It is now 17.  The percentage of pupils in classes of more than 30 was 41.8% in 1996-97.  It is now 25.1%.  The percentage of pupils in classes of more than 35 was 11.4% in 1996-97.  It is now 2.2%.  We are heading in the right direction and we have 4,000 more primary school teachers than we had in 2002.  I can go through all of the figures.</P>
        <P>The Minister has correctly directed resources to the areas in which they were most needed, namely, disadvantage, special needs and language skills.  Plans are afoot to recruit 800 more teachers.  My understanding is that 500 will be targeted into special areas and 300 into main classes.  Schools have also decided within their own remit to at times allocate teachers to younger children at a lower pupil-teacher ratio than more senior classes.  Overall, the pupil-teacher ratio has come down and will reduce further despite all the new challenges faced by the Minister in recent years.</P>
        <P>We must welcome and work on this report.  I do not support the calls for it to be withdrawn or the arguments that because of the sensitivities of certain people, they would be unhappy or offended in some way because questions are suddenly being asked about their profession and how it is taught.  People have much to learn, including those in training colleges, students, we as politicians&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The inspectorate may have something to learn from it.</P>
        <P>We should not be dismissive of a report we can learn from just because people are getting hyper-sensitive.  I firmly believe the area of teacher training must have a greater emphasis, in the <Col N="585"/>modern society in which we live, on how teaching skills are communicated and knowledge is imparted rather than academia.  I would like to see some redressing of the balance in their education syllabus in that regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to this report and that we are taking on board self-criticism.  This is no harm and it is the only way we will improve.  Such improvement will be to the benefit of all the students in the country and the teaching profession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to welcome the Minister but as she is leaving I will welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  Senator Minihan is not a teacher and neither am I, so I respect the views expressed here by those who were teachers.  I also respect that they would have much more knowledge of this issue than I do.  I have some knowledge as I worked for some time as a substitute, or unqualified, teacher.  Such teachers are often berated by others but I filled a need in schools which badly needed a teacher, even if it was just a supervisory capacity.  I would like to think I did much more than that.</P>
        <P>As with every profession, there will be good and bad.  There would be excellent teachers and good teachers, as I would not like to state there are bad teachers.  There may be weak or underperforming teachers.  The majority are very hard working and excellent teachers.</P>
        <P>Those in our training colleges today aspire to be excellent teachers in future but this report will do nothing for their confidence.  I have concerns similar to those others expressed this evening about how this report was put together, the evaluation and the assessment carried out on these student teachers.  I have questions as to how the ground rules were set down as it is clear a level playing field was not set out.</P>
        <P>The student teachers were all in different types of schools and on a particular day they would have had different problems depending on class size, behaviour of students and children&rsquo;s use of the English language.  We know that to be a major problem in many schools currently, where so many children do not have English as their first language.  There are also children with special needs.  Every student teacher was in a different situation so we are not getting an accurate picture of how each teacher performed across different levels.</P>
        <P>One of the problems with teacher training as it stands is that trainees are not getting enough practical experience.  My son is a qualified teacher who did one year of training, or more accurately nine months, as a postgraduate student in Glasgow.  Half of his time there was spent in the classroom, and he probably spent more time in the classroom during that period than the average trainee teacher does in Ireland over the course of three years.  This should be considered and I know the Minister has indicated she wishes to look at whether student teachers should be given <Col N="586"/>more practical teaching experience.  I believe they should.</P>
        <P>Every one of us would improve as we have more practice at whatever we do.  To judge a student teacher on a hour or two hours of a performance on any one day, given the problems that can arise within the classroom, is totally unfair.  There should be an ongoing assessment involving the class teacher and principal.  We should improve this area and I would have liked to have seen recommendations relating to the amount of teaching practice student teachers get and the involvement of the teacher within the classroom and the school principal.  This is the process in Glasgow, where the teacher and principal must give a report on how the student has fared throughout a six-week period at the school.</P>
        <P>To come out with such an assessment over a longer period would be a much more valid evaluation of how student teachers are doing.  The way this report is done gives a very unfair picture of how student teachers are.  I agree with Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s comments that this report should be withdrawn or at least revised to give a more accurate picture of how people perform.  Instead of knocking people&rsquo;s confidence coming towards the end of the training programme, we should be trying to inspire them and ensure that these people will do the most important job anybody can, namely, educate our young people.</P>
        <P>This is an unfair assessment of those student teachers.  We will of course have excellent and good teachers; we would have such people in every profession.  Some will have better skills than others and even within the classroom some teachers will be good at mathematics and others will be very good with computers.  The issue should be expanded and at the very least, the report should be revised.</P>
        <P>I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance of many of the cases and points raised here tonight instead of a defence of a report which is indefensible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I must declare that I am not a primary school teacher.  Hence, my knowledge of teacher colleges and teaching programmes is not in-depth.  However, I came from a teaching background, as my father taught in the multigrade system.  I have often maintained that what matters is not the numbers in a classroom but how good is the teacher.  The five pupils in a classroom with a bad teacher could get bad results whereas the 20-30 pupils in a classroom with a good teacher&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Few have just 20 pupils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Better than anyone, the Senator knows what I am talking about.  He has experience of 30-35 pupils in a classroom, good teachers and good discipline.  I am not too worried about <Col N="587"/>class sizes, as the numbers are reducing.  If a teacher is good enough, the system works.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not seem to be worried about it either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report in so far as it gives us an opportunity to discuss the matter.  It has strengths and weaknesses and the Minister has acknowledged the latter, but why should we throw out the dirty water until we have the clean inside?  We should examine what we have and determine how to improve the system.  If we must, let us criticise the report, but let us not throw it out.  Everything written should be analysed and revised.  This report is concerned with determining the degree to which we can review teaching practices in colleges and has some positive aspects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently, I received a telephone call from a young teacher who had just concluded her training at Mary Immaculate College.  During her teacher practice, she had a bad experience with her inspector in that her assessment was not good.  Consequently, she only passed and did not get an honours degree, which will have an impact on her salary.  However, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Drumcondra, one is not required to get an honour in one&rsquo;s teaching practise to get an honours degree.  If one gets an honours degree, one will be paid a higher salary.</P>
        <P>Something is not right in Mary Immaculate College&rsquo;s procedure.  I would have thought that all teacher training colleges would have the same standards and criteria for work experience assessments.  I do not know enough details, but why are there different standards in the two training colleges?  While I did not read through the report in detail, I looked through it to find an answer to my question.  The situation is unfair to the Mary Immaculate College student.  Will I be given a reply on this matter?</P>
        <P>The system has changed, but the teacher colleges have not taken single grade classes, Irish medium schools and children with disabilities into account.  Schools are facing increasing levels of complexity in terms of different ethnic and social backgrounds and the new school curriculum.  I searched for this topic in the report, but I found no answer as to whether the colleges cater for the issue.  Is this fair on a young teacher who goes into a classroom without knowing the structure of the school, the principal or the class teacher or without enough understanding of the school&rsquo;s environment, namely, is it urban or rural?</P>
        <P>Would it not be better to lengthen the probationary period?  Once teachers receive their final qualifications, they should be assessed during the ensuing probationary year.  Is this not the fourth year in question, namely, three years in college followed by a probationary year?  I do not know enough about the matter, but I listened to the debate.  The Minister is against increasing the <Col N="588"/>duration to four years whereas some speakers were for the measure, but am I missing the point?  It was not raised in the report but perhaps we should examine it.</P>
        <P>How do colleges organise the school network?  Is there a structure?  I did not get a feel for this matter in the report, but it seems haphazard.  I would like a more formal structure wherein St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, for example, would have a network of schools so that the new teacher would have time to familiarise himself or herself with the class teacher, the school&rsquo;s structure, the students&rsquo; backgrounds, the parents and so on.  Given that it would help teaching, the network would be important.  Apart from the learning process and connecting with the class, there is more to teaching than going into classrooms, using computers and so on.  It receives greater holistic consideration than it did 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report and the changes that must be introduced.  There are many weaknesses, but I congratulate the Minister for moving the matter forward.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>I am tired of negativity.  Let us be positive and determine what good can be done through the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I also welcome the report and the opportunity to speak on it.  Other speakers referred to whether they were teachers, but I was not a teacher until last year when I became an adjunct professor at the National University of Ireland, Galway.  I have declared that I am a teacher, albeit not a secondary teacher.</P>
        <P>Last year, I was in South America.  It is interesting that at the end of the Second World War, the middle class people of Uruguay wanted to educate their children and went around the world to find a good education system.  They found Ireland and brought its Christian Brothers to Uruguay to teach their children.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the quality of Irish teachers and education.  That quality is high and I was supported by Senators Ulick Burke and Fitzgerald when I sought a debate on the report last week in an effort to maintain the quality.  I am pleased to discover that a personal belief of mine is shared by the OECD, which stated that the quality of teachers is the most important determinant in the achievement of pupils.  I have always referred to it as teachers being the linchpin of education from pre-school to university level.</P><Col N="589"/>
        <P>If one talks to a person about his or her school days, what he or she will remember is the influence of a particular teacher.  I have vivid memories of very good teachers and, perhaps, others as well.  My belief in the central role of teachers was reinforced by my experience as chairman of the steering committee on the development of the leaving certificate applied, about ten years ago.  We on that committee could huff and puff all we liked, but the real determinant of whether the new approach would work was the approach to be taken by the teachers at the chalkface.  They were the ones with responsibility to implement change, and the quality of the end-result depended entirely on the quality of their input.  Any success the leaving certificate applied has had, is due entirely to them.</P>
        <P>The reason I was in South America was to talk about the Celtic tiger and relay the reasons for Irish economic success.  In all my researches I found the prime overall determinant was education.  For many years we had invested in education and in so far as I can see the Government is increasing that investment to a considerable extent.</P>
        <P>In this country we have a tremendous respect for education, for what it can do for us both individually and as a contributor to our economic development.  Unfortunately, we do not have an equivalent respect for teachers, and I think that this is a very bad thing indeed.  It may be thought romantic and nostalgic to hark back to the days of the hedge schools, when the teacher was respected as one of the pillars of the community, but I do not believe this to be the case any longer.  If we want to have the best teachers, then we must respect them and accord them the rewards and status that is their due.  That is the first essential requirement for getting the best teachers to work for us.  In making this point I may sound like a propagandist for my colleague, Senator OToole, but I believe that my view is all the more compelling because it comes from outside the profession, and is totally free of any vested interest.</P>
        <P>Having nailed my colours to the mast, let me express the hope that this debate will not turn into an exercise in teacher bashing.  Let us use this very valuable report to learn some lessons that will have the end result of improving the quality of our education system.  Teaching is a demanding profession, and there should be no place in it for those who are not capable of meeting those demands.  Just as we all can remember those exceptional teachers who influenced the rest of our lives, we can also recall instances in which a teacher was clearly not up to the job.  If we really believe what the OECD says when it argues that teacher quality is the most important determinant of a pupil&rsquo;s achievement, we would take very good care indeed to ensure that inadequate teachers are removed from a situation in which they can cause lifelong damage and underperformance in their pupils.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>Teaching is more than a profession, it is a vocation, like being a doctor, a priest or an actor.  In all these vocations, academic achievement is an important prerequisite, but it is not enough on its own.  There must also be that special spark that joins together the person and the task.  Either that spark is there or it is not.   Without it one cannot excel.</P>
        <P>Having made the teaching profession sufficiently attractive to bring in the best people, our first task should be to ensure that only those with that special spark are allowed in.  This is the first area where we could usefully have some change.  At present all entrants to the teaching profession are high academic achievers, but that is the only criterion by which we assess them.  We do nothing to ensure they have the spark, and I believe that we should.  Teaching is one of those professions where we should have an aptitude as well as an academic test.  Aptitude tests may have their shortcomings, but they are better than nothing.  In the case of medicine this is being clearly talked about in recent times.  It is not just a question of whether one has got good marks in the leaving certificate, but rather a matter of whether one has the aptitude.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This research shows that a significant number of student teachers in their final year of training were not up to the job.  That could be due to a fault in the way they have been trained, or it could be an indication that some at least of them lack the necessary spark to become successful teachers in the first place.  My point is that under the present system we simply do not know the cause &mdash; whether it is with the students, teachers or the way that they are taught.</P>
        <P>The reality is probably that it is a combination of both.  Given that we make no attempt whatever to assess students&rsquo; aptitude before admitting them to a teaching course, it is inevitable that some people without a true vocation will slip through.  On the other hand, I find it hard to believe that the number without a vocation could be as high as the number of students the inspectors found to be producing unsatisfactory results.  Therefore, the training they get must also be capable of improvement.</P>
        <P>There are two ways in which to deal with the issue revealed by the report.  First, we owe it to everybody concerned to make an effort to weed out from the student cohort at the outset those who do not have the exceptional capabilities that it takes to make a good teacher.  In assessing student teachers for basic suitability, we must look beyond their results in the leaving certificate.  Second, we must put pressure on the teaching colleges, in two ways.  First, we must encourage them to constantly review their training methods so that they match the true needs of the profession.  Second, we should require them to fail students who do not reach a high level of competence in the problem areas the inspectorate has identified in this report.  It is a good report and should not be hidden as it is very valuable. <Col N="591"/> However, it will not serve its purpose unless we act on it.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s debate has been very useful, I am sure, from the Minister&rsquo;s viewpoint.  I urge her to listen to what has been said today, to read the report seriously and to react to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for the lively contributions we have heard during this debate.  There is always a very high standard of debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. </P>
        <P>It is clear that the quality of our education system is as close to the heart of many Senators as it is to the Department of Education and Science.  Maintaining quality and ensuring the best educational outcomes for our children is central to what we have been debating this evening.  The issues raised, from class size, the high calibre of students going into teaching, the quality of work in the classroom in catering for pupils from diverse cultures and backgrounds and integrating children with special needs are all core issues that the Department has been prioritising for some time.</P>
        <P>As has been stated, the level of Government expenditure on education has trebled in the last ten years.  Today we spend &euro;8.4 billion on education.  A particular focus of this expenditure in recent years has been to offset the effects of disadvantage at primary and second level.  Almost 50,000 pupils in schools in disadvantaged areas are now in classes of reduced size.  This year nearly &euro;730 million will be spent on tacking disadvantage and a further &euro;820 million will be spent on educational provision for pupils with special needs.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure this level of expenditure is spent wisely and that the ultimate beneficiaries are the pupils.</P>
        <P>While some may criticise the Government for not meeting the target on class sizes outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government, we make no apology for the decision to prioritise resource allocation to pupils with special educational needs, those in disadvantaged communities and those who need help with their English.  Now that these priorities have been largely addressed, extra teachers are being provided in the current and 2007-08 school years to reduce class sizes in primary schools.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Provision was made in the 2006 Estimates for extra teachers to reduce class sizes in this school year and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen is committed to doing so again in 2007.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government firmly believes that the benefits accruing from the re-targeting <Col N="592"/>of resources towards the most vulnerable pupils outweighed a general reduction in class sizes in the first instance.</P>
        <P>My Department is conscious of its responsibilities with regard to quality in the system.  Every year evaluations are carried out in a range of educational settings and now whole school evaluation reports are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Additionally, a number of composite reports have been published on the thematic evaluations carried out by the inspectorate.  Previous publications aimed at the primary sector examined literacy and numeracy in some disadvantaged primary schools, the impact of school development planning on pupil learning and how primary school curriculum subjects are being implemented.</P>
        <P>The reports are published to inform a wider audience about the quality of the education system and also to promote professional debate and dialogue with a view to bringing about further improvement.  The report we are discussing Learning to Teach examined student teacher progress during their final period of teaching practice in primary schools.  Teaching practice is a core element in initial teacher education because it focuses on real work in classrooms.  During teaching practice students have an opportunity to bring theory and practice together and to experience being in a class of children perhaps for the first time since they were pupils in primary school.</P>
        <P>It is an intensely challenging time for student teachers and the final grade ultimately awarded by their college depends to a great extent on how well they do in the classroom.  The inspectorate in my Department has worked for many years with the colleges to monitor the standards of teaching practice in schools with a view to ensuring that the high level of achievement is maintained.  The inspectorate has considerable experience in this area as every other year inspectors work with newly qualified teachers during the probationary period.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am conscious that it is now 7 p.m. and that a number of questions were asked during the debate.  The questions will be taken on board and I am sure that the Minister will respond in due course in the context of forthcoming debates on education.  We have had a good debate.  The quality of debate in the Seanad is always impressive and I say that as a former Senator.  Education is a very important subject and close to the heart of Senators and that was demonstrated here this evening.  I look forward to ongoing debate on all these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter I wish to raise involves heritage and tourism.  It is the condition of and particularly the access problems relating to the Swiss Cottage at Cahir in County Tipperary.  It is an historic place.  It was originally built by the Butlers of Cahir who were my maternal family&rsquo;s sworn enemy.  Therefore, it is remarkably altruistic of me to take up the cudgels in defence of their architectural remains.  </P>
        <P>It is a rather beautiful structure.  The Minister of State is aware of the place, although like myself, it may be a number of years since he has been there.  It is a classic 19th century folly and has all the feeling and the appeal of a Hansel and Gretel cottage buried in the woods.  It is an extensive place and the Lord Butler of the period used to reside in it occasionally and also use it as a hunting and fishing lodge.  There is still a great deal of fishing done around that area.</P>
        <P>For a number of years up until about 1980 it was in a rather sorry condition and continuing to decay, a process that was aided by various sporadic acts of vandalism.  During the 1980s a group of dedicated individuals and organisations got together and lovingly restored it, allowing it to be opened to the public in 1989.  It subsequently quickly became one of the most popular heritage sites in Ireland.  A system of guides was introduced and so on.</P>
        <P>The principal approach to the cottage is across a bridge over the River Suir.  This provides access from the car park to the cottage.  The bridge needs extensive repair apparently and as a result a decision has been made to close the site for an indefinite period.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the provision of alternative access to the cottage.  There is temporary access.  There are two options.  One was suggested by Senator Mansergh from the Government benches in a letter to the Minister in regard to providing a temporary bridge to the cottage.  The other alternative is the resurfacing and adequate maintenance of the right of way from the Clogheen Road.  A temporary hard surface on the large flat field behind the toilets would also provide reasonable car parkage.</P>
        <P>I put the point rhetorically that if there were a difficulty of access to another major site such as Newgrange or the Rock of Cashel, would the response of the authorities be simply to say &ldquo;Fine, close it off for a period of a year&rdquo;.  If access to this site is not addressed by either of the two methods I suggested, or another alternative that the Minister of State can suggest, it will be certainly closed for a year and there may be a recurrence of the vandalism that occurred during the 1980s, as a result of which the cottage was very nearly lost.  The Minister of State will be aware of <Col N="594"/>a number of instances where historic buildings were destroyed by fires.  In the 1920s it was deliberate.  Subsequently a number of houses of architectural significance were lost through accident fire, Rockingham House, being a classic example.</P>
        <P>With regard to the importance of these sites of architectural heritage, this is not a great house, but it is the kind of an appurtenance of that kind of lifestyle.  The tragedy is that in 1918 there were about 1,500 of these architecturally important houses in Ireland but that number is now reduced to 30, which represents an absolutely catastrophic decline.  That highlights the need to take great care of them.</P>
        <P>The car park to this site is accessed through the Cahir Park forest and it is simply a clearing in the wood, situated in an isolated areas about five minutes walk from the cottage.  The walk to the site is also through a densely wooded area.  Therefore, it is quite remote and people might feel vulnerable there, particularly as there have been a series of incidents of vandalism against cars parked there either by officials or by tourists over the years.  This is very regrettable because it indicates the degree to which people are vulnerable there.</P>
        <P>Representations were made by some of the guides to the OPW regarding the position, health and safety issue on site, the provision of safe car parking and so on to which, I am told, they got a pretty dusty answer.  They were told by somebody from OPW to get off the Minister&rsquo;s property or their cars would be removed.  They were also informed subsequently by a senior civil servant of the OPW head office that the reason the OPW does not want them park in the only relatively safe area near the work entrance is that in his opinion once the guides cross the bridge, they are then on council property and the OPW is no longer responsible for their safe access to and egress from work.  In other words, it is a kind of demarcating dispute.  I gather there is a fair amount of red tape flying around.  It took ages to get even a lick on the bridge because there was an argy-bargy about who was responsible, who had to pay for the paint, who provided the brushes and the usual old nonsense.</P>
        <P>Since then there has been a kind of threatened position whereby it was possible that the bridge would be closed and a letter dated 20 September 2005 was sent, which states, if there is a consensus that the car park is not suitable or safe to use, then it may be necessary to close the site to the public and consider the options for the future for future access.  In other words, the fact that the guides complained about the vulnerability of the car park, the response of the officials was that if guides do not like the car park, the OPW will close the site.  That is an odd way to behave.  Last year the OPW refused to open the site on 2 March as scheduled.  It also refused to offer contracts until people signed a parking form.  Another contract was produced at a meeting on 12 April between the guides, union officials and <Col N="595"/>representatives of the OPW.  They were told that contracts would not be issued unless the guides agreed to whatever proposals were put to them before they even knew what they were.  If that is an accurate summary of the situation, it is daft.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister of State, I come from a good midlands agricultural background.  My grandfather was a farmer.  He was a fairly improvident man who lived the life of what he thought was a gentleman farmer, but I doubt if even he would have bought that kind of pig in a poke.  It is just not done as country people are a little bit cuter than that.</P>
        <P>The cottage was closed on 9 November 2006, ten days ahead of schedule, as the bridge was damaged according to the OPW.  There is no visual evidence of damage, but I understand that the decking may be taken off due to some kind of structural difficulty.  That is a great pity.  I ask the Minister of State to give some kind of undertaking that this greatly cherished site will be made available to the public as soon as possible, and that the building be safeguarded against the possibility of vandalism.  I also ask that the welfare, the safety and the jobs of the excellent professional guides be safeguarded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address the House on the subject of the Swiss Cottage in Cahir, County Tipperary.  The Swiss Cottage may be without peer in the realm of fantasy, but it also has few equals in the field of architectural history.  It is rightly considered to be among the finest examples surviving of the ornamental cottage.  In this context, and as one of the more renowned garden or landscape buildings in the country, the Swiss Cottage stands proudly alongside the Casino at Marino, a site also in the care of the Office of Public Works, as a very fine example of a sophisticated garden building.</P>
        <P>Situated near Cahir, the Swiss Cottage was constructed in the early years of the 19th century as a fanciful realisation of an idealised countryside cottage.  Built by Richard Butler, the 12th Lord Cahir, it was intended as an occasional residence <Col N="596"/>and as a backdrop of a more unusual character for entertainment.  Its conception was perhaps not without certain modesty, but its realisation was spectacular.  In 1989 the cottage was presented to the Irish nation and since the early 1990s has been part of the portfolio of heritage sites presented to the public by the Office of Public Works.  Today, the cottage stands as a testament to the many figures involved in its renovation, to its designer, and to the family responsible for its erection, the Butlers of Cahir.</P>
        <P>Public access to the Swiss Cottage is by way of a bridge across the River Suir.  In recent times, the condition of this bridge has, on visual inspection, given cause for concern.  In late 2006, a consultant engineer was appointed by the Office of Public Works to carry out an assessment of the bridge and to make recommendations on its structural condition and the level of work required.  Early in this assessment process, the engineer reported that the bridge was in dangerous condition and recommended that access to it be limited pending his full inspection and report.  At that stage, access by motor vehicles was restricted.</P>
        <P>When it was received at the beginning of 2007, the engineer&rsquo;s full report underlined the dangerous condition of the bridge, highlighted the ongoing erosion of its structural members and recommended repair as a matter of urgency.  Based on these recommendations, the Office of Public Works acted swiftly to request the preparation of the necessary tender documents for the repair of the bridge.  These documents are scheduled to be complete by the week beginning 12 March 2007.  At that point, tenders will be invited immediately with a view to the necessary repair work being commenced at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>The first step in the works programme will involve the removal of the deck of the bridge, which is in an unstable condition.  With the necessity to remove the deck, the closure of the bridge is absolutely essential.  For both practical operational reasons and for health and safety, the removal of the deck must take place when the river is at its lowest.  Unfortunately this period happens to be when the site is normally open to the public as part of the Heritage Sites of Ireland programme operated by the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>In this context, an alternative access to allow the cottage to remain open was examined.  The only alternative access on the cottage side of the river is a private road which is in poor condition.  While the Office of Public Works has a right of way over this road, for works purposes this does not extend to public access.  This roadway is not suitable for cars and there are no parking facilities in the area close to the Cottage.  In addition the roadway would also provide the only access to the site for emergency services should they be required.  The advice available suggests that the roadway would not be suitable for an ambulance. <Col N="597"/> The question of providing an alternative temporary bridge was also considered, but given the extent of the work required on either side of the river bank in repairing the existing bridge, it is felt that this option is not feasible from a health and safety perspective.</P>
        <P>I am very hopeful that all of the necessary work to repair the bridge at the Swiss Cottage can be completed during the course of 2007.  It is regretful that such a magnificent site will not be available to the public this year but the dangerous condition of the only public access to the site means that there is no other choice but to close it to the public.  The period of its closure will used by the Office of Public Works to bring forward its plans to re-thatch the building, work originally pencilled in for 2008, thereby minimising further possible disruption in the future.  In the meantime, visitors to the Cahir area can still visit the magnificent Cahir Castle, which attracts in excess of 60,000 each year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  It is no consolation to the people in the Swiss Cottage that they can visit Cahir Castle, as they can do that any time.  The Minister of State also referred to the Casino at Marino, but that is a disaster.  Architecturally it is beautiful, but there has been a complete lack of respect for the surroundings and the permission granted for buildings all over the place is scandalous in European terms.  I am afraid that the Casino is not the best example.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State prepared to listen to the guides who might offer a view on the idea of maintaining some limited degree of accessibility to the public?  If they came to Dublin, could they meet him for a quarter of an hour.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I congratulate him on his appointment and I wish him well.</P>
        <P>There is great disquiet in Waterford that Waterford City VEC may have to axe many adult and community education classes.  The news has sparked outrage and disappointment, especially among many senior citizens, who are dismayed at the suggested discontinuation of some of the classes, such as languages, arts, crafts and computers.  We should surely be encouraging people, especially our senior citizens, to broaden their horizons by updating their skills.  After all, they created this Celtic tiger of ours.  These classes are of great importance to older people.  The Department of Health and Children has been emphasising the need for older people to keep active as long as possible, yet the Department of Education and Science is not providing sufficient funding for older people to continue further education.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>The adult education centre runs 100 classes and caters for over 1,400 people annually.  The budget is a mere &euro;130,000, which is a pittance when one considers the benefits that people accrue from these classes.  Senior citizens, refugees and members of the travelling community are among some of the diverse groups that attend the centre, and they derive great satisfaction from their courses.  It would be a travesty of justice if these people were to lose out because of the lack of funding, which is not a major amount.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that sufficient funds are granted to Waterford City VEC to allow the continuation of these classes.</P>
        <P>I have been inundated with letters from senior citizens.  In the most recent, which I received today, the writer said that at the class of 21 February the manager of the centre advised that unless there was a significant increase in the centre&rsquo;s funding for 2007 &mdash; apparently the centre has not yet been advised of its allocation for 2007 &mdash; the adult education centre could not continue to provide the number of classes currently provided and some classes would have to be axed.  No decision had yet been made on which classes would be axed.</P>
        <P>This is the problem faced by adult learners and it is a matter of grave disquiet for them and all people using the centre.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for raising this matter, as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position with regard to the funding of community education through the VEC sector.  The adult and further education services, including the community education service, are, for the most part, funded by the Department and delivered locally by the vocational education committees.  It is open to the groups involved in the non-formal education sector to submit applications to their local VECs for funding for their activities.</P>
        <P>Community education refers to education and learning, generally outside the formal education sector, with the aims of enhancing learning, empowerment and contributing to civic society.  It is firmly community-based, with local groups taking responsibility for and playing a key role in organising courses and deciding on programme content.  The grants provided by the Department to the VECs are to enable disadvantaged adults to avail of community education at minimal or no cost.  This is usually allocated through the provision of teaching hours or small grants to a range of community and voluntary groups for educational activities.</P>
        <P>The importance of community education lies in the way it extends and deepens the democratic process and can successfully engage those who are most excluded in our society.  Community education at its best is concerned to overcome the <Col N="599"/>constraints that limit the potential to participate.  It aims to develop the capacity of the more marginalised sectors in the community to participate both in decision making and in the general social and cultural life of society.  For that reason, Ministers for Education and Science over the past ten years have sought to develop the community education service.  Expenditure has been progressively increased.  In 2005, and again in 2006, over &euro;9 million was spent on community education.  This year, the funding for community education will be in the region of &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>The back to education initiative provides flexible part-time options for adults who wish to return to learning and serves as a re-entry route to those in the workplace who wish to upgrade their skills.  Since its inception in 2002, 10% of places on the back to education initiative programme have been allocated to community groups and are dispersed directly among community groups by the Department.  The cost in 2006 was &euro;1.7 million.  In 2003, the post of community education facilitator was created in the VECs.  Some 37 community education facilitators, CEFs, were employed by the VECs and since then they have been supporting a range of groups around the country.  As they have become established in their positions, they have already raised the demand for flexible educational opportunities.</P>
        <P>The development of the community education service will continue apace.  This year, the Minister will provide an additional &euro;110,000 to consolidate women&rsquo;s participation in community education through the extension and mainstreaming of the AONTAS women&rsquo;s community education quality assurance framework project.  This project demonstrates the uniqueness of the work carried out by women&rsquo;s groups and provides a quality benchmark for it.  Hundreds of community-based groups across Ireland act as access points for what are termed hard to reach adults who would otherwise be excluded from second chance education.  Many of these groups have been founded and led by women.  The success of community groups in attracting hard to reach adults lies in their approach, in terms of respect for the individual learner&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and in their ability to provide flexible learning opportunities which take account of those needs and circumstances.  Not only do these groups provide access for hard to reach learners, they also have the potential to provide progression routes into further and higher education, training and work.  They also play a key role in the development of civil society through their work of empowering communities to participate in policy and decision-making.</P><Col N="600"/>
        <P>Expenditure on adult and further education has increased progressively since 1997.  In 2002, expenditure on adult and further education was &euro;113 million.  In 2007, it will be approximately &euro;169 million.  This represents an increase in the budget of &euro;56 million, or 50%.  Increases in the provision for adult education have been a significant feature of every budget in recent years.  I was pleased to note that the increase announced in the 2007 Estimates for adult education represents an increase of nearly &euro;19 million, or 12%, as compared with the position in 2006.  This compares very well with the increase in the overall departmental provision of 8%.</P>
        <P>Annual grants to the City of Waterford VEC for community education have followed the pattern of the overall grant by being increased annually.  In 2002, funding amounted to &euro;94,000.  It has increased each year since then and in 2006 was &euro;138,000.</P>
        <P>The VEC will shortly be notified of its funding provision for this year.  The Department, as an exceptional measure, recently approved an application from the City of Waterford VEC to transfer an excess on its adult literacy programme to offset a deficit that arose on its community education programme at the end of 2006.  This transfer of funds alleviated in full the deficit arising on the community education programme last year.  Furthermore, following a request in January, an advance of this year&rsquo;s funds was made to enable the VEC to continue to provide all its existing programme of classes in its community education programme.  The City of Waterford VEC has informed my Department, in response to an inquiry, that no classes have actually ceased on the pretext that they are not specifically aimed at target groups.</P>
        <P>I am anxious that VECs expand their community education services as much as possible.  However, as demand for funding always exceeds supply, the expansion of the service must be governed by budgetary restraints.  Even so, and bearing in mind that the discretion of VECs must be respected, I would be happy to consider any particular problem in the administration of the service that arises from unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.</P>
