	<P>I have received notice from Senator Shane Ross that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the recent agreement between the HSE and the pharmaceutical wholesalers is renegotiated.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2007, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business, and No. 2, all-party motion on Burma, to be taken at the conclusion of the debate on No. 1.  It is proposed that spokespersons will speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten.  Senators may share time with the agreement of the Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader his views on the comments made by Mr. Justice Paul Carney in a lecture he delivered in Cork yesterday evening on victim impact statements.  He referred in all but name to the trial of Wayne O&rsquo;Donoghue for the murder of young Robert Holohan and his comments clearly raise painful memories of that trial.  Will the Deputy Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify whether he has any intention to reform the method by which victim impact statements are made and to outline what he sees as the role of such statements in future cases?</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of cutbacks in the HSE on a number of occasions.  I remind the House that the Minister for Health and Children stated the cutbacks were having no impact on patients.  However, given that they appear to be causing untold harm to patients, we need to revisit the <Col N="426"/>issue.  In <i>The Irish Times </i>today it is reported that not only is the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, unable to discharge patients because community care packages have been, it is also unable to accept patients because it has insufficient beds.  A Dublin man who requires intensive rehabilitation after suffering a stroke is in a different hospital because he cannot gain admission to the NRH.  That, clearly, has a significant impact on the individual concerned.  The chairperson of the hospital&rsquo;s board has spoken about the implications for patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure many Senators listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, on which a dentist spoke about the impact of the cuts in dental services on schoolchildren and children with special needs.  A number of Ministers have spoken in this House as if everything is rosy but we would like to hear more realistic speeches and replies to the points we raise.  Real debate is needed on real issues and if they are making choices on cutbacks and priority areas, let us hear about them in order that we can have a proper discussion about what is happening in the real world of hospitals and patients.  I ask the Deputy Leader to take that point on board and ensure we will have a real debate on these important topics when Ministers attend the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On victim impact statements, an issue I raised previously, their standing in law has never been explained to us.  We recognise that certain judges regularly allow or facilitate such statements but we are not sure how they fit into legislation.  It would be helpful, therefore, if we had a debate in a non-confrontational manner on where the issue stands.  I have a lot of time for Mr. Justice Carney and admire what he says.  However, while I find myself in agreement with many of his comments, I also have a number of questions to ask about the reason he raised the issue in the manner he did.  It did not seem the appropriate setting for such an important debate.  Some of the issues he raised were within his control.  He could, for example, have intervened on the addendum to the agreed victim impact statement but chose not to do so.  I would like to have a debate in a political context in order that we could hear the views of each side in a non-confrontational manner.  While I am in favour of victim impact statements, I am unclear on how a judge is supposed to take them into consideration in coming to his or her conclusions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader to examine the issue of climate change and carbon emissions because it is appropriate to his party.  Most uninterested people say Ireland is only a small country that can achieve little in this regard.  The matter should be localised.  I would like the Minister to consider having a carbon audit per county with each county producing an annual report on carbon emissions and how they have changed from year to year.  This would localise the matter and make it something people feel they would be better <Col N="427"/>equipped to tackle.  I would like to hear the deputy leader&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>Last week we restored to the Order Paper some of the Government&rsquo;s legislation.  With the agreement of the deputy leader, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  Nos. 23 and 24 refer to the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill, in my name and that of Senator Paul Coghlan, and the Civil Partnership Bill, in the names of Senator David Norris and others.  I ask that as the first two items of business the proposal that they be restored to the Order Paper be taken without debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call Senator Alex White, I again remind Senators of the need to turn off mobile phones when entering the Chamber.  Switching them to silent mode is not enough as the Debates Office has informed my office that they interfere with the quality of recordings.  They also affect the quality of televised material.  I urge Members to turn them off completely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I felt like I was sitting in the middle of an orchestra pit for a few moments, with all of the sounds to be heard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I support my colleagues&rsquo; call for a debate on victim impact statements, the judge in question has performed an important service for the community in making his remarks for which he has been criticised and for the context in which they were made but the legal profession, particularly the Judiciary, is often criticised for living in a cocoon and not engaging in public debate.  There are certain restrictions on those involved in the legal profession but in this case the judge is also an adjunct professor of law at University College Cork and he took the opportunity to raise this issue.  He should be commended for doing so.  I agree there should be a debate in this House but when a judge steps off the bench to make such an observation as part of a public debate, it should be welcomed, as it does not happen often enough.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to raise with the Deputy Leader the publication yesterday of a report by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the placement of children under 12 years in residential care, as reported in the newspapers today.  It is remarkable that in this day and age, according to the chief inspector, some 5,000 children are in care.  While it may seem relatively low, the figure is significant.  The chief inspector acknowledges that the number is low but says it is disproportionately large when compared with best practice internationally.  This matter should be of concern to Members of the House and the Mini<Col N="428"/>ster of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith.  There have been other calls to have him come before the House.  I ask the Deputy Leader to add this matter to the list of issues he will address.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was one of the Members who did not get to speak yesterday.  Therefore, I ask for patience while I briefly address the matter I sought to raise then.  Regarding world health day, I welcome the debate on world health.  There is an onus on each Member of the House to get rid of the terrible, unfortunate stigma attached to mental illness, one of the biggest factors affecting those suffering from mental illness or even mild depression.  Last term I heard Members seek debates on issues such as those raised yesterday and today only to fail to attend and speak when the debate occurred.  I ask that when debates take place in the House Senators attend and try to make a change for the unfortunate persons who suffer from mental illness.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s call for a debate on the lack of beds for adolescents suffering from anorexia nervosa.  This was one of the last issues I addressed on the Order of Business last term.  Teenagers are not the only ones to suffer from anorexia nervosa; it can also affect children as young as nine years of age.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the tragic murder of 17 year old Manuela Riedo in Galway.  I always worried late at night about my two daughters who were students in Galway.  It is said &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; but this was never the case when I was in Dublin and they were in Galway.  My daughters informed me that a system was put in place in the National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway, whereby students were taken home by taxi if they did not have enough money to pay the fare.  The student concerned would hand over his or her student card, worth between &euro;10 and &euro;15, in lieu of the fare and return to the taxi rank the next day to retrieve it in exchange for the fare.  This ensured students were delivered home safely.  I call for a debate on youth safety in the light of this terrible murder.  I heard a report on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; from the murdered girl&rsquo;s rural home town.  Her parents are so traumatised that they are sedated and cannot give interviews.  It is not enough for Members of the House to merely sympathise with them.  We should try to do more.  Towns and cities with institutes of technology and third level institutions such as Waterford, Tralee, Sligo and Galway could make the aforementioned system workable, although perhaps it would not be possible in Dublin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My colleagues have referred to the comments of Mr. Justice Carney before the Law Society in University College Cork yesterday.  It is important that we soon have a debate in the House on the direction the criminal justice system is taking.  We heard yesterday about the climate of fear and intimidation in some prisons because we take a short-sighted, punishment only attitude to criminal justice that will not protect the community in the long term.  Mr. Justice Carney has, rightly, pointed to the other side of the coin in how the abuse of the victim impact statement can damage the delicate balance that must be preserved in the presumption of innocence.  In debating this issue we must also debate the need for officialdom, specifically the Courts Service, to be proactive in dealing with victims and their families in a humane way.  The event that led to Mr. Justice Carney&rsquo;s comments may not have happened had we a system in place under which victims and families were fully informed of court proceedings.  They should be kept up to date regarding when cases will come before court and informed of the rules of court.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions should explain proceedings in order that shock can be avoided, as well as events such as those referred to by the judge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These issues can all be covered if there is a debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we have that debate.</P>
        <P>Yesterday many colleagues raised the issue of abortion.  It is time we had a debate on the subject.  There are worrying reports that a reputable agency which has been doing good work for many years, CURA, will not receive funding from the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  We need to debate whether the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is fulfilling its remit to reduce the number of abortions taking place and whether the action of refusing funding to CURA is consistent with our constitutional provisions, which are to defend and vindicate the lives of both the mother and the unborn child.  It is only by vindicating the rights of both parties that we will have a truly humane response to this sensitive issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to what Bishop Burrows said on abortion, politicians are not spineless.  We have had a commission on assisted human reproduction and the Joint Committee on Health and Children held four public sessions on the issue.  Both I and Senator Feeney attended those meetings.  The situation in Ireland is quite clear.  Irish courts give full protection to the foetus as soon as it is implanted into the uterus.  However, it is the status of the embryo between fertilisation and implantation which remains in legal limbo.  The fact that the morning-after pill is legally prescribed here implies the embryo has no protection before implantation <Col N="430"/>into the uterus.  This was the legal perspective in the High Court case dealing with the frozen embryos of a couple whose marriage had broken down and in the discussions that took place in the committee.</P>
        <P>The impression has been given that politicians have not discussed this issue or that there is no position on it.  My interpretation of the position, based on what was said at committee and what has happened in our courts, is that as soon as an embryo is implanted into the uterus, it has the full protection of the Irish courts, which technically makes abortion illegal.  It is what happens before implantation that is not tied up legally.  The important issue this House must discuss is the fact there is no legislation on the issue of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.  Some 1,000 babies are born here every year by this method and neither mother nor baby have any legal protection in that regard.  We should seek legislation on that issue.</P>
        <P>The issues of human rights and vested interests have been mentioned often in the House in the context of our health services.  I feel strongly on these issues and believe we should have a patient safety authority to protect patients within our heath care service.  We have significant vested interests in our health care service, whether consultants, nurses unions, the administrators of the Health Service Executive or Ministers.  Some of these advocate on behalf of patients, but it is not their main remit.  We need a patient safety authority to change the health service dramatically.  Senators who have spoken on the issue of human rights this morning appear to be considering this kind of advocacy for people who are vulnerable.  Whether we are talking about people dealing with the courts or the health service, we need a statutory organisation that will look after the interests of people dealing with our public services.  We should push for debate on these issues so we can make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to reinforce the comments made by Senators White and O&rsquo;Toole on the address made by Mr. Justice Paul Carney.  It was important that he made this address to the law society in UCC, which is a group of serious, young law students.  I attended a packed meeting at the society a few weeks ago.  As Senator White said, it is good he spoke at this democratic forum.  Far too often judges keep their minds opaque to themselves and just talk to their peers over port.  It is good he spoke at this democratic forum and I hope the House commends him on his courage in speaking out and letting us know how his mind works on this important subject.  The danger of manipulation of victim impact statements in collusion with some sections of the media is very real.  We need to know how these statements fit into the business of judging.</P>
        <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Feeney on mental illness.  It is 20 years since I made a programme entitled &ldquo;Darkness Visible&rdquo; for RTE, <Col N="431"/>after which the switchboard was jammed for three days simply because nobody had spoken out about mental illness previously.  I would love to be able to say things have changed, but the stigma attached to mental illness is as great as ever.  If people in the private sector let their employers know they suffer from chronic depression, they soon find out how little the stigma has changed.  I have seen people discriminated against because, genuinely believing the stigma was gone, they told their employers they were suffering from depression.  They were squeezed out and dealt with badly.  We need debate on the issue.  It is not that we need to put the Minister or anyone else under pressure, but an open debate would do good and help destigmatise the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The centre for global development has just released its report and index on the performance of the richest countries of the world on overseas development aid.  Ireland comes halfway up the list which, while not a bad result, leaves room for improvement.  One of the criteria used in assessing performance is aid.  We are committed to providing 0.7% of gross national product by 2012, three years ahead of the UN deadline.  Other countries are doing better than that.  Luxembourg provides 0.87% of its gross national income and Sweden gives 0.9%.  I suggest we try to increase our contribution.  Tr&oacute;caire made the point in its September report that public opinion would probably support a rise and now would be the opportune time to make that increase.  I support such an increase and feel it would help other countries to increase their contributions.  Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister with responsibility for overseas development to come to the House for a discussion on overseas development aid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the House to discuss the major crisis in housing, particularly in Dublin where significant price issues do not facilitate access to housing for the average working person.  We need discussion on this important issue.  We also need the Minister to discuss the downturn in the market with regard to social and affordable housing.  The downturn will reduce the ability of local authorities to deliver the number of units required to reduce waiting lists.</P>
        <P>The Minister should also require an audit of empty dwellings from all local authorities.  It is a shame that we have so many empty houses when we have such a number of homeless people or people on waiting lists for more than ten years.  This issue must be addressed.  Our local authorities need a complete overhaul and review.  We need an audit of all managers and programmes in local authorities to examine how the service is <Col N="432"/>being delivered.  The Department is probably one of the largest Departments after the Department of Health and Children.  We need joined-up thinking with other Departments on the issue.  It is very important we have this debate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>People on all sides of the House have raised problems, but nobody seems to mention solutions.  We have the opportunity to talk about solutions.  The Minister for Education and Science was in the House yesterday, but there does not appear to me to be joined-up thinking between that Department, local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I want to raise various issues that need to be discussed in that debate.  There is no point in asking the Minister to the House specifically on the issue of local authorities.  We need to address certain issues within local authorities, such as the fire disaster in Bray.  The local authorities are the frontline people.  We also have the Civil Defence.  The Minister is a reforming Minister and that is the reason I raise the issue.  He was also a councillor in Dublin City Council and he understands what is required to reform local government.  I ask for that debate. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the non-contentious proposal by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, for a change to the Order of Business. I commend Mr. Justice Carney.  I listened to the broadcast this morning and read the text of his speech.  I thought it was sensitive, measured and judicious.  It raised a number of extremely important points that we should debate.  It was the right forum.  It was a lecture and he held off on speaking last year because of the sensitive nature of the case.  It took courage to do that because of the public sympathy for the suffering of the families involved but he made the point that because of the unscripted nature of the remarks at the end of that statement, it had a serious negative impact on the intention of his judgment which was to permit the other young man, Wayne O&rsquo;Donoghue, to look towards the reconstruction of a shattered life.  </P>
        <P>He also made points, which were well made, about the intervention of the media, particularly about the its sensational elements.  The Government appears to wish to reintroduce the Defamation Bill and the Privacy Bill is on the Order Paper.  A press ombudsman has been appointed.  We have a press council, even though the Bill was discarded.  Would the existence of the press ombudsman or the press council have stopped that?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald about the situation regarding the health service and ask for <Col N="433"/>a debate on that.  I, too, am aware of the case of the stroke victim she mentioned.  Another case of a stroke victim, who has been reduced from a full regime of physiotherapy to three hours, been drawn to my attention.  On the morning this man was to be transferred to a nursing home, the family were told, just as they were expecting the ambulance to take him, that it would not happen because the funding had been withdrawn.  It is unconscionable that Government spokespersons maintain there is no impact on patients.  I cannot think of a more catastrophic impact than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, or that of your office or the Clerk of the Seanad&rsquo;s office on issues that warrant address.  I listened this morning, as I have done for the past few weeks, to a number of issues being raised by Members which are valid and worthy of response and find that a system falls into place in that regard.  I am not sure, however, if any Member is satisfied with the manner in which this House responds to the issues raised.  I support the call by the Leader of the Opposition&rsquo;s main party in the House, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, concerning the health services and the budgets allocated to those services but there is no point in bringing the Minister for Health and Children into the House to talk about the Health Service Executive budget because that is a matter for the HSE.  It was decided by successive political parties over many years to abolish the system in place and replace it with the HSE, giving it its own autonomy.</P>
        <P>I support the call made by a number of speakers regarding the victim impact statement but let us wind back the clock.  The victim impact statement of Majella Holohan had a huge impact and Mr. Justice Carney is probably right to address the issue.  I am not sure, however, I would agree with everything he said.  I disagree that Wayne O&rsquo;Donoghue has no future in this country but do I take up that issue with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Courts Service?  With whom do I take up that issue?  Most of us want to raise issues about traffic.  Do I take up such issues with the Minister for Transport or with the National Roads Authority?  Other Members raised issues including the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, another separate agency, and there was even a call this morning to set up a new authority.  I am aware we will be advised that, under Standing Orders, we cannot do this or that.  All these issues involving the HSE, the NRA, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We cannot have a debate on that, if that is what the Senator seeks.  Requests are made by Members for Ministers to come into the House or for statements to be made on certain issues and the Leader or the Deputy Leader do their best to arrange for Ministers to come to the House for such debates.  Two weeks ago there was a call for a debate on Burma.  The Leader <Col N="434"/>and the Deputy Leader sought that and the debate will take place today following the taking of the Bill.  It is difficult for me to influence that.  It is a matter for the Leader of the House to do his best to deal with the requests made by Members.  Senator Callely&rsquo;s points are valid but a public representative who wishes to call on the door of any Minister with a request will not find that door closed.  The Leader has ensured in the past, and will in the future, that as many debates as possible on the relevant issues are held in the House.</P>

	<P>I appreciate your comments, a Chathaoirligh, and support all you said.  My point is that we are guided by Standing Orders.  We can invite a Minister here but he may not be in a position to respond, for example, to a measure taken by a separate agency with its own autonomy.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, those are issues which should be raised internally at group meetings.  The debate on Burma today arose from the meeting of the representative of the different groups.  Similarly, we have already decided there will be a meeting on economic issues next Thursday afternoon.  The system works.</P>

	<P>I would like to be associated with the comments on mental health of Senators White and Harris.  It is a worthy debate, there is an element of stigma associated with this topic that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>As a result of the way in which the HSE is managing its business, there will be knock-on effects in other areas that the House should know about.  Given the management style of the HSE, where it manages by budget instead of demand, the knock-on effect will be felt by the emergency services.  We are all conscious of what has happened to firefighters recently but another arm of the emergency services faces an impending crisis, the ambulance service.</P>
        <P>I have been contacted by ambulance personnel in the mid-west who are in dire straits.  As a result of the decision of the HSE to manage by budget instead of demand, and the consequent cap on recruitment that resulted in closures of wards in hospitals such as Nenagh General Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, I would like some latitude.  As a result of this cap, the ambulance service will ferry people between hospitals instead of doing their normal work.  Within Nenagh there are 75 beds so if a 76th person arrives, he must be ferried to Limerick.  I got a phone call from an ambulance driver asking what will happen if the control room gets an emergency call while a person is being taken to Limerick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can take that up in the debate.  The Order of Business is not a <Col N="436"/>forum for detailed discussion, it exists so Senators can raise issues with the Leader of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result of the significant investment in the ambulance service in coming years, 80 ambulances will be bought that will only have one stretcher, instead of two, and there will be capacity problems.  I would like the Minister for Health and Children to explain how this will be dealt with given that ambulances will now be used for areas they were not used in the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s call for a debate on the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and its refusal to fund Cura.  This is entirely inappropriate, particularly as Cura was established with a particular ethos and mandate.  It is expected to give out details of Positive Options, abortion referral agencies in other words, which is entirely inappropriate.  There is nothing positive about that at all.  It is entirely wrong that State funding is being refused to a group that cares for women and their children.  This should be addressed immediately.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested in this House that we should not grandstand on issues of foreign affairs.  I agree but that does not mean we should not discuss foreign affairs, this is no mean country with no mean people.  Currently, the Irish Embassy in Russia handles business with Ukraine, a potential accession state and the second largest country in Europe, with a population of 60 million.  It would be entirely appropriate, at a time when the second most common spoken language in this country is Polish, that we establish an embassy in the Ukraine to reflect what is happening.  Poland is the centre of Europe and for the future we must look east.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Several Senators raised the remarks made by Mr. Justice Carney on victim impact statements.  While there are necessary constraints between the Judiciary and the Government, it is obvious that the judge was referring to the impact of victims&rsquo; statements and the issue should be widely debated.  We should be grateful to the judge for raising the issue.  It was raised in a precise and rational manner and, as a result, the cold nature of the language may have affected some of those involved in this case.  That does not deny the need for the debate and a response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the demands made in the House today on the issue.  As part of that debate, Senator Mullen&rsquo;s request about a review of the lack of information given to victims as cases progress can be put to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Many Senators spoke about the impact of the budget cutbacks by the Health Service Executive, <Col N="437"/>with references to Ministers talking about the lack of impact the freeze will have.  It is legitimate to debate this regularly under the accountability brief we hold in this House.  If the Minister or a Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children is available, the issues raised can be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked about a county by county carbon footprint to see where the impact of climate change is most felt in Ireland.  Under the programme for Government, as part of this year&rsquo;s budgetary process there will be a carbon budget.  We can find out how that information is made available.</P>
        <P>Senator White asked about the number of children in care and how that compares to other states.  There have been requests for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House and this could be another issue that would be part of the debate when he is available.</P>
        <P>There was a return to an issue raised yesterday, World Mental Health Day, with questions on anorexia and mental illness.  Senator Harris spoke of the continuing, unchanging stigma attached to mental illness.  Not only is there a need for such a debate but it should focus on those who have experience of mental illness and the mental health services because such people are rarely heard when discussing the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan asked about overseas development aid.  The Government is committed to achieving the 0.7% of GNP target by 2012 and while there is no immediate plan to increase to that figure, offsetting of carbon emissions from Government travel will be undertaken through projects in areas where Irish development aid is in place.  That will increase the amount going to development aid and should increase the figure the Senator has in mind.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler called for a debate on housing and asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come into the House.  I will make that request of both the Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  The Senator also mentioned empty houses.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution tried to address this when dealing with questions on property in a recent report.  There are constitutional issues related to taking empty properties into public ownership but the legislation dealing with dormant accounts demonstrates there is scope for provision for dormant estates to cover intestate property that is unused and which could be used for socially advantageous purposes.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely spoke about procedures, but the point should be made that this is the seventh sitting of the 23rd Seanad, which is still relatively early into our term.  It is a very new Seanad in so far as 35 of its 60 Members are new to this House, while 25 are new to the Oireachtas.  Therefore, there is still a feeling around process as to what the procedures are and how to follow them.  Some of this will become much clearer, however, when <Col N="438"/>in the next month joint Oireachtas committees will be formed.  The focus of those committees will be to invite people not only from Departments but also agencies such as the HSE to ask the type of questions that are being posed regularly here.</P>
        <P>The final point raised concerned diplomatic services in large countries where Ireland is not represented by an embassy.  A request can be made to the Department of Foreign Affairs on that matter.</P>
        <P>I have skipped the contributions of several Members who revisited the call for a debate on abortion, which was raised yesterday.  To reiterate what I said then, if leaders of groups in the House feel there is a consensus for such a debate there is nothing stopping us from doing so.  However, I would be dubious if such a consensus could be reached.</P>
        <P>Particular concerns have been expressed about how the Crisis Pregnancy Agency deals with certain organisations.  There is scope under our Standing Orders for people to raise such matters either on the Adjournment or by framing a particular question as a motion for Private Members&rsquo; business.  Outside a wider agreement between leaders of groups in the House as to how the issue can be approached in a more substantial manner, I cannot see a more imminent debate taking place.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is essentially a technical amendment.  I still have a concern with the collective citation of &ldquo;the Local Government Acts 1925 to 2007&rdquo;.  As I understand it, the Water Services Act 2007 has already created a collective citation of the Local Government Acts 1925 to 2007.  Therefore, we already have such a collective citation, which comprehends the Water Services Act 2007.  The latter Act has not yet commenced but its collective citation does not require commencement as such and, therefore, it is deemed to have commenced on enactment.  We are left with a situation whereby, unless this amendment is accepted, an anomaly could arise.  I accept it is a technical amendment, which may not detain the House for as long as other matters.  Nonetheless, because the Water Services Act 2007 is in place, an anomaly could arise by having two inconsistent citations in reference to the Local Government Acts in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) This Act <i>(</i>other than <i>section 7) </i>shall come into operation on the first making of regulations under section 42A of the Principal Act inserted by <i>section 7</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to repeat the concern I raised on the last occasion.  This amendment deals not so much with a technical issue as with a matter of some substance.  There is not a commencement order in the Bill, so in the normal fashion it will commence on enactment.  Under the terms of the Bill that means existing exemptions in the principal Act will be repealed.  While the exemptions are gone, in the normal run of events it will presumably take the Minister some time to produce regulations to be made under the new lending scheme as envisaged in section 7.  That would appear to leave libraries in a legal limbo between the enactment of this legislation and the issuance of regulations to be prepared by the Minister.  Will the Minister of State assure the House that the regulations are either already prepared or will be prepared prior to the enactment of this Bill?  That seems to be a big ask for the Minister of State to give such an undertaking, so I will await his reply in that regard.</P>
        <P>If the new regulations are not in place when this Bill is enacted, there will clearly be a gap.  There will be a period of time following the enactment of the Bill &mdash; which will remove the exemptions &mdash; during which we must await regulations governing the new lending scheme, which is the principal purpose of this amending legislation.  I suggest a commencement provision is required, which would allow section 7 to operate immediately, while the repeals would only come into operation on the making of the regulations. That would seem to meet my concern, otherwise libraries might be forced to stop lending books until the regulations were made.  That is the implication of not accepting this amendment, which is an attempt to deal with the problem by plugging the gap.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes the inclusion of a new subsection 1(4) which would mean the Act would not commence on enactment but when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government introduces regulations bringing into operation a public lending remuneration scheme.  Senators raised this issue on Committee Stage but as I indicated then it is imperative that the legislation come into effect as soon as the Oireachtas passes it.  As evidenced by the decision of the European Court of Justice against Ireland last January, we are in default of our obligations under the EU directive on rental and lending and it is incum<Col N="441"/>bent on us to come into compliance with the decision as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Commission is pursuing Ireland under Article 228 of the treaty.  These proceedings are advancing and can lead to the imposition of heavy monetary fines against the State unless remedial action is taken quickly.  Our immediate obligation is to provide an exclusive lending right for authors and this right will be replaced by a right to remuneration on introduction of a public lending remuneration scheme but it is not possible to await that development given our immediate obligations under the directive.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage it was indicated that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was working towards making regulations, possibly as soon as the end of this year with a view to having the scheme operational from 2009, with the possibility of making payments in respect of part of 2008.  This undertaking should go a long way to providing a clear signal of the Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators were concerned about the exposure for public libraries in the period between enactment of the legislation and the introduction of the scheme because authors might exercise their exclusive right and prevent their books being lent in the public libraries.  I have met representatives from the Irish writers&rsquo; representative organisation and it is my understanding that they are satisfied their public lending rights are being recognised, albeit late.  With the public lending remuneration scheme well within view it is unlikely that authors will decide to exercise the exclusive right that will obtain in the interregnum.</P>
        <P>Public libraries spend significant sums of money in book stock each year which yields a reward for authors.  This is particularly important for less well-known authors for whom the public libraries are a major customer.  For example, public libraries will spend more than &euro;15 million in purchasing books in 2007, an increase of 10% over 2006.  Continuing investment by public libraries in book stock will result in a total expenditure of &euro;75 million in the period 2002-07.</P>
        <P>The compelling rationale for this legislation remains and it must be enacted as soon as logistically possible.  For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody argues with what the Minister of State describes as &ldquo;the compelling rationale&rdquo; for the legislation.  We on this side of the House understand and support it.  The Minister of State has not, however, dealt with the possibility of a limbo situation arising.  The only reassurance he offers the House is that he thinks it unlikely that authors would seek to exercise a right in the interregnum.  I have no doubt he has been in touch with the Irish Writers Union but no organisation can bind every writer to a particular agreement.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State ought to have considered that this is a real prospect.  The amendment would <Col N="442"/>still allow the legislation to be put in place.  It would simply give the Minister of State a mechanism to ensure we can have both and there is no gap.  The word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; is not good enough and to say regulations will &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; be produced by the end of the year is not sufficient to deal with the problem.</P>

	<P>We dealt with educational establishments on Committee Stage when the Minister of State correctly pointed out that there is a definition of educational establishments in the principal Act.  There is, however, a basis for considering this amendment.  The purpose is to limit the blanket exemption for educational establishments.  We suggest limiting it by giving power to the Minister to prescribe conditions for the loans.  This does not take from the legislation but adds to its effect.  While the definition in the 2000 Act may be sufficient to limit the scope of the exemption to some extent, the lack of specific conditions is a matter for concern.  What is to stop a prescribed institution, as defined in the principal Act, lending works to persons who are not its students?  The practice is for educational libraries to lend only to their students but is there anything that prevents a disreputable educational institution lending to all and sundry?  This bears further scrutiny and the Minister should have the power to put in place these conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Sections 8 and 12, as amended on Committee Stage, provide an exemption for educational establishments from the provisions for public lending.  This exemption provides continuity because educational establishments were already exempt under the 2000 Act.  It is necessary to ensure that our schools, colleges and universities continue as rich sources of learning and research unfettered by any requirement to observe public lending rights.  The amendments proposed appear to attempt to qualify the exemption and involve the responsible Minister in prescribing conditions under which such establishments can lend books.  Any such qualification is unnecessary, hence I do not propose to accept these amendments.  </P>

	<P>I thank the Chair for his kind words and am glad to address this important issue in the House.  I welcome this all-party motion on Burma and the further opportunity to set out the Government&rsquo;s views, which I know are widely shared across both Houses of the Oireachtas and throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Although a semblance of calm has returned to cities and towns in Burma and the military regime there talks about a return to normalcy, the situation remains completely unacceptable.  In recent weeks, the people of Burma made clear on the streets their unequivocal demands for democracy, national reconciliation and an end to military dictatorship and the Irish Government and people stand firmly behind them.  The regime tried to quell the voices of monks, nuns and unarmed civilians who were peacefully demonstrating in the streets through bullets, beatings, tear-gassing, widespread arrests and brutal repression.</P>
       <P>The numbers killed, injured, arrested or missing are not yet, and may never be, known precisely.  While the regime has tried to cut off communication with the outside world in the hope of covering up its actions, it has not been able to hide the evidence of its brutality or the strength of discontent and opposition to its rule among the people of Burma.</P><Col N="445"/>
        <P>The Government has long taken a strong position on Burma, including the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.  It has spoken out firmly on the issue for many years at the UN General Assembly and in all other appropriate fora.  It raises its concerns consistently in meetings with the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, and other Asian countries.  In international meetings at which Irish Ministers and officials have encountered Burmese Ministers or delegations, they have always used the opportunity to make clear in a forthright manner the views of the Government and people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Through the Irish Aid programme, the Government has provided support for humanitarian causes and for the democratic process.  It maintains close links with Burma Action Ireland and the small Burmese community in Ireland and offers some assistance for their activities.  In addition to regular meetings between Ministers and Burma Action Ireland, President McAleese met representatives of the group and the Burmese community yesterday.  The Government has always worked proactively to ensure Burma remains high among the priorities of the EU and the UN and is discussed at the Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and the Security Council.  For example, Ireland proposed and circulated a joint EU ministerial statement on Burma that was adopted at the Council in April.</P>
        <P>As the crisis escalated in recent weeks, the Government has stepped up its action in support of the Burmese people.  On 24 August, during the early days of the popular demonstrations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, issued a statement calling for the release of key democracy activists and for the initiation of inclusive dialogue with opposition parties.  As the situation intensified, he followed up this with a statement on 24 September in support of the demonstrators and appealed to the regime to exercise restraint, release all political detainees and initiate a process of dialogue and national reconciliation.  Immediately after the widespread attacks on the unarmed demonstrators on 26 September, he condemned forcefully the use of force and called again for restraint, dialogue and reconciliation.</P>
        <P>All these statements called on ASEAN and other Asian countries that may exercise influence with the Burmese regime to do all in their power to protect the people of Burma, encourage restraint, dialogue and reconciliation, support the role of the UN and, in particular, to facilitate an immediate visit to the country by the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s special envoy, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, followed up these statements by writing to the foreign ministers of China and India to call on them to use their influence to stop the violence in Burma and to encourage positive <Col N="446"/>change.  These messages were delivered to the ambassadors of China and India in Dublin and by the Irish ambassadors in Beijing and New Delhi.  At his request, the Irish ambassadors in the ASEAN region made urgent <i>d&eacute;marches</i> to the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.  Equally, the Irish ambassadors at the UN in New York and Geneva have been active in conveying these messages to Security Council members, as well as to ASEAN and Asian neighbours of Burma.  The Government is pleased these representations have received encouraging responses.</P>
        <P>In his address to the UN General Assembly in New York last week and in his bilateral meetings there with the UN Secretary General and international foreign ministers, including the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, the Minister again highlighted Irish concerns.  He also had a detailed discussion on the issue with US Secretary of State Rice in Washington and, on Monday, with Foreign Secretary Miliband in London.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the situation in Burma is deplorable, we believe the events of the past few weeks represent a possible turning point.  For the first time, ASEAN, as an organisation, as well as many of its members, have spoken out in condemnation of the brutality of the Burmese regime.  They have expressed revulsion at the violence used against unarmed demonstrators and have called for national dialogue and reconciliation.  Similarly, the Government of China has been working behind the scenes with the military leaders and has spoken out more clearly than ever before in calling not only for calm and stability but also for reconciliation and progress towards democracy.  The significance of these statements and actions by Burma&rsquo;s neighbours should not be underestimated as the influence of the EU and the US is comparatively limited and such regional pressure, while it may not be as forthright as one would like, is essential.</P>
        <P>Chinese and ASEAN involvement made it possible to achieve agreement to hold a special session of the UN Human Rights Council on Burma and to adopt a strong resolution there by consensus.  They also helped to force the agreement of the Burmese regime, headed by Senior General Than Shwe, to grant a visa to UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to visit the country to meet General Shwe personally, and to allow him to meet democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi twice during his visit.</P>
        <P>The agreement of the members of the UN Human Rights Council &mdash; including China, Russia and some of Burma&rsquo;s neighbours &mdash; to accede to a request from the EU to hold a special session on Burma last week was in itself a highly significant move forward, but the outcome, a tough resolution adopted by consensus, is unprecedented in terms of Council action on Burma.  Among other provisions, the resolution deplores the regime&rsquo;s violent repression of peaceful protestors, calls for the human rights and fundamen<Col N="447"/>tal freedoms of the people of Burma to be fully respected and demands international access to the country to allow investigation of the situation.  In this regard, the Council called on the Burmese authorities to co-operate fully with the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Paulo S&eacute;rgio Pinheiro, including urgent facilitation of a visit by him to that country.  We believe this sends the clearest of signals to the Burmese regime that the international community is prepared to stand together to ensure the days of impunity are over.</P>
        <P>As regards the UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s visit to Burma, Dr. Gambari briefed the Security Council last Friday on the three objectives of his mandate, which were to assess the situation on the ground; to deliver clear messages from the Secretary General to the Burmese authorities at the highest level; and to promote dialogue between the Government and the opposition as the best path to ending the current crisis and achieving national reconciliation.  In his assessment, Dr. Gambari admitted that the circumstances and duration of his trip had not made it possible to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of recent and current events.  However, he was quite clear in his view that &ldquo;since 1988, the democratic aspirations of the people ... have been systematically denied by the Government in the name of stability and security&rdquo;, and that the exclusion of key stakeholders from the Burmese Government&rsquo;s National Convention, which was supposed to pave a way for the return of democracy, &ldquo;undermines the credibility and legitimacy of the process&rdquo;.  He also expressed concern that reports were still coming in of abuses being committed by the security forces and others, including raids on private homes, beatings, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, and mass relocation of arrested monks.</P>
        <P>On the second point of his mandate, Dr. Gambari confirmed that he had succeeded in delivering clear and strong messages on behalf of the Secretary General, which included calls on the regime to respond constructively to the demands of the international community and its neighbours.  He stated, &ldquo;No country can afford to act in isolation from the standards by which all members of the international community are held&rdquo;. In addition to the release of detainees and other immediate measures demanded by Dr. Gambari, he called on the regime to address the political and socio-economic factors underlying the demonstration, including, from a political point of view, the initiation of a process of dialogue and national reconciliation.  Dr. Gambari admitted it remained unclear how responsive the authorities would be to the list of messages he set out, but he felt he had succeeded in increasing the regime&rsquo;s understanding of regional and international perceptions of the situation in the country.</P>
        <P>Finally, with regard to his task of promoting dialogue, Dr. Gambari described himself as being <Col N="448"/>&ldquo;cautiously encouraged&rdquo; by what he described as the &ldquo;potentially welcome development&rdquo; of Senior General Than Shwe&rsquo;s offer to meet Aung San Suu Kyi.  It should, however, be noted that despite the specific demand from the UN Secretary General that any dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi be unconditional, the Burmese authorities have imposed a number of conditions which, unsurprisingly, have been broadly criticised by the NLD and many Burmese.  After so many years of ruthless repression of viewpoints other than its own, scepticism about the regime&rsquo;s bona fides is inevitable, and fully justified.  However, it is important that some way be found to exploit the opening which now seems to exist &mdash; no matter how slim it may be &mdash; for the dialogue for which we have long called.  It is our hope that the UN Secretary General and his envoy will succeed in having these conditions removed and that Dr. Gambari&rsquo;s wish for the dialogue to resume as soon as possible will be realised.  It remains to be seen whether the regime&rsquo;s appointment of a minister to liaise with Aung San Suu Kyi represents a serious willingness on its part to engage in genuine dialogue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Gambari has also suggested the creation of a broad-based grouping to examine the work done to date on a new constitution.  In addition to this, he suggested that a poverty alleviation commission be set up to identify and address the country&rsquo;s major socio-economic needs.  The Government believes Dr. Gambari&rsquo;s recommendations, if implemented, offer the best way forward for the people of Burma.  It is important that Dr. Gambari, who will return to Burma next month for a follow-up visit, receives strong support from the international community, particularly from Burma&rsquo;s neighbours.  It is also the Government&rsquo;s view that Dr. Gambari&rsquo;s proposals for a constitutional review commission and poverty alleviation commission make sense, and I would like work on these to advance as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>While we wish to encourage all possible constructive initiatives, Ireland and its EU partners are also considering an extension of sanctions against the regime.  We already apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures to Burma, and options for toughening them are currently under urgent consideration.  Ireland has taken a leading role in this regard.  It is expected that EU Ministers will take up this question at the next General Affairs Council on 15 October.  A priority for us is to ensure that any new measures are targeted against the regime in order that they will not cause further suffering to the people of Burma.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to stand firm with the people of Burma at this time, as do all Opposition parties and the people of Ireland.  News about Burma may have faded from the international headlines, but we in Ireland have not forgotten and will not forget the demands for freedom and justice so clearly expressed by the <Col N="449"/>people of Burma.  We will continue to monitor very closely developments in Burma, to work unrelentingly with the EU, the UN and the countries of Asia on this issue, and to keep the focus of the world on the plight of the people of Burma.  We will continue to demand that the Burmese military regime desist from further violence against it people, release all recent and long-term detainees, including Aung San Suu Kyi, initiate inclusive dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic minorities, prioritise national reconciliation, and co-operate in full with the UN and the demands of the international community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He was a Member of this House in the last Seanad, and I congratulate him on his elevation to the position of Minister of State.  I wish him well in his duties.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, this is an all-party motion &mdash; which is to be welcomed &mdash; supporting the oppressed people of Burma in their quest for democracy.  I read with interest the speech of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the UN, and I compliment him on its content.  All right-thinking people abhor the violent reaction of the military junta to the peaceful protests of the Burmese people, especially the Buddhist monks.</P>
        <P>Burma remains one of the world&rsquo;s tragedies.  A brutal dictatorship has been allowed to enslave the country for almost half a century, hold its democratically elected leader prisoner, pocket the country&rsquo;s resources and violently repress all attempts to demand freedom and justice.  The tolerance shown to Burma contrasts with the desire of some countries for regime change in other parts of the world.  Burma continues to be a prisoner of its military while the world looks on in horror, and up to recently, silently.  The country has suffered with brutal regimes for most of its existence, under British rule, Japanese occupation during the Second World War, and a series of brutal military dictatorships since 1962.  It is a sad fact that democracy existed in Burma only between 1948 and 1962.  The military has held the democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest or worse for almost 20 years, and refuses to accept the results of a democratic election which saw her win by a landslide in 1990.  I applaud Senator Norris, who raised the issue of Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi in this House many times, long before the current crisis.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Burmese people, peacefully protesting not only about their standard of living but also about the lack of democracy and repression by the military regime, were savagely cut down by the military, whose members used live rounds, tear gas and baton charges and arrested thousands of people.  The regime acknowledged 11 deaths but other estimates put the figure at more than 200, with hundreds badly injured.  In the 1988 attempt at peaceful revolution the then government claimed the dead numbered only a few dozen <Col N="450"/>when, in fact,  more than 3,000 persons were massacred.  We do not know the death toll for the current situation but we can be sure that the suffering of the Burmese people, and the Buddhist monks in particular, continues daily outside the glare of the world media.</P>
        <P>What can we as a nation do?  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has written to his Chinese and Indian counterparts appealing to them to use their considerable influence with the military regime to end violence against peaceful protestors, to release the detainees, to set about national reconciliation and democratisation, and to co-operate with the UN.  I commend the Minister also for involving our ambassadors and officials who have already made d&eacute;marches to the governments of Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam seeking to address the immediate, and indeed long-term, problems of Burma.</P>
        <P>No doubt the best way to find a sustainable solution to the crisis in Burma is to seek to maintain international focus and pressure on the issue, particularly on Burma&rsquo;s neighbours.  The UN Security Council should be more actively involved and the Government should ensure that the EU as a body exerts as much pressure as possible also.</P>
        <P>Ireland has no diplomatic relations with Burma and it is the Government&rsquo;s position that no steps will be taken to develop diplomatic relations with Burma until such time as Aung San Suu Kyi is released from detention.  My party fully supports the Government&rsquo;s stance in this regard.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, and his officials on the diplomatic offensive which they have undertaken to help redress this dreadful situation.  I would urge the Minister of State to continue his efforts and to leave no stone unturned in assisting the Burmese people to achieve their goal of a democratic Burma free from the tyrannical dictatorship which continues to inflict so many human rights abuses on its citizens.</P>
        <P>Senator Jerry Buttimer attended the 117th meeting of the Interparliamentary Union in Geneva on Wednesday of this week where legislators from 125 countries adopted an emergency motion calling for the urgent need to immediately stop the widespread human rights violations and to restore democratic rights to the people of Burma.  This motion received comfortably the two thirds majority which was required.  I would hope that this type of international pressure will yield the desired results.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to continue his efforts in having diplomatic pressure placed on Burma and to continue his efforts with the Burmese neighbours, China in particular, to ensure that we will see a democratic Burma in the not too distant future.</P>

Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; go m&oacute;r leis sa phost agus sa Rialtas.</P>
        <P>Molaim an tAire, an Teachta Dermot Ahern, as ucht an suim at&aacute; curtha isteach agus an iarracht at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige chun imeachta&iacute; i Myanmar a chur i bhfeabhas, go m&oacute;r mh&oacute;r go mbeadh na gn&aacute;thdaoine sa t&iacute;r sin p&aacute;irteach sa Rialtais i Myanmar.</P>
        <P>Burma is a large country of some 50 million people, which reflects the large populations in many of the Asian countries.  It has a long historic tradition and it is sad to think that the military junta has been running the country since 1962.  To some extent it perhaps shows the inability of the international community and the international organisations to get to grips with serious situations around the globe.  The fact that it should be allowed continue for so long must be a matter of great concern.</P>
        <P>All of us will be aware that increases in oil prices for the regime led to the current serious situation in Burma and the peaceful protests which emanated as a consequence.  However, it was the built-up hostility to the repression that people have suffered over the past four and a half decades that gave rise to this expression of hostility.  It is fair to say that it quickly changed from a situation where people were protesting against the fuel price increases, which impacted severely on the poverty of many people in that country, to one of condemnation and a seeking of the end of suppression by the military regime.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the protests were led by the Buddhist monks.  Those of us from Wexford would be familiar with the 1798 rebellion where the Catholic priests and the Protestant leaders led the campaign to free the people of the yoke of tyranny which suppressed them for centuries, and this has a similar resonance with what is happening with the Buddhist monks.  There are approximately 500,000 Buddhist monks in the country.  I have also learnt that there are also approximately 500,000 Buddhist monks inculded in the army and that many people feel the fermentation of resistance may well come from that group of monks.  Buddhism promotes a peaceful disposition to society and to governments generally, but the fact that the peaceful protests were put down with such cruelty will generate its own reaction in time.</P>
        <P>The regime has acknowledged that there were approximately 11 deaths but most independent commentators believe that the number is probably in the hundreds.  In addition, many people have been imprisoned, not least many of the monks who were involved in the protests.</P>
        <P>There is a lesson in the fact that many of the activists who were involved in the 1988 protests <Col N="452"/>have been re-imprisoned, presumably, as the regime would see it, as a precaution against further protestation.  That protest occurred 20 years ago and very little has changed.  While calm has been restored we must be clear that the diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation in the Burma in the interests of the people of that country should be intensified.</P>
        <P>Ireland has taken a strong position consistently on this issue and it is correct that we should seek that the military junta accept the genuine democratic aspirations of the people of Burma and engage meaningfully with the opposition, and particularly with the ethnic groups.  Some 30% of the population is made up of ethnic groups and that mirrors the position in other Asian countries.  It may well be in their interest to ensure a peaceful transformation from the current oppression to a state of greater democracy and respect for human rights in Burma because other Asian countries will be susceptible to protests if there is not a move in that direction.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Cummins in complimenting the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has shown great consistency and leadership in the manner in which this and other issues have been tackled.  In particular, the fact we engaged our ambassadors in Asian countries, particularly the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, to ensure the voice of the free world was reflected was a good response.  The strong condemnation of those nations was unprecedented.  While the Minister stated he would perhaps like to see further moves in this direction, it is unusual for Asian countries to in any way adversely comment on the internal affairs of other countries.  It is significant it happened and needs to be encouraged.  There will be a further opportunity for Ireland and the EU in this regard when the ASEAN countries meet on 22 November.</P>
        <P>It is fair to acknowledge that China has played a constructive role behind the scenes in encouraging the military regime to respond and to allow the United Nations representative, Dr. Gambari, to visit the country with free access to opposition leaders and to examine the situation.  I realise there is criticism that China, with Russia, vetoed the United Nations Security Council debate and formulation of a resolution in this regard.  However, we all remember the manner in which the Security Council was used with regard to the invasion of Iraq.  The human rights section of the United Nations might at times be a more appropriate vehicle to address such issues.</P>
        <P>When he visited Burma, Dr. Gambari had access to Dr. Tan Shwe, the leader of the military junta, and to Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, the opposition party.  I believe the solution is to be found in the agenda set by Dr. Gambari, which suggested, first, the establishment of a constitutional review group within Burma and, second, the establishment of a poverty alleviation commission.</P><Col N="453"/>
        <P>There is talk of sanctions but, as is generally the case when dealing with people, we need the carrot and the stick.  The carrot in this situation can be the financial and economic support of the international community to create the transition that is necessary in Burma.  A huge element of the population is in deep deprivation and poverty.  This incentive must be part of the solution.</P>
        <P>The third change sought by Dr. Gambari was that there would be international access to Burma, which is essential.  Part of the reason the regime has been allowed to continue with impunity has been that there is little access to the country, which for long periods of the past 45 years has been more or less ignored.  The intensification of interest must be sustained.  It was interesting to note that the Red Cross, a body not noted for condemning particular countries or regimes, denounced in very strong terms the Burmese regime, particularly when it refused entry to the prisons in that country.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred in his speech to sanctions, some of which are currently in place.  I am glad there is heavy emphasis on targeting and focusing those sanctions to adversely affect the regime, not the people.  This is a very difficult circle to square.  To again return to the example of Iraq, when the UN and the international community applied sanctions over a long period, it had the most serious effect on the population, particularly children, from a medical and economic perspective.  We should learn a lesson from this, namely, that sanctions which hurt the people of the country, who we claim we are endeavouring to assist, are ridiculous in the extreme.  I urge caution.  We must ensure any sanctions are carefully constructed and used to protect the people of the country.</P>
        <P>The House is <i>ad idem</i> on this issue and that is how the international community should be.  We must continue along the lines we have set out and, in particular, we must follow the agenda set by Dr. Gambari and promote dialogue, reconciliation and mutual respect.  We must not just do this when the issue is a nine-day wonder in the newspapers due to the protests, but continue to do it month in, month out, when the situation in Burma is calm and not highlighted so much in the media.  It behoves us as a Christian country and a respected member of the international community to do so, particularly as we ourselves suffered over a long period.  We are in an ideal position to play a constructive role as an advocate in encouraging others to play their part to ensure we change what is an appalling situation in that country.</P>

	<P>I am glad to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I know of his <Col N="454"/>interest in this matter.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his work in New York.  Other European countries have also played a positive role.  The British Prime Minister was very clear in this regard, as were both the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, and his Foreign Minister, Mr. Kouchner, who even went so far as to suggest they would try to get the French oil giant, Total, to pull out of Burma.  I am not sure such a move would be appropriate because it would simply open the way for China to further colonise the country.</P>
        <P>This is a point that needs to be put on the record.  Burma is in fact an economic colony of Beijing.  China has the key, as demonstrated when it vetoed the resolution at the UN Security Council.  The tragic situation in Burma highlights clearly the truth of what President Ahmadinejad told the United Nations, namely, that the entire organisation still reflects the situation at the end of the Second World War.  If we want effective work from the United Nations, we need to examine the permanent membership of the Security Council and the disproportionate power given to permanent members by the use of the veto.</P>
        <P>Burma is a very beautiful country, rich in natural resources and with a gentle and lovely people.  It is ruled by a vicious and inward-looking regime.  While the present turmoil was sparked by the enormous rise in commodity prices, the small ruling elite was insulated from its impact and continues to live in considerable luxury.  The members of the elite have not had experience of the rest of the world and have not travelled or been educated abroad and so on.  However, they are quite capable of inflicting serious damage upon their own people.</P>
        <P>This happened in 1998, when there was great repression and at least 3,000 people were killed.  The difference between then and now is the advance in technology.  Whereas in 1988 the regime was able to conceal the situation and the outside world did not know until it was all over, we now have contemporary reports.  I followed events in Burma on television and radio in Cyprus.  I saw in a newspaper blurred images, taken on a mobile phone, of the bloodied faces of monks.  We also know of attacks on pagodas and monasteries.  The events in Burma could not be concealed.</P>
        <P>The murder of a Japanese tourist while taking footage of the protests was disastrous for the Burmese authorities and raises the question of whether Japan, one of the main donors of assistance to Burma, will cut off aid.  The most interesting aspect of the initial phase of the protests was that they consisted exclusively of monks and were entirely peaceful.  A gentle revolution led by monks who had made clear to civilians that they should not get involved as it would mean exposing themselves to danger was brutally attacked.  It was at that point that ordinary members of the population became involved in the protests to a significant degree.</P><Col N="455"/>
        <P>Buddhist monks in Burma are representative of the population because entering a monastery for a period is almost a form of national service.  Virtually every young Burmese male becomes a monk for a time before rejoining civilian life.  The question arises as to what are the feelings of soldiers who may have experienced being a monk.  We have entered the end game for the Burmese regime and while it may take a long time, the skids are under the junta.  I am glad that is the case.</P>
        <P>In terms of Buddhist culture, it was significant that the monks refused to accept offerings from members of the military.  This is tantamount to an excommunication of the government agencies.  The role of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, is significant because these states have been mealy-mouthed previously.  We have listened to calls for constructive engagement but this means sweet damn all.  The economic interests and vulnerabilities of these undemocratic regimes mean they were unwilling to apply pressure on the Burmese regime.</P>
        <P>China is the key to this issue but I would not hold my breath in that regard.  I appeal to the Government to apply greater diplomatic pressure on the Chinese Government.  The Chinese ambassador should be told in unambiguous terms that it is perfectly clear that China could have the violence switched off tomorrow if it wished, given its absolute control of what is an economic colony of China.</P>
        <P>A question also arises with regard to the attitude of the West.  Tragically &mdash; Senator Walsh alluded to this point &mdash; while President Bush and his wife may have said all the right things &mdash; their comments were bang on &mdash; they are a busted flush with no moral authority because the United States is involved in the kidnap, torture and bombing of civilians.  Who are they to lecture the Burmese regime?  On the other hand, a small country such as Ireland still has some moral authority, despite the ongoing use of Shannon Airport for military purposes.  Complaints emanating from the United States about the undemocratic nature of the regime are justified but what about Palestine where a government returned in a proper election has been subverted?  A similar process took place in Algeria.  In other words, from the point of view of the West, democracy only works when it produces the result we want.  This approach leaves our moral authority elided.</P>
        <P>Senators should start a debate on whether it is appropriate to support holding the Olympic Games in Beijing in the light of the consistent and gross violation of human rights by the Chinese authorities in Burma and Tibet.  I say this despite hearing Jung Chang, the author of <i>Wild Swans</i>, in a discussion of her interesting and analytical biography of Mao Tse-tung on the wireless in recent days, state the staging of the Olympic Games in China has put pressure on the authorities to open up a little.  She also stated, <Col N="456"/>however, that it would be no harm to send the Chinese authorities a warning.  If we are to stand in solidarity with the people of Burma, we must raise these issues with China because we only have one chance to use the Olympic Games for this purpose.  Now is the time to demand that China take real, constructive action on Burma or face the prospect of the debate heating up and protests taking place against the Olympic Games.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Cummins for his kind words but the real praise should be directed towards the Burma action group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I welcome this cross-party motion.  It is most important that the House achieve consensus on this issue.  It is particularly important that we call upon the member states of the United Nations, especially those countries with seats on the Security Council, to put pressure on the despotic regime in Burma to cease its repression of the Burmese people and release its political prisoners, not only Aung San Suu Kyi but other political prisoners referred to in the motion.  </P>
        <P>Irish people are very moved and concerned about pictures and reports of the suffering of Burmese monks and those who came out in support of them.  All of us will recall the terrible pictures in newspapers on the Saturday before last, in particular those showing a dying student and the dying Japanese photographer to whom Senator Norris referred.  These images were probably the reason so many of us took part in a protest in support of the Burmese people on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin city centre on the same day.  It was heartening to see many hundreds turn out at such short notice and with very little publicity for a protest in support of the popular movement in Burma.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to the 1798 uprising.  The protests in Burma also evoke memories of other demonstrations.  For me, they brought back memories of 1989 and the student protests across central and eastern Europe against Soviet sponsored regimes.  They also brought back powerful images of the repression of students in Tiananmen Square in China in 1989.  We should learn from this.  It is heartening that so much has changed since 1989 in many of the countries in which students and others protested.  This should remind us of the importance of adhering to the freedoms, civil liberties and human rights that we, in Ireland and most other western countries, take for granted.  These include freedom of expression and freedom of movement, assembly and association.  It is very important that we stand firm against attempts to restrict these freedoms in the name of security or the fight against terrorism and that we remember how important these freedoms are and what power they have had in countries where people try to fight against despotic and repressive regimes.</P><Col N="457"/>
        <P>I welcome the motion.  It is important, so early in the life of this Seanad, that we have a cross-party motion on such an important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish my fellow parishioner, the Minister of State at<b></b>the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, every success.  He will apply his undoubted talents in the service of the country in the coming years.  I do so on a sad occasion, one on which we reflect on a very tragic country.  On 26 September the Burmese Government lived up to its reputation for brutality and its threats to act against protests.  It showed yet again that it was not afraid to spill the blood of innocent people to protect its interests. </P>
        <P>It is worth recalling the recent history of this tragic country.  In 1990 Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s National League for Democracy decisively won elections which the junta had allowed in Burma.  Under normal circumstances, she would have been sworn in as Prime Minister but, as we know, the military set aside the results of the elections and refused to hand over power, despite international denunciation and representations.  In recognition of her bravery Aung San Suu Kyi has been awarded the Sakharov Prize and Nobel Peace Prize and remains under house arrest to this day.</P>
        <P>To give an example of the inhumanity of the regime, for five years between 1995 and 2000 some of the restrictions placed on Aung San Suu Kyi were removed.  However, even when her British-born husband, Michael Aris, was dying from cancer in 1999, the regime would not allow him to visit her.  The couple never saw each other again and Aung San Suu Kyi remains separated from her children who live in the United Kingdom.  While we know she is currently in reasonably good health, she is often refused access to her doctor and visitors are not generally permitted to see her.</P>
        <P>Aung San Suu Kyi represents the sufferings of her people who continue to suffer every imaginable depredation.  Mass murder has been committed in Karen State where events can only be described as genocide in the technical and legal sense of the word.  Often, groups of villagers are forced to clear landmines and act as human shields.  Recently, people from 12 villages were forced to act as human shields around a bulldozer clearing a road of potential landmines.  The Burmese army forced one person from each of the 55 households of a village to become human landmine sweepers.  Elsewhere, 850 villagers were forced to carry supplies for the Burmese army and to act as human mine sweepers.  The regime has a callous disregard for the lives of the people it enslaves.  This year, the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in Britain was commemorated, but a system of slavery persists in many parts of the world, not least in Burma.</P>
        <P>As a small country, Ireland must ask what it can do to try to play a part in undoing such <Col N="458"/>cruelty and tyranny.  To begin, we must ensure that the plight of the Burmese does not slip from our minds in the way such issues slip as soon as the media moves on and the circus moves to another town.  The suffering of the Burmese will continue.</P>
        <P>We must examine how the UN is functioning, as I agree with my colleague&rsquo;s comments on its ineffectual role.  China and Russia blocked attempts by the UN Security Council to impose Western-led global sanctions.  Instead, it made a watered down press statement urging restraint.  Ireland must use its pester power and not be blinded by the economic attractions of dealing with large countries such as China, as I mentioned in another context.  We must be a moral voice to ensure China and Russia place pressure on the Burmese Government to allow democratic reforms.</P>
        <P>We must examine the European Union and the role played by the so-called democratic countries of western Europe in this story.  I acknowledge Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on the possible undesirability of Total, the French oil giant, withdrawing from Burma and leaving the field to China, but such arguments are an easy cop-out for the selfish interests of western governments.  The EU has been divided in that some countries such as Britain and Ireland want to step up pressure on Burma by varying degrees.  Other countries have opposed increasing pressure, not only for selfless reasons, but also selfish reasons.  It behoves us to make every possible effort at UN and EU level to try to ensure a consistent and persistent response based on a common vision for the protection of human rights and dignity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With this motion the House speaks with one voice in expressing its strong support for the efforts of the Government to date.  We are in line with most free-thinking countries regarding what should happen, but we wonder what will change.  After the headlines fade away, there is a danger of slipping back into the same situation as that seen after 1988 when the Burmese people tried to make their feelings known and after the 1990 elections.  Burma has a closed and clandestine society where the junta performing government tasks has existed since 1962, all of my life.  There is little sign that the efforts of the international community can bring about the necessary changes.</P>
        <P>We should be grateful for the way in which this motion has been worded.  It does not refer to the Government of Burma, rather it refers explicitly to the military junta.  Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Burma and will not until Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners are released and some semblance of democratic normality is achieved.  The motion refers to the wishes of the Burmese.  As Senator Norris stated, the main difference between this year&rsquo;s events and those in 1988 is technology, which allows us to see the nature of the repression.  The longer <Col N="459"/>those of us in the outside world allow the repression to continue, the greater the onus on us to bring about necessary changes.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the stronger commitments made by organisations such as ASEAN and the EU and comments from China, to which Burma is a client state.  However, they are just words.  Senator Mullen referred to the weak position of the EU in implementing effective economic sanctions due to the French Government&rsquo;s role and the Total situation.  If Ireland wants to exert moral authority as a small country and as a part of the international organisations of which it is a member, we cannot stand over a double standard of discussing what must happen while facilitating less than effective action.  There is an onus on us to ensure talk stops and effective action begins.  We must consider how this Chamber and country can do so.</P>
        <P>Many people should give ongoing support and commitment to the work of Burma Action Ireland.  Efforts have been made to inform elected representatives of events in Burma.  Last year, the prime minister in exile visited Ireland and was met by many Members.  Such avenues should be further strengthened.  Unlike the Middle East and Tibet, Burma is not the subject of an Oireachtas parliamentary support group.  That simple action would not only ensure debates of this nature and the monitoring of the Burmese situation, but also effective interparliamentary action in trying to bring about possible changes.  For example, Senator Cummins referred to Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s attendance of last week&rsquo;s meeting of the International Parliamentary Union.  Ireland is a member of the EU and the Organisation for Security Co-Operation in Europe.  Each body at which there is parliamentary representation should receive an Irish input via Members to ensure Burma&rsquo;s cause is heard and to alleviate its situation.</P>
        <P>Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s house arrest has been referred to.  She has witnessed appalling deprivations in terms of the military junta&rsquo;s abuse of her country and her personal situation, namely, her family&rsquo;s absence and her husband&rsquo;s death in exile.  In political terms, she represents someone akin to Nelson Mandela and is an embodiment of democratic values who deserves and needs the support of we who describe ourselves as democrats.  Often, such support is discussed and not readily given in physical and practical terms.  If this debate is to have any purpose, as well-worded as the motion is, we should continue to identify with Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s personal situation.  Through the efforts of our Government not only should we use the international arena available to us, we should also identify practical means by which her situation, and that of her people, can be changed.  I would not like to see us return to issues of this nature regularly because we would be letting her and the Burmese people down by engaging in some type of looped debate <Col N="460"/>which does nothing to change the plight of Burma and its people.  I appeal to Senators to work collectively to identify those means.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning, <i>The Independent</i> of London reported the following voice from Burma:</P>
        <P LI="1">There were about 400 of us in one room.  No toilets, no buckets, no water for washing.  No beds, no blankets, no soap.  Nothing ... The room was too small for everyone to lie down at once.  We took it in turns to sleep.  Every night at 8 o&rsquo;clock we were given a small bowl of rice and a cup of water.  But after a few days many of us just couldn&rsquo;t eat.  The smell was so bad.</P>
        <P LI="1">Some of the novice monks were under 10 years old, the youngest was just seven.  They were stripped of their robes and given prison sarongs.  Some were beaten, leaving open, untreated wounds, but no doctors came.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>The Independent</i> has published a stunning report comprising fresh information and eye-witness accounts of the horror taking place in Burma.  Nothing could be more eloquent than the voices of the people facing that horror.</P>
        <P>I welcome this motion and the Labour Party joins our colleagues in this House in supporting it.  I concur with what Senator Boyle said in the conclusion to his contribution.  I do not wish to say this debate is not valuable or important but its value is limited if we are unable to do anything of practical import.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government on its actions thus far and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on raising the issue in various international fora.  However, without detracting from what has been done, I would expect nothing less than a robust position from a sovereign Irish Government and the Minister who represents it abroad.  To the extent the Minister has done that, I welcome his intervention.</P>
        <P>I find it difficult to explain to my children the hierarchy of concern that applies to international relations.  I do not say international public opinion because that is not always the same as relations between countries.  If we take in particular the US and the great powers, including China, this hierarchy often relates directly to the financial and strategic interests of the countries concerned.  They are not predicated often enough on the issues themselves.  We have seen interventions being made by the US and supported by others where the interests of the great powers are perceived to be affected by events in certain countries.  However, this has not occurred in respect of Burma.</P>
        <P>I listened to the contributions of Senators Boyle and Walsh.  I welcome that this is an all-party motion and we are largely in consensus in our discussions, but I prefer the emphasis given by Senator Boyle to the issue.  Senator Walsh quite reasonably referred to sanctions and the constructive engagement and behind-the-scenes <Col N="461"/>efforts of China.  However, what is the point of so-called constructive engagement or behind-the-scenes work when it has been seen to achieve nothing over the past decades?  There is no point in attempting to persuade the junta to change its mind when we know it will not do so.  The junta will only understand forceful and robust action by way of sanctions.  A recent statement by the American Government warned that if certain actions are not taken by the regime, it would face sanctions.  The day has passed when we could have any confidence that any request by the international community to Burma would be met.  I understand Senator Walsh&rsquo;s intention when he speaks about the carrot and the stick but I am not sure whether the carrot belongs in this debate any longer.  I remain to be convinced that such an approach has any value.</P>
        <P>Another individual is reported in <i>The Independent</i> as stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">My friend was taken away for clapping during the demonstrations.  She had not marched.  She came out of her house as the marchers went by and, for perhaps 30 seconds, smiled and clapped as the monks chanted.  Her face was recorded on a military intelligence camera.  She was taken and beaten.  Now she is so scared she won&rsquo;t even leave her room to come and talk to me, to anyone.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The article continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Another Rangoon resident told the aid worker: &ldquo;We all hear screams at night as they [the police] arrive to drag off a neighbour.  We are torn between going to help them and hiding behind our doors.  We hide behind our doors.  We are ashamed.  We are frightened.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are the most recent reports available and we are indebted to <i>The Independent</i> for bringing them to the attention of the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One cannot disagree with the calls made by Senators for more stringent sanctions and for the Government to insert itself into the debate at an international level in the most robust way possible.  Numerous references have been made in this discussion to Aung San Suu Kyi, as is right given that she is the democratically elected leader of the country despite being kept under house arrest by the generals for so many years.  She wrote a speech in 1991 which speaks to the horror of the situation, even today, and describes the fear we cannot appreciate in this country.  She stated in the speech: "The effort necessary to remain uncorrupted in an environment where fear is an integral part of everyday existence is not immediately apparent to those fortunate enough to live in states governed by the rule of law".  We may congratulate ourselves on the consensus we have reached regarding the depth of the problems facing Burma&rsquo;s people but we cannot truly appreciate the horror of what they are enduring.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>I will quote further from Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s piece of 1991 because I feel it is very powerful.</P>
        <P LI="1">Saints are the sinners who go on trying.  So, free men are the oppressed who go on trying and who, in the process, make themselves fit to bear the responsibilities and to uphold the disciplines which will maintain a free society.  Among the basic freedoms to which men aspire, that their lives might be full and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an end.  People who would build a nation in which strong democratic institutions are firmly established as a guarantee against state induced power must first learn to liberate their own minds from apathy and fear.</P>
        <P>In conclusion she said</P>
        <P LI="1">Within a system which denies the existence of basic human rights fear tends to be the order of the day: fear of imprisonment, fear of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family, property or means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of isolation, fear of failure.  A most insidious form of fear is that which masquerades as common sense or even wisdom, condemning as foolish, reckless, insignificant or futile the small daily acts of courage which help to preserve man&rsquo;s self respect and inherent human dignity.  It is not easy for a people conditioned by the iron rule of the principle that might is right to free themselves from the enervating miasma of fear.  Yet even under the most crushing state machinery courage rises up again and again for fear is not the natural state of civilised man.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Could there be a more eloquent statement to the world that the daily fear on which this regime is based, recounted as recently as today and yesterday in newspapers, cannot be allowed to continue by the international community of nations?  We can no longer stand back and must use any means available, including sanctions and strong pressure on countries such as China to desist from supporting the regime.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael P. Kitt, was obliged to attend another meeting but it is encouraging to see that should a Senator depart this House the next logical step is to become a Minister.  </P>
        <P>In 1990 the opposition National League for Democracy Party won the general election in Myanmar-Burma but the military junta refused to <Col N="463"/>honour the result and placed the party leader and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest.  Recently 100,000 people began to openly protest against the military dictatorship.  The timing is crucial because the eyes of the West are now on the East due to the impending Olympic Games in China.</P>
        <P>Myanmar has a long history of close association with China, its largest trading partner and a heavy purchaser of Myanmar&rsquo;s rich natural resources.  The Chinese influence in Myanmar is powerful and, to date, it has protected Myanmar from UN sanctions and other attempted action because of the junta&rsquo;s refusal to recognise the elected government and other civil rights violations.</P>
        <P>UN sanctions do not always work and they were counter-productive in Iraq where the general population, including children, suffered as a result.  This provided a salutary lesson for the future because severe deprivation was caused by UN sanctions.  Sanctions are a blunt instrument and those against whom they are aimed often become even wealthier through the use of limited natural resources while the rest of the population, who we seek to protect, end up worse off.</P>
        <P>It is important, however, that we recognise spheres of influence.  They were evident in the Monroe Doctrine the United States applied to South America, in Tehran and when the great powers divided eastern Europe into spheres of influence.  There is no doubt that Myanmar lies within the Chinese sphere of influence.  There are severe civil rights violations in Myanmar and China has an obligation to ensure the military junta there at least stops its crackdown on innocent, peaceful protesters.  It would be difficult to request a full, democratic government in a country under the influence of China, a one party state.  Notwithstanding this, it operates in Hong Kong under two systems and there is no reason why, in an enlightened atmosphere, Chinese influence should not be brought to bear to ensure an element of democracy or at least that this repression stops.</P>
        <P>We have a long history of bringing people to account for crimes committed during terms of military dictatorship and this is evident now in the Hague where crimes committed in Kosovo and Croatia ten or 20 years ago are being tried.  It was also the case with the Nuremberg trials.  The military junta should be made aware by the international community that there is a price to be paid and that it will pay it.  During the Second World War one of the factors that limited the maltreatment of prisoners of war were leaflets dropped by the allies stating in German that any maltreatment would be dealt with subsequently by the allied powers with justice brought to bear.</P>
        <P>With regard to Burma, we should take into account different proposals made by different groups.  The Ethnic Nationalities Council in Burma has specific proposals, many of which I support, including, given the extreme suffering of <Col N="464"/>the people of Burma, the need for the violence to stop in the cities and the countryside in the seven ethnic states.  The Ethnic Nationalities Council has a particular interest in the ethnic groups.  It calls on parties in the conflict to withhold aggressive action and seek a political solution through dialogue.  It also seeks support for the UN General Assembly resolution of 1999 that calls for a tripartite dialogue between the military, the 1990 election winners, led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the ethnic nationalities to solve Burma&rsquo;s problems and build a sustainable democracy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Ethnic Nationalities Council calls for no further action on talks for a parallel government because they may be counter-productive and it also urges the international community to address the situation in the Union of Burma to assist the national reconciliation process through the good offices of the United Nations, multi-party talks, a UN Security Council resolution under chapter 6 and under chapter 7.  There are many suitable, peaceful and diplomatic solutions available to us.</P>
        <P>The international community, including our Department of Foreign Affairs, must make it clear, especially through the Chinese, who have a strong say in their sphere of influence, that any violations of civil liberties and human rights will be brought to account sooner or later.  The world will hear about these violations and people will be made answerable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Hanafin for sharing time with me and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I was amazed that on the second day this House sat a Member of the Opposition spoke aross the floor on the subject of Burma.  The Member said the Seanad discussing the situation in Burma would have the same effect as us discussing the situation in Russia in the early 1900s.  We must remember that advocacy and lobbying are powerful tools for change around the world.  I agree with Senator Bacik in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to understand a defeatist attitude from a Member.  The Oireachtas presides in Leinster House, which faces onto Merrion Square where the great liberator, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, resided when in Dublin.  He is regarded around the world as the founder of the modern day civil rights movement which has been a force for change of minds, attitudes and governments.  His example was followed by Mahatma Gandhi whose actions and leadership led to the independence of the sub-continent of India.  It was followed by Martin Luther King, whose protests brought about improved civil rights for African Americans in the United States.  It was also followed by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1968 when its members marched in Derry.  The actions of these people led to great change, but change did not come about in a matter of days, weeks, months or years.  Sometimes, as in our case, it took centuries.</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>The junta in Burma could be on its last legs and it is important the Government and the United Nations keep up the pressure on it.  Even on a small scale, lobbying and government pressure can be a great force for change.  For example, the brother of a man sentenced to death in Pakistan said his family was indebted to the people who campaigned for the release of his brother, Mirza Hussein.  He said the actions of those who wrote letters and stood in the rain with placards meant his death sentence was commuted and he was released.  If people took the same attitude as some Opposition Members, that man would have died.  If people in the House believe we can do nothing, we will do nothing.</P>
        <P>Lobbying was also effective in Haiti and China.  Over a period of five and a half years, more than 100,000 letters were sent to the Chinese Government calling for the release of Rebiya Kadeer.  When she was released, she thanked all those who lobbied on her behalf.  When we see how effective the lobbying of individuals around the world has been, it beggars belief that a Senator would have the attitude that anything we might do would be a waste of time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Robert Kennedy spoke of apartheid in South Africa on 6 June 1966.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped.  Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While we on our own will not change the situation in Burma, I commend the Government on its actions and on bringing pressure to bear, not only on the Burmese military junta, but also on the Chinese Government.  I also commend it on its work with the United Nations and the European Union.  We in the Seanad should add our weight to these calls and demands for change in Burma.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue and to follow what Senator Mark Daly has said.  We do not fool ourselves that passing this motion, even on an all-party basis, will have the slightest effect on the Burmese junta.  It does not listen to the United Nations, the European Union nor its regional neighbours in the ASEAN community.  It certainly will not listen to the views of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This makes it all the more important for us to continue passing resolutions such this and not to lose sight of the important need to bear witness against injustice.  Everybody in the House who has spoken on the issue agrees with that.  We must continue passing resolutions, even when bearing witness has no immediate prospect of <Col N="466"/>achieving tangible results.  As long as injustice continues, we must continue to lobby against it.</P>
        <P>In the case of Burma-Myanmar, we have no problem with maintaining a policy of opposition to what is taking place there.  We can maintain this policy because we have no commercial relationship with the country.  We have nothing to lose, therefore, by offending the junta.  I cannot help but reflect on the difference between that attitude and our attitude to China in this respect.  I visited China in July for the first time after many years.  China is moving away from a regime of personal intimidation towards the individual, but at a very slow pace.  However, the size of our commercial interests in China mean we are quite reticent about encouraging China to move at a swifter pace.  This is somewhat ironic because China is one of the two large states &mdash; the other being India &mdash; fighting over Burma&rsquo;s natural resources.  They are also the only two states to which the Burmese junta has any incentive to listen.  It would be quite bizarre if we ended up thanking the Chinese for persuading the Burmese junta to make changes and see some sense.</P>
        <P>When the ASEAN community invited Burma to join it in 1997, there was a feeling that it should not be allowed join because it was not seen to be a democratic state.  The argument then for its admission was that it was better to be able to influence Burma from within rather than from without.  Look, for example, at what happened in the case of Libya.  A case was made to try to persuade it to change and it did.  There are also signs of North Korea moving to a more acceptable level of recognition of rights.</P>
        <P>Aung San Suu Kyi has been supported worldwide in what she has done.  The Dalai Lama supports her, as does Bishop Tutu and others who recognise there is a challenge to be faced.  We must continue to condemn the junta and what it is doing.  Our voice may not be loud but it will add to the continuous drip of criticism.  If we can manage to influence other countries, including Japan which has interests in the area, and particularly China and India, and convince them to use their pressure to influence the junta, it is possible we can achieve some success.  This may seem impossible when we see what has happened recently, but I urge the Seanad to continue to make these efforts and to put the spotlight on Burma in the hope that even small steps forward will prove successful in the long term.</P>

        <P>In welcoming this motion I am particularly conscious of the power of the steadfast individual and the small nation, especially when accompanied by perceived moral authority.  There is no doubt that Ireland has that perceived moral authority, which it exercises on many occasions independently and courageously.  As a small nation, we have often led the bigger nations on the road to justice, of which there are many instances.</P>
        <P>What we are dealing with in Burma is typical of what we have seen from malign military juntas which were not prepared to recognise the rights or democratic will of the people.  When the people demand those rights in a peaceful but powerful manner, of which there are many instances throughout the world, they are oppressed and killed.  Every effort is made to ensure their cause will be misrepresented, misunderstood and unreported.  Burma is a typical example.  We need only look at what has happened in that regard.  Something that has given me great hope is that from day one our Minister stepped into the breach and in an unequivocal manner demonstrated clearly what the Government expected from Burma and the United Nations.  The motion before us is unequivocal.  That is important.  This has been the position of the Government during the years.</P>
        <P>At the time of the unilateral invasion of Iraq &mdash; some Members will know this &mdash; a few of us put our heads above the parapet and made it clear that we considered the invasion, without the imprimatur of the United Nations, to be unjust and immoral.  We continued to make that point here, even at a time when 75% of the American people were satisfied with what was happening.  The current position is that less than 30% are now prepared to condone or endorse what has happened in Iraq.  We made that point at the time and went out on a limb for no reason other than to give a voice to logic and democracy because it was clear that the invasion represented the wrong step and would leave chaos in its wake, such as we had seen in Vietnam.  Many would say we were like dwarfs speaking through a megaphone, which I never believed.  I have always believed every word we utter in this House is read by some agency of government, including the Burmese.  We should have no doubt about this.  I know because I made a comment in the past 12 months recently in a particular case and a renowned judge queried subsequently who I was to have made it.  The same is true internationally.  It can be taken for granted that somebody, on behalf of the Burmese, is sifting through what we say.  Therefore, we should not regard this as an exercise which will lead nowhere.</P>
        <P>What is important &mdash; I believe another Member touched on this &mdash; is that when media interest has lessened in this issue, we should <Col N="468"/>endeavour to keep it alive.  That is the only hope for the democratic movement in Burma.  A dictatorship such as the one in Burma cannot exist, continue, expand and ignore so many other democratic principles unless it is receiving succour from bigger nations.  In every single instance of conflict the vested interests will always be found on the periphery.</P>
        <P>China has been mentioned.  It is gradually emerging into the light of democracy, for which it should be praised and saluted.  The Olympic Games should not be used as a pawn in this game because the games in China will be a watershed in the emergence of that nation emerging into democracy.  There is a possibility, however, that Ireland could exert greater influence on China than any other large country because to this day the Chinese remember the support they received from the Government when they sought the United Nations status they now enjoy.  I have been to China on several occasions and the name of Frank Aiken has come up on many occasions.  When they wanted our vote to secure a seat at the Security Council, they got it.  It must be borne in mind that that is the way powers work and Ireland, undoubtedly, will be in a position, diplomatically and otherwise, to exert an influence.</P>
        <P>The same is true of India because one only has to consider the number of leaders in India, both military and political, who were educated by the Irish Christian Brothers.  Recently, a group in India were celebrating the centenary of the Christian Brothers in India which was attended by the chief-of-staff and the Deputy Prime Minister.  The same is also true of South Korea where the Columban Fathers continue to enjoy a status today because of their education system.  That is the road to travel.  We must use that influence and call in that to which we are entitled.  We have one major asset in that regard.  We never colonised any other country.  All we ever did was send peacekeeping forces to help in areas experiencing difficulties.  We sent missionaries to help where the provision of education services was required.  Many of our emigrants were the architects of the new legislatures in those developing democracies.  If we bear all of this in mind, we have huge power which we should never underestimate.</P>
        <P>Nothing has given me greater satisfaction in the House than to see a joint motion being tabled and Members not being partisan or scoring political points on intrinsic issues such as human rights.  That will not be lost on observers outside the House.  We often talk about expanding its role.  I genuinely hope several more cross-party issues will come before the House on which we will not be looking for kudos but rather trying to demonstrate solidarity with those who will be vulnerable at a given time.  Burma is one example.  There will be many others.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Many of us will have travelled to Asia and seen at first hand the dignity and ser<Col N="469"/>enity of Buddhist monks but when they become the enemy within, as they have become in Burma, we know there is something seriously wrong with that state.  These peaceful people are protesting for their dignity and it is up to us to show solidarity with them in their fight.  Burmese campaigner and political prisoner, Aung San Suu Kyi, summed up the spirit of the monks when she stated: &ldquo;The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear&rdquo;.  The BBC news agency recently reported that 4,000 monks had disappeared from Burma.  Internet access has ceased.  This reminds me of a situation 20 years ago when communications from Rangoon ceased.  It reminds me also of the protests in Tiananmen Square when news reports ceased.  It is impossible in such situations to know the exact number who have been imprisoned, killed or injured but we know something very serious is happening.</P>
        <P>The motion must be a statement to the Irish people to support the campaign against the junta and defend the actions of the oppressed people in Burma.  It must also be a statement to the European Union and the nations of the world.  However, it is all very well passing motions; we must see action taken on foot of them.  I want action taken by the House and the Government.</P>
        <P>Unlike some of my colleagues, I tend to agree with the Burmese campaign groups which state a carrot can be used, as well as a stick.  Since 1988 many investments have been made in the country.  The major trading partners are Asian countries, with Japan purchasing timber in exchange for transport goods and commodities and China investing heavily in the country.</P>
        <P>Some Senators have mentioned a boycott of the Olympic games.  I remember the boycott of the Moscow Olympics in 1980 over the invasion of Afghanistan.  The Russians blithely ignored the protests but, having been in China several times, I know the Chinese are less likely to want to lose face on this issue.  There is a window of opportunity because the threat exists that the Olympics may be boycotted.  I would not like to see it happen but we should use the threat to make the Chinese Government take action in Burma.</P>
        <P>We should take action in other countries that are closer to home.  Natural gas accounts for 90% of fossil fuel production in Burma and the French oil company Total has invested heavily in the country.  The French Government should introduce economic sanctions.  In Ireland we could identify companies trading with Burma to put pressure on them to cease trading.</P>
        <P>Wholesale change is vital in Burma but it will not come easily; it will certainly not come from motions passed in western Parliaments.  We must encourage them to change,  however, because the outside world can help a new Burma develop from the deplorable regime currently in power.  We can do this by offering additional investment to a new Burma, by providing debt relief and increasing aid packages.  That should only be done, however, if change comes.  It must be con<Col N="470"/>tingent on a new Burma emerging from the present system.  We have seen repressive regimes change in the past, South Africa being a notable example.  By sending a clear message to the regime hopefully we will see change in Burma.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; r&aacute;ite sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, ruda&iacute; at&aacute; t&aacute;bhachtach.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; ar fad n&aacute; go bhfuil d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn sa Teach seo.  D&uacute;irt Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Daly agus &Oacute; Murch&uacute; c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; s&eacute; go mbeadh daoine sna t&iacute;ortha beaga ag cur a gcuid machnamh isteach in &aacute;bhair th&aacute;bhachtacha mar seo.  There is a long tradition of recognition of the importance of the influence of representatives of smaller countries.  This is an incremental debate happening in small countries throughout the world so that in international fora such as the United Nations it is not left to the huge nations of the world to influence this decision.  The Irish representative, whether he be the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an ambassador, can state that the Houses in our Parliament unanimously supported movement on the matter.  That is important.</P>
        <P>I cannot add much to what has been said about Burma but I would like to raise the issue of China.  It is the most important player in this area.  When I look at Asia, two things stand out.  India is a democracy of 1 billion people who have been voting in democratic elections for 60 years.  No other country with such underdeveloped regions has managed to do that.  China, however, is blatantly in breach of every regulation we hold dear in the civilised word, be they regulations related to environmental or health and safety standards or civil rights.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Senator Norris that we should use the Olympic games as leverage in this area but I also do not agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn iad a &uacute;s&aacute;id in aon chor.  Caithfidh go dtuigfimid seo &mdash; fad agus at&aacute;<?oasys _jy ?>sportspeople from all over the world involved in activities in China, down the road there are harmless, innocent, non-violent groups, such as Falun Gong, that have no interest in undermining the Government, or causing difficulties to the state, that are not even religious in nature but simply oppose violence, that are being persecuted, imprisoned and used for medical experiments and organ harvesting.  We in Ireland should bring that to people&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>Next week the Olympic torch will pass through Ireland and I will take that opportunity to remind the Chinese Government what it is doing in the same way that we are reminding the Burmese Government.  We must make our views known on these situations.  Over 100,000 people went out on the streets of this country to show their abhorrence at the invasion of Iraq.  None us expected that number of people, they came out of nowhere.  We thought the usual crowd would turn up but it was multiplied 1,000 fold.  It is important to know that represented people&rsquo;s views.  We <Col N="471"/>must incrementally put together the views of others like us who are not world powers to influence developments.</P>
        <P>As we look forward to a debate on Europe next year, this will be an important issue.  We have never had a real debate on neutrality.  I come from a left wing position on this but I have argued with members of both the left and the right about the meaning of neutrality and what we should do when we see something wrong.  Should we be proud that we stood back while Hitler was killing millions of Jews?  Should we be proud that we did nothing while Pol Pot killed off hundreds of thousands of intellectuals?  Can we tell our grandchildren that we were pure, virginal and neutral?  Is that what we mean by our neutrality?  I do not think so.  Neutrality has an active imperative that requires us to act to express our feelings.  I would like to see that debate take place next year in a way that will recognise, protect and respect Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty.  The two are not mutually exclusive.</P>
        <P>This debate was important and I thank the Deputy Leader of the House for responding so quickly for requests from this side of the House for such a discussion, in spite of what Members on the Government side said this morning.  It is important that we state our views on these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a delicate issue that has caused a great deal of anxiety among pharmacists.  It relates particularly to medical card holders.</P>
        <P>When artificial prices are being imposed or negotiated between various State bodies, it is important that there be a minimum of interference.  In a situation where the State, rightly, has decided that medical card holders must be subsidised, a difficult negotiation between various bodies results, in this case the HSE, the wholesalers and the pharmacists.  The issue to be decided upon is the mark-up that is taken by various bodies and the eventual profit that pharmacists actually receive.  As the Minister knows, the mark-up wholesalers receive from the HSE on drugs supplied to pharmacies for medical card patients is to be reduced next year from 17.65% to 8%.  In January 2009, the figure will be reduced further to 7%.  I do not know where these figures came from and I have heard no rational reason <Col N="472"/>why it was ever set at 17.65%, or why it is now being reduced to 8% and then to 7%.  Admittedly, there is a difficulty when one introduces figures of this sort, which tend to be arbitrary.</P>
        <P>However, the decision to do so arbitrarily, without consultation with the pharmacists, is wrong.  It shows a misconception of where pharmacists make money.  They make money on the medicines they dispense to medical card patients through deals they negotiate with wholesalers.  It is a complicated series of circular transactions, but initially they got a proportion of the 17.65% that wholesalers received.  As I understand it, it was up to individual pharmacists to negotiate their own deal with the wholesalers, after which they would be reimbursed by the HSE.  This new measure will reduce pharmacists&rsquo; profits by half or more.  It is difficult to say, but it appears that from the lobbying of many pharmacists, some of them will be asked to sell at a loss.  If so, we cannot ask them to continue to operate in this fashion.  They maintain the new measure will force them to cut corners and reduce overheads.</P>
        <P>An additional difficulty is that many pharmacists are claiming the effect of this measure &mdash; and we are only talking about medical card holders &mdash; will be to threaten closure of pharmacies in the most vulnerable areas where customers include elderly and poor medical card holders.  If pharmacists are not making money from selling medicines to medical card holders, the majority, or a large percentage, of their business will be lost.  As a result, if what they are saying is correct, it will mean the most vulnerable medical card holders will not have pharmacies in their areas.  Therefore, those who are least capable of doing so will have to travel much further to access pharmaceutical services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I applaud the fact that the HSE is seeking to cut costs in all sorts of areas, but there is no justification for the executive to cut costs if it means the most vulnerable will suffer.  The HSE has many problems and there are many areas in which costs could be cut. However, if cuts are made to payments to pharmacists, who are not popular and it is a slightly populist measure, thus forcing them to reduce overheads while operating in a competitive market, the result will be that the weakest consumers may suffer.  The Minister is cutting costs in the wrong place.  I ask her to examine whether there is room for renegotiating this arbitrary cut.  She should consider asking the HSE not to implement cuts in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to take this Adjournment matter.  When I saw this item on my private secretary&rsquo;s desk earlier today, I said that it could not possibly be from Senator Ross.  I thought he must have made a mistake because I did not believe the consumer&rsquo;s champion could possible table such a motion.  Senator Ross and I are good friends.  We attended Trinity College together and I have strongly defended him in many places <Col N="473"/>because I support many of the matters he has pursued.  If he were to ask his friends, the auctioneers, about this, however, they would tell him that retail pharmacies sell for three times their annual turnover.  In the retail sector, pharmacies and pubs are the businesses that make most money, although I understand that publicans are under some pressure.</P>
        <P>There were no negotiations with the wholesale sector and there is no agreement because there can be no agreement or negotiation.  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children engaged in discussions with the wholesale sector.  During the course of those discussions the sector brought forward legal advice to say that we could not engage with them because it would amount to price fixing and a breach of competition law.  When the HSE got its own advice and the Department received advice from the Attorney General, they found that was the case and therefore we were not in a position to negotiate with the wholesale or retail sectors.</P>
        <P>Over the past ten years, the price of drugs has risen by 370%, which is more than two and a half times the rate of inflation in the same period.  In 2006, drugs cost us &euro;1.57 billion, the fastest growing cost in the health services.  There are a number of components in that cost.  In the first instance, there is the ex-factory price.  We negotiated a new arrangement with the EPHA which will save approximately &euro;260 million over the next four years.  A price was set for the wholesale sector which, as Senator Ross said, is 8% from 1 January 2008 and 7% from 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>The wholesale margin in Ireland is twice what it is in any other European country.  Drugs are more expensive in Ireland than anywhere else and even though the ex-factory price is around the middle of the range of such prices elsewhere, we are at the top when it comes to cost.  That is because of the wholesale margin, which is double the cost elsewhere, and because of the way we remunerate pharmacists.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the latter point.  I am a strong fan of ensuring people have a fair return for their efforts, whether they are professionals or in other business sectors generally.  I am a strong supporter of entrepreneurship in the public and private sectors.  There is no question of seeking to put anyone out of business.  On the contrary, as a result of the liberalisation of our law, pharmacists from throughout Europe can practise in this country, including many of our graduates who could not train in Ireland when there was only one such school in Trinity College with 25 places annually.  We now have a second pharmacy school in Cork.  Many Irish people had to go abroad to qualify as pharmacists but when they returned, they could not open a pharmacy.  We have changed the law in that respect.</P>
        <P>We reimburse pharmacists in two ways: through the General Medical Service scheme and the drug payment scheme or DPS.  As regards the GMS scheme, we pay between &euro;3.27 and &euro;18.83 <Col N="474"/>per item per dispensing fee.  For the DPS, we pay from &euro;2.86 to &euro;32.90 per item.  On top of all that, pharmacists in the latter scheme get a 50% mark-up.  It is clearly unacceptable that there should be such a mark-up in addition to the money coming back from the wholesale margin, which is roughly 9%.</P>
        <P>I understand that a meeting will be held today under the process overseen by Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC.  In the dialogue that is under way, we want to separate the price of the commodity, where we will save &euro;660 million over the next four years, from the professional fee we pay to pharmacists to dispense it.  We want a better balance between both schemes.  One that is based on a 50% mark-up, so the more expensive the drug the bigger the fee, is clearly not acceptable.  In that scenario there is a big incentive to dispense more expensive drugs.</P>
        <P>The big beneficiaries of the new regime will be those in the most deprived areas where there is a large GMS practice and perhaps not as many DPS or private patients.  These include areas such as Donegal, certain other counties and the more disadvantaged parts of Dublin and other large cities.  I hope as a result of the dialogue under way that those new arrangements can be put into effect soon.</P>
        <P>I understand people say that from 1 December, GMS patients will not get their drugs.  It would be a great pity if contracts were breached in that way and the most vulnerable patients in our society were to suffer.  No pharmacist has informed the Health Service Executive that it does not intend to dispense medicine to GMS patients from 1 December.  Pharmacists are required under contract to give three months&rsquo; notice in writing if they are not going to honour their contracts.</P>
        <P>Methadone is not part of the contract and some pharmacists will not dispense it from tomorrow.  The HSE will have to put alternative arrangements in place through its clinic network.  This affects a vulnerable weak group of people.  I appeal to pharmacists not to use the most vulnerable and the weakest in our society in the dialogue.</P>
        <P>We want to reduce the cost of medicine which is rising for demographic reasons entailing new medicines and treatments.  The &euro;660 million we will take out over four years simply slows down the increase because the cost has been rising at a rate of approximately 11% per annum.  The regime that was in place in this country was almost unique and resulted in consumers, at the top of the class of all 27 European countries, paying more for their drugs than those elsewhere.  We ranked in the middle band for ex-factory prices.  Nobody could stand over that and it is not in the interests of the health system, the patients or consumers.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross represents Trinity graduates and, until recently, all pharmacy graduates had to come from Trinity.  Even his better judgment, <Col N="475"/>however, must agree with what we are trying to do.  The HSE has my full support and that of the Government in the efforts it is making to garner more money to provide more services for patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Will she consider this matter again if as a result of this measure those who depend on medical cardholders for a large percentage of their business suffer and close or do not offer the necessary service, in which case the most vulnerable members of society will suffer?  The possibility of those circumstances arising has been spelt out to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  That is not to say that if vulnerable people suffer, I will not take notice.  The pharmacists will receive between &euro;3.25 and &euro;18.40 per item they dispense.  There might be three items on a prescription or only one.  We want to achieve a better balance between the way they are paid on the GMS, for which they receive the professional fee, and the DPMS, for which they get a fee and a 50% mark-up.  We want to re-balance that and separate the price of the commodity from the professional fee.  Nobody would understand it if we paid doctors some kind of mark-up towards their salaries on <Col N="476"/>the basis of what they prescribe.  We want to pay the pharmacists a professional fee and separate that from the price of the commodity.  There is no question of the pharmacists paying more for the drugs than they will receive, a suggestion I have read in the newspapers and have heard from people who have contacted me.  There is no question of that happening.  How could that be the case?</P>
        <P>This is a challenging time for health reform and we must all play our part.  This is a key area of the reform.  We must also reform the way in which we remunerate general practitioners.  We have almost concluded the consultants&rsquo; contract.  Now we must deal with dentists and so on.  Every morning when I wake up I hear about the disaster in the health services and ask myself where is the &euro;15 billion going.  We must provide a more responsive way of remunerating pharmacists than that we have used until now.  Everybody would agree that is preferable.  It is unusual that a 17% mark-up for the wholesalers should be double the mark-up in other European countries.  The reason for that is that half of it goes back to the pharmacists.  We believe in paying them a professional fee so that they do not depend on the price of the commodity to earn their income or on the payback from the wholesale sector.</P>
