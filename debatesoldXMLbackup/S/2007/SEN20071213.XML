    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion establishing the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, statements on the Government&rsquo;s integration policy, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude no later than 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for closing comments and to respond to questions from spokespersons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of pieces of legislation were rushed through the previous D&aacute;il before its end.  These were the Pharmacy Bill and Bills concerning the new Medical Council and new nursing home standards.  Could the Leader find out whether these pieces of legislation have even been implemented or if their commencement orders have been signed?  There is considerable concern about what is happening in nursing homes and other institutions.  We rushed the legislation dealing with these issues through both Houses just before the previous general election but we do not seem to have the standards in place and the work does not seem to be carried out.  We have done this to protect elderly and young people in institutions throughout the State yet, even today, we discover reports which clearly state that these institutions are not being inspected.  Why have we gone to the trouble of debating these issues and pushing the necessary legislation through only to find out that the Departments involved simply are doing nothing about it?  I would like the Leader to find out what is happening in respect of these specific pieces of legislation and these very important issues.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the link between alcohol and suicide, which has been known about for years.  We see reports again today regarding the <Col N="190"/>considerable effect alcohol and binge drinking have on teenagers.  Why have we failed in respect of this issue?  Perhaps we need to bring the Minister involved to the House to discuss this issue because young people are binge drinking to a greater extent than before and there is a very clear link between binge drinking and suicide.  We need to bring the Minister in to discuss that issue and why we are failing so much in respect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will be aware that the Minister for Education and Science recently decided to circulate a copy of a book on the first president of Fianna F&aacute;il to every school in Ireland.  I will state an interest.  The author of the book, Diarmuid Ferriter, is a friend and supporter of mine.  I am happy that this was done for him.  That is not the issue I raised.  I am an Independent Senator who takes an independent view.  The biography of the first president of Fine Gael, General Eoin O&rsquo;Duffy, by Fearghal McGarry is also a very fine book.  Is the Minister thinking of circulating this book to schools in the interests of balance?  I am sure the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>One would get great money for libraries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not object at all to the circulation of a well-written book, namely, Diarmuid Ferriter&rsquo;s book on de Valera.  That is not the issue here.  The issue is that it can and is being perceived as showing a lack of balance.  This is important.  I fought for many years to get more books into schools so I am not going to argue in this House against sending books to schools.  If it is going to be done in this way, however, which is perceived to be possibly biased, we should also balance it in another way by sending the biography of Eoin O&rsquo;Duffy to schools.  I am not sure whether Fine Gael would feel as strongly about it as I would.  I am looking at it in the interests of balance.</P>
        <P>On a related issue, the cost to schools of water has been raised in the other House and other places.  It was raised recently in the Lower House by the former leader of the Opposition in this House, Deputy Brian Hayes.  The costs for primary and post-primary schools seem appalling.  The books being sent out could be seen to promote Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The summer projects for schools is being ended, a matter raised by Senator Buttimer.  The Cathaoirleach and I discussed this issue many years ago.  When schools needed work done on the buildings they needed to complete a complex procedure.  People decided that it would be better if this could be done locally.  A new system was set up, where people would have to deal with all <Col N="191"/>the bells and whistles and the different levels of quality.  They could then manage it locally, with grants available.  In order to do so, engineers&rsquo; reports, architects&rsquo; reports, builders&rsquo; reports and various other reports were needed before the schools qualified for a grant.  It worked very well and efficiently, giving quality, value, local involvement and volunteerism.  The Minister has pulled the plug on the scheme.</P>
        <P>Not only are schools losing out by not having projects completed but they are losing money.  They spent the last year getting engineers&rsquo; reports, architects&rsquo; reports, builders&rsquo; reports and various other reports in order to apply for the grant.  This is counterproductive and does not save money.  Schools will become run down, it will cost more next year and we must undergo the whole rigamarole again.  I ask for the Minister to explain this to the House so that we can show her that this does not make economic sense, apart from the lack of education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those welcoming the signing of the Lisbon reform treaty.  Since Ireland joined the EEC, as it was then, in the early 70s the country has been transformed utterly, largely because of our membership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Not largely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The structures in place to run the EEC in the early 1970s are largely outdated and more suited to running a group of ten countries than 27.  It must be changed and this is the focus of the treaty.  Most people in the House have read the treaty and are generally in favour of it but we must guard against complacency if we hope to have the referendum passed.  We see the start of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign today, with people selling their message outside the gates of Leinster House.  One of today&rsquo;s tabloid newspapers has started a campaign against the treaty.  It has been reported that Mr. Jean Marie Le Pen, of the Front National party in France, has stated he will come to Ireland to fight against the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, will be well able for him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Europe has brought stability, democracy, peace and economic growth.  The Leader will agree that it is up to everyone, on both sides of the House, to explain why this treaty will bring benefits to Ireland and to ensure it is passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey referred to suicide.  A strong correlation has been proved between alcohol consumption and suicide.  In many cases there are traces of alcohol present <Col N="192"/>in the victim.  Last evening I attended a seminar in the audio visual room, organised by Senator Mary White.  It was very interesting and I commend the Senator for her innovative approach.  This is an issue for society that will not go away if we close our eyes.  We must face facts.</P>
        <P>I spent a long time with people who had a suicidal ideation.  I must confess that after 30 years in a service that dealt with potential suicide cases, I was as wise beginning as when I left because every suicide is different.  The risk associated with young males is seven times that of females of the same age category, a worrying factor.  The talk by a member of Meath County Council was very fine, relating her experience concerning suicide.  I ask the Leader and Senator White to arranged a debate in the new year.  We have had debates here before.  I was part of the Oireachtas sub-committee on suicide.  Although I do not say so because I was a member, the report we published was worthwhile.</P>
        <P>I raised the question of organ donation on two occasions.  A gentleman in Westmeath telephones me <i>ad nauseam</i> on this matter.  His contention &mdash; and he is right &mdash; is that our approach to organ donation infers burying life with death.  Important organs that could help others live are interred.  I know something about the issue, having lost a sister and a brother to road fatalities.  The issues to which I refer could be dealt with in the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of comments by Senator Corrigan yesterday and the comments of an eminent person working in the disability sector, Ms Deirdre Carroll of Inclusion Ireland this morning, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, for a debate on the inspection of residential homes for vulnerable children with disabilities.  It is startling that it is 13 years since Inclusion Ireland called for the introduction of a national standard of inspection of residential centres, which has not been established.  I ask that this be placed on the agenda urgently.  It is a matter of grave concern to those working in the sector and to parents.</P>
        <P>In support of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s views on Government&rsquo;s U-turn on education, I ask that we revisit the education debate.  The Minister attended the House before the budget but the landscape has changed since then.  The commitment on class sizes has been rolled back, the commitment to the summer work scheme has been lost and it is imperative to have a debate on education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the 4,000 cultural diversity packs given to primary schools this week to help overcome the idea of segregation and to promote integration.  This is linked to class sizes, with 1,800 primary school teachers just teaching English to non-national children try<Col N="193"/>ing to integrate in our primary schools.  This is putting pressure on existing resources.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the library moneys given by the Minister to schools.  On the question of whether the de Valera book should be sent to schools, we are trying to promote student interest in politics.  Some two-thirds of people polled know nothing about the EU treaty.  Not only should we dispense library money and many kinds of books we must examine how to get children to read material relevant to their future and how to make this material relevant to them.  We could debate how to make politics more relevant to younger people.</P>
        <P>Many schools have done good work on the green schools initiative.  Much support is given to domestic homes for wood chip boilers.  Many schools are considering installing a wind turbine to reduce energy costs.  There is a great deal we could do in terms of promoting, in a positive fashion, the work of schools through our policies on the green agenda.  That matter might be worthy of a debate at some stage.</P>
        <P>The concept of regional development is close to my heart.  This is a matter about which we must have a debate.  The north west is pandered to by people discussing developing cross-Border access.  At the most recent meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council at which transport was discussed, the Dublin-Derry train service was again ignored.  The meeting to which I refer concentrated only on the Dublin to Belfast train service.  I was disappointed and disillusioned earlier when I received a letter from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, via the Minister, indicating that it still has no real interest in developing a Dublin-Derry train service.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about North-South co-operation, INTERREG funding and funding for projects in locations where there is more than one Government involved, we should engage in a debate on true North-South co-operation by encouraging our northern counterparts, who are responsible for the current lack of progress, to promote an all-Ireland train service.  In that context, there is a need to invest in the Derry to Coleraine section of the Derry-Dublin line.  Colleagues do not realise that it is possible to travel by train from Dublin to Derry.  The difficulty, however, is that there has been such a lack of political will to upgrade the line, particularly that section to which I refer, that there are not enough passing points to make the line a reality.  That is all that is involved.</P>
        <P>It is lovely that we are upgrading the Dublin-Belfast line on a continual basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not lovely.  It has taken a long period to upgrade that line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The upgrade to which I refer has taken place at the expense of a regionally disadvantaged area.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the first non-Government motion on the Order Paper in the name of the Independent Senators regarding the status of charities etc., perhaps the Leader will indicate when legislation will be forthcoming.  We were promised legislation to make charities more accountable, to regulate their activities and so forth.  In saying this, I am not trying to be a Scrooge.  I have just posted ten cheques to various charities.  However, I strongly object to being unable to walk the streets of this city without being ambushed on every corner by those collecting for charity.  Between my home at one end of O&rsquo;Connell Street and this House, I am frequently the subject of seven or eight demands for money.  Today, the ISPCC is collecting.  Serious concerns were previously raised about that organisation and its attitude towards money.  I am not impugning those who currently run the ISPCC but we must examine the possibility of regulating this area.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the extremely sensitive intervention of Senator Glynn on the subject of suicide and to place it in another context.  I refer here to the impact of bullying on young people.  The tragic case in Cork was raised on the Order of Business earlier in the week.  A number of Members on all sides have highlighted the fact that a serious situation regarding bullying has arisen in the context of people using gay or homophobic slurs.  The victims of such bullying may be neither gay nor homophobic.  However, 80% of bullying in primary schools carries a homophobic element and in 80% of such incidents the school authorities do nothing.  The reason for the latter is that the schools are covered by the exemptions gained by all the churches from the provisions of the Equality Act.  In circumstances where young people are being driven to suicide, that is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>On a slightly lighter note, my colleague and esteemed and dear friend, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, was being slightly mischievous when he suggested that copies of the biography of Eoin O&rsquo;Duffy be circulated.  I do not believe the Senator has the best interests of Fine Gael at heart in this regard.  I would strongly object to the book being circulated because O&rsquo;Duffy was an egomaniacal, alcoholic, sexually confused person who had a long passionate relationship with the late Miche&aacute;l MacLiamm&oacute;ir.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not consider the late General Eoin O&rsquo;Duffy, in the absence of a more appropriate and positive example, a suitable role model for impressionable, young gay people.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="195"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter has nothing to do with today&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of debate is taking place at present regarding the European reform treaty.  I welcome the coverage in the media today which suggests that the Government is willing to back Pat Cox, former President of the European Parliament, as the chair of a group to which President Nicolas Sarkozy referred as a council of wise men on the future of Europe.  However, I ask the Leader to convey a number of concerns I have about this matter to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche.</P>
        <P>One of the concerns to which I refer relates to the fact that we are referring to a group of wise men.  The idea that a small group of men in suits might decide the future of Europe smacks of elitism and it is a far cry from the gender and other equality policies the European Union has advocated for so long.  I ask that the Leader convey to the Minister of State the fact that Ireland and its Government should clearly seek balanced gender representation on any council debating and discussing the future of the European Union.</P>
        <P>We should also convey our concerns regarding the potentially elitist nature of this process of deliberation on the future of the European Union.  Why should a small group of experienced politicians decide the future of Europe in the absence of meaningful consultation with its citizens?  The purpose of the reform treaty is to improve matters and bring citizens closer to the European Union.  This process will not do any such thing unless parallel processes that actively involve the national Parliaments and civil societies of each of the member states are built in.  Will the Leader convey my concerns to the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and request that the Government raise the points I have made with the Council of Ministers in order that there might be a more balanced gender representation on the group to which I refer and also that there might be more involvement on the part of citizens in any deliberations on the future of the European Union?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s final point, the group in question is referred to as a &ldquo;reflective group&rdquo;.  There seems to be a suggestion that this group might be somehow undesirable.  In that context, one need only consider the achievements of the group chaired by Jim Dooge, former Cathaoirleach of this House.  The Dooge report, which was produced by that group, formed the basis of the Single European Act, which transformed the European Union.  I accept the Senator&rsquo;s concerns on the issue of balance.  However, to suggest that there should not be a reflective group is really to suggest that we should not engage in research on any issue concerning <Col N="196"/>Europe or otherwise.  It would be an extremely positive development to have a group of experts to look forward to the end game in respect of the European Union.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I called for a debate on the national debt and the nation&rsquo;s finances.  I wish to correct the Leader, who acceded to a debate on the budget, because I requested that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, come before the House to engage in a debate on the national debt and the nation&rsquo;s finances.  I wish to outline the motivation behind my request.   Under the Tallaght strategy put forward by Alan Dukes and in the form of the Government led by John Bruton in the 1990s, we worked hard to get the national finances in order and to reverse the near bankruptcy the country experienced during the Haughey era.</P>

	<P>What about the period 1982 to 1987?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been successful in that regard.  However, loose budgetary discipline and uncontrolled expenditure in recent years have brought us back into an era of deficits and increases in the national debt, both in absolute and percentage terms.  It is this aspect about which I am specifically concerned and I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on it.</P>
        <P>I previously called for a debate on standards in public office and I understand the Leader has acceded to my request in this regard.  I do not propose to mention the Mahon tribunal because I know that doing so upsets certain people in the House.</P>

	<P>However, I wish to raise one point regarding a statement made by my constituency colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who stated that Ministers must be paid well in order that they will not be susceptible to outside interference.  I was surprised and disturbed by this statement because we have been assured on many occasions that the bad old days of Fianna F&aacute;il corruption were gone.  However, the Minister was speaking in a current context and she raised the issue of outside interference.  What is the objective basis of her statement?Are there cases where Ministers were approached with suggestions of offers of moneys to corrupt decisions?</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>It is important to know what gave rise to this comment.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is saying, in reality, that Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers must be paid in order not to accept bribes.  I question whether that is official party policy or official Government policy.</P>

	<P>Christmas is a particularly joyous occasion for most people.  However, for those who have lost loved ones it can be a very sad and lonely occasion.  It is a particularly difficult time for one group of people, the families of missing persons.  Those families are in limbo.  They obviously hope for the best but perhaps fear the worst.  In the main, they have had to carry out their own inquiries and investigations.  They have travelled to bus stations, railways stations and other public areas and put up posters in the hope that they will get some information.  The posters are pretty faded but the torment still continues.</P>
        <P>Ireland has had a particularly high proportion of missing persons.  There must be people who have information on some of these cases.  Would it not be a lovely Christmas present for a family <Col N="198"/>if somebody came forward with good news or even if it is bad news, it would give the families an opportunity to grieve properly?  We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand on this issue.  It is not only a question of one or two cases.</P>
        <P>I have been in communication with one family for quite a long time.  They lost a daughter.  She was on her way from Dublin and disappeared.  The lives of the members of that family have completely and utterly changed.  It is important for us to do anything we can to help these families.  In the past I called for resources from Government and they were provided.  A missing persons task force was set up and resources were provided to the Garda.  Some individuals, not necessarily the people who were directly involved, must have some information.  If this message gets out, I make an appeal that at least somebody would come forward to try to help to resolve some of these cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>We learnt recently of the introduction of long-stay charges applying to intellectually disabled people in a residential or community setting.  A charge of &euro;120 per week in a residential setting and &euro;90 per week in a community setting applies when a registered nurse attends the person concerned, even if it the nurse&rsquo;s attendance is only of five minutes duration or if it is a regular feature of the person&rsquo;s treatment.  Such charges do not apply when a health care assistant or social care worker attends the person concerned.  I call for a debate on this issue with the relevant Minister.  To deny intellectually disabled people treatment by a professional nurse because a charge applies for that service is not the correct way to proceed and it does not represent equal treatment.  I would be pleased if the Leader would allow a debate on this matter. </P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senator&rsquo;s call for a debate and some of what he said about the former Fine Gael Leader, Alan Dukes&rsquo;s Tallaght strategy and the sea change we saw in the country at that time.  The Senator seems to have forgotten about other people, one being the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, who set up the most important mechanism to deal with the <Col N="199"/>national debt, the National Treasury Management Agency.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can hear all about this in a debate on the matter, if the Leader agrees to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to Senator Regan learning the full story when he hopefully has an opportunity to participate in such a debate.  </P>
        <P>I wish to raise another issue.  We had a good debate on small and medium-sized enterprises yesterday.  The Minister of State provided us with all the positive developments happening in the marketplace.  We recognise that there are many positive developments but the challenges globally and other developments have created problems in 2007.  We have not enjoyed the level of growth we enjoyed in the 2000-06 period.  It is likely that this turbulence will continue into 2008.</P>
        <P>In light of the likely sins of one or two individuals involved with some of the major financial institutions, the banking organisations, I understand that new regimes, regulations and processes are being put in place, which may cause further difficulties for people who will require finance to fuel their entrepreneurial spirits and ideas.  An important ingredient of small and medium-sized enterprises is the availability of appropriate finances without the burden of unnecessary bureaucracy that may prevent such finances becoming available.  I ask the Leader to examine whatever is the most appropriate mechanism to provide assurance in this regard to the banking organisations that may or may not have been stung by the likely or unlikely sins of two solicitors, the outcome of which cases we do not yet know.  Given the turbulence being experienced in the economy, it is important to ensure that necessary finances  are available to entrepreneurs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris raised an apparently appalling situation yesterday regarding the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  He stated that a member of it had a 100% record in declining all cases that came before him or her.  I would like the Leader to advise how that tribunal is constituted.  Was that person allowed to sit alone in considering these cases and, if so, how many cases did he or she hear?  This is extremely damaging to the supposed fairness of the system.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a democracy based on laws, we have always prided ourselves on upholding the highest standards.  This is a serious blemish on the record which must be addressed.  I, too, would like to hear from the Leader as to the Minister&rsquo;s view on this matter, if that alleged <Col N="200"/>situation is true, and I do not doubt what Senator Norris said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Twomey&rsquo;s remarks about nursing homes and about the enactment of legislation.  It is an extraordinarily serious matter.  We need a well resourced inspectorate and regular inspections.  We owe that to our old people.  We all know that there are wonderful nursing homes and wonderful people working in them.  Great work is being done in most of them but that in no way removes the need for an active and continuous inspectorate.  Properly run nursing homes will have nothing to fear from such an inspectorate.</P>
        <P>We have heard of many dreadful horrific abuses in children&rsquo;s homes that are painful to recall, but at least the children who were in them lived to tell the tale.  Much abuse in nursing homes unfortunately dies with the victim, and at Christmas we should be very mindful of that.  We owe it to our older people to do this and I ask the Leader to come back to us on it on specific terms.  We need the number of inspectors and the resources of the inspectorate.  It must happen instantly.  It is a serious matter and Senator Twomey could not be more correct to raise it.</P>
        <P>I also support the remarks of Senator Buttimer on residential homes for children.  There are 400 children involved, but there is no inspectorate.  This is a related issue and I ask the Leader to address it also.  We had a horrific catalogue in the Galway home recently, which was beyond description.  It is tragic enough that old people are being abandoned in our modern society, where the emphasis is on materialism and wealth, but if we going to abandon old people to homes, the least we can do is ensure a standard of quality care for them.  It is a very urgent matter and I want the Leader to be very specific on how we deal with this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to raise an issue that the House has already debated.  On a day that we are due to debate integration, it is appropriate to ask the Leader to convene a debate in the new year on the Government&rsquo;s child care policy, in particular the changes proposed to subventions to the community child care scheme.  I and other colleagues from both Houses attended a very helpful briefing yesterday organised by the Irish Childcare Policy Network, which is a national group of child care providers from all over the country.  We were briefed on the clear consequences of the changes that will come about if such changes are implemented next June as proposed.  The group is concerned that community child care providers all around the country will be forced to close as a result.  Even if they do not close, there will be serious implications for integration in communities, as it will mean effec<Col N="201"/>tively the segregation of children of persons on social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is seeking a debate and if the Leader agrees, we can have that debate.  Time is limited and I have a number of speakers offering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The ICPN made a very specific request that this decision be deferred until the end of next year to enable further negotiations and consultations to take place with the Minister and other interest groups.  We could help that process in this House by debating it.</P>
        <P>I would also like the Leader to respond to the motion that was agreed on Ingrid Betancourt.  I know the deputy Leader of the House had emailed Members about it and I wanted to know what had happened to that motion and whether we could bring it before the House to ensure consensus on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>At the risk of introducing a premature note of Christmas cheer to the proceedings, I would like to inform the House that a former Senator of this House, Professor Murphy, had lunch with myself and Senators Ross, Norris and O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of the lunch, Professor Murphy, who otherwise spoiled the lunch by his argumentative nature, remarked that this Seanad seemed to be more sparky, more lively, more entertaining and more to the point than when he was around.  He said that with some kind of nostalgia and regret.  There was a general consensus at the table that much of this was due to the influx of new, opinionated and sharp Senators from all parties, along with the fatherly and completely competent service given by the Leader of the House, plus your own generous and liberal chairing of proceedings, a Chathaoirligh.  I thought you should know that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>That really puts my contribution in the ha&rsquo;penny place.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come in here and talk to us about the inclusion of illnesses such as lupins, asthma and hypertension in the long-term illness scheme?  What is the difference between diabetes and hypertension when it comes to paying bills?  The drugs payment scheme has increased.  A person I know suffers from lupins and is trying her best to work and not be on disability, but she is a middle income earner and is being penalised.  It seems most inequitable that a person suffers from a particular illness and is penalised.</P>
        <P>Has the Leader had an opportunity to speak with the Minister for Transport on the debate I demanded last week on the Mullingar to Athlone rail link and the Killucan railway station?  I concur with Senator Keaveney on how important rail transport is for regional areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise again the point I made yesterday about the proposed inspectorate for residential homes for children with intellectual disability, as well as the residential settings for adults with intellectual disability.  Can the Leader ascertain the timeframe for the commencement of this?  It is absolutely essential.  I would also like him to convey to the Minister the need for the inspectorate to have the expertise to ascertain from the individuals in receipt of service their level of satisfaction with that service.  It is important to note that the State is funding the service.</P>
        <P>Any organisation that provides a service for either children or adults with intellectual disability should have in place procedures for investigating allegations of non-accidental injury or allegations of abuse.  It is not a requirement at the moment in the existing contracts between the Department, the HSE and the various services.  Those contracts are due for renewal in 2008 and there is a timely opportunity to ensure that those contracts include that requirement.  Other services are not funded by the State and there also should be a requirement for those services to have in place a procedure for the investigation of non-accidental injury and sex abuse.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>He was speaking about the issue of talent in the Seanad. That was the only issue at lunch about which there was any consensus.  I am very grateful to him for painting such a selective picture of what actually happened.  His introduction of Christmas cheer was as premature as was his own exit from that lunch yesterday.  As Members can imagine, there was agreement among the selected diners about absolutely nothing, apart from the fact that this is a tremendous Seanad and it has been very stimulating so far.  The influx of new people has been a really great injection and has lifted this House to a level which I have not seen in all the time I have been here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Twomey and O&rsquo;Reilly inquired about legislation for the future.  The Bill in question is on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  On the urgent matter of nursing homes, I will do everything possible to have this legislation before the House as soon as the Government orders so.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Glynn and Norris expressed their strong concerns on suicide, alcohol and bullying.  We have seen an unfortunate tragedy in the past few days.  As a lay person, it strikes me that we could have CCTV in schools, school yards and other areas where bullying takes place.  If CCTV is used, all the activity will be there for everybody to see.  No student, boy or girl, at any level should be tortured by bullies.  When the Minister for Education and Science comes to the House we will ask her how best to address that problem.</P>
        <P>On suicide and alcohol, 13 Senators who are very concerned about drug abuse attended my office yesterday at 2.30 p.m. and we will have our first all-party agreed motion on that next Wednesday from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.  Thereafter we will have whatever sittings are necessary, beginning on 6 February 2008, to allow every Senator to make his or her contribution.  I will endeavour to have as many Ministers, whether for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children or Education and Science, present at various sittings in order that the Seanad can play a meaningful role on substance abuse and the plague of suicide.  I thank the Ministers for their concerns.  We witnessed terrible events in the past few weeks.  Hopefully we can play a part in assisting the Government and its agencies in the challenges ahead.  The health services and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have an important role to play and we want to lead the way on an all-party proposal.  I thank everybody who gave up time to attend that meeting.  It was a difficult day with so many committees and meetings.  Senators made a <Col N="204"/>terrific effort to attend the first meeting under the chairmanship of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Keaveney expressed their views on the Minister&rsquo;s support for books in schools.  It is nice to see so many students in the Visitors Gallery.  While Senator O&rsquo;Toole may not be pleased with the book the Minister sent out for Christmas, called <i>Judging Dev</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I compliment the Minister on his contribution in the House yesterday on the Lisbon treaty.  I was disappointed with last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  Yesterday we had two excellent contributions from Deputies Roche and McGuinness.  I will take up with RTE the coverage this House is getting on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and the imbalance in that regard.  Yesterday the Minister spoke here on the reform treaty and today he went to Lisbon to discuss it and witness the leaders of Europe signing up to it.  The debate was timely.  There is more to the Houses of the Oireachtas than the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>Senator Glynn again called for a debate on organ donation.  I already made a commitment on this and am endeavouring to arrange it.  Senator Buttimer spoke on the Minister for Health and Children and the inspections were mentioned by Senators Prendergast and Corrigan.  We must have the Minister for Health and Children in the House on this and I will allow time after the Christmas recess.  Senators Buttimer and Keaveney spoke on the Minister for Education and Science and I have already covered that.  Senator Keaveney was at pains to point out the green agenda and called for regional development of the North-South, Derry-Dublin train service.  This is a worthwhile call and we will discuss it after the Christmas recess.  Senator Norris inquired about the Charities Bill.  This is on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and as soon as I am ordered to take it, I will have no difficulty doing so.  It will be after the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and Callely called for a debate on the national debt and I have no difficulty allowing time for this.  The Tallaght strategy was proposed by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, and supported by the then leader of Fine Gael, Mr. Alan Dukes.  Senator Regan meant well when he mentioned the Tallaght strategy, but from 1983-87 national debt doubled and emigration increased by 1,000 per week.  It is a bad time to use as an example.</P>

	<P>On Senator Regan&rsquo;s call for a debate on standards in public office, we can have a debate on it but it will not be for just one party.  As Christmas approaches and we think about angels and religious expressions, we will include all parties in that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke on the families of missing persons at Christmas and I agree with his call on anybody who has information that might help a grieving family to come forward.  Senator Callely called for the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for small business to speak in the House on the challenges that will meet his Department in the coming years.  The Minister of State excelled in his first contribution to the House yesterday.</P>

	<P>It was a star performance and as there were so many events, meetings and committees in the House on that day I will allow time for the Minister to return early in the new year and continue yesterday&rsquo;s debate.  Senator Coghlan spoke about the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  I shall have inquiries made for the Senator in this regard.  Senator Bacik raised the matter of Government child care policy and wanted the Minister to come to the House to debate this.  As the Senator knows, an extra &euro;11 million was allocated last week in the budget for this, and I am sure she was pleased to hear that.  There is no difficulty in setting time aside for this.</P>
        <P>After the Order of Business this morning, the party leaders will meet to discuss matters arising for next week.  I hope the wording of the motion regarding the Green Oxygen Party leader in Colombia will be agreed at that meeting and will be on the Order Paper for next week.  I understand Senators Harris and Ross had a very joyous meeting yesterday.  The occasion must have been for a certain type of Senator since neither the Cathaoirleach nor I was invited.  I understand that now that we are in their book of good news, however, we may be at their Christmas party next year.  I wonder what is coming down the track, but it is the good news slot in the Seanad this week and I thank the Senators for their kind remarks and comments.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden called for the Minister for Health and Children to address the House on the long-term illnesses support schemes.  That is a very reasonable request and there is no difficulty in having time left aside for this.  I still await an update on the matters she brought to my attention for the Minister for Transport about the Athlone-Mullingar railway line and also the <Col N="207"/>reopening of the Killucan railway station, which would be a big help to commuters in the midlands region.</P>

	<P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the theme of integration.  The integration of newcomers is perhaps one of the most important social issues this country will face over the next few decades.  Ireland must respond in a planned and effective manner to the challenges and opportunities that inward migration and integration bring.</P>
        <P>We must work to ensure an intercultural society where the different cultures speak to each other, listen and ultimately enrich each other in the context of a common aspiration to promote the welfare and values of a new Irish society.  We know this is not an easy task.  The experience of our European colleagues bear witness to the difficulties of achieving successful integration and the implications of not achieving that success.  Compared with other countries, we have had only a short time to come to grips with this very complex area.  In some ways, however, we are very lucky.  We have the opportunity to examine integration policies in other member states of the European Union and to learn from them.  Most importantly following that, we must forge our own path and develop a unique approach tailored to Ireland&rsquo;s situation and distinct experience.</P>
        <P>Our country continues to be transformed by immigrants from all over the world.  We are enriched by the variety of cultures, languages and traditions these newcomers bring.  Immigration has been a positive experience for us and the newcomers have brought much needed skills and strong work ethics that have helped to build on our economic success.  So much contribution has been made in so many sectors that these workers <Col N="209"/>have helped to develop our status as a wealthy nation.  Areas such as business, construction, manufacturing, health and hospitality have particularly benefited from migrant labour.</P>
        <P>Integration cannot be taken for granted and we must consider how best we can support each migrant to make the greatest possible contribution to our society and economy and help him or her to integrate.  We all must work to ensure migrant workers are treated fairly and that they are protected from exploitation, given their vulnerability.  We must see our migrants as more than workers as they are not just units of the labour market.  I recall a remark made by a Swiss writer who spoke about experience in Germany: &ldquo;We asked for workers, but instead we got people.&rdquo;  This gets to the very heart of the issues of integration.  There is obviously a dynamic contribution that migrants may make to the labour market and the development of our net national wealth.  They are also people, however, and like the Irish, they travel in great hope and expectation.  The Irish, when they emigrated to other countries, did so from a country that was then a failure in economic terms.  These people have a similar experience in their own countries, and primarily that is one reason among many they choose to come to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Migration has brought with it anti-racist, diversity management and integration issues.  Planning for and managing a diverse society is not a process that has a beginning and an end.  It is a living process and one which needs to be driven by a sense of what is good for everybody.  There is no reason we cannot achieve an inclusive society where everyone is assured of respect for his or her identity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national action plan against racism, Planning for Diversity, is in place for the period 2005 to 2008 and is an ambitious, forward-looking strategy.  The emphasis throughout the plan is on the accommodation of diversity through reasonable and common sense strategies that have the potential to receive broad support across society. The national action plan seeks to take into account the significant economic, social and cultural changes which have taken place in society in recent years and which continue, with the most recent census in 2006 showing that there has been a significant broadening of national and religious diversity in Ireland.  The Central Statistics Office latest household survey for the third quarter of 2007 indicates that the number of non-Irish nationals accounts for more than 12% of the population and immigrant workers account for almost 15% of the workforce.  This is a dynamic and changing trend.  It is so dynamic in the modern age because of low air fares and cheap travel across Europe.  It means that figures and statistics can change within a month.</P>
        <P>As we saw, 40,000 workers lost their jobs in the construction sector in August.  However, the <Col N="210"/>follow-on labour surveys did not show an increase of 40,000 on the live register or in the unemployment figures.  The reason was a great many of the people who lost their jobs in August simply went home, to Poland in many cases where a minor infrastructural boom is under way.  That is how dynamic migration is in Europe.  We need to have a strong research-led approach which guarantees we are getting the information we need in timely fashion and that the research we conduct is not lagging behind the reality.</P>
        <P>It has been recognised that harnessing this change before it becomes problematic is what will differentiate our success from failure.  The national action plan has sought to harness changes and direct energy from this into positive diversity management programmes.  Since its inception almost three years ago, the national action plan has provided practical solutions and anticipated potential racism, diversity and integration issues where possible.  Much has been achieved in the short time since the plan was launched and it has assisted with the development of a number of effective and strategic programmes.</P>
        <P>The issue of integration is being taken very seriously by the Government, and we are actively working to ensure the transition can become a positive experience for Irish and newcomer alike.  We are committed to social cohesion and this has been given a new political focus through my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for integration.  My office has been given a cross-departmental mandate to develop, drive and co-ordinate integration policy across other Departments, agencies and services.  It will be involved in the development of a long-term national policy on integration informed by widespread consultation at a national level.</P>
        <P>Stakeholder consultation is critical to successful integration.  The process of consultation with NGOs and key stakeholders has already begun.  Two major conferences on developing integration policy were held in 2007, one in February with the follow-up workshop held on 6 December.  Our theme for this recent conference which was held in Croke Park was &ldquo;Towards an Integrated Society &mdash; the chance to get it right&rdquo;.  These conferences proved to be useful consultative mechanisms where the voices and opinions of immigrants could be heard and listened to.  Importantly, they state they are ready, willing and committed to participate in a new Irish society.</P>
        <P>Alongside these, I have plans to establish a range of other consultative structures.  As I already announced, I intend to establish a task force on integration in 2008 to identify key issues affecting immigrant communities.  This will consult widely with the immigrant and indigenous populations, visit communities, examine previous research and report back with specific practical and implementable recommendations for the <Col N="211"/>medium to long term development of policy which must be introduced now rather than later.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My plans for next year also include the establishment of a ministerial council for integration.  This will be solely representative of immigrants and will allow ongoing input by immigrants into policy issues.</P>
        <P>The third structure I intend to establish is an ongoing commission on integration.  This will include a broad representation of stakeholders to reflect the groupings and interests emerging from the work of the task force.  The commission will advise me on all aspects of the development of policy in the integration area.  It will be a standing commission designed to be a focal point not only for me and the Department but also for the sector developing around integration issues and themes.</P>
        <P>An ongoing range of strategic studies will also help inform policy development in the integration area.  In particular, the Government is aware of the crucial role of the English language for all legally resident migrants and we have commissioned a study to examine this area.  I will refer further to this.</P>
        <P>In addition, a study has been carried out on appropriate funding mechanisms for ethnic minority organisations.  The report was commissioned under the national action plan against racism, NPAR, and my officials and I are examining it.  A study on interpretation and translation services is also under way.</P>
        <P>With regard to initiatives in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, more than 450 ethnic liaison officers have been appointed throughout Ireland.  In addition, intercultural consultative forums between the Garda and members of minority communities are organised locally and nationally.  The Garda is also actively recruiting people from minority communities.</P>
        <P>The development of a national intercultural health strategy was supported under NPAR.  This <Col N="212"/>strategy is due to be launched in February 2008.  It will provide a framework through which staff and service users may be supported to participate actively and meaningfully in designing, delivering and evaluating provision of health care to minority ethnic service users in Ireland.  An important objective of the strategy is the reduction of social exclusion experienced by many in this group enhancing their access to health services and in the longer term, promoting positive health outcomes and social gain.</P>
        <P>The action plan highlights that it can only succeed if local communities are active players in delivery of its objectives.  To this end, local anti-racism diversity plans are a central plank of the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations.  The purpose of the anti-racism diversity plans is to foster a co-ordinated approach at local city and county strategy level consistent with the aims and objectives of the national action plan against racism.  My office will expand on this initiative and will work towards assisting local authorities to develop integration plans.</P>
        <P>Under NPAR, research has been commissioned into the adequacy of Ireland&rsquo;s legislation on racially motivated crime.  This research is to be published in early 2008.  NPAR also supports research on housing policy arising from increased cultural diversity in Ireland.  The research will scope key issues arising in public and private housing and the implications for planning future housing policy and estate management.  The research will be targeted at specific local authority areas.</P>
        <P>Funding has been provided to sports clubs and societies to address issues of racism.  The aim of these grants is to enable organisations to raise awareness about racism and to highlight cultural diversity in Ireland.  Historically, sport has in some instances been a breeding ground for religious and cultural divisions.  In reverse, it can provide the solution by virtue of its wide and powerful appeal.  Recognising the potential to use this power to influence a wide audience, the FAI has developed an intercultural strategy, appointed an intercultural officer and brought anti-racist and integration messages directly into the sporting spotlight.</P>
        <P>NPAR also supports diversity management initiatives in the corporate sector.  It is important that Irish businesses develop long-term strategies for integration of their diverse workforces.  Research to promote the business case for diversity has also been commissioned.  It is anticipated that this research will be concluded in the latter half of 2008.  We expect that it will identify good practice and that the learning from this research can be transferred to the workplace through publications, events and training.</P>
        <P>Senators may be aware that a cross-departmental group was established by the Government in February 2007 to carry out a review of existing <Col N="213"/>integration policy and to provide an initial assessment of future policy options.  The group was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The review was completed in May 2007, prior to my appointment.  A policy framework document was submitted, which we hope to publish shortly.  I also intend to take over the chairing of this cross-departmental group to ensure that a high level of co-ordination exists across those Departments which provide integration services.</P>
        <P>From a strategic point of view, Ireland adopts a mainstreaming approach to integration whereby statutory service providers take full responsibility for delivering services to a new Irish society within which newcomers and Irish are simply constituent parts.  Recognising that minority groups have needs which cannot always be addressed within the existing mainstream framework, the State also provides funding for targeted initiatives.</P>
        <P>Funding aimed at migrants has been included in the 2008 Estimates for a number of Departments.  In addition, my office has been allocated a budget of more than &euro;9 million for next year.  This will provide strategic seed funding for a number of initiatives which will greatly facilitate the economic, social and political integration of new immigrants into Irish society.  I plan to develop new funding streams to help create and mobilise existing and emerging institutions such as faith groups, trade unions, employers and large membership groups including political parties.</P>
        <P>Within the Department of Education and Science, my brief is to ensure that the range of education policies across different areas of the Department and the bodies under its aegis take account of the need to integrate immigrants and their families, and also to co-ordinate the work of the Department of Education and Science on the integration of newcomers with the related work of other relevant Departments and agencies.  To assist me with the education portion of my brief, the Department of Education and Science has established an integration unit which will co-ordinate planning and strategy with regard to newcomer issues.</P>
        <P>In the 2006 to 2007 school year, we had approximately 340,000 pupils in our post-primary schools.  Of these, 17,000 were newcomer pupils from more than 160 nations.  The top ten counties of origin included the UK, Poland, Nigeria, Lithuania, the USA, Spain, Germany, Philippines, Latvia and South Africa.  More than 446,000 pupils attend primary schools and it is estimated that approximately 31,000 of these are newcomer pupils.</P>
        <P>Within primary and post-primary education, the key requirement for the integration of young students for whom English is a second language is the provision of language support teachers.  More than 1,900 language support teacher posts are allocated to primary and post-primary schools <Col N="214"/>compared to 260 in the school year 2001-02.  Some schools with more than 121 students for whom English is their second language have up to six language support teachers.  This will cost more than &euro;120 million in 2007 and 2008.</P>
        <P>Many resources have been prepared for the teachers and the schools. On Monday, I was delighted to launch a toolkit for diversity in primary schools, Together Towards Inclusion, with the Minister for Education in Northern Ireland, Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane.  In the new year, language assessment packs will be provided to primary schools to assist teachers in determining the language proficiency of pupils at the initial stage and also for on-going assessment.</P>
        <P>Other key resources include the intercultural guidelines prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for primary schools and also for post-primary schools.  Integrate Ireland Language and Training has also prepared resource materials for primary and post-primary schools as well as provided a programme of support for English language teachers to assist them in meeting the English language needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>On arrival in Ireland many parents may not speak or read English and are unfamiliar with the Irish education system.  To assist these parents and others, information on the education system has been placed on the Department&rsquo;s website in six languages, including Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and German.  In addition, a newcomers&rsquo; area has been developed on the website to provide relevant educational material in different languages.</P>
        <P>A DVD on the primary school curriculum has been also produced by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, for parents in English, Irish, French, Polish and Lithuanian.  Entitled, The What, Why and How of Children&rsquo;s Learning in Primary School, it is also available on broadband video.</P>
        <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute has been commissioned by the Department of Education and Science to undertake a large-scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon resource requirements and day-to-day teaching and learning.  The research is organised in two phases, the first involving a national survey of primary and post-primary school principals and the second involving detailed case studies of a sample of primary and post-primary schools.  This will involve focus groups and an in-depth examination of the manner in which integration is taking place and the challenges posed in the classroom.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Science will start to conduct an evaluation of the provision of English as an additional language in a number of schools and in 2009 it plans to publish an analysis of its findings as a composite national report.  These reports <Col N="215"/>will provide vital data which will inform future developments in the primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than 12,000 places are being taken up by migrants learning English in classes provided by the national network of 33 vocational education committees.  Asylum seekers are entitled to attend the VEC English language classes for adults.  As I indicated, the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with the office for integration, has commissioned an independent review to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation.  This study is due for completion in early 2008 and involves extensive consultation with stakeholders, including providers of English language training, that is, vocational education committees, third level institutions, private providers and NGOs.  Vitally, it will also consider the views and attitudes of migrants, as individuals and through their many representative organisations.  The recommendations of the review will help inform the development of a national English language training policy and framework for adult immigrants.</P>
        <P>Most qualifications are now recognised on the ten level national framework of qualifications, which includes learning achieved at all levels from the most basic, level one, to the most advanced, level ten.  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland established Qualifications Recognition Ireland as a one-stop shop for inquiries regarding the recognition of awards from other countries, whether for purposes of employment or access and progression to further education and training.  It is important to note that the information provided by Qualification Recognition Ireland is advisory in nature.</P>
        <P>Considerable work has been done by the Department of Education and Science and its agencies.  There is a commitment to take account of the needs of immigrant children and their families.  Schools are seeking to create an inclusive, integrated environment in which, through a two-way process, all students will be welcome and experience a high quality education that will enable everyone to achieve his or her full potential, participate fully as members of our increasingly intercultural society and contribute to our social and economic development.</P>
        <P>We have reached an exciting and challenging stage in developing an intercultural Ireland.  We recognise the need to plan for the new diverse Ireland and ensure the voices of immigrants and the indigenous population inform the development of comprehensive integration policies for the future.  We must all work together to cultivate a culture of respect and tolerance that celebrates difference and fosters creativity and self-reliance. <Col N="216"/> A successful integration approach requires the contribution of all sectors of civic society, including the new communities, host communities, social partners and civic society organisations.  The responsibility for successful integration falls on all of us, working together in partnership, to achieve a common goal.</P>
        <P>After six months in my current portfolio, I believe we have an opportunity to get inward migration right.  When one considers the position in our European Union neighbours and across the European Continent, it is clear that not one country has been a success in this area.  We can and will get this right.  Ireland has shown in the past decade that it can transform itself from a high emigration and high unemployment society to a country of full employment which cherishes all its citizens.  It is possible to continue on this path with the newcomers who are coming to our shores.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to outline his policies on this important subject.  As with much of the business in the Chamber, Senators are making statements on a policy issue, as distinct from dealing with legislation.  It would be preferable if we were to deal with legislation such as the immigration Bill, as it would allow us to focus on precisely what action is required in this area.  While Senators can make statements on integration time and again, legislation must be in place if we are to move forward matters. </P>
        <P>We all recognise that Ireland is a changed place from the country of 15, ten or even five years ago.  We have gone from a country of net emigration, through a period of immigration chaos when the structures of public administration simply could not cope to a point at which the Government has finally appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for integration.  This step, while it constitutes a welcome recognition of the importance of integrating new communities, does not, of itself, solve the problem.</P>
        <P>The area of integration has been characterised by an absence of good planning, administration and foresight.  The increasing volume of migrants did not occur overnight but has been evident in the past five to ten years.  The current legislation relating to immigrants is weak.  Applications for residency take too long.  All Senators receive representations on this issue and the delay in assessing many applications currently stands at up to two years.  It appears that making representations does not accelerate the process.  The work permit system is unfair, while human trafficking legislation is inadequate, although the latter topic was addressed recently.  Driver safety legislation, as it applies to non-Irish driving licence holders, is effectively useless.  Moreover, our education system, to which the Minister of State alluded, has been placed under immense strain, not by the <Col N="217"/>children of migrants but by the Government&rsquo;s failure to plan for the inevitable increase in numbers.</P>
        <P>While not directly related to the work of the Minister of State, if ever there was an example of bad planning, it is in the area of human trafficking.  We know the extent of this problem both globally and in Europe, specifically in the accession countries and other eastern European states where girls and women disappear and are trafficked abroad, including to this country.  The practice of trafficking was highlighted by the tragic events in Wexford-Waterford in December 2001, which culminated in the death of eight people trapped inside a freight container.</P>
        <P>To date, neither the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking Act) 2000 nor the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 has ever resulted in a successful prosecution for the crime of trafficking, although individuals have been arrested and charged.  The problem lies with the current legislative code which is not sufficiently strong to facilitate successful convictions.  For this reason, the Fine Gael Party welcomed the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill as a positive step forward, as it will, for the first time, impose strict penalties on those involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of people.  However, as my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Naughten, recently noted, a report by NUI Galway highlighted the case of a woman found by garda&iacute; in a private brothel in Sligo who was brought to Mountjoy Prison, even though she was believed to have been trafficked.  She was the only one criminalised in this situation.  It is very important that the new Bill will ensure victims are not the only ones to be penalised.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On the issue of education, there are serious difficulties in the integration process.  For that reason, the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, earlier this year called for a national debate on immigration.  The growth in multiculturalism within the education system comes at a time when the system is already under pressure, with significant expansion of pupil numbers forecast.  The Minister of State referred to the figures on the number of non-nationals in post-primary education and it is estimated there are 31,000 non-national children in the primary school system alone.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>As matters stand, there are many teachers, particularly in large urban centres, whose classes include significant numbers of children with language difficulties.  The current system for allocating language support teachers is not serving the interests of these children.  It provides that schools with 14 non-English-speaking pupils are awarded one language support post and those with 28 or more receive a second, but a third post can only be granted in exceptional circumstances.  These rules take no account of the reality that many schools have far more than 28 non-English speaking pupils.</P>
<Col N="218"/>
        <P>The system is not serving the interests of either our immigrants or our own population and needs to be changed.  As a first step, the allocation of language support resources must be revamped so that schools with higher demands receive proportionate and appropriate support.  A national audit must be carried out to find the true extent of this problem and to establish whether other measures, such as providing additional language support outside normal school hours, are needed and what additional teaching resources are required.</P>
        <P>Tackling deficiencies in adult literacy is a key challenge for the education system in general.  Ten years ago, it was estimated that over half a million Irish adults needed help but just 35,500 people have benefited from adult literacy programmes since then.  There is evidence that over a quarter of those who have undertaken these courses were from non-English-speaking backgrounds and did so in order to improve their knowledge of English.  These programmes were not designed as language classes and should be targeted at people with literacy problems rather than those with fluency problems.  We need to develop dedicated English language classes for adult immigrants that are focussed on their needs.</P>
        <P>On driver safety, we are aware of the efforts to improve safety on our roads and reduce the carnage that causes so much difficulty to so many families.  One of the cornerstones in the battle to reduce road fatalities is the introduction and enforcement of the penalty points system.  However, as migrants from other EU countries are not required to transfer their driving licences, penalty points cannot be applied to their licences.  It is disturbing that 20% of the penalty points which should have resulted from offences detected by the Garda could not be applied, in many cases because of this loophole.  It also means that the deterrent effect of the penalty points system is not applying to a proportion of the driving population.</P>
        <P>This was recently highlighted by Mr. Petkus, a court translator from Lithuania, based in Mayo, who has appeared in the media in recent weeks on the issue.  He pointed out that more and more foreign nationals are becoming involved in accidents on the roads of Ireland and, in most cases, they are not insured properly or their cars are not roadworthy.  It is in the interest of our community that this issue is addressed.</P>
        <P>I have only touched on some of the issues surrounding integration.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has come to the House to debate the issue.  I hope the debate will encourage him to address some of the specific issues highlighted.  While he has pointed to many studies, task forces and action plans which have been drawn up, it is not readily apparent how an immigrant is being assisted when he lands on these shores.  I would ask the Minister of <Col N="219"/>State to respond on this issue when concluding the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As a people, we do not have a happy history of integration at home or abroad.  In rural Ireland the divide between town and country now seems a curiosity of a bygone age.  The blow-in is well known in rural Ireland and in many places one can still be a blow-in 50 years after moving into an area.  Indeed, three generations on, a family may still be classed as blow-ins.</P>
        <P>Abroad, as a race, we did not integrate into the United States or England for many generations, preferring to live in Cricklewood or South Boston, and to be among our own.  Despite being the victims of racism in the United States, Britain and elsewhere, our record against other minorities in these countries is shameful, to say the least.  The case of Eugene &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Connor, notorious opponent of the black civil rights movement, who famously prevented the peaceful protest in Birmingham, Alabama, was a descendant of Irish emigrants.  Racism by the Irish in the Five Points in New York on the proposed introduction of conscription during the American civil war led to a three-day riot by the Irish, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of African-Americans.</P>
        <P>These examples of racism by the Irish abroad demonstrate that we need to redouble our efforts to ensure racism does not get a toehold in Ireland.  We need to prevent ghettoisation in the sense of isolation from Irish society among the new Irish.  Our experience abroad makes it easy for us to understand why the new Irish like to live together but living in the same area must not mean isolation.  Our task as a Government is to get people of different languages to speak to each other.</P>
        <P>We are lucky we can learn from the mistakes of others in Europe.  We must avoid the problems of Germany, where, in the town of Marzhan, a population of 13,000 Russian migrants lives in a ghetto beset by drugs and violence.  In Paris, isolation has now led to nearly annual riots among Algerian immigrants in Abb&eacute;ville and, in Britain, the word &ldquo;Brixton&rdquo; and riots are nearly synonymous.  These are events we want to avoid in our future, which is why the Government is acting now.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a Minister of State responsible for integration is a timely move.  His cross-departmental brief makes his task difficult but not impossible, and his capabilities are well known &mdash; his work in his previous post stands testament to that.  However, with one in eight households now being new Irish, it is vital that the action plan against racism, Planning for Diversity, which is being implemented from 2005 to 2008, is implemented.  The other initiatives announced by <Col N="220"/>the Minister of State show the Government&rsquo;s commitment on the issue of integration.  The task force on integration, the ministerial council for integration and the immigrant commission are all part of Government policy, which will guide us in the years to come.  Other initiatives with the Garda, the health services and the city and town councils, where local anti-racism diversity plans are being implemented, as outlined by the Minister of State, show the Government&rsquo;s commitment.  The FAI must be commended for its appointment of an intercultural officer and the corporate sector must also be commended for its work in expanding immigration and integration policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Education is the key, not only for the 17,000 new Irish but also for the 340,000 Irish in the second level education system, and not only for the 31,000 new Irish but also for the 446,000 Irish in the primary school system.  The civil, social and political education, or CSPE, programme provides the Government with a perfect opportunity to teach the Irish about the new Irish.  I ask the Minister of State to consider asking the Department of Education and Science to make integration a part of the CSPE course.  Education is the key to shaping the Ireland of the future and it is also the way to teach young Irish people about the new Irish.</P>
        <P>An extreme example of education being used to teach racism to an entire race was the Nazi domination of Germany from 1933 to 1945, when education was used to demonise, ghettoise and isolate the minorities.  It is a stark example of education being used to promote a particular mindset but also an example of how, if a people can be taught racism, they can be taught integration.  The Government&rsquo;s various initiatives are enabling people who speak different languages to communicate with each other and thus avoid isolation.  For example, &euro;120 million is being spent on 1,900 language support teachers, which is a major step in the right direction, compared with where we were five years ago when we had only 260 such teachers.</P>
        <P>In our search to help integrate the new Irish I am delighted to see an integrated approach being adopted by the Minister for Education and Science and her counterpart in Northern Ireland towards determining the language proficiency of pupils.  Teachers who have to deal with children whose first language is not English will find the tool kit for diversity in primary schools, Together Towards Inclusion, an invaluable aid.</P>
        <P>I am sure many people are not aware of the Government&rsquo;s array of supports for parents of the new Irish.  The Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s website, which provides information in six languages on the education system, is a great example of such initiatives.  The DVD on the primary school curriculum in five languages is also a step in the right direction in helping the <Col N="221"/>new Irish to find their way through our education system.</P>
        <P>The final report by the ESRI on how increasing diversity in our schools impacts upon the resource requirements of day-to-day teaching and learning will be of assistance to the Minister in formulating policy in this area.  Education has been a key to our economic success so we must ensure we provide enough resources to the education sector so that the new Irish are provided with the opportunity to contribute to this society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister of State well in his work of ensuring future generations of Irish will judge people not by the colour of their skin but by their character.  I commend the Government on its initiatives across a wide range of sectors and wish the Minister well in his role.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, to the House.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, for his earlier contribution in which he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">We must work to ensure an intercultural society where the different cultures speak to each other, listen and ultimately enrich each other in the context of a common aspiration to promote the welfare and values of a new Irish society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State put that forward as a challenge and I agree with it.  I do not believe, however, that the rest of his speech went down that particular route.  It is much more practical.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point Senator Regan made about language teachers.  I will not deal with it now as time is short but he is right to say that important matter needs to be addressed.  I also acknowledge the point made by Senator Mark Daly and others concerning additional language teachers.  It was a battle to get them and they are doing a great job, but the system needs to be tightened up along the lines Senator Regan outlined.</P>
        <P>There is another issue I wish to deal with and about which all sides of the House should express outrage.  We cannot accept a situation whereby every single appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal has been rejected.  That cannot be right, so we should examine the matter closely.  I disagreed with criticisms of the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by those who called him fascist and racist.  He was right-wing and conservative in his viewpoint but he is certainly not a fascist or a racist.  He is far closer to libertarianism than anything else.  I did not often agree with the way in which he tried to do things, but I do not think he deliberately established a refugee appeals system to operate as it does.  Somebody should examine what is going on in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  I am not saying there is any greater wisdom on this side of the <Col N="222"/>House than the other, but we want to know what is happening.  If a certain number of cases go before an appeals structure and not one of them succeeds, questions must be asked.</P>
        <P>The recent economic boom has been fuelled by immigrants.  In every significant developed economy in the western world, the second generation of immigrants have provided an extraordinary injection into the successful development of the next phase of the economic cycle.  We have seen that happening in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to argue over words but I welcome that not only the Minister but also the Department has moved from a concept of multiculturalism to one of interculturalism.  A significant point in Irish life was marked by the establishment of the country&rsquo;s first Muslim school, although it did not give rise to the discussions which I felt were necessary.  It was a good thing to reflect our openness in allowing another religion and culture to flourish, but it was not a good thing in the sense that we were just giving them their own private space.  That is basically what leads to racism and apartheid.  It is not about giving space to different groups, which is multiculturalism.  Interculturalism, however, is where one measures a community by the quality of the engagement between different cultural backgrounds.  That is a challenge not just to our society but also to immigrants.</P>
        <P>To take the point Senator Mark Daly made about south Boston, the Bronx or Cricklewood, we can see that we were basically buying into establishing places where only Irish people lived.  The challenge to every immigrant group in this country is not just about integration but the fact that there must also be a certain cultural compromise by immigrants.  There are too many do-gooders in this regard.  I support and defend immigrants but that does not mean one does not pose questions and create challenges for them.  I want to see second-generation immigrants playing in all-Ireland finals, but it must be allowed to happen by encouraging immigrants to participate in Gaelic games and whatever else is going on in this country.</P>
        <P>In recent times, we have seen communities standing by immigrant families and trying to prevent them being sent out of the country.  Such cases occurred in small communities, which is the answer to Senator Daly&rsquo;s point.  They happened in Bantry, Killarney, Sligo and Athlone where communities banded together because they knew the immigrant families concerned.  Such families had become part of the local community, taking part in local festivals and living there.  In a place such as Gort, for example, the Brazilian culture is probably stronger than the Irish one.  The Brazilians have intermingled and created a community there.  We are talking about community building but to do it we need to be fair and firm. <Col N="223"/> It is not about opening our gates to anybody who comes in but about recognising that when people come here, they come in through a process.  That is why it needs to be regulated at all times.  It does not mean having open doors because regulation is required and that should reflect labour force requirements.</P>
        <P>In addition, we need to be humanitarian and recognise that some asylum seekers are economic migrants.  There is nothing wrong with that if they make a contribution to our society, learn in our schools and add more to the community.  It does mean, however, that a certain cultural compromise is required when they come here.  The fact that people leave their own country to come here means that they have made a decision in that regard anyway.  They are now living here and we want to see them playing Gaelic games and understanding Irish culture.  That does not mean that we seek to change the core values of their own culture but it does mean a certain amount of assimilation, although I know some groups hate that word.  In other words, to integrate one must assimilate to a certain extent into Irish society, and that means giving up some things that were valuable in one&rsquo;s own country.</P>
        <P>When Irish people went to America they had to merge, assimilate and make certain cultural compromises concerning what was going on in that country.  They may have had to adopt new attitudes.  Irish people in America now celebrate Thanksgiving in the same way they celebrate Christmas, and thus have two festivals.</P>
        <P>Last year, there was a row about a Christmas tree in Tallaght Hospital because some people thought it would be insulting to those who were not of a Christian persuasion.  We should not allow ourselves to get into such a nonsensical argument nor give credence to those who provoke such arguments.  They do not deserve any answer apart from the kind of debate we are having in this Chamber.  People must recognise that there is give and take in all these matters.</P>
        <P>The real issue, which was raised by Senator Mark Daly, is that Irish people went to America and other places and suffered discrimination.  Chuaigh a l&aacute;n acu as na Gaeltachta&iacute; gan focal B&eacute;arla acu.  N&iacute; raibh cuid acu in ann scr&iacute;obh abhaile n&oacute; labhairt leis na daoine timpeall orthu.  Labhair siad Gaeilge lena chomhleacaithe i p&eacute; &aacute;it ina rabhadar &mdash; Springfield n&oacute; Boston, mar shampla.<b>  </b>They never really settled in.  The worst thing was that they became discriminatory toward coloured people in the United States.  This type of discrimination reverberates down through the generations and we must address that.</P>
        <P>I am supportive of groups representing immigrant communities and always ask them if they can point me to the best role model in the world which has the best immigration policy for which we should aim.  I never receive a complete answer <Col N="224"/>but it is quite interesting that the thoughtful people in those groups invariably suggest three countries, namely, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.  What is important is that those three countries have firm immigration policies which are perceived to be fair.  It is about ensuring the system works in a way with which we can all live.</P>
        <P>It is important we reflect on the fact that immigrants have brought considerable economic benefits to this country and deserve to be treated fairly, with equality and to be fully educated.  That is investment in our future.  Immigration is good and necessary for this country and economic development is dependent on immigrants coming to this country.  That is the reality, so we need to make it work.  We also need immigrants to make it work.  That is the type of conversation which should take place between us and the newcomers to this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not faced the challenge of integration of new people to our shores in modern times.  We need to supplement the necessary debate about immigration control and the arrival and reception of immigrants with one about the long-term picture, namely, integration.  I have read that multiculturalism is defined as &ldquo;validating diversity and harmony between different groups&rdquo;.  Instead of building higher walls, it offers security of identity while promoting a creative and dynamic hybridity.  There are times, however, when the loose way in which the term has come to be used in public debate is unhelpful and even dangerous.</P>
        <P>On the one hand, the rather fuzzy way in which the pro-diversity and anti-racist lobby groups use the word &ldquo;integration&rdquo; hardly provides us with an effective roadmap for defining future policy.  On the other hand, the lack of clarity about the term also fuels the concerns of those who fear change, sometimes for understandable reasons, and who do not know where it is leading us.</P>
        <P>Everyone is a little nervous of the new and it behoves politicians and those who favour change to explain what they mean and the implications such changes might have for ordinary people.  Those of us who belong to the pro lobby when it comes to immigration and integration have sometimes failed to take our case to the public in terms which are understandable and clear.  We fail to connect in that regard.</P>
        <P>Multiculturalism would not work without State intervention and support but it cannot be managed in the long-term on a top-down basis.  The aim must be to facilitate partnership-based, bottom-up approaches through local community groups and schools.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on setting up the expert group to advise the Government on integration policies and I look forward to its report early next year.  I also congratulate him on his intelligent handling <Col N="225"/>of his policy brief thus far.  However, I mention a few areas of crucial concern.  We need to encourage the Civil Service to introduce a recruitment policy for foreign nationals.  Different elements of the State are operating at different speeds and it is the Government&rsquo;s job to bring everybody up to speed, so to speak.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is ahead of the pack in that regard and has recruited foreign nationals.  I would also like to see the Civil Service do so.  Seeing public sector jobs being made available would be an important signal to immigrants as it would encourage so-called ethnic entrepreneurship where immigrants set up their own business which has benefits for society.</P>
        <P>Language classes were mentioned but there is no uniformity in the way the vocational education committees are running classes.  They are not run frequently enough.  We all know how easy it is to forget what we have learned from one term to another.  More frequent classes are needed to continue learning done in the previous course.  A more formal approach needs to be taken.  I urge that pressure be put on the VECs immediately to run more classes.  If we are to wait until the report comes out and perhaps another year before some formal approach is taken, many people will be frustrated because they cannot speak the language.  Frustration can lead to other things, such as crime.  It behoves us all to put pressure on the VECs.  Some of them are brilliant at what they are doing but others are not so good.  There is no uniformity of approach and we need to address that.</P>
        <P>The primary school initiatives the Minister of State mentioned are very welcome.  However, we need to focus on the parents.  The parent information provided on the websites is excellent but many immigrants do not have access to the Internet.  It may be a bridge too far for them to look up Internet sites when really all they are looking for is human contact.</P>
        <P>John&rsquo;s Road primary school in Wexford town, in conjunction with the Wexford area partnership, has just completed a programme for the parents of next year&rsquo;s junior infants in preparing them for school.  It is called Head Start.  They finished the first stint of their eight week course last night and it has gone very well.  This could be held up as a model of what needs to be done and what works.  Funding for this came from the European integration fund.  It is piecemeal, obviously, and we should consider rolling it out.</P>
        <P>The recognition of qualifications is another area which causes stress.  I suggest the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland needs to speed up confirming qualifications because it is taking approximately six months, which is a little too long.</P>
        <P>We need to address access to health services and advocacy rights, which are vital.  People deserve to be treated like human beings and we need more contact points and clinics.  The area <Col N="226"/>partnerships are the way to go in that regard because they get people in and are able to deal with them through translators.  The two new integration funds from Europe are welcome in that regard because they are giving more support.</P>
        <P>Policy, planning and provision all matter in terms of the effective reception of immigrants into our society and systems but civic society has a crucial and active role to play.  Settling into a strange place with a different language is tough.  As Senator Mark Daly said, we know how tough it is, so I will not go over that again.</P>
        <P>Some people have legitimate concerns, which they have expressed, about the impact of immigration, whether on the lives of those already marginalised in society, our mores and values, wage levels, job security, housing or on a host of other issues.  We need to create a space for those voices to be heard.  We cannot allow racism to fester.  I hope this debate will help to provide such a space.  There should be fora for different voices throughout the country and I welcome what the Minister of State said about funding such fora.</P>
        <P>Many countries have got this wrong but I have great confidence we will get it right because we will do it differently from them.  Integration is the way forward and I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s report which I hope we will have early next year so that we can get on with the job.</P>

	<P>I welcome a former long-serving Member, Dino Cregan, to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for facilitating this debate.  I was struck by something Senator McDonald said at the outset when she examined what the word &ldquo;integration&rdquo; means.  It is a word that is thrown around a lot.  It is something everybody believes in and thinks of as a positive thing.  I am sure we all subscribe to it.  </P>
        <P>However, there is a certain fuzziness to it sometimes, as Senator McDonald identified.  It strikes me that one cannot ultimately detach what one&rsquo;s integration policy is or what one wants it to be from the harder questions of immigration policy.  Some of the areas referred to by Senator Regan, such as delays in applications for status, lack of consistency in the application of different rules by the Department and an absence of a clear policy that people can understand, are all very relevant to integration.</P>
        <P>If one has a cohort of people in one&rsquo;s country who are uncertain of their status and futures and when or where they will see their families again, one builds into their lives a permanent sense of the temporary.  If people have a permanent or semi-permanent sense of the temporary in their lives, how are they expected to integrate and take the steps any person or citizen needs to take to integrate into the society around them?</P>
<Col N="227"/>
        <P>I suggest to the Minister of State and my colleagues that we ought not to think that we can detach the sometimes fuzzier issue of integration from the hard-nosed central issues of what should constitute our immigration policy.  In that sense, I regret the fact that there appears to have been a further delay in proceeding with the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  It has not been produced again this session.  It is time it was produced, particularly given that the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said last week that it might be necessary to introduce legislation in this area every year.  He is not in the House at the moment but will perhaps be in a position to respond to this and perhaps we will get an opportunity to ask him again about it.</P>
        <P>The statement by the Minister of State was curious, especially when we do not even have the basic legislation in place.  He was saying that we might have to introduce new legislation every year.  It might help if we could have one Act as this would then enable us to understand the basis upon which the Government wishes us to view its immigration policy in all its various facets.  I have some concerns about elements of the Bill but we will wait and perhaps have a longer debate on that in due course.</P>
        <P>The notion of a legal pathway to permanence is something towards which every citizen has an aspiration.  We have debated the issue of the Irish in the US over and over again in this House and are supporting the campaign in the US.  What is that about?  It is about people having a sense that they will be able to put their roots down properly in the society they are in, send their children to the local schools, buy their house, get jobs and settle in.  These are the kinds of things that any human being, worker, employee or employer wishes to do and is something to which we should aspire for people who come to this country.</P>
        <P>Some other Senators argue that we cannot divorce or detach the notion of integration from some of the other issues relating to our labour market.  I have previously raised the question of agency workers and the agency workers directive.  Surely this issue is linked to integration?  I asked the Minister of State to indicate why on 5 December 2007, the Government again joined with one or two other states in blocking the draft directive on agency workers.  This directive would equalise the rights and entitlements of persons who are brought into this country by agencies with those of their counterparts who work directly for firms.  Again, this is a vitally important issue if we are serious about integration.  Why should people not see that they have basic rights in employment?  These are basic, not enhanced rights.  They are just the same rights held by their counterparts who are Irish citizens or have come here other than by being introduced through <Col N="228"/>agencies.  This issue is not separate from integration but is entirely relevant to it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the position the Minister of State holds has been accepted by the Government.  This is a positive step and has been welcomed across the board by a number of different organisations.  It is right that we also should welcome it and wish the Minister of State well in the task he has undertaken because it is important.  I wonder whether the figure of &euro;9 million, which was mentioned in his speech, is in any way sufficient for the task at hand but it is a start and we must see how things progress.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, and others will be familiar with the fact that Ministers sometimes straddle different Departments.  This is particularly true in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  I wonder how this will ultimately work and whether there will be a real sense of a Minister of State being able to call the shots on the issue and make real executive decisions or whether he will simply be somebody who is somewhat semi-detached from two or three different Departments.  I hope this does not turn out to be the case.</P>
        <P>With regard to what has been referred to as the softer issue of integration, if one can call it that, there is a big job to be done in terms of engaging public debate and support for it.  We need to take a hearts and minds-type approach to this.  Former Senator Maurice Hayes leads the National Forum on Europe, and other fora have been set up to deal with other issues, including the North.  Perhaps this is an area where we should consider a forum of that kind even if it is a travelling forum and we have to devote some resources to it.  It is something that needs to be taken into civil society, not just talked about here in Dublin.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others have said, we should engage with sporting organisations and organisations that have standing in the community, not just the NGOs.  I have huge regard for the different NGOs involved in this debate but it is too big and important to be left to groups of NGOs, however vitally important their work.</P>
        <P>Some of the NGOs with which I have been in contact have expressed concern about the level of real engagement which the Minister of State has had with them.  It is early days but I hope that he would respond to their request for closer and more meaningful consultation in respect of the way forward he proposes to take.</P>
        <P>Other Senators have dealt with the issue of education.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he has identified education and language as two vital pillars of an integration policy.  Nobody could disagree with that because they are at the heart of what needs to be done.  Some Government speak<Col N="229"/>ers have pointed to the extra spending on language support teachers in primary schools and so on, with which I am familiar and which I very much welcome.  However, it is not nearly enough.  More resources are required.</P>
        <P>We constantly call for resources and such a call can be just a catch cry but there is a genuine need there.  Knowledge of and the ability to speak the language of the country where one lives is vital for any individual, citizen or family seeking to make a life for themselves.  We should support and encourage immigrants, many of whom, in my experience, are very anxious to learn English.  We sometimes suggest that people should be told that they must learn English or that it is an absolute requirement.  Immigrants are only too keen to learn English if the support and facilities are there.  If the State or the VEC provides these language courses, by all means charge immigrants a fee, perhaps a modest fee on a sliding scale.  Many immigrants I know and have met are only too willing to improve their English and improve themselves in that way.</P>
        <P>The overall point has been made by my colleagues and is one that my party and I support.  The balance sheet in terms of the impact of immigration in this country has never been anything other than positive in the past decade.  We should all see it as a great opportunity for our country and for those people who come here.  The people who come to our shores should not be feared and immigration should not be debated in that context, rather it should be viewed as a great and positive opportunity.  It is here to stay for Ireland and this is an interesting start to the debate, to which I hope we return in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to discuss integration policy.  This issue is very important for this country because of the speed and extent of the demographic changes in the past ten to 20 years.  It is difficult to believe the extent of immigration in this country.  It is estimated that up to 14% of the Irish population is made up of immigrants and non-nationals.  It poses a significant challenge for the country.  Based on Ireland&rsquo;s experience and the fact that many of our residents emigrated, leading to a large diaspora, we have no excuse for getting it wrong when the experience is reversed.  We have primary experience of moving to other <Col N="230"/>countries and being strangers and immigrants.  We know how difficult it can be.  While no perfect model of integration has been identified, Ireland is in a position to benefit from the experience of many countries.</P>
        <P>Different models of integration have been experimented with, from the assimilation model attempted by France to the multicultural approach of Great Britain.  It is fair to categorise Ireland&rsquo;s approach as intercultural and there is growing consensus that this is a more progressive and effective way of helping immigrants to integrate.  An intercultural approach is where interaction, exchange and communication between cultures is encouraged and there is an egalitarian relationship between the host culture and the immigrant cultures.</P>
        <P>I agree with those who have highlighted education as an important part of integration policy and an important mechanism to integrate children and young immigrants to the host culture.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, states that the battle for integration will be won or lost in the schools.</P>
        <P>We have many problems that must be overcome if we are to help the children of immigrants to integrate properly.  One of these is planning.  Many immigrants live in suburbs of our capital city.  We must ensure the way we plan does not lead to new schools catering specifically for the children of immigrants, creating educational ghettos.  This would not be in the interests of educational planning or integration policy.  We must be careful to gather statistics to inform our planning system so that we can respond with properly integrated schools, with a combination of new immigrant populations and our Irish population.</P>
        <P>I am concerned at the models of education provided to the children of immigrants enrolling in our schools.  When the Minister for Education and Science was in the House we spoke of the dominance of the faith-based model in Ireland.  The Catholic Church runs 98% of State schools.  While it has done a good job over many decades, we recognise it is time for a new, non-denominational model for children of other faith cultures.  Educate Together is a positive model and some 20 applications have been made for new schools this year.  This reflects the demand for a new model for non-denominational education catering for children of immigrants attending school in this country.</P>
        <P>I support those who call for a greater emphasis on English language training for the children of immigrants attending our schools.  In Australia, English language training is provided for between six and 12 months prior to a child attending a mainstream school.  We should examine this model.  It is difficult for children to integrate and assimilate if there are language barriers.  Providing preliminary language training before school would make it easier for them.</P>
<Col N="231"/>
        <P Just="Left">Many positive steps have been taken in the development of an integration policy.  I recognise the fact that we have appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for integration, a positive step.  The increase in the budget from &euro;5 million to &euro;9 million is welcome, as is the establishment of a task force for integration.  The national action plan on racism supports our policy on integration.  The Department of Education and Science has provided guidelines on intercultural education, developed in response to the situation in our schools.  The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism is another important structure to support and assist the implementation of an integration policy.</P>
        <P>Some have criticised, however, how integration policy has focused on immigrants as economic units, taking a labour market approach to the challenge of immigration.  Cultural assimilation is important and I am pleased to see funding dedicated to awareness raising exercises through the media, arts, sports and cultural spaces to promote positive images of other cultures and develop greater understanding among the public.  We also need mechanisms to promote enhanced participation of immigrants in our society, politically in terms of policy making and at community level.</P>
        <P>A number of concerns have been expressed by non-governmental organisations and groups representing immigrants.  There have been repeated calls for an independent appeals mechanism for immigration decisions.  There is a need for a transparent and independent appeals mechanism for immigration decisions.  I hope the Government will commit to this and establish it soon.  There is also concern about the payment to asylum seekers.  When first introduced in 2000 it was &euro;19.10 and has not changed in seven years.  I was contacted by groups who expressed disappointment that this amount was not increased.  We should consider this for the budget next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Buttimer.  A politician in another country is spending much time quoting Dr. Martin Luther King when he says certain issues require an urgent passion for now.  The subject we are discussing is one such issue.  We spend much time talking about infrastructure, public spending and other issues in this House.  Problems created in these areas can be fixed later.  The issue of social integration and the kind of society we want is very different.  If we do not make the correct decisions in respect of these matters, future generations will reap very negative consequences as a result of our lack of action in and focus on this area.</P>
        <P>This matter must be set against a backdrop of an experience of integration in Ireland which has been very positive.  I live in and represent an area that has experienced colossal change in a short <Col N="232"/>period.  I have been struck by how, for the majority of people, this has been a positive experience which has led to the economic, social and religious regeneration of areas that needed it.</P>
        <P>The kind of integration for which we must strive is that which gives people arriving here the ability to live independent lives and which allows them to be respected.  These people&rsquo;s lives must not be completely separate from the country and society they have entered.  To date, we have by and large been able to facilitate people in this regard.</P>
        <P>One of the many questions we must answer is whether our success in this area was achieved by design or through luck.  In view of the rapid change taking place and the degree to which our society has changed so quickly, I am of the view that this success has been achieved more through luck than by design.  I do not mean this as a criticism because the luck to which I refer is that which we have generated.  It is luck that draws upon the many positive qualities of Irish people, namely, the desire to be generous and to respect other people who are trying to look after themselves and their families and create a better life for all.</P>
        <P>There are, however, a number of areas in respect of which we should refocus our attention to ensure we do the right thing by those arriving into the country and the people already living here.  Previous speakers referred to some of these areas so I will not dwell on them at length.  I will concentrate on those areas in respect of which not much was said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first matter to which I wish to refer involves children arriving in Ireland with adults who are not their parents or with whom they do not have a close positive relationship.  After a short period, these children are frequently stranded here without adults who can look after them.  I have seen figures which indicate there are up to 300 such minors in Ireland who find themselves in that position.  I cannot think of a situation that would be more desperate or wretched than being a young person stranded in a country where one was not born, with which one has little or no cultural affinity and with nobody to look after one.  The relevant agencies must up their game in dealing with this issue.  Barnardos has pointed out the frequency with which such children are abandoned and the need for us to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>The second issue to which I wish to refer is that involving the operation of the refugee tribunals.  It is scandalous that certain individuals are being treated in a particular way by some of these tribunals.  It was stated in the House earlier in the week that a member of one of the refugee tribunals has consistently refused people entry to this country and continually prevented them from being treated in a dignified and fair manner.  The degree of discussion taking place in respect of this <Col N="233"/>matter and the priority it is being given is scandalous.  It is important that we should take action in this regard in a more urgent and passionate fashion.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the most globalised small country in the world.  Our recent success has been built on our unique ability to benefit from flows of capital.  The challenge we face is to ensure we benefit socially, culturally and economically from the flows of people that will enter the country in the future.  We should not just refer to these individuals as a flow of labour.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Donohoe for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey.</P>
        <P>We live in a multicultural society.  Those of us who live in Cork would never have thought we would come to live in an Ireland in which we would be obliged to embrace different cultures, languages and nationalities.  We should take cognisance of the latter in formulating a phased, planned integration policy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who was present earlier, was correct to state that the integration of newcomers is one of the most important social issues we face.  It is regrettable that we did not have a planned integration policy in the education sector.  It is important that young people entering the country are welcomed and begin their studies here in a positive manner.</P>
        <P>I welcome Deputy Conor Lenihan&rsquo;s appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for integration.  Census figures indicate that the percentage of immigrants entering the country is continually increasing.  It is imperative, therefore, that these people be integrated.  Senator Regan referred to existing immigration legislation, applications for residency permits, the work permit system, driver safety legislation and the education system.  I appeal to the Minister of State to continue to examine ways in which we might introduce improvements in these areas.  We must reinforce, in particular, the work done by teachers who are being frustrated in their efforts to reach out to people.  As a former teacher, I am acutely aware of what is happening in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Planning is a vital factor.  I pay tribute to the Cois Tine group in Cork which operates under the leadership of Fr. Angelo Lafferty and his team and the SMA Fathers.  This group works with people and helps them integrate into our society.  It  behoves us all to dispel the myth relating to racism and to deal with the intolerance that exists in many parts of our society in respect of new communities.</P>
        <P>The needs of migrants have changed and are centred on information and help in respect of the asylum process, particularly as many of them have moved out of asylum centres and into communities.  These people face a struggle in terms of <Col N="234"/>dealing with issues relating to housing, employment, schools and integration.</P>
        <P>The issue of education is critical and I appeal to the Minister of State that, even if we do nothing else in respect of our integration policy, we ensure we empower our schools and provide them with resources.  I have worked in the area of education and I encountered immigrant students and their families who had difficulties adjusting.  We must remember that one size does not fit all.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We need to support ethnic groups, reinforce the work being done by many great organisations &mdash; in Cork it is done by Cois Tine and NASC &mdash; and build bridges to new communities.  By doing so and by building on the good work that has already been done, we will avoid the regrettable ghettoisation that is beginning to occur in some parts of our cities.  I appeal to the Minister of State to put in place the structures that are necessary to build and create new communities.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for their interesting comments on the future direction of immigration policy.  In the short time I have been in the Chamber I observed great unity among Members in support of the approach we are adopting.  That many Members have much to contribute indicates the complexity of the issue of immigration.  I reiterate that we have an unique opportunity in Ireland to get it right in terms of how we deal with this issue.  Members will often have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, say that in the context of learning from the mistakes of other countries and our becoming a truly international example of best practice in dealing with this issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been transformed by immigration.  I heard what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said.  Anybody who works in Dublin city and elsewhere in the country recognises the positive contribution immigration has made to this country.  It has thrown up challenges and raised some fears but overall a positive contribution has been made by all of those who have chosen to come to live here.  We have been enriched by people from a wide variety of cultures who have come to live among us.  However, we must ensure we do not squander the goodwill that currently undoubtedly exists.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has consulted the Civil Service commissioners on mechanisms to encourage non-Irish nationals to join the public service.  Another priority is the encouragement of ethnic entrepreneurship.  The Minister of State was a great supporter of the Emerge programme, when he was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development, which greatly aided non-Irish nationals to establish businesses.  As the Minister of State develops <Col N="235"/>Ireland&rsquo;s integration policy in the next few months, he will seek to meet with and to listen to all stakeholders.  He described the mechanisms he intends to put in place for that to happen.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that we are at a very exciting stage in developing integration policy.  We recognise the importance of proper planning, which is essential.  We will put in place consultation measures with other Departments to ensure the mainstreaming of Ireland&rsquo;s integration policy into all areas of strategic planning.</P>
<Col N="236"/>
        <P>The comments of the Members who spoke have been useful and the Minister of State will take them on board in developing his policy for the future.</P>
