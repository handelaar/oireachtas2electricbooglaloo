	<P>I have notice from Senator Dan Boyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the policy of equality of treatment for children throughout the country, in terms of pre-treatment in areas such as vaccination, and ongoing and after treatment with conditions such as childhood diabetes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Camillus Glynn of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that borough councils and town councils will continue to receive their housing allocations directly as is currently the case and not through the county councils as is proposed re the housing allocations for 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Standing Order 94A, without debate, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, statements on Chad, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be given five minutes to respond at the end of the debate. </P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators may have heard a report on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning on the difficulties experienced by those in new primary schools in regard to the start-up grant, which currently stands at &euro;6,300.  For example, in <Col N="1810"/>Adamstown in Lucan, which is a strategic development zone, a primary school was put in place as an emergency measure in July.  I spoke to teachers in three of the schools in Adamstown and with those in the gaelscoil in the area and learned that they are experiencing great difficulty in setting up what is needed in the schools.  The grant is inadequate in terms of the resources required for the curriculum.  While the Minister for Education and Science was in the House recently, perhaps she might be invited back to address this matter.  This grant has not been reviewed for some time.  An emergency exists with the shortage of primary schools places.  Another primary school will be  needed in Lucan next September.  In west Dublin and in north Dublin there is a crisis in terms of primary school places, but this is added to immeasurably by the difficulties posed by the level of this grant.  It means that teachers have to do a great deal of photocopying and have to use the local library and go to Lidl  to purchase musical instruments at a cost price.  The insufficient funding places significant pressures on teachers who should be getting on with the core business of teaching.  It also means it is very difficult for them to employ secretaries.  Decisions need to be made to increase the grant.  The Minister for Education and Science was in the House recently but I would be grateful if the Leader would take up this issue with her again.  Reviewing the grant will ease the burden on many teachers in start-up primary schools around the country.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey, who cannot be here this morning, asked me to ask the Leader if he had heard from the Garda Commissioner on whether there will be prosecutions on foot of the Leas Cross nursing home inquiry.</P>
        <P>I launched a report yesterday on violence against women entitled, &ldquo;Women Overcoming Violent Experiences&rdquo;.  It was produced by a voluntary women&rsquo;s group that provides superb support to women who suffer from domestic violence.  Another report was published yesterday on the huge cost to the health service arising from domestic violence against women.  We could discuss this in the House.  The Government has invested more resources than ever in this area, but perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will consider funding local women&rsquo;s groups that provide a very personal service to women who find it difficult to leave violent circumstances and who must sometimes remain in them.  Support for the relevant local organisations, in addition to the national ones, would be very welcome and helpful to those concerned and would prove very productive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s point on grants is certainly worth considering.  We should remind ourselves that last week we raised with the Minister for Education and Science the fact that we expect management grants for primary schools to be doubled, as was indicated <Col N="1811"/>or promised at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis.  We expect this to be announced next week.</P>
        <P>We have recently raised the question of ethos.  My colleague Senator Norris has referred regularly to the ethos of the Catholic and Protestant churches in educational institutions and mentioned the ethos associated with sacking and employing staff and enrolling students.  I have raised the matter myself.  <i>The Irish Times</i> suggests this morning that we might consider protecting the Protestant ethos on the Trinity panel.  This deserves some discussion because I did not recognise that my colleagues representing Trinity College represented a particular ethos.  I am sure they will be as quick as I am in saying this.  I am sorry Senator Norris is not present because I am sure he would agree with me.  The word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; is confused with culture and other matters and while there are real phenomena that need to be protected in society, &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; is not the word that describes them.</P>
        <P>A related matter was raised in the House on a number of occasions, namely, the support CURA receives from the Government, in addition to the question of the Positive Options campaign.  I am delighted the organisation has decided, in agreement with the Catholic bishops, to ensure all those who approach it will be made aware of and receive the Positive Options leaflet.  It is good that the service is the same in all circumstances.  This is how CURA has dealt with the question of ethos.  A good news story arising from this development is that there are now fewer teenage pregnancies than there were heretofore and the number of women going abroad for abortions has decreased.  I refer to The Netherlands in addition to the United Kingdom because somebody suggested women may be going to the former for abortions instead of the latter.  There are therefore some positive developments in this area.  It is good that Positive Options is not being excluded in any of the discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all welcome the announcement today that the Government is to launch a &euro;15 million campaign to alert the country to the dangers of climate change and suggest what can be done about it.  The campaign is based on a five-year strategy and will make the public aware of how it can meet the goals agreed under the Kyoto Protocol.  According to this agreement, we must reduce our emissions level to 13% above the level that existed in 1990.  At present, the level is 25% above it and the latest statistics indicate a disimprovement.  I was therefore glad to hear of the Government&rsquo;s campaign.</P>
        <P>It was reported that emissions in the United States decreased by 1.5% last year.  Next week the US Senate will debate a Bill on climate change and it hopes to put in law the requirement to reduce emissions by 60% over the next 40 years.  This is good news in respect of one of the world&rsquo;s greatest polluters in terms of emissions. <Col N="1812"/> Many countries seem to be making real changes to lower emissions.  Will the Leader press upon the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the need to proceed with the Climate Protection Bill, which was debated in this House almost two months ago?</P>
        <P>I was glad to see that Cathal Guiomard of the Commission for Aviation Regulation intends to name and shame airlines that fail to provide compensation to passengers who experience delays or suffer from the loss of or damage to their baggage.  The number of passenger complaints has trebled in the past two years and one in four complaints to the European Consumer Centre relates to the airline industry.  Some chief executives of the industry have very thick skins when complaints are made.  It is fair to recognise the tremendous benefits new airline entrants have brought to the Irish market, not only in terms of tourism but also in terms of the ability of emigrants to return home to visit their loved ones at a frequency that was never envisaged years ago.  Passenger rights legislation was introduced in 2005 but it is clear that airlines do not seem to be making it easy for passengers to enjoy these rights and receive compensation where required.  Will the Minister for Transport monitor this and introduce further legislation to deal with the airlines if necessary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on public service reform made by Senator Alex White on the Order of Business yesterday.  He referred to a recent and excellent speech made by the Minister for Finance at the Indecon conference.  Another very good speech was made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness.  I recommend that Members read the two speeches, both of which concern improving efficiencies and productivity in the public service.  Everybody recognises this is a priority.  A debate on this would be good because it will open our minds to a new approach to ensuring current systemic inefficiencies, which are costing taxpayers enormous sums of money, are dealt with.  There are excellent people in the public service but, equally, there are others who are hiding behind them, many of whom are protected by trade unions such as IMPACT, which regards itself as a preserver of inefficiencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outrageous.  The job of the trade unions is not to preserve <?oasys _ch ?>inefficiencies.  They have led the charge against inefficiency in the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks on ethos.  Most parents whose children are going to or have completed school will recognise the excellence of many teachers but also the fact that many were not cut out for the profession.  We need a means by which efficiencies can be injected into the system.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1813"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>One should sack those who do not do their work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>All senior positions should be opened up to the private sector as well as the public sector.  There should be no discrimination in respect of access to good, well-paid jobs in the public sector.  Thus, we would have the public services to which we all aspire and which taxpayers deserve in view on the large quantum of money they are investing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be in order and timely if the Leader again conveyed our very best wishes to Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady, who is making his return from Rome today.  He is to arrive in Dublin and will later be escorted by the PSNI from the Border.  It is an historic day for Ireland and the Cardinal personally.  It merits repeating that he is an exceptional pastor and a great scholar, and he is absolutely and very visibly a man of God.  We are tremendously proud of him in County Cavan and Senators Wilson and Brady will testify to this.  We have discussed it previously.  I ask the Leader again to wish Cardinal Brady well on our behalf.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Hannigan on his prescience in raising the matter I intended to raise, although some of the points made merit repeating.  The latest European Commission figures suggest that Ireland looks set to overshoot its Kyoto Agreement commitment by almost 100% and that CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will be close to twice the amount they should be at the requisite time.  A UN report calls for cuts in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions to limit global warming to below 2&deg; Celsius and for more funds to help developing countries adopt to climate change.  This is also the view of the stop climate change lobby group and many other interested parties.</P>
        <P>We propose to spend considerable sums of money purchasing carbon credits.  However, I would welcome two initiatives from this Government.  Senator Hannigan mentioned funding to increase awareness among the people, which is important.  I would also welcome building regulations.</P>
        <P>This Government has essentially failed to make any real inroads into dealing with carbon emissions and the threat of climate change.  Radical steps are necessary and we should be much more proactive.  The recent reports are disturbing.  Will the Leader raise this with the relevant Minister?</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs if he has the results on the investigation I sought on the discriminatory means test in regard to non-contributory pensions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the Minister for Health and Children came to the House and took questions following statements.  We also had a debate on education last Thursday.  Will the Cathaoirleach and the Leader raise the point at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, <Col N="1814"/>which I believe is the appropriate forum, that the Seanad would possibly work more efficiently if we had regular meetings with Ministers and if we had the ability to table questions to them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>A point made last week, and one which I have made since I became a Member of this House, is that an eight minute contribution on statements is not enough time to ask the relevant questions no matter how good one is.  It would be good from the Minister&rsquo;s point of view as well in that he or she would know the questions which would be asked.  The Minister for Health and Children was exceptional in her ability to deal with every issue.  If we had a regular opportunity to ask questions, which had been submitted to Ministers, it would enable us to keep up-to-date with issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like some guidance on whether we need to invite the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss a recent report which suggests there is serious gender inequality in terms of female entrepreneurs.  I do not believe the females of Ireland are any less entrepreneurial than their male counterparts but a recent report would lead me to call for a debate.  I do not know whether entrepreneurship begins in school with the choices people are offered or whether it is an equality issue.  I will leave it to the Leader&rsquo;s discretion to decide which is the more appropriate Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate on Seanad reform last night the point Senator Keaveney made was discussed, that is, the opportunity for Members of the Seanad to ask Ministers questions. That would be a very useful way to go.  I would like to invite two Ministers to the House to do what the Minister for Health and Children did last week.</P>
        <P>Earlier Senator Fitzgerald referred to Lucan and Senator O&rsquo;Toole talked about the Protestant ethos being maintained.  Let us make sure we also maintain the Catholic ethos.  The reason I mention it is that I heard the interview on radio earlier this morning with Educate Together in Adamstown and with the Gaelscoileanna.  There is a need to ask the Minister for Education and Science to look again at the setting up of new schools.  Catholic schools have been established for generations.  That worked very well.  We ended up with a marvellous education system.</P>
        <P>There are now schools of varying ethos, one of which is Educate Together.  There are people who want a different type of education to a religious one and clearly they need set up money to establish themselves.  As the head teacher explained, the same amount of money, &euro;6,374, is given to a school whether it is a 12-teacher or a two-teacher one.  There is clearly a need to look again at that.</P><Col N="1815"/>
        <P>The House the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government attended the House last night but I would like the Leader to invite him to return to return as there is a need for him to answer questions on his views on planning matters.  Last year Senator Mary White and I mentioned the number of petrol stations which are disappearing because land is being used for other purposes.  Golf courses, which give us green spaces around our cities, seem to be disappearing.  In north Dublin, I can think of Clontarf.  I gather D&uacute;n Laoghaire golf club recently disappeared.  There is also talk about Foxrock golf club and Douglas golf club in Cork.  These green spaces were great to look at but we are losing them.  While the land may be put to worthwhile use, we need to have a discussion on the issue and it would be useful if it could take place in this House.  The Minister could also answer the question the Irish Rural Dwellers Association asked about appointments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to discuss An Bord Plean&aacute;la and An Taisce, which is a blight for many people down the country in that it seems to have the ability to become a serial objector &mdash; in fact, it objects to pretty much everything in my part of the world.</P>
        <P>I would also like the Minister to answer questions on the housing aid for the elderly scheme which used to be administered by the HSE but which will now come under his Department.  Other grant schemes will also be administered and expanded by his Department.  I calculate that approximately 140 people in the HSE administered the housing aid for the elderly scheme.  This job is now being transferred to the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the local authorities but the staff have not been forthcoming.  As a result of embargoes, no staff will be supplied to administer the scheme and the other expanded schemes.</P>
        <P>I want to ensure that in 18 months&rsquo; time we do not receive calls from local authority members telling us applications are not being processed.  In some counties, the processing of applications is very slow.  Perhaps we might discuss that matter when the Minister comes to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a matter discussed many times in the House, namely, the state of the fire service.  I refer to the ongoing investigation into the Bray fire tragedy.  There is much concern that the scope of the investigation is not wide enough and that only the fire and the building are being investigated.  It is important the systems, procedures and protocols surrounding that tragedy and all fire tragedies are investigated.  I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to debate the fire service and report on <Col N="1816"/>systems, procedures and protocols.  This issue needs to be addressed. </P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on car insurance.  There is much evidence to suggest there are many uninsured cars on our roads and that the status of some of those insured is questionable.  I know and am pleased to be able to say that all cars that leave garages are insured because I have checked it.  I am not so sure, however, that this is true in certain cases following purchase at car auctions.  It is a serious matter.  It is bad enough if people who get behind the wheel are bad drivers.  A person can be a good driver without or without insurance but if he or she has no insurance, it is a serious matter.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I raised a matter here that was brought to my attention, not for the first time, by one of my constituents in County Westmeath.  The matter pertains to organ donation.  There is a great need for a debate on this matter.  I will not go into the whys and wherefores of it because we will do that when the debate arises.  This individual and others to whom I have spoken and who have contacted me on this matter are deeply concerned.  I ask the Leader and our spokesperson on health, therefore, to exhort the Minister for Health and Children to have a debate on this very sensitive issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As the only Senator in the Chamber from the University of Dublin panel, it is certainly news to me that I represent people of any particular religious ethos.  As somebody who was brought up a Catholic and is now firmly lapsed and an atheist, I am very proud to represent people of all religions and none.  I hope all Senators here feel the same way.  It is dangerous to start talking about anyone representing any particular religious ethos.  On the debate on the reform of the Seanad last night, I strongly supported the calls to open up the university seats to graduates of all third level institutions as part of an overall package of comprehensive reform.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and abortion.  I renew my call to the Leader for a debate on this topic.  While it is welcome news that the numbers of abortions have fallen, we must still be very concerned that women in terribly tragic situations like that in which Miss D found herself earlier this year must still travel abroad for services which should be available to them in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have also called for a debate on gender issues in our society.  I note a report today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> about a study produced by Frances Ruane from the Economic and Social Research Institute and Julie Sutherland from Trinity College which showed that women are far less highly represented in the manufacturing sector and entrepreneurship and that far smaller numbers of women own firms and are successful in business.  It would be useful to have a debate on why this is so and to look at women&rsquo;s rep<Col N="1817"/>resentation across all sectors of society, including the Seanad and D&aacute;il where our numbers are still very low.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the call of the Fine Gael Senator for a debate in this House on the future of fire services in this country.  The appalling tragedy that occurred in my constituency in Bray that resulted in the deaths of two fireman obviously has focused national attention on fire services.  I know the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Tony Killeen, is responsible for fire services.  My colleagues and I are meeting with him next week.  It would be very helpful for this House if he came here to hear the concerns of Members about fire services throughout the country and, in particular, to address the investigations being carried out into fire services in Bray and the organisation of fire services in County Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Three investigations are being carried out by Wicklow County Council, the Health and Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, respectively.  There are concerns that because Wicklow County Council is the fire authority and is responsible for the organisation and delivery of fire services the terms of reference established for that investigation should be very carefully monitored.  I know a number of local councillors have expressed concern that those terms of reference would be transparent and that they would have an opportunity to have an input into it.  I would like the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House so that we can debate fire services in Bray and nationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question for the Leader of the House.  We had a discussion on the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill which was restored to the Order Paper.  The matter seemed to be urgent and there was some furore about it.  What is the current status of the Bill and how is it planned to progress it?</P>
        <P>In respect of the same subject, I draw the attention of the House to the significant new evidence which emerged at the Mahon tribunal over recent days.  We have seen the evidence of Des Richardson and, in particular, P&aacute;draic O&rsquo;Connor, which is reported in all the media today and on news bulletins last night.  In that regard, I am surprised RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very brief and conclude.  I draw attention to the relegation of the report by RTE in its main news bulletins, unlike other television stations.  This follows on from a pattern by RTE in respect of certain dealings relating to fair broadcasting.  It follows on, of course, from a soft interview with the Taoiseach last September which allowed him to get his story across about the &euro;300,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader previously indicated that I did not compliment the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on any occasion I have spoken in this House.  On this occasion, I compliment him on his imagination in thinking up the stories of the dig-out loans.  I thank him for his audacity in going to the nation and reporting on that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I accept the Chair&rsquo;s ruling.  At the beginning of the current session of this House, many people pointed out that this House needs to be relevant.  If we close our eyes to what is going around us, that is bad for politics and this House.</P>

	<P>To illuminate a previous point made in connection with CURA, the Positive Options leaflet includes details about CURA but CURA does not hand out this leaflet.  If a lady who wishes to have an abortion comes to CURA, it refers her to a doctor and not to an abortion referral agency.  That is the current situation, as I confirmed this morning, and I do not see any change in that.</P>
        <P>A call was made this morning for certain services to be introduced.  The services that were called for were abortion services.  If we wish to have a debate on this matter, I would be happy to debate it because there is no stomach for abortion in this country.  There may be an unwanted pregnancy but there is no such thing as an unwanted child.  There are a couple of silent screams in the world, one of them being that of couples who cannot have children and who would love to adopt the children of girls who may not wish to have their baby.  The least these girls could do is to allow the child to live.  That is the ethos that is being spoken about and which I believe will continue in this country.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader to convey my gratitude to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, for the time she spent here last week?  I concur with Senator Keaveney on the value of asking questions.  I asked two questions of the Minister because my time was restricted to four minutes.  One related to Killucan national school, which the Leader knows very well.</P>

	<P>I support the Leader in that.  The other school is Athlone Community College, also dear to the Leader&rsquo;s heart, and part of the VEC.  Plans have been drawn up but there is no start date.  I asked the Minister about these matters and she agreed to reply but I have heard nothing yet.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald regarding women overcoming violence.  The Minister should attend a full debate here to see how we can support women who find themselves in this sensitive and sad position.  These women are voiceless and, by the nature of the sensitive issue, they need people like us to represent them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest inviting the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House before she makes appointments to the HSE board.  There is major absen<Col N="1820"/>teeism of board members at the moment and quite a few turn up to very few meetings.  All board members receive approximately &euro;17,500 per year and the least they could do is attend board meetings, particularly when there is such a crisis in the health services.  The chairpersons of the health forums, who are elected, receive no remuneration for their sterling work on behalf of the State and could serve on the board of the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has let down the Minister badly in the past week in respect of its conduct on the matter in Portlaoise.  It seems to take no responsibility.  The Cathaoirleach was a member of the Midland Health board and I was chairman of the Western Health Board.  I attended all the meetings and presume the Cathaoirleach did too but I would be ashamed to miss so many meetings.  A lottery takes place between board members to decide who should attend board meetings.  It is like a meeting of godfathers to see who draws the short straw.</P>

	<P>Regarding Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to revisit the Planning and Development Act 2000 in view of the length of time it takes to deal with planning application, whole sections of the legislation should be revisited.  When the planning division grants planning permission an objection may be lodged and the matter must be decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is no joined up thinking regarding the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  By the time a decision is made on the application, six months have passed.  That should not happen and the entire Act should be revisited.  It should be <Col N="1821"/>divided into sections because it is too clumsy and covers too much as it stands. </P>

It is a worthwhile programme to aid vulnerable elderly people living in substandard accommodation.  Its administration has been handed over to local authorities.  Several senior members of the housing staff in Galway County Council are concerned that although they have been given the responsibility and the funds, they have not been given the staff to administer the programme.  I call on the Minister to address the problem.</P>

	<P>It is seldom that good news stories are raised on the Order of Business.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole brought a significant good news story to our notice this morning, namely, the decrease in women travelling abroad for abortions.  This is significant because people are contemplating the consequences of abortion for those unfortunate women.  There is a sense of guilt and psychological problems.  Those who use the women in the debate on abortion forget them very quickly afterwards.  There are no surveys or follow up statistics available but this matter is coming to the fore.  I do not believe there is need for a debate on abortion.  We know what happened in the past and how divisive it was.</P>
        <P>We should debate how to help people with unwanted pregnancies.  This has not been put forward for discussion.  We dealt with the two extremes but seldom thought of the people directly involved.  I ask the Leader for a debate in that context and the Seanad could provide leadership.  Abortion is not an answer to anyone&rsquo;s problem.  It demeans human life and it does not help if legislators do not consider the life of everyone, including the unborn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader on how he summarised the health issue yesterday.  Debates on health, to which I listened, have been valuable in both Houses over the past weeks.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole brought moderation to the debate when he mentioned how we could tackle problems in health.  I am pleased to hear that the Leader will invite the Minister to the Seanad to discuss the review of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE is not working on behalf of the people who provide funding for the HSE.  We should review it.  As a former member of the health boards and the HSE I was not quick to jump to conclusions.  I wanted to see a settling in period but it is not capable of delivering the services we require.  We should bring moderation to the debate and find solutions.  If we cannot do so the Seanad has failed.  I look forward to contributing to the debate.  A better service should be delivered.  If the HSE was not capable of pro<Col N="1822"/>viding the service as a single unit it should be split into four units, one for each province.  Health services could then deliver the eight centres of excellence required for cancer services.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Walsh, Quinn and Ormonde expressed strong views on the funding of primary schools.  It is a challenge of a positive nature, particularly in light of the increase in our population.  It is a by-product of the Celtic tiger, parts 1 and 2.  I will pass on the Senators&rsquo; views and I have no difficulty in making time available for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald inquired about the follow-up to Leas Cross.  I last commented on this matter on 22 November.  The updated position is that the Garda authorities have confirmed to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that they followed up on the media reports and on a number of letters of concern received by them in respect of Leas Cross.  The Garda has kept in close contact with the DPP&rsquo;s office on this matter and on 14 June it was agreed with the DPP that they would await receipt of the O&rsquo;Donovan report commissioned by the HSE, at which juncture the issue of a full criminal investigation will again be examined.</P>
        <P>The Senator also inquired about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform coming before the House to discuss domestic violence and the allocation of further funding.  I have no difficulty setting aside time to debate this matter.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Bacik, Hanafin, McFadden and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed their strong views on unwanted pregnancies, CURA, funding, leaflet distribution and all other aspects of this matter.  I do not believe it will be possible to debate this issue in the House prior to Christmas because time is getting short.  If, however, some of the political parties wish to table Private Members&rsquo; motions in order to assist the Senators, I have no difficulty in facilitating such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden inquired about the new school for Kilucan and the new facility for 1,000 students at Athlone community college.  As a result of the time I spent serving as a Deputy in the Lower House, I am in a position to update the Senator on the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Bishop of Meath kindly donated, on behalf of the diocesan trust, a state-of-the-art site at Killucan.  This was badly needed because the population in the area has <Col N="1823"/>increased by 140%.  We are awaiting the green light from the Department, which approved the building of a new school, to proceed with the next stage of this project.</P>
        <P>Athlone has been waiting for a new community college for approximately 15 years.  I played a pivotal role, along with the Minister for Education and Science, in ensuring the project would be announced during the final term of the previous D&aacute;il.  A new community college that will accommodate 1,000 students is to be built on the current site.  I will ask the Minister how we might progress matters in respect of this new facility, which as already been sanctioned.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and O&rsquo;Reilly inquired about climate change and the serious challenge the world faces in this regard.  Senator Hannigan stated that the US is at long last taking up this challenge and is drawing up a master plan to reduce its emissions by 60%.  Stronger and much larger nations have a massive responsibility in this area.  The Indian ambassador came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment when I was its Chairman and stated that his country, which is friendly to Ireland, would be able to assist us and perhaps save the Exchequer a large amount of money.  I will endeavour to discover where stands his offer at this stage.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators that we face a serious challenge.  The major powers have not been as vigilant, determined or committed as small nations such as Ireland.  We will do everything in our power to ensure progress in this area.  There has been a major change of attitude in respect of this matter.  I am extremely proud of the people of Ireland with regard to the way they are facing up to the challenge and responding to the leadership offered by the relevant Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Department in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh requested that the Minister for Finance come before the House to discuss his speech at the Indecon conference and the comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, regarding the contribution of the public service.  I am sure that a debate on these matters would be welcome.  A budget debate will take place in the House at 6 p.m. on Wednesday next.  After the Order of Business, but before this morning&rsquo;s CPP meeting, perhaps I could meet the other leaders to discuss the time that will be required for that debate.  I have no difficulty in bringing the point raised by Senator Walsh into the debate if the leaders of the other groups are in agreement.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly offered his best wishes to Cardinal Brady and congratulated everyone associated with his accession to higher office, particularly the Holy Father, who is responsible for appointing Ireland&rsquo;s third cardinal.  I live three parishes away from Cardinal Brady who is a man <Col N="1824"/>of immense faith.  We all wish him well and I look forward to working with him in the future.  It was extremely uplifting to watch his investiture on television on Sunday morning last.</P>
        <P>The power of religion is very important to every human being.  Some people who reach low points in their lives return to their churches or their faiths.  Religion could play a major role in combating the terrible plague of suicide.  Many of the unfortunate people who are affected by suicide turn to religion.

        <P>Senators Keaveney, Quinn, McFadden and Bacik requested that the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science come before the House.</P>
        <P>On Seanad reform, Senators stated that they would welcome the holding of an orderly question time in the House, even if it was only on one day per week.  I do not know how possible it would be to facilitate this request.  However, when the Minister for Health and Children recently came before the House, the question and answer session we held was very orderly.  I am aware that her response to it was extremely positive.  As Members, we are all aware that this is the direction the House needs to take.  This matter will be on the agenda relating to Seanad reform and those who are appointed to the committee announced yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, will be able to progress it further.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to gender balance and entrepreneurs.  I have discovered throughout my life that entrepreneurs are born and that it is difficult to make them, male or female.</P>

	<P>Senators Quinn, Daly and &Oacute; Murchu called for a debate on the challenges we face in the context of planning.  I have no difficulty in arranging time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Daly and Cannon requested a debate on housing aid for the elderly and asked that additional staff be appointed by local authorities in respect of this matter.  I will pass on their views to the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Coffey and de B&uacute;rca referred to the fire services.  The councils are at present involved in discussions on estimates with county managers.  The fire services and the libraries were left on the back burner for many years.  Those of us who were members of local authorities were obliged to preside over these services when resources were scarce.  As with the Exchequer, there is major buoyancy in local authority finances.  I ask Senators to return to their council groups to see if the fire services can be placed at the centre of their requests for funding.  No Member of this House is more committed to the fire services than the Leader.  I am the son of a fire station officer and, following my father&rsquo;s retirement, my brother was fire station officer in Castlepollard for 37 years.  I know what it is like to be called out to deal with problems when one does not have the wherewithal to do so.  If a debate in this House is needed on fire services I have no difficulty in again setting aside time for it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the two Wicklow firemen who unfortunately lost their lives I read in the newspapers that a quarter&rsquo;s pay was not paid to them.  This is an all-time low.  A quarter&rsquo;s pay is a three hour call out.  It is regrettable that fire officers were paid for only the first half-hour or hour, died, and were not paid for the second two hours.  Let us call a spade a spade.  This Leader fully supports whatever this House can do for firemen.  We will keep the matter on the agenda at every session of the 23rd Seanad to see what we can do to assist them and to ensure the people of Ireland have fire services and the wherewithal for fire men and fire women to fight the emergencies with which they must deal morning, noon and night.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on insurance.  This is one of the great success stories of the previous D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Uninsured vehicles account for 10% of all those on our roads today and 10% of everyone&rsquo;s premium, even that of a person with a no-claims bonus for 30 years, is for the uninsured.  This is true for motor, commercial and all other types of insurance.  Everyone knows this.  Having conducted a large amount of research, I believe the only answer is to introduce a handset similar to that used by the police in New York.  They place a handset the size of a mobile telephone to the tax disc on a car windscreen and within 30 seconds are told whether the person is insured and has taxed his or her car.  The device can also tell whether an offence was committed within the past five years.  The master computer into which everything feeds <Col N="1826"/>costs a large amount of money.  It is used in New Zealand as well as New York.  I would welcome a debate on this to see how we can progress it during the new D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn also called for a debate on organ donations.  I have no problem in setting aside time for such a debate.  Senator Regan called for an update on the Tribunal of Inquiry Bill.  I will make inquiries after the Order of Business and get back to the Senator on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on membership of the new board of the HSE to be held in the presence of the Minister for Health and Children.  I have no problem setting aside time for this.  Senator Butler called for a review of the HSE after three or four years of its establishment, a matter which I also have no problem setting aside time.</P>
        <P>Senator Patrick Burke called for a debate on tourism.  This has been agreed and I gave a commitment to the House that this would happen.  If we can have it before the Christmas recess we will.  If not, we will have it early in the new year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad, on my own behalf and that of the Minister for Defence, for providing this opportunity to outline the background to the proposed EU operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, CAR, and the reasons the Government decided to authorise the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the operation.</P>
        <P>The basis of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in international peacekeeping is firmly grounded in the United Nations.  Ireland is, and always has been, a strong and committed supporter of co-operative multilateral arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, particularly the United Nations.  In tandem with this, Ireland has recognised and defended the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the UN has recognised the advantages presented by the existence of regional organisations, such as the European Union, to which it can assign crisis management and peace support missions.  Similar developments have occurred between the UN and other regional organisations.  In the case of Liberia, the initial deployment of troops was from the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and in the case of Kosovo it was NATO.</P>
        <P>The increasing reliance of the UN on regional actors in crisis management situations has, in part, contributed to the impetus towards development of the European security and defence policy, ESDP.  The European Union now has the capacity to mount major peacekeeping operations and to date a total of five military operations, in and outside Europe, have been undertaken by the European Union.  The comprehensive range of instruments available to the European Union, including the capacity to deploy military forces, means that the European Union now has the capacity to play a major role in supporting international peace and security and in support of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>UN-EU co-operation is being developed continuously to ensure a coherent and complementary response in peace support operations.  There is also increasing co-operation between the UN and the EU in the area of crisis management with EU involvement in the areas of &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo; including courts and prisons, civil administration and civil protection including response to natural disasters.  The increasing necessity for post-<?oasys _ch ?>conflict peace-building has also called for the involvement of civilian police.  This typically includes a training element and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has participated in a number of such operations and has built up a capacity in this field which is well-recognised internationally.</P><Col N="1828"/>
        <P>The touchstone for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in overseas missions continues to be the UN.  Decisions on Irish participation in ESDP missions are taken on a case-by-case basis, and are subject to the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; process.  Irish participation in ESDP operations is fully in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UN.  Against this background, the Government is fully supportive of the participation of the Defence Forces in a substantive manner in the EUFOR mission.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the conflict and the proposed operation in Chad and the Central African Republic.  The multiple conflicts in the border areas between Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic constitute a threat to peace and security in the entire region.  In Chad, following an agreement between the Government of Chad and the peaceful political opposition in August 2007, a peace deal was signed between the Government and four rebel groups in October 2007.  However, major problems continue with ongoing clashes between rebels and Government forces.  Arising from these clashes, more than 180,000 internally displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees now live in camps in eastern Chad.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Central African Republic, the already fragile situation has been exacerbated by the activities of criminal gangs, the spill-over of instability from Darfur and Chad and an armed rebellion in the north west and north east.  Approximately 170,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since September 2005.  In addition, more than 43,000 refugees from the Central African Republic reside in Chad and 20,000 people are thought to have fled to Cameroon.  Malnutrition has reached alarming levels, particularly among children.</P>
        <P>The troubled situation in Sudan&rsquo;s Darfur region, Chad and the Central African Republic demands an immediate response from the international community.  As then Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development assistance, I visited Darfur in 2004.  It is a terrible reflection on the international community that the situation there has not been resolved but I am proud that we are playing a role in regard to the refugees who come from that region.  That innocent people, who have been already uprooted from their homes to face terror, rape and murder, continue to be at risk in camps for refugees and internally displaced persons cannot be tolerated.   During my visit to Darfur, I spoke with many families who were living in fear and was told some horrendous stories about their personal circumstances.</P>
        <P>The former President, Mary Robinson, and a group of women leaders made a well-publicised visit to Chad&rsquo;s camps recently.  Her report on what she witnessed and heard from the women refugees is disturbing.  Women who had escaped horrific attacks by militiamen in Darfur now faced being targeted and raped in the refugee camps and are afraid to go out to collect food and <Col N="1829"/>firewood.  She has called for an EU force to protect refugee camps and highlighted the need for security because the refugees and displaced persons, and women in particular, are not safe in the camps.</P>
        <P>The authorities of Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence in their respective countries.  This was reiterated during the visit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to Chad on 15 and 16 November, when he received the assurances of the Chadian Prime Minister.  The signing of the peace deal in Chad in October 2007, albeit under some strain at present, can still provide an opportunity for greater stability in the region and, with the deployment of the UN mission, an improved environment for assisting and protecting refugees and supporting the distribution of humanitarian aid.  The EU mission to Chad will complement the planned UN-African Union hybrid mission being launched by the UN in Darfur by limiting the spill-over potential from the conflict in Sudan.</P>
        <P>On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multidimensional UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  The multidimensional presence will comprise a United Nations Mission in Chad and the Central African Republic, to be known as MINURCAT, which will focus on the security and protection of refugees, internally displaced persons, IDPs, and civilians in danger, and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic; and troops deployed by the European Union with a robust authorisation to protect and support it.  In its decision of 15 October 2007, the Council of the European Union agreed a Joint Action to launch the ESDP mission in support of the UN operation in Chad and the Central African Republic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">UN Security Council Resolution 1778 authorises the European Union, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, to deploy for a period of one year from the date of its initial operating capability is declared by the European Union in consultation with the Secretary General.  The EU forces will be deployed to eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic.  The EU forces are authorised to support the UN and to take all necessary measures within its capabilities and its area of operation to contribute to protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons; to improve security in the area of operations to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel; and to contribute to protecting United Nations and associated personnel, facilities, installations and equipment.</P>
        <P>The EU is planning to launch this operation as a matter of urgency.  The intention is to have an initial operational capability on the ground in December with the operation fully functional by <Col N="1830"/>the end of March 2008.  Planning to this end is ongoing.  At this point in time, contributions of troops from EU member states are in line with the mission requirements.  However there are significant deficiencies in key enabling elements, such as medical facilities, medevac and helicopter and fixed wing tactical lift aircraft.  This is not unusual at this stage in the planning process because medical and air assets are always at a premium.  However, the operational commander has been absolutely clear that in the absence of these elements it will not be possible to launch the operation.  The Minister for Defence has called on his European ministerial colleagues to step up to the plate and provide the required assets so as to allow this important mission to proceed speedily.  I assure Senators there is no question of the Defence Forces deploying in theatre without the required enablers being in place.</P>
        <P>Ireland from the outset has been positively disposed towards the proposed mission.  In its decisions of 2 October and 23 October 2007, the Government deployed the then Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Pat Nash, as operation commander of the EU force and up to 11 additional personnel to the headquarters of the operation.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved the deployment of Major General Nash and his personal support staff on 9 October 2007.  The role of the operation commander is to manage the overall military operation and provide the military interface between the military operation and MINURCAT, the EU and the UN.  The post of operation commander is the highest profile post Ireland will have undertaken in an EU operation to date.  In mid-October, Major General Nash assumed immediate leadership in the planning and launch of the operation.</P>
        <P>The likely location for the deployment of the substantive Irish contingent will be the Goz Beida region of eastern Chad.  The role of the contingent will be contributing to the establishment of a safe and secure environment in order to protect civilians in danger, facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, the free movement of humanitarian personnel, protecting UN and associated personnel and encouraging the return of IDPs.  The Irish contingent will be based on a mechanised infantry battalion group comprising manoeuvre elements and combat support and combat service support elements.  The contingent will comprise some 400 personnel.  Due to the nature of the operation and the mission area and environment, force protection will be a key consideration.  The final configuration of Ireland&rsquo;s contingent contribution to the mission is being further worked out in consultation with the EU military staff and the operation commander.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces initial entry force will comprise an advance party of approximately 50 personnel of the Army ranger wing and support elements, which will provide reconnaissance and force protection for engineers in the selection and <Col N="1831"/>establishment of the Irish camp.  These personnel will be deployed in December 2007 and the main contingent, which is currently undergoing selection and concentration prior to detailed mission specific training, is likely to deploy in February or March 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A full assessment of the Chad-Central African Republic operation was undertaken, including a comprehensive and detailed reconnaissance of the area of operations by an experienced Defence Forces team prior to the final decision being made.  The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has advised that the threat level in the area of operations is assessed as medium risk.  Rebel and bandit groups using four by four pick-up vehicles and hit and run tactics constitute the main threat EUFOR may have to face.  These groups operate opportunistically, concentrating and dissipating quickly to engage weaker targets including aid workers, the local population and weaker military elements, but they lack the potential for any prolonged engagement.  They operate mainly along the border between Chad and Sudan.  French forces based in Chad have indicated they have had no engagement to date with any of these groups, possibly due to the fact that the groups do not have the potential to engage well trained and equipped military elements.  The military authorities assure me that, while the level of risk is consistent with any operational deployment into a conflict zone in Africa, it is one which the Defence Forces has the capability to manage.</P>
        <P>The decision to send troops overseas is not taken lightly.  I assure the House that our ability to protect the health and safety of personnel is of paramount concern when considering any mission.  Once a decision to deploy is made and the nature and manner of that deployment is finalised, all operational decisions regarding deployment, force protection assets, medical facilities, etc., are a matter for the military authorities.  The final decision on the deployment to the EU mission was not taken until the Defence Forces conducted their own detailed threat assessment in the area of operations and the Minister for Defence had received the report from the Chief of Staff.</P>
        <P>While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is the policy and practice to ensure Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission.  The Defence Forces will deploy MOWAG APCs and close reconnaissance vehicles, which will provide armoured protection, mobility, firepower and a communications platform.  The MOWAG APCs being deployed were also deployed with the Defence Forces when they served with UNMIL in Liberia and UNIFIL in Lebanon where they performed very effectively.  In addition, the existing French presence in Chad is capable of rapid expansion if necessary to support the EU force.</P><Col N="1832"/>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces for service with the UN mandated operation in the Republic of Chad and Central African Republic.  I will now address one of the issues raised during this debate which relates to the recent breakdown in the ceasefire in Chad.  Obviously, in the context of the ceasefire negotiated only last month, the latest outbreak of hostilities is disappointing.  It is my understanding from my reading of the reports that the rebels are impatient with the Chadian Government&rsquo;s progress in implementing the terms of the ceasefire while, at the same time, the Government of Chad is wrestling with the challenge of working out how to give effect to the terms of the ceasefire, include the rebels in the structures of Government and integrate rebel forces into the army.  While these tensions are understandable, they do not excuse the extent of the violence which I have seen reported.</P>
        <P>Breakdowns in ceasefires are not unusual in these types of conflicts and the House will recall that in the context of the ceasefires in Northern Ireland we have also experienced many false dawns.  Obviously in the case of Chad the level of violence, if the reports are to be believed, is more extensive.  This is the reason we are deploying professional troops with extensive force protection assets, significantly beyond that which is available to the rebels.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have faced similar circumstances in Liberia where rebels, faced with overwhelming firepower and professional forces, have faded into the background.  We are hopeful a similar situation will apply in Chad.  I call on all parties to the conflict, Government and rebels, to have patience, respect the ceasefire and, in the case of surrounding countries, not to exacerbate the situation or become involved in the conflict.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that we will provide the Defence Forces contingent with whatever is necessary to enable our forces to discharge their mandate safely.  The Defence Forces military command continually evaluates the situation in theatre to ensure contingents have the requisite firepower and protection on an ongoing basis to undertake their mission.  The planned deployment to Chad will not be different.</P>
        <P>The conflict in Chad is one of the many, often forgotten conflicts in Africa which demands a response from the international community.  Irish and international humanitarian aid workers daily risk their lives working in extremely difficult conditions to relieve the oppression of helpless citizens, women and children, who are continuously at risk.  We, Ireland and the European Union, can make a real and substantive contribution.  If anything, the increase in hostilities points to the need for the international community, in particular the European Union, to raise its game and ensure this mission is a success.  If European Security and Defence Policy means anything to our partners in the European Union, now is the time to make it <Col N="1833"/>mean something.  Despite being one of the smallest member states, with less than 1% of the European Union&rsquo;s population, Ireland is providing more than 10% of the planned EU force.  It is now up to other member states to meet their commitments if we are serious about European Security and Defence Policy and the EU being a global player on the international stage in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have a strong tradition of participation in missions of this nature and Ireland has a special commitment to Africa, evidenced by, among other things, our bilateral aid programme.  Having regard to the importance of this mission to peace and stability in the region and Ireland&rsquo;s abiding interest in Africa and its development, the Government is satisfied that we should participate in the mission.  Ireland is determined to play a meaningful and constructive role in the mission, as the expected second largest contributor and provider of the operation commander.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the launch of the operation depends on the response of the European Union as a whole.  In this regard, it is vital that those member states with access to medical and air assets, in particular the larger member states, come forward in support of this mission.  Planning is continuing in earnest and I look forward to a successful launch of the mission in December.  Senators will join me in wishing our troops a successful and safe mission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and extend best wishes to the Minister for Defence on his work on the mission to Chad.  The Fine Gael Party supports the deployment of 400 troops to Chad with some reservations.  I congratulate Major General Pat Nash and wish him, the initial group of 50 rangers and the 400 strong force the best of luck on their deployment.  </P>
        <P>While I have never been to central Africa, I visited South Africa in 1994 for the first democratic election, which was an amazing event.  We have not given sufficient credit to the former President of South Africa, Mr. F. W. de Klerk, for the wonderful work he did in helping to create peace in South Africa.  It is wonderful that South Africa has remained peaceful through changes in government since 1994.</P>
        <P>In light of the centuries of conflict in Ireland, specifically the conflict in Northern Ireland in recent decades, we are in a strong position to send troops on peacekeeping missions.  We have also learned the value of peace since the ending of the conflict in recent times.  We also have individuals of a high calibre, including Major General Pat Nash, who are available to take control of peacekeeping missions.</P>
        <P>I compliment those members of the Defence Forces who have signed up to participate in the mission to Chad.  It is extremely brave to put one&rsquo;s life on the line for peace, not knowing <Col N="1834"/>whether one will return.  The operation is planned to last for 12 months.  Is it possible it will be extended, given the potential of the conflict in Chad to destabilise central Africa in general?</P>
        <P>As was noted in the D&aacute;il yesterday and in the national media, Chad, the fifth largest state in Africa, is larger than any European Union country and three times bigger than California.  I am not sure whether more recent statistics are available but according to figures from 1993, life expectancy in Chad is only 47 years and 47% of the people are under the age of 15 years.  In terms of religious composition, 54% of the population is Muslim, 20% Catholic, 14% Protestant and 3% atheist.  Does religion play a role in the conflict, as was the case here?</P>
        <P>There is widespread concern about the safety of the Irish troops who will take part in the mission to Chad.  Initially, 50 rangers will travel to the country on a dangerous mission to prepare the ground, establish camps and so forth.  The Minister of State does not believe this group will face dangers, whereas I am certain they will be in danger.  I understand only three helicopters are available for the mission, which requires approximately 20 helicopters.</P>
        <P>Have any ladies signed up for the mission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>They are women soldiers.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister for Defence made a concerted effort to recruit women to the Defence Forces, which proved difficult.  There are significant difficulties for women who join and I wonder whether they are treated in the same fashion as men.  I know, for example, that footballers working in the Defence Forces are very well treated with regard to time off etc., but I do not know if the same is true for women who play county or club football.  This matter was brought to my attention some time ago and I urge the Minister to look into it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Are any members of the Reserve Defence Force going on this mission or does it include only members of the Permanent Defence Force?  There has been speculation in the media with regard to problems getting water and facilities to the mission.  What problems are envisaged in that regard?  What will happen if there is a civil war?  The Minister of State said in his speech the risk to the Defence Forces undertaking the mission would be minimal.  If there is a civil war, the risk will not be minimal.  Have we the necessary aircraft capability to move our Defence Forces out if required?</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister of State mentioned what our former President, Mary Robinson, had to say about her visit to Chad.  It was disturbing to watch her on television, as she was emotionally affected by what she saw.  I am sure our Defence Forces will be prepared for similar experiences when they go to Chad.  They need to be well pre<Col N="1835"/>pared as they will come across innocent people being murdered and find that people uprooted from their homes who have been terrorised or raped continue to be at risk in refugee camps where there is lack of tolerance for internally displaced persons.  Mary Robinson reported that what she heard from women refugees was most disturbing.  Women who had escaped horrific attacks in Darfur, were now facing being targeted and raped in refugee camps.  They were afraid to go out to collect food and firewood.  I am sure our Defence Forces will be well equipped and trained to deal with these matters as well as all the other issues with which they will have to deal.</P>
        <P>While we support this worthwhile, necessary and humanitarian mission, it is risky.  Full protection must remain in place for the duration of the mission for all the troops.  It is the most dangerous mission ever undertaken by the Irish Army and, therefore, requires proper protection, facilities and back-up to be put in place.  If these are put in place, the risk will be minimised.  We fully support the mission and wish the best of luck to Major General Pat Nash and the initial 50 rangers going to Chad.  They will have the dangerous job of doing the groundwork for the other 400 going out.  On the medical side, I am sure there will be full medical back-up for the troops and I wish them too the best of luck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I  welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House and congratulate him on his re-election to the D&aacute;il.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the EU military operation in Chad, our most expensive mission to date.  The operation, requested by the UN, is being led by an Irishman, Major General Pat Nash, as operations commander of the EU force.  His deployment and that of his entire support staff was ratified by the triple lock, whereby Irish Defence Forces planning an overseas mission must receive authorisation from three factions: the UN, the Government and the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Chad has had an unstable history characterised by decades of civil war.  It is governed by a regime which is democratic in name but in practice does not resemble in any way democracy as we understand it.  The relationship between Chad, as a former French colony, and its one-time European rulers continues to be fraught, with France having somewhat of an ambiguous status both in Chad and elsewhere in north and central Africa.  Its presence is often regarded as a kind of double-edged sword.  It is condemned for continuing imperial interference and praised as a facilitator of sustained stability through financial investment and military support.</P>
        <P>As we are already aware, Ireland is the second largest provider of troops on this mission, second only to the French, who will comprise almost half of the total force.  The role of the Irish Army in <Col N="1836"/>Chad is multifaceted.  One such facet, owing to the history outlined above, is to distract somewhat from the size of the French contingent, helping to create and enforce the vital perception of the mission as comprising troops from a host of European countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s presence is of particular importance in this regard because of the similarities that exist between our history and that of Chad and because of our historic and widely renowned neutrality, which has served our reputation well on an international scale.  As Major General Pat Nash commented, &ldquo;Ireland is seen as an honest broker in international relations.&rdquo;  Therefore, it is seen as a diplomatic asset on a mission of this nature.</P>
        <P>While Chad has shaken off its colonial status, its tendency for conflict has not ceased.  The multiple conflicts and ongoing clashes in the border areas of Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic have resulted in more than 180,000 internally displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees.  This turbulent situation has been further compounded by the devastating effects resulting from natural disasters, which has prompted the UN and our former President, Mary Robinson, to request the support of a combined EU force to offer protection and security to the displaced and the refugees being accommodated in camps in the eastern part of the country and aid workers representing all corners of the world, including Ireland, who are working hard in the camps.</P>
        <P>Chad is a remote and massive landlocked country 20 times the size of Ireland and the approximate combined size of France, Spain, and Germany.  The main area of activity is in the eastern part of the country, similar in size to France.  Infrastructure is sparse and the nearest port is 2,000 kilometres away, with few if any roads.  The existing roads are dusty dirt roads over very rough terrain.  As a result, all vital enabling elements, from people to helicopters and tents to tanks, must be flown in by air.  This is a costly exercise, coupled with the fact that all equipment used will suffer massive degradation owing to the harshness of the environment.  This fact was stressed by Colonel Brian O&rsquo;Keeffe at the RACO conference this week.  It will take approximately 40 plane loads of equipment to transport the required equipment to Chad, not to mention another 40 plane loads for the return.  The troops themselves will only need two flights each way.  The cost of transport will total between approximately &euro;1 million and &euro;4 million.</P>
        <P>All told, costs are expected to reach a ballpark figure of &euro;57 million to &euro;60 million, the most expensive operation on which the Irish Defence Forces have ever been deployed.  Unlike the usual blue hat operation, with which we are all familiar and where the substantial costs are met by the UN, in the case of an EU mission, albeit one mandated by the UN, the costs are met by the contributing member states.</P><Col N="1837"/>
        <P Just="Left">As I mentioned already the Irish troops are travelling to Chad to protect civilians in danger, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and the free movement of humanitarian personnel.  It goes without saying that the troops will meet with a hostile environment in every sense of the word.  The Chief of Staff has advised that the threat level is of medium risk, with the main threat being posed by the rebel or bandit groups.  I note there has been some media concern about the safety of the Irish troops while on Chadian soil.  The French forces already based in Chad have assured us that they have had no engagement with any of these groups to date, and have added that the level of risk being posed is in no way different from any other conflict zone in Africa.  The Irish troops, therefore, are more than capable and equipped to manage any threat to their safety and that of the vulnerable, whose protection is their primary reason for their presence in Chad.  As Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Earley advised, his personnel are &ldquo;in the business of taking risks&rdquo;.  There is no such thing as a safe mission, these Irish soldiers are professionals who have trained long and hard, and were trained by experts in order that they are able and ready for such a mission.</P>
        <P>The high level of cost and that level of danger must not be our main focus.  We must recognise that while these factors are of massive importance, they are outweighed by the contribution the mission can make to peace and security in the region.  The decision to participate on the mission is in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and our commitment to the maintenance of international order and security through the efforts of and participation in peacekeeping activity, supporting the UN and the EU regardless of cost.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that the bulk of the troops are expected to be deployed early next year, and their departure will mark the 50th Anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s participation on UN missions, when personnel from the Irish Defence Forces form part of an observer group in the Lebanon, and I hope it continues for many years to come.</P>
        <P>I wish the troops and the mission well in Chad and I have no doubt the mission will be very successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party supports the deployment of 400 troops as part of the UN mandated military operation in the Republic of Chad.  The triple lock mechanism of approval by the UN, the Government and the D&aacute;il has been completed and this satisfies the approval requirements before Defence Forces can be deployed overseas.  </P>
        <P>Ireland is the second largest contributor of troops and provides the overall operation&rsquo;s commander, Major General Pat Nash.  I am sure he is very proud to be the operation&rsquo;s commander and so should his family.  We wish him well.  France is the largest contributor and will supply more than <Col N="1838"/>half the 4,300 troops required.  That in itself has the potential to be a problem given that France was the former colonial power in that country and is a supporter of the Government there.  Anti-Government feeling could manifest itself in anti-French feeling but hopefully that will not arise.</P>
        <P>We are confident that our troops will be well prepared.  The additional specific training referred to in the D&aacute;il yesterday will make a major contribution to this difficult situation.  We wish the troops well in their mission and pray that there will be no fatalities.  This is very important and is always a major risk in such missions.  The medical back-up and hardware must be available and must be adequate for the task.</P>
        <P>The stated objectives of the mission, to which the Minister of State referred in his contribution, are to help establish a safe and secure environment for refugees, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the refugees and to protect the UN and humanitarian personnel.  It is against that background and that of the humanitarian crisis in the country and the region and the worthy objectives of the mission that the Labour Party supports it.  However, we do so not without concerns, some of which have been referred to by previous contributors.</P>
        <P>This difficult and demanding mission is the Irish army&rsquo;s most challenging mission to date.  It will also be the most expensive, costing in the region of &euro;57 million.  Chad, as we are aware, is landlocked and is approximately 2,000 km from the nearest port.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his return from the region, described the environment as being one of the harshest in the world.  He also stated that there are no roads to speak of and that travel can be dangerous.  The threat level has been described as medium risk.  However, only this week there were reports of hundreds being killed and fighting in eastern Chad.  As the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il yesterday and as the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, stated here this morning, this is the likely location for the deployment of Irish troops.  What does medium risk mean?</P>
        <P>One issue to arise concerns the potential for our troops to be drawn into Government rebel conflict there.  I have already touched on one aspect of that in the French context.  There is also the matter of the increasing level of banditry and vulnerable targets and the risk from break-away rebel factions seeking arms, ammunition and vehicles is on the increase.  I accept the view of the Minister of State that they are unlikely to take on a well-armed international force and, hopefully, this will be the case.</P>
        <P>The safety and welfare of our troops has got to be our major concern.  There are reports of emerging gaps in transport resources in the area of heavy airlift and helicopter assets.  Apparently, there are only three helicopters available where it is estimated that 20 will be required to support this mission.</P><Col N="1839"/>
        <P>In my view Ireland should not provide the troops unless the estimated resources required are provided.  I am happy to read in today&rsquo;s newspapers that there will be delays because of the shortages of equipment and specialist troops.  These are not delays in themselves but the troops will not be committed unless the supports and resources are available.  That is welcome.  This mission must be properly equipped.  It is up to the bigger member states, as the Minister has said, to come up with the goods and support this mission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Party is proud that the Permanent Defence Forces are going to take part in this mission.  It will bring great credit to its members, to the Defence Forces generally and the country as a whole.  However, those involved must be given the tools to do the job and they must have adequate transport arrangements.  We wish our troops safety, health and success in their mission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am unique in that I have a special relationship with the Defence Forces as I get their nomination to contest the Seanad election.  I meet the men and women of RACO  and PDFORRA several times a year and I know at first hand what brave men and women they are.  That is part of the reason I am here this morning.</P>
        <P>As other Senators have pointed out, this is one of the biggest operations in which Ireland has ever got involved.  It is also one of the most expensive, costing a total of &euro;57 million, which is a great deal of money out of the budget of the Minister for Defence.  It is being done for all the best reasons, mainly, humanitarian.  In addition to sending 400 soldiers, we and our Defence Forces are honoured through the appointment of Major General Pat Nash as overall commander of the entire force.  I wondered last night if Major General Nash was the first Irish commander but I was told this morning that in the 1960s an Irish man filled the same shoes in the Congo.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has said it is an onerous and dangerous mission.  Like the rest of us he has complete confidence in the professionalism and ability of our Defence Forces to carry out a mission such as this.  I concur with Senator Burke who said it is the most dangerous mission ever undertaken and we should be concerned.  I spoke with the general secretary of RACO, Brian O&rsquo;Keeffe, this morning and he assured me that we can have complete confidence in our military experts who said, &ldquo;we can do this mission and we can do it well&rdquo;.  Let us get on with it.  I look forward to hearing more about the mission when our troops go in the new year.</P>
        <P>As the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, stated, this is the most ambitious and challenging overseas development to date.  The mission of the Irish troops is threefold: first, to establish a safe and <Col N="1840"/>secure environment for refugees; second, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid for the refugees; and, third, to protect UN and other NGO personnel.</P>
        <P>It has been pointed out by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and other speakers that 180,000 Chadian and 236,000 Sudanese refugees are living in camps in eastern Chad, which gives an idea of the mayhem the country is experiencing.  Some 170,000 people have been forced to leave their homes since September 2005.  Malnutrition is reaching alarming levels, particularly among young children.</P>
        <P>I often think it must be the saddest thing for any adult to see a young child starving.  I remember the first, frightening pictures coming into our homes from Biafra more than 30 years ago.  When I went to primary school in Tullamore, every Friday we brought in a penny for the black babies.  This may no longer be politically correct but it was certainly correct at that time.  The Irish people go back that far and further in terms of our aid to more deprived areas of the world.</P>
        <P>I was touched when the Minister of State referred to Mrs. Mary Robinson&rsquo;s role and her meeting with displaced persons and refugees.  Two or three years ago a lovely young woman from the Congo with two children contacted me.  She told me terrible stories of her being raped, their entire family being murdered and her daughters being tortured.  She was in a refugee camp but there were times when she was not safe there.  I am glad she has now been given refugee status in Ireland.  I am proud of our country and of the Government for giving people like Jan a safe haven and a new start in life.  Her two little daughters are five and seven and look forward to a bright Christmas this year as she just received refugee status in the past month.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have pointed out that Chad is the size of France, Spain and most of Germany combined &mdash; we seem to be working from the same script.  The main area where our troops will be centred is eastern Chad, which is the size of France.  A small country such as Ireland understands how massive such an area is.  The country is landlocked, with rough terrain and difficult infrastructure.  There are few roads, if any, and, as Senator Kieran Phelan noted, as it will be difficult to get machines, armoured cars and the like into the region, much of this will have to be done by air.</P>
        <P>Liberia was a smaller, more tightly scaled mission.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Defence Forces on a very successful mission in Liberia, which has only recently finished.  I take my hat off to them.  They carried out their duties in a professional way, as we have come to expect from them.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the 50-strong Army Ranger team who are going out to set up the mission are exceptionally well-trained men and women and will be well able to prepare the ground.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, a man whose <Col N="1841"/>name escapes me described how the rebels attack.  He concluded that with the strength of the army force in place to protect the refugees, the rebels will back away because they are not equipped to deal with the force they will come up against.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, made a wonderful presentation which has given us much food for thought.  He stated, &ldquo;Despite being one of the smallest member states, with less than 1% of the European Union&rsquo;s population, Ireland is providing more than 10% of the planned EU force.&rdquo;  We can be very proud of this.   As Senator Burke noted, we know peace comes at a high price, but we in this small island also know the value of peace.  I am proud we are sending in our troops.</P>
        <P>At the recent RACO conference in Kilkenny, Colonel Brian O&rsquo;Keeffe called for additional funding to be made available for equipment such as armoured personnel carriers.  Through this mission, we know how important equipment is for our forces.</P>
        <P>Like other speakers, I wish our men and women well on this mission.  Living in Sligo, just 20 miles from Finner Camp in Bundoran, I know what it is like for the families of the brave men and women we are proud to send to Chad.  The families will miss them.  It is a difficult time and a dangerous mission.  They are in our thoughts and our prayers.  We look forward to wishing them <i>bon voyage</i> in the new year.  We wish them well.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1842"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to these statements.  As one from an Army family and as a former Fine Gael spokesperson on Defence, I very much value and appreciate the role which our armed forces have played on the international stage.  It was a great honour when I led the first all-party visit to our troops in Lebanon some years ago and saw first-hand the invaluable work they were doing there, and the contribution they made to peacekeeping in the area and to supporting civilians and ensuring their lives were somewhat less hazardous than they would otherwise have been.</P>
        <P>I noted a number of the points made by the Minister of State in his comprehensive speech.  He referred to the visit made by the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, scenes from which many of us will have seen on television.  She was horrified at the experiences of the displaced refugees.  It is extraordinary to consider the numbers involved.  As a result of the clashes, as Senator Feeney stated, 180,000 Chadians are internally displaced and 236,000 Sudanese refugees are living in camps.</P>
        <P>The tragedy of conflict and war is that when people are moved to camps, far from receiving enhanced security, the camps themselves can often become places of danger, potential assault and rape, which appears to be the problem in this case.  There is poor security in the camps and I hope the Defence Forces, when they arrive, will be able to enhance the security of the camps and make them a place of safety rather than a place of further threat.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Army is pleased to be part of this international peacekeeping and peace-enforcing force.  Obviously, there are concerns, in particular with regard to safety issues, equipment, water safety and whether the tents supplied are adequate.  The Minister of State noted that key enabling elements, such as medical facilities, medevac and helicopter and fixed wing tactical lift aircraft, are not in place.  He has given a guarantee that if these are not in place we will not be part of the mission until that is done.  That is a real problem, although I note the Minister of State said it was part of the normal planning process and that at this stage it is not unusual.  Perhaps the Minister of State will discuss what measures are being taken by the Government to ensure that these facilities will be in place, as well as providing an update from his European colleagues who have been approached by the Government to provide somewhat more than they are currently providing.  In that way the Army will have the necessary facilities.</P>
        <P>This is clearly a dangerous mission.  The Army has been in Liberia and other dangerous locations.  It is professional, well equipped and able to conduct such missions efficiently.  However, this is a medium-risk mission and therefore more dangerous than other ones in which the army has previously been involved. <Col N="1843"/> Even though Europe is taking an increasing role in peacekeeping, we should be proud that Ireland wants to take part in this mission in Africa.  It complements our foreign policy, including the kind of work undertaken not just by the Government but also voluntary work by individual Irish citizens in Africa.  This military mission will complement the kind of contribution that Irish citizens and Government agencies can make to Africa&rsquo;s development.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to revert to two points I raised, namely, the logistical difficulties of the mission and European support for it.  Given that the armies of many European countries are currently involved in Afghanistan and Kosovo they are not making a contribution to the Chad mission, but the needs are enormous.  The figures for displaced persons are horrifying, as is the scale of the overall problem.  I also ask the Minister of State to note the concerns raised by Senator Paddy Burke and myself about the logistical issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for sharing her time.  I listened with interest to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and I thank him for attending the House to address this important issue.  I do not wish to repeat the important points other speakers have made, but I have the greatest confidence in the members of our Defence Forces who are highly trained and motivated.  If given the necessary training and personal equipment, including transport, air support and medical backup, our troops will succeed in their mission to Chad.  Yesterday, I noted the concerns of Colonel Brian O&rsquo;Keeffe about the reduced number of doctors in the Army medical corps.  Of a total of 18 doctors, six will be deployed to Chad.  This lack of initiative in recruitment is disturbing and does not inspire confidence in the Chad mission.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the 400 Irish troops to be deployed from the fourth western brigade are from my area and I know many of them personally.  In addition, my grandfather was a member of the Defence Forces.  I have the utmost confidence in their ability to undertake this mission.  The troops of the fourth western brigade have proved their competency and humanity since first being deployed to Liberia in 2004.  I am proud of them, support them and wish them well in this dangerous endeavour.  I urge the Minister of State to provide the necessary resources to ensure their safety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Ormonde.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am glad of the opportunity to discuss this EU mission to Chad. <Col N="1844"/> The mission has a UN mandate and is being conducted within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy.  UN Security Council resolution 1778, which established the mission, gives it a robust peace-enforcement mandate.  We are a small country with a proud tradition of peace-keeping but given the expansion of the Petersberg Tasks under the forthcoming reform treaty and the mandate for peace-enforcement missions, we must accept that Irish troops will be participating in increasingly dangerous missions.  It is important that both Houses of the Oireachtas should monitor these missions closely and be aware of what is involved.  The public must also be kept informed of the often perilous missions in which the Defence Forces are involved.</P>
        <P>The situation in Chad is both difficult and unsatisfactory.  Other Senators have mentioned the number of refugees and displaced persons, which is put at over 400,000.  In October, a peace deal was signed between the Government and four of the rebel groups but it has already broken down.  There have been a number of gun battles between Government and rebel forces in which hundreds of rebels were reportedly killed.  The operation&rsquo;s Irish commander, Major General Patrick Nash, has said that the troops under his command will be strictly neutral in terms of ongoing conflicts in the region.  Nonetheless, is the Minister of State concerned by the fact that half the EU troops in the mission will be French?  France is a former colonial power and French military contingents have been based in Chad and the Central African Republic over the past two years as part of bilateral treaties.  They have been helping Government forces to beat back rebel offensives during that period, so will that pose a difficulty for Major General Nash in maintaining the mission&rsquo;s neutral identity?</P>
        <P>In common with other Senators, I am concerned about the apparent gaps and logistical problems, particularly with regard to transport resources.  As has been said, there appears to be a shortage of heavy airlift and helicopter facilities, which will be essential in eastern Chad where Irish troops will be operating.  The region&rsquo;s road infrastructure is extremely poor and therefore helicopters will be essential to support troop movements.  There are also serious deficiencies in medical support and perhaps the Minister of State could comment on that matter in his reply.</P>
        <P>The intention is that Irish troops will be deployed from December onwards and will form part of what is known as an initial entry force to facilitate the arrival of follow-on troops.  However, is the Minister of State concerned that the location chosen as a base camp for Irish troops will be in the environs of Abesh, which is the main town in eastern Chad?  Last month, members of the French charity Zoe&rsquo;s Ark were caught there attempting illegally to transport 103 African children to Europe.  That incident caused much concern and resistance locally.  I wonder if there will be any fall-out for Irish troops in having <Col N="1845"/>their base camp there, as feelings were running high over the attempted transportation of those children.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><P>We have great confidence in the Defence Forces and wish them all the best in this dangerous mission to Chad.  I look forward to debating the issue again at a subsequent date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have not had the opportunity to do so in this session.  I have a great interest in non-governmental organisations, as well as overseas aid and development.  I will always be ready to reach out to help those in Third World countries when I see an opportunity to do so.  It has always been a part of my life.  In my other profession I did likewise and will continue to do so in this House.  The decision to participate in the Chad mission is a courageous one and I congratulate the Government on taking it.  I also congratulate the Minister for Defence for allowing 400 soldiers to take part in this military operation in the Republic of Chad.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, outlined the background to this mission and many speakers outlined their views on it.  I will not repeat what has been said because we are all singing the same tune in terms of the problems that exist.  I congratulate Major General Pat Nash on taking the lead in the planning and launching of this operation and wish him well.  As we all know this is a dangerous mission.  We have all read about the atrocities that have occurred there.  We hear reports on Sky News and other television programmes of displaced people, many of whom have been terrorised, raped and murdered.  People have been forced to leave their homes, their villages have been burned, wells have been poisoned, their livestock killed and the list of atrocities continues.  Such atrocities are frightening.  Ireland has been to the forefront and has a strong tradition since the beginning of our history of doing what we can to help those who are so displaced.  I congratulate the Irish troops participating in this mission, knowing that it is such a dangerous one.</P>
        <P>The EU has taken on capacity in regard to peacebuilding and peacekeeping in this area.  What are the relations between the EU and United Nations and is there sufficient joined-up thinking in that regard?  Our troops are ready to leave, but they do not have the helicopters they need and the necessary field hospitals are not in place.  There seems to be a lack of those material aspects that would make life a little less dangerous for those troops who have sacrificed their lifestyles to bravely take on this dangerous mission.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said there are significant deficiencies in enabling elements of EU planning and preparations.  I would like him to address that aspect.  In the absence of these elements, it will not be possible to launch the operation, as rightly made clear by the operation commander.  If that is the case, will the Minister of State indicate the timespan involved?  When will the Minister for Defence deal with these issues in the EU and will he do so before or after Christmas?  While I am <Col N="1846"/>aware the 51st contingent is going out to prepare and launch this mission, I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on the seriousness of this mission and the scale of these deficiencies.  That is my main concern.</P>
        <P>I wish those participating in the mission well.  I hope it will be successful.  When our troops participate in overseas peacekeeping missions and assist in the provision of humanitarian aid, they invariably have success stories.  I wish them every success in getting the next stage of development off the ground.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Bradford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Like Senators Feeney and Leyden, my nominating body for the Seanad is the ICPSA on which RACO and PDFORRA are represented.  </P>
        <P>There is no doubt the professionalism of Irish troops in peacekeeping operations has been acknowledged worldwide.  It is a wonderful honour for the country that Major General Pat Nash has been given overall command of this mission to Chad.  I am sure we would all join in the congratulations being extended to him.</P>
        <P>I would like to address three points.  Senator Ormonde spoke of deficiencies that exist.  Such deficiencies must be addressed before our troops are asked to take on this most serious and probably one of the most challenging missions Irish troops have been asked to undertake since the Congo conflict.  One area of concern is the supply of aircraft.  We were told that up 20 aircraft, including helicopter supply craft, would be necessary to adequately supply our troops.  Are those aircraft now in place?  Have other European countries lived up to their obligations in providing such aircraft?  Without it the operation cannot proceed.</P>
        <P>The distribution and supply of water to our troops in a country like Chad is of paramount importance.  The logistics of providing such a simple amenity as water is a significant problem.  Without adequate aircraft it cannot be provided.  Temperatures of up to 45&deg; C can be experienced at times in that country and with such temperatures people are susceptible to dehydration and risk of other diseases.  It is important that an adequate water supply is provided for our troops.  In referring to other diseases, it is also important that adequate medical supplies and medical personnel are provided.</P>
        <P>The conflict in Chad has been ongoing for some time.  Our mission there is threefold, namely, to establish a safe and secure environment for the refugees, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to protect the UN humanitarian personnel.  It is a major challenge but one our troops are up to.  I spoke to a number of people the other night at the RACO conference and they are looking forward to the mission.  They are well equipped.  They are concerned <Col N="1847"/>about a number of the deficiencies mentioned by Senator Ormonde, but with the proper supplies and equipment I am confident our troops and Defence Forces will do us proud, as they have done in every mission they have undertaken.</P>
        <P>A member of personnel from another country who was on peacekeeping duties spoke to me recently of the regard people have for Irish troops and the rapport Irish troops build up with local communities.  He mentioned one incident where people were throwing stones and one group of troops broke down the door and went gung-ho after the people.  He said when a similar incident occurred where Irish troops were based, our troops, who had built up a rapport with the people, knocked on the door and asked &ldquo;What the hell is going on?&rdquo; and got a much better response.  It is an example of Irish people acting in an Irish manner and doing their duties in a proper manner.  I join everybody in wishing our troops well in their onerous task.  I am sure they will do our country proud, as they have done previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and wishing the Irish troops well on this important peacekeeping mission.  As part of the triple lock mechanism, the Oireachtas is consulted and must approve such missions.  We have had this type of debate on a number of occasions.  When our troops return home from this mission &mdash; hopefully, it will be a successful one &mdash; it might be appropriate to ensure a mechanism whereby the Minister would report to the House is put in place to enable us to assess the success of the mission, highlight problems which may have emerged and plan for improvements in future missions.  I do not believe it is a tradition that we reflect on missions in the aftermath of them.  Perhaps for future reference it would be useful for the Minister to report back to the House on this to enable us to learn lessons for the future.</P>
        <P>I concur with all that has been said about the issues of concern in regard to this mission, given the dangerous territory on which the Irish troops will operate.  The background to this mission is the deteriorating situation in Sudan and Darfur and the total lack of an appropriate UN intervention in Darfur.</P>
        <P>When we discuss the issue of foreign affairs in this House or elsewhere, be it in respect of Iraq, Afghanistan or another location, there is always a tendency to complain about the involvement of the United States.  However, we must question the impact of the United Nations in this regard.  It is very disappointing that it has been so ineffective in Darfur.  If it had intervened positively at an earlier date, the current circumstances would not obtain.  We must recognise that unless there is major reform of the United Nations and much greater willingness on its part to intervene when and where required, we will continue to have such problems.  It is very easy and cheap for politicians to bash the United States for its intervention in conflicts throughout the world.  That <Col N="1848"/>said, if the United Nations is to serve as an international policeman, it must examine its role and scrap its policy of standing idly by while conflicts in locations such as Darfur continue to worsen.</P>
        <P>During the term of the previous D&aacute;il, especially at meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs, a number of interviews were held with representatives of charities, particularly GOAL.  The chief executive officer of GOAL, John O&rsquo;Shea, may not get it right all the time but his view on the deteriorating circumstances in Darfur needs to taken on board more closely, not only by the Irish Government but also by the European Union and the international community.  If there is no change in this regard, we will continue to have debates such as this since we will again be required to send Irish troops on peacekeeping missions.</P>
        <P>The conflict in Sudan, including Darfur, and the Central African Republic is an international tragedy and I am sure Irish troops will play a very effective role.  I concur with Senator Cummins&rsquo;s point that the troops are looking forward to the mission and doing what they are trained to do.  I have every confidence in them because they are as well trained as any army worldwide.  They are trained for peacekeeping and I am sure they will carry out their mission very effectively.  The conditions locally are serious and the mission will be one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult, ever undertaken by Irish troops.  Issues arise in respect of water supply, infrastructure and health care facilities.  The lack of helicopter support must also be taken seriously.</P>
        <P>I wish the Irish troops well.  In a sense, it is an honour for the Irish community to be adopting such an international role.  I am sure the mission will be successful and I hope that in 12 months or so, the Minister of State will return to the House to reflect on it and outline what can be learned therefrom such that we can make improvements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It is heartening to hear the contributions so far.  Like other speakers, I welcomed the decision to send Irish troops to take part in the EU force that is to support the UN operation in Chad and the Central African Republic.  As many have said, we should not lose sight of the fact that this mission, like all others of its kind, will be difficult.  The Irish troops, comprising 400 Permanent Defence Force personnel under Major General Pat Nash, will risk their lives in carrying out their duties.  I wish each of them a successful mission.</P>
        <P>The mandate of the EU force is to protect civilians and refugees, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and protect the UN personnel in carrying out their mission.  The EU force has what is referred to as robust authorisation to carry out its mission.  The need for this is clear considering the events in Darfur over the past four years.  The Sudanese Government-sponsored militia, known as the Janjaweed, have been carrying out what amounts to nothing less than genocide against the native population of Darfur.  This is simply an appalling tragedy.</P><Col N="1849"/>
        <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Bradford&rsquo;s comments to the effect that there are various forces on the world stage that are able to respond to terrorism, tragedies and other such problems using various vigorous methods and, where required, force.  This has not happened in respect of Darfur in Sudan or in any part of central Africa.  I do not know why it takes to ring the bell to awaken people.  Do we need to shout louder?  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has been on the circuit a little while.  I would be delighted if he could advise us on the avenues available to us to ensure that further and stronger efforts are made to address the issue.</P>
        <P>The use of rape as a weapon of war is very prominent in this conflict.  The culture of the region is such that it carries a particular stigma and results in dreadful humiliation for the victims and their families.  More than 3.5 million people have been displaced and have crossed the border into Chad and the Central African Republic.  The Janjaweed militia has been known to strike across the border against those who are already destitute and starving as a result of the conflict.  The malicious regime of terror is to ensure the displaced refugees never return home.  The militia will now target all UN personnel and try to disrupt their mission by attacking them directly in the course of their duties.</P>
        <P>The EU force is tasked with the protection of the UN force and ensuring the refugees are fed and housed.  The humanitarian effort is being sabotaged by the local rebels and further affected by natural disasters, such as the flooding of August 2007.  The flood washed away several camps and hampered seriously the great work of the aid agencies, which were assisting tens of thousands of people.  This highlights the mammoth task involved in protecting the camps against such risks.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The 400 Irish troops comprise the second largest contribution to the EU force, and this reinforces Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an international peacekeeper.  Last week, however, the Minister for Defence expressed dissatisfaction regarding the larger EU countries which are not supporting the force to the best of their ability.  In particular, he noted the lack of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.  Such aircraft were expected to have been supplied by other member states of the European Union.  I understand there are ongoing discussions on air support for the troops on the ground.  As this House will appreciate, the logistics of the operation present significant difficulties and air support will be vital.  France and Ireland are supplying the largest number of ground troops and others are doing the best they can at this time.  It is vital that the larger member states do as they said they would and fully support a force they agree should be deployed.  I refer to all the necessary supports which have been identified and which are needed to respond appropriately to local needs.</P><Col N="1850"/>
        <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><P>Will the Minister of State outline whether it is time for the Defence Forces to have an expanded air support section, especially a helicopter wing, that would enable them to meet their own needs while serving abroad on EU and UN missions?  Such a force, while expensive, would give our Defence Forces and the State much greater options in deciding what type of mission in which to become involved.  As Ireland is a much more accepted peacekeeper, because of our known neutrality, we would be able to respond immediately to the humanitarian needs of people and nations in conflict and other troubles.  As a neutral and a caring nation, Ireland has a duty to help those less fortunate.  I am delighted to contribute to this debate.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and congratulate him on his excellent work as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, is doing a tremendous job and morale within the Defence Forces is very high.  It is a credit to the work of both Ministers.</P>
        <P>Like my colleagues, Senators Maurice Cummins and Geraldine Feeney, I am also a nominee of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations to which RACO and PDFORRA are affiliated.  We are very fortunate to be nominated by it and to be elected to the House.  It gives us a particular connection to the Defence Forces.  Senator Maurice Cummins and I met members of the Defence Forces on Tuesday evening and we got a very strong impression of their support for this mission to Chad.  They are very excited about this project.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have a tremendous track record in Kosovo, Liberia and in Cyprus.  They have created a great impression everywhere they have gone.  Lebanon was another great success story as far as our troops were concerned.</P>
        <P>Some 400 troops will be deployed in the Chad region.  It is a great honour for this country that of the 27 EU member states, Major General Patrick Nash will head the European Union protection force of 3,700 and will have the backup of 11 staff in the headquarters in Paris.  It is a great honour for this country to have such a leadership role.  It is only right in the circumstances that we should deploy 400 troops for 12 months at a cost of approximately &euro;57 million.</P>
        <P>We are also very fortunate to have Lieutenant General Dermot Earley as chief of staff of the Defence Forces.  He is from County Roscommon and we are particularly proud that he has achieved great success in the Army and has become chief of staff.  The loyalty of the troops to him is very impressive.  He will support the troops on the ground and Major General Patrick Nash in his work.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a particular role in the world because it never had colonies and was not involved in any of those conflicts.  Irish troops are accepted in every country and in every conflict.  They will play an important role in the conflict in Chad which has been going on for too long.  Some <Col N="1851"/>50 rangers have been deployed and I heard one on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning explain the mission.  They are very well equipped troops and will assess the logistics in advance of the arrival of the 400 troops who will arrive after Christmas.  They will be able to be with their families for Christmas before they embark on this dangerous mission.  It is, however, a great humanitarian mission.  We wish the troops every success and a safe return.  It will be a successful mission because all missions in which the Defence Forces have been involved dating back to our first involvement with the United Nations have been successful.</P>
        <P>I was an election monitor in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The troops who volunteered for civilian work there proved to be the most qualified and best trained in the world.  We are very proud of our Defence Forces.  They have shown great ability to deal with complex situations.  They have certain diplomatic skills which those in most other countries would not be in a position to deploy.  We are all very proud of their work and the success they have achieved.</P>
        <P>An issue which arises from time to time concerns the voluntary or local Defence Forces.  They have indicated that they would be interested in supporting our troops.  It is generally accepted that some should be given the opportunity to participate in overseas missions.  That could help our troops on the ground.  While they would not be in the same position as the Permanent Defence Forces, they have played an important role and it would be a recognition of their work in providing voluntary support to the Army if they were given the opportunity to be deployed as backup to our Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>The nearest barracks to County Roscommon is Custume Barracks in Athlone.  It plays an important role in the life of the region and we are pleased to have that type of deployment in Mullingar and Longford.  I hope that type of regionalisation of the Defence Forces will continue, particularly of the Army which plays an important role in the life of the midlands, as the Cathaoirleach knows.  They have been involved in every voluntary organisation.</P>
        <P>The work of the troops will be difficult as it is a very complex conflict.  For too long the world has stood idly by and allowed this situation to develop.  All the countries of the European Union should be involved.  I hope Germany and Italy will play an important role and that the larger countries will provide the backup as far as helicopters, fixed wing aircraft and other logistics are concerned to make this mission a success.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il unanimously approved this deployment and wished the troops well.  There may be reservations among some parties but they should be reminded that this is a peacekeeping mission authorised by the United Nations and the European Union.  It is a very big step for us as a small country.  We are showing our commitment to the world by deploying our troops in a peaceful manner.</P>
        <P>I send the troops Christmas greetings.  They will spend Christmas at home with their families <Col N="1852"/>before they embark on this mission.  We look forward to welcoming them back safe and sound following the completion of this mission.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.  Many issues have been raised and I will try to deal with as many as I can.  Senator Leyden summed it up.  This is a very important humanitarian mission and it fits with the wishes of this House and the Government that we play an active role in trying to save lives.</P>
        <P>Many Members said the role of the Army complements the work we do on the humanitarian side.  It is great to see our overseas development work expand.  Through our missionaries and NGOs, we are doing much fantastic work, especially in Africa.</P>
        <P>I mention my interest in this area because I visited Sudan twice.  Many years ago I visited southern Sudan.  Senator Callely mentioned the fact that many of these conflicts are ongoing.  It is very frustrating for us to witness these conflicts, especially in Africa, which we wish would be resolved.  On my first visit to Sudan, there was a north-south conflict on which progress obviously has been made.  The current conflict is Darfur which has been ongoing for many years.  I visited there in 2004 and I keep in touch with what is happening.</P>
        <P>What we are doing will greatly help the situation in Darfur because we will deal with people fleeing from the Janjaweed and other rebel groups in that area.  The region is dangerous but we will provide security.  There are always risks, with which I will deal, with these missions but the contribution we will make will be enormous.</P>
        <P>On Senator Callely&rsquo;s point, there are huge political problems affecting the internal situation in Sudan where there is an African Union mission which is taking a long time to put in place.  It is supported by the international community.  That has caused problems.  There was resistance to outside parties becoming involved so, in many of these instances, politics has held up conflict resolution.  It is a terrible situation but we as a small nation are doing our best in many of these regions.  The work we will carry out in Chad will be very significant and I hope all will go well.  Meanwhile, the process of peace and conflict resolution within Darfur will proceed.  I hope progress will be made there.  Major players such as China have a substantial input there and we must keep the pressure on at international level.</P>
        <P>A very basic question was asked about male and female involvement.  The selection process obviously is open to male and female members and the process is under way.  I have no details regarding the composition of this mission but I have no doubt there will be a good combination of males and females involved, as they are in some of the missions I have seen abroad recently.  I recently visited Kosovo where there is a very good involvement of female members of the Defence Forces.</P><Col N="1853"/>
        <P>Senator Leyden and others raised the question of the Reserve Defence Force.  There are no plans to deploy members of the RDF.  It would require legislation because they are, as the Senator noted, volunteers.  I have noted the points made by the Senator.</P>
        <P>Issues such as security and water were raised.  In respect of water, there is a reserve of 30 days&rsquo; supply of bottled water which will be stored in a very cool environment.  In respect of sanitary issues, it would be necessary to drill water holes for the supply of water, which was another point raised in the debate.</P>
        <P>I believe Senator de B&uacute;rca raised a question relating to French involvement.  The EU support mission in Chad and the Central African Republic was established under the authority of the UN Security Council resolution 1778, which was unanimously adopted in September.  As a chapter 7 mission, the Security Council has deemed that the situation in Chad and the Central African Republic constitutes a threat to international peace and security.  This is the basis for the Security Council&rsquo;s action in deciding to authorise the mission, including authorising the deployment of troops by the EU.  For its part, the EU is committed to the establishment of a force that is neutral and impartial and operates in full co-operation with the UN.  There will be 1,200 French troops, which is a third of the overall contingent in the region.  I thank the Senator for raising that matter.</P>
        <P>The mission will last for 12 months from the date it becomes fully operational.  At the end of this period, the mission may be taken over by the UN.  Major General Pat Nash will report on the situation in Chad in six months&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>I believe Senator Bradford mentioned the matter of reporting back.  An annual report on participation by the Defence Forces on all overseas missions will be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the Defence Acts.  I agree with the Senator that it is imperative to have further debates.  We will arrange for that at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney asked whether Major General Nash&rsquo;s involvement is a first.  It is a first in that his is the first high-profile post as an EU operational commander but there were other high-profile positions taken up by Irish people, such as those occupied by General Sean McKeown, General Bill O&rsquo;Callaghan of UNIFIL and Major-General Quinn.  As Senators probably know, we have a framework nation involvement in Kosovo, which I visited recently and where I met troops.  Brigadier-General Gerry Hegarty is the commanding officer there with 1,200 soldiers under his command.  It is very encouraging to see so many Irish people in prominent positions dealing with many of these conflicts throughout the world.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca and many others raised the issue of safety.  The decision to send troops overseas is not taken lightly and I assure the House that our ability to protect the health and safety of our personnel is of paramount concern when considering any mission.  While no absolute guarantee can be given with regard to the safety <Col N="1854"/>of troops serving in missions, it is the policy and practice to ensure Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission.  The detailed threat assessment and reconnaissance undertaken informs decisions regarding the configuration of the contingent and its protection.  In the case of the current mission, the Defence Forces will deploy a full range of force protection assets, including Mowag armoured personnel carriers, close reconnaissance vehicles and indirect fire capabilities.  These together will provide the necessary armoured protection, mobility, firepower and communications.  The Mowag APCs being deployed were also deployed with the Defence Forces when they served with UNMIL in Liberia and UNIFIL in Lebanon where they performed very effectively.  In addition, the existing French presence in Chad is capable of rapid expansion, if necessary, to support the EU force.  We are all very conscious of this issue.</P>
        <P>I was asked whether we were happy with the procedures for the management and protection of the health of our personnel.  Senator Burke raised the fact that major plans are in place.  A key concern of the mission is the health of our troops, having regard to the environmental health issues arising in a tropical setting.  The Defence Force adopts a comprehensive approach to managing and protecting the health of its personnel.  As a matter of course, all personnel volunteers must have passed their annual medical examination in the first instance.  They are then subjected to a further detailed overseas medical examination where they are assessed for suitability with particular reference to the physical requirements of the particular mission.  The troops to be deployed in Chad will go through that process.  All troops will be fully immunised against known disease risks.  In respect of possible water-borne parasites or diseases, the Defence Forces will bring their own water purification plant and sewage treatment plant with them.  On return from the mission, all troops are fully tested from a health perspective as a matter of course.  The Defence Forces will deploy a containerised medical facility as part of the battalion.  This facility will be operated by two medical doctors who will be assisted by a team of 13 Defence Forces medical personnel and paramedics.</P>
        <P>I know there may be other issues but we could return to them at a future date.  I thank Members for their contributions to this debate.  It has been very helpful and also shows the considerable support and respect for our Army personnel.  I commend the individual members of the Permanent Defence Force who have served and continue to serve on overseas missions, together with their families and loved ones.  As we enter the Christmas season, I know it will be a difficult time for the families with loved ones far from home.  However, I know the arrangements we will put in place will help ensure there is good and effective ongoing contact between our peacekeepers and their families.</P>
        <P>In respect of security, we have a key Irish person in place.  Our troops will not be allowed to go <Col N="1855"/>to Chad until all the logistics and arrangements mentioned are in place.  Important provisions are being made.  People have mentioned situations where evacuation might be needed.  All those are being considered very carefully.  As I said previously, we have an Irish person in place who will involved in making those decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I thank also the Minister of State for being present to take this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Government.  The issue concerns health policy on the pre-treatment of children and aftercare, with particular reference to childhood diabetes.</P>
        <P>The first issue relating to pre-treatment concerns a vaccination programme and what seems to be an uneven spread of take-up throughout the country due to decisions made about resources.  While I realise that decisions on resources and administration are matters for the Health Service Executive, I am enquiring whether there is a policy that certain types of vaccination would be available regardless of geographic location and, in particular, would be available to children and parents of children in specific cases.  It was decided in Cork that BCG vaccinations would not be made available.  While the cost, &euro;40,000, was quite low for the number of children involved it seems curious that an administrative decision, with consequences for health policy in general, can be made in one part of the country while the parents and children could have access to that vaccination elsewhere.  In raising this Adjournment matter I am attempting to find out why that is the case.  If the Minister of State is unable to provide a direct answer now I would appreciate if an official of the Department of Health and Children could forward the information.  There are tremendous strains on the health service in respect of frontline services but the point I raise today is that if we are clear about policy and put resources into preventative health care and continuing care outside hospital services, we could <Col N="1856"/>save much of the current grief about the bottleneck where health service resources are provided.</P>
        <P>The treatment of childhood diabetes in the Cork area is of constant concern.  The backup team available to children and parents is small compared to services provided elsewhere in the country.  There is nothing like the number of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists available in other areas.  The former southern health board area, comprising Cork and Kerry, appears to have a preponderance of children suffering from type 1 diabetes.  People are born with this rather than acquiring it.  I would have thought a national health service, such as the title of the HSE implies, could identify these clusters and allocate resources appropriately.  The role of the Department of Health and Children should ensure equality of access to service throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is hard to understand why these difficulties exist in Cork, the second city in Ireland.  It should not have them, and they are even more prevalent in isolated, rural communities.  That these problems exist at all in a major urban centre is a cause for concern.  I wish to put these concerns on record and pose a number of questions, to which I expect a detailed response.  By taking the opportunity to make these concerns known I hope to see a process set up to provide effective answers and action in these areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  This provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House the importance attached by the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to the issues raised.</P>
        <P>Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting children against certain diseases.  The primary childhood immunisation programme is administered on a countrywide basis and is offered to all children in all HSE areas.  It is administered by general practitioners.  It is a voluntary programme and therefore it is essential that we encourage all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>
        <P>I understand from the HSE that owing to regulatory difficulties being experienced by the manufacturer of the BCG vaccine, there may be a shortage of the vaccine throughout the country during the coming weeks.  This is a Europe-wide problem as the manufacturer in question is the only company which supplies the vaccine to the European market.  The HSE is in regular contact with the supplier, and is doing all it can do to ensure delivery of the vaccine at the earliest possible juncture.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to stockpile the vaccine in advance because it has a very short shelf life.  It is anticipated that the HSE <Col N="1857"/>will receive fresh stocks of the vaccine in early January.</P>
        <P>The objective of the primary childhood immunisation programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95%, which is the rate required to provide population immunity and to protect children and the population generally from the potentially serious diseases concerned.  Ireland&rsquo;s recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the national immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  These guidelines are prepared with the assistance of a committee from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.  The recommended childhood immunisation schedule in this country contains immunisation against ten infectious diseases.  These include tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, haemophilus influenzae B, meningococcal C disease, measles, mumps and rubella.  The national immunisation advisory committee has recently completed a review of our immunisation schedule and among the changes recommended are the addition of hepatitis B and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to the programme.  It is proposed to introduce the new schedule in 2008.</P>
        <P>Immunisation against infectious disease has saved more lives than any other public health intervention, apart from providing clean water.  In order to eliminate these infectious diseases entirely, uptake of immunisation of 95% or greater is required.  When immunisation uptake rates are below 95%, outbreaks of infectious disease will continue to occur and some children will suffer complications or die as a result.  Unfortunately, immunisation uptake in this country has never achieved the target of 95%.  The HSE informs me that an expert advisory group is examining a policy document on diabetes and this includes issues of childhood diabetes and equality of access.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised this Adjournment matter because I have been contacted by the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  This body nominated me to stand for election to this House again and I was elected on that nomination on three occasions.</P>
        <P>There is a view that a move may be done to devolve housing allocation from borough and town councils to the medium of the county council.  Two Members raised this matter in the other House.  I will give my views in case it becomes reality.  It would be a backward step at a time when we are endeavouring to strengthen local government and when town local government, above all other units of local government, must be strengthened.</P>
        <P>The borough councils concerned are Drogheda, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford.  Some 49 urban councils are involved, of which three have a number of members equal to that of a borough council, namely 12.  The other 46 have nine members each.  Bray Town <Col N="1858"/>Council represents an area greater than at least two counties in this country.  If housing powers are downgraded we would take a backward step, making a nonsense out of upgrading local government and strengthening town local government.</P>
        <P>If the expenditure of town councils and county councils is examined, one sees that town councils perform very well.  In a town not far from where I live, 144% of the housing allocation was spent.  It could have done with more money.  Meanwhile, the county council spent 67% of its allocation, a figure that speaks for itself.  I am not aware of the long-term proposals but I ask for the views in the Department, the permanent government.  I ask the Minister and Ministers of State not to proceed with any proposal to devolve the allocation in the manner outlined.  Such a proposal would not be in the interests of town councils, local government in general or democracy.</P>
        <P>I am proud to have been a member of a town council, albeit it one that was non-rating.  Unfortunately, town commissions had their name changed under the 2000 Act.  However, all that changed was the name.  There are 26 non-rating authorities and 49 urban district councils, making a total of 75.  They are all town councils but, as already stated, 26 are non-rating.  Some of those towns have populations much larger than those that obtain in towns with rating authorities, which were originally called urban district councils.</P>
        <P>A great deal is at stake in the context of local democracy.  I was born and bred in the country and I live in a town.  In 1979 I had the honour to be elected to both Westmeath County Council and Mullingar Town Commission.  There is no comparison between the problems of towns and those experienced in rural areas.  One can travel miles along country roads and the only problems one might encounter would relate to the serving of hedge notices, verge trimming, the opening of water cuts, road surfaces or the need to straighten a bad corner.  Walk town a street in a town and one might be presented with 20 issues.</P>
        <P>There is no point in saying that this can be done more efficiently.  I reiterate what I said regarding the uptake and utilisation of allocations.  Town councils are far more efficient in terms of taking up their allocations and making use of them.  I request that the situation which obtains at present in respect of the allocation of funding for housing starts to borough and town councils remain as it stands.  I also request that any proposal, whether it comes from the Department or the Minister&rsquo;s office, be parked permanently.  We should forget such proposals because they are not in the interests of democracy or furthering the powers of local government in our towns.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, to which I will be replying on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</P>
        <P>The background to the annual round of housing allocations is the steady increase in the size of <Col N="1859"/>the social housing investment programme.  Substantial investment has been made in social housing in recent years.  The range of programmes has broadened, with more households being offered a wider range of housing options.  Delivery methods have also diversified, with the growth in voluntary and co-operative housing and with innovative arrangements being applied to promote tenure diversity through public private partnerships and major regeneration schemes.  New housing is also coming on stream through Part V agreements and the new rental accommodation scheme, RAS.</P>
        <P>During the period 2007 to 2009, 27,000 new homes will be commenced or acquired for those in need of social housing, through a combination of measures including local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and RAS accommodation under long-term contracts.  The Government allocated in excess of &euro;926 million in 2007 for this purpose.  The resources being made available under the national development plan will allow for similar levels of activity after 2009.</P>
        <P>Housing authorities will be the primary agents for the delivery of social housing with 20,000 new housing starts projected for the 2007 to 2009 period.  This level of activity naturally will place significant demands on housing authorities.  The evidence in 2007, however, is that performance on the social housing programme is at its strongest point this decade.</P>
        <P>Officials of the Minister&rsquo;s Department met representatives of housing authorities last October to review their housing action plans.  These meetings brought together all the housing authorities within a county area with the aim of ensuring an integrated approach to delivering their programmes.  With individual households often applying for housing support to different authorities within an area, in light of the fact that housing solutions frequently address the concerns of more than one authority and given the need for authorities to make best use of local resources in the design, planning and management of projects, it is clear that authorities cannot and should not act in isolation.</P>
        <P>In so far as this relates to allocations, it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to provide county and city councils as early as possible in 2008 with an indication of the general level of Exchequer funding which will be available over the next three years <Col N="1860"/>for the main housing investment programme.  This will take into account a number of factors, including existing commitments, the state of housing programmes and, in particular, housing need.  This is the first stage of a process of consultation and negotiation with housing authorities to arrive at an equitable distribution of funding for the 2008 to 2010 period.</P>
        <P>County councils will be expected to co-ordinate the planning for the various housing programmes for their county areas in co-operation with the housing authorities within their areas and in some cases with adjoining counties.  The Department will then meet and discuss these plans with each housing authority, including town and borough councils, as part of the housing action plan review process.  It is expected that capital allocations for 2008 for each housing authority will be formally announced by the end of the first quarter of next year.  As is the normal practice, allocations will be made directly to city, county, borough and town councils.</P>
        <P>The Minister is conscious that over time the management and integration of various housing programmes has become more complex and some pooling of resources at a county level is required to improve planning and to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of projects.  Against this background and in the context of developing further the multi-annual financial framework for housing investment programmes, the Minister is examining ways to provide more flexibility in the management of the investment programmes.</P>
        <P>The successful delivery of housing investment programmes depends on housing authorities, including the town and borough councils.  In this context, the aim is to strengthen the capabilities of all housing authorities to enable them to better deliver housing services at local level in an integrated and effective manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I ask him to relay to the Minister my comments on the efficiency of town councils regarding the administration of their housing allocations.  County councils have much to learn from town councils in this area.  In the context of housing starts, figures relating to uptake and disbursement provide clear evidence that what I am saying is true.</P>
