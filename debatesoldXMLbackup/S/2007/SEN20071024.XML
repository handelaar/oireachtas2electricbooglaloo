	<P Just="Left">I have notice from Senator Donohoe that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the current conditions and future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra, Cabra, Dublin 7.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport to discuss, with his ministerial counterpart in the Assembly, a direct Dublin to Derry train service and to outline the impediments, if any, which would hinder such a service from being realised.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider rescinding the ministerial order allowing the removal of the Turoe Stone from its current location to a new location at Galway city.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ellis of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to advise on the position with regard to the proposal to remove the rheumatology services from Manorhamilton and transfer them to Sligo General Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to review his decision to refuse an employment permit in respect of a person (details supplied).</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Before I call the Leader on the Order of Business, I wish to point out that No. 2, motion on establishment of committees of the 23rd Seanad, contains a number of printing errors.  The most obvious is that, in respect of each of the Joint Committees on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, European Affairs and Foreign Affairs, the number of Senators should be six, not four.  A number of other errors and misspellings have been made.  For the convenience of the House, I have circulated the correct text of the motion on a supplementary Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 5, 15, 3 and 4.  No. 1, motion on appointment of Members to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission,  and No. 2, motion on the establishment of the joint committees of the 23rd Seanad, will be taken without debate on the conclusion of the Order of Business.  No. 5, statements on the Government&rsquo;s current suicide prevention strategy, will be taken on the conclusion of No. 2, to conclude not later than 5 p.m. if not previously concluded, and the Minister to be called on to respond not later than 4.55 p.m.  No. 15, motion on lifelong learning, will be taken from 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.  No. 3, Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages, will be taken on the conclusion of No. 15, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes each, and Senators may share time.  No. 4, early signature motion on the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2007, will be taken without debate on the conclusion of No. 3.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Leader for arranging today&rsquo;s debate on mental health, which many Senators have sought.  It is important that we hold this debate because, as Senator Harris has noted, it will provide us with an opportunity to influence attitudes on mental health.</P><Col N="639"/>
        <P Just="Left">I believe every Senator would wish to express abhorrence at the two murders which have taken place since this House last met.  While every murder is dreadful, these were particularly cold-blooded and horrific displays of violence.  In one of the cases, a young man was bludgeoned to death by a group of men.  As he screamed for his life, he was told, &ldquo;Now you know who is in charge here&rdquo;.  That chilling comment was reported in our newspapers.  Another young man was shot to death while he was sharing a taxi with three women and a driver in the wrong place at the wrong time.</P>
        <P>Surprisingly, the Green Party was somewhat critical of my party when Senator Regan brought a Private Members&rsquo; motion which highlighted the urgency of this issue last week.  The response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the motion did not demonstrate the urgency required to address the types of gangland crime we are currently seeing.  Fine Gael will not be found wanting in supporting the range of measures needed to deal with this issue.  The Minister stated that he would raise the issue with the Garda as a priority, although he had not yet agreed priorities for 2008 when he came to the House.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the issue of combating gangland crime needs to become a priority for the Garda in the coming year.  I urge the Leader to request the Minister&rsquo;s return to the House so that he can indicate the priorities and extra resources he will dedicate to addressing this issue.  These two horrific murders highlight the need for urgency in introducing new measures and resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I subscribe to the view that further debate is needed on this issue.   As Senator Fitzgerald has noted, we have previously debated aspects of it but there is one aspect we have not addressed, which is that one of the killings occurred in the Border area.  The business of laundering diesel and so on has become a major industry and turf wars take place there all the time.  The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to bring about shadow legislation and the shadowing of decisions.  I do not understand why taxation should not enter into this.  We are in a position to address commercially some of the issues in the area.  There should be more co-operation between North and South on issues such as excise on diesel to make activity such as diesel laundering a non-runner.  We have little chance of controlling the flow of drugs into this country if people can bring in thousands of litres of diesel without detection.  We need to discuss these issues further and the chilling comment repeated by Senator Fitzgerald is important.  As in Limerick and other places, we now know that the gang bosses are in charge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this House we have often requested that the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in condemn such criminal acts in the Border area.  If one positive development <Col N="640"/>has emerged from this matter, it is that the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in has done so in this case and has asked any person with information to co-operate with the Garda and Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  We waited a long time to hear such a statement and it is important we heard it.</P>
        <P>We need to have an extended debate on the Border in the context of what is proposed for the coming years.  In the past ten years I have inquired approximately ten times in this House about Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the Schengen Agreement and the fact that we must produce passports when travelling throughout Europe.  As things stand, it seems we will have to show our passports when crossing the Border into the North and when travelling around Europe and we will lose in both ways.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should sign up to the Schengen Agreement, especially as the UK is beginning its new arrangement on passports.  Through this system we could bring about free travel within this island under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are either part of Europe or we are not and it should not be beyond the ingenuity of man to find solutions to such matters.  The idea is to allow free movement through borders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am also concerned at Prime Minister Brown&rsquo;s proposals on electronic border controls from 2009 because we have a land border with Northern Ireland that poses many problems in this regard.  A person from Dundalk who needs to go to the UK seeking a new job as a football manager, for example, may find it easier to travel from the North than from the South.  He or she could simply drive to Belfast International Airport and fly to Britain without the use of a passport.  This clearly poses a problem for the British Government as it is not its intention to allow such anomalies to continue.  I wish to impress upon the Leader of the House the need for the Taoiseach to talk to his counterparts in the UK to create an arrangement that will allow the system to work for all of us.</P>
        <P>I was interested to note today that one of our leading think tanks, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, predicts clouds on the horizon for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  Forecasts show that insufficient tax revenues will be raised in the coming year to cover promises made in recent months on health, crime and education.  It appears the Minister will have to make some stark choices.  He can renege on some promises, raise taxes or go cap in hand to the bank seeking extra cash, but none of these options will be easy for him as he has told us for years how well his Department is run.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, mistakes made on the issue of Shannon Airport by the Department of Transport came to light and this week the Department of Finance&rsquo;s forecasts have been proven wrong.  Ministers seem to just sail blithely on. I am concerned that the Government does not engage in any accountability.  Will the Leader request that <Col N="641"/>the Minister address this House on his intentions regarding the economy?</P>

	<P>Regarding debates on serious crime, I have no difficulty in having the issue addressed regularly in this House. It is, however, incumbent on all involved in public life not to adopt a tone of moral superiority which suggests that, somehow, their response to law and order is better than anyone else&rsquo;s.</P>

	<P>We heard enough lectures last week in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry if someone has taken that implication from what I said, but we have heard likewise from the other side of the House as well.  The problems are unchanged.  There is no difficulty with having ongoing and regular debates if they are entered into in the right tone and with the common approach the issue needs, especially with regard to criminality in the Border region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to raise the issue of the right of Irish citizens living abroad to vote in our elections.  This weekend we saw the phenomenal sight of thousands of Polish people participating in a Polish general election.  The circumstances in Poland may be different from those in Ireland in that the nature of Polish emigration could be temporary. <Col N="642"/> Polish people who come to the UK and Ireland may want to return to Poland as soon as possible.  Irish emigration may be more permanent and there might be a distortion in the figures in electing a Government as a result of the number of Irish citizens living abroad.  However, we need to debate whether Irish citizens living abroad should be allowed vote for our Head of State or whether they should vote on issues related to the Constitution which affects all Irish citizens wherever they live.  The Seanad would be a good Chamber for such a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no difficulty with the call for a debate on the economy in the context of the budget.  The projections made by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the general election were matched exactly by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The Green Party was the political party that made the most prudent and modest economic projections in the general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another flip flop from the Green Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not expect to speak so soon after Senator Boyle&rsquo;s speech.  I call for a debate in the House on the report of the constituency commission.  I understand the Minister has said he will allow debate on the legislative stage in both Houses, but it is time for the House to debate the issue in a measured manner.  One must question, for example, the manner in which Limerick county and city have been torn to shreds by the boundary commission.  I noted that there were more than 300 submissions on the website yesterday, most of which referred specifically to County Leitrim.  Nothing has yet been done to restore Leitrim to its previous glory in electoral terms.  The report is important and the constituency commission carries out an important function, but its work should be debated in the House.  I accept the argument that we must keep politicians away from such a politically sensitive issue, but we need to examine the role the commission plays in carving up our constituencies.  The Leader fell victim to one of the reports of the commission previously, and I know he would agree to a broad debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I read with dismay this morning that due to Health Service Executive, HSE, cutbacks, some people who suffer from multiple sclerosis, MS, are being denied home care packages.  This is as a result of budget restrictions.  The HSE has refused to accept this is the case, but people in the MS society have told us it is.  It is alarming that people with such a debilitating and serious <Col N="643"/>illness are being denied home care packages.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate to establish whether this is the case?  If it is, will the HSE stop delivering a spin on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the issue of the ESRI report relating to examinations and the experience of junior certificate students. This recent publication explored the experience of junior certificate students and highlighted what schools can do to enhance student learning and engagement with schools.  Would it be appropriate to ask the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House to debate this? It is important to examine the ideas contained in a survey of 900 students, although it should have been broader.  Issues highlighted include the dominance of the State examinations, the streaming of students, interaction between teachers and students, and whether we should have a vocational and academic, as opposed to a vocational or academic, approach to education.  Those are interesting topics and they are linked to the Private Members&rsquo; business motion this evening which deals with lifelong learning.  The earlier we start, the more success we will achieve.  This survey is timely and would result in an interesting debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to follow up on what Senator Fitzgerald said about last week&rsquo;s debate on gangland crime.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, displayed no sense of urgency about this problem.  He did not suggest any new legislation or the provision of additional resources, and there was nothing from him regarding a change in policing methods.  He described the motion as tendentious and opportunistic, yet in the D&aacute;il debate this week the Taoiseach proposed making greater use of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the absence of any clarity or precision on any such proposal by the Minister a week earlier, is there any substance to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s suggestion or is it merely words to suggest we are doing something about the situation?  He said that if criminal gangs continue to operate and do the things they are doing, we will have to do something about it.  That does not appear to constitute a policy or new innovation.  It is easy to criticise the courts for not convicting people but the reality is that the detection rates for these types of crimes have plummeted.  These gangs believe they cannot be caught.  It is a question of the detection and prosecution of people for these crimes.  It is very easy for the Government to criticise the courts and suggest that they are failing in this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments about the Schengen Agreement.  I do not wish to revisit the matter but when we discussed the opt-out on criminal law in the European Union one of the issues was that we had to protect the common <Col N="644"/>travel area.  One week later, we now know that it will be discontinued in two years&rsquo; time.  It is important to have a debate on the Schengen Agreement and on these opt-outs to see where we are going and identify Government policy on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>As this is my first time to speak on the Order of Business I want to congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment and wish him every success in the Chair.</P>
        <P>I concur with the comments of Senator Fitzgerald and abhor the killings that occurred since we spoke here last week.  As spokesman on justice in this House for the third time, I will not have any difficulty if the Government decides to invoke the Special Criminal Court to deal with these serious crimes.  I am aware there is a reluctance in that regard on the part of certain civil liberties groups and I would be slow to go down that road.  However, because of the escalation in the level of violence I ask the Leader to convey my concerns that if these gangland, drug-related mercenary assassinations by people who are paid to carry out these crimes continue week in, week out we may have to invoke the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>We are approaching the winter season.  The clocks go back one hour next weekend and we will experience long nights.  I raised this issue many years ago, which concerns the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and I ask the Leader to examine it.  I would like the wearing of reflective vests or armbands to be made compulsory for pedestrians, particularly young children and the elderly.  In a recent incident in east Cork two people going to mass early in the morning were knocked down.  Unfortunately, one of them died.  As someone who has one of the longest journeys to make to and from the Oireachtas, I dread meeting people clad in dark clothing on winter mornings, including children alighting from buses in the darkness.  Although every attempt may be made to avoid such accidents, the driver is not always at fault.  It would not cost much to issue up to 50,000 reflective armbands to schools and pensioners, but it might save lives.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this matter, which is appropriate given the approach of winter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should attend the House to discuss tourism policy.  We underestimate the value of tourism as a driver of economic growth and I have a number of concerns which need to be addressed in this regard.  In particular, a recent analysis has shown that in the first six months of this year the number of visitors from Britain dropped.  This is an important statistic as Britain is our most important market.  The issue will become more important considering the fiasco in Shannon and the high yield tourism and commercial business which it handles.  Business tourism <Col N="645"/>will now be detrimentally affected, particularly as we no longer have a manager in Shannon Airport to help alleviate these problems.</P>
        <P>We must also see how the Government can work with agencies in facilitating more visitors to come to the regions.  This concerns the role of Dublin Tourism working more closely with other agencies in order to achieve such an outcome.  This perennial issue must be addressed.  While Dublin Tourism is doing a fine job, its work should be extended in order to disseminate visitors outside the capital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My other concern relates to driving tourism growth in the regions, which do not have the same international visitor experience.  The domestic market has performed excellently for the past ten years, but it must be reaching a peak.  Therefore we should examine strategies for extending visitor stays in addition to creating extra ones.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">We should examine the possibility of overturning the decision to deregulate the self-catering sector.  Like all other sectors, it was approved for a number of years but its deregulation will have a detrimental effect in rural areas where the majority of accommodation is self-catering.  Henceforth, the sector will no longer be marketed in the same way as other models of accommodation.  The bed and breakfast sector has experienced problems in recent years together with a lack of investment in e-marketing by agencies.  In addition, there are inefficiencies due to the number of agencies operating in the sector.  We should have a debate on tourism strategies to ensure the future of the sector.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to confine my comments to the crime problem.  While I welcome Gerry Adams&rsquo;s statement concerning the atrocious beating on the Border, nevertheless there is a clear link between the paramilitary tradition and the current state of gangland crime.  The culture of paramilitaries and the use of lethal force, including executions, are tied in and synthesised with the drug culture.  Therefore, Mr. Adams cannot abscond from all responsibility in this respect.  The good news, however, is that the link between paramilitarism and crime offers us the solution.  The Taoiseach began the debate the other day when he said he was thinking about using the Special Criminal Court.  He was right to say no more.  Surprisingly, I am not in favour of a knee-jerk reaction.  I am sorry if this matter is going to be politicised because I wish it would not be.  I commend Eamon Gilmore&rsquo;s idea that membership of a gang or association with a gang should be a crime.  Eamon Gilmore is from a strong left-wing tradition in Europe.  The Communist Party supported the special investigating magistrates which smashed the Mafia.  The pity is that too often the left wing is ready to talk about the dangers to civil liberties rather than joining the general community in solving the crime prob<Col N="646"/>lem first.  When that is done I will listen to the civil liberties case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach was right at the weekend to be censorious of civil liberties.  We have a problem.  Fine Gael has made some good suggestions in respect of 24 hour surveillance.  The Labour Party has also made good suggestions.  Fianna F&aacute;il should not be so defensive of its Minister.  We need to work together to deal with this problem.  There is gangland crime in Dublin, Limerick and on the Border, and an impending problem caused by foreign gangs trafficking and committing crime here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to use the Offences Against the State Act provisions which have been on the Statute Book since our war on terrorism and give the Special Criminal Court a new category of investigating or prosecuting judges.  Instead of a garda relaying witnesses whom he or she believes but who do not want to go into the witness protection programme a judge would do so.  An experienced judge protected by the law would say that he or she was satisfied with the witnesses&rsquo; bona fides and direct that suspects be interned or locked up for 30 days.  That is necessary to disrupt gangland crime in Dublin and to lift young men out of their communities in Limerick for their own sake.  There is no point telling a 20 year old who is involved in a vendetta that he will go to prison.  Men of that age do not care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Kierkegaard said that most of the trouble in the world is caused by men under the age of 25.  It is not possible to talk to a tearaway at that age.  He needs to be lifted out of his community for his own sake.  The political resonances of this are important.  The Irish State, under Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and coalition Governments, lifted hundreds of Republicans between the 1950s and the 1970s.  Proinsias De Rossa has said that he benefited by that action.  It is sometimes necessary to allow people to cool off for their own sake.  It is no harm going into a good progressive prison for 30 days if one is involved in a Limerick vendetta.</P>
        <P>Instead of giving a knee-jerk reaction we should stand back coolly from the British common law system which waits for a crime to be committed and then act.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is adequately resourced.  One can make political capital if one wishes to do so by putting more community garda&iacute; on the beat but that will not deal with organised crime.  A proactive policy of setting out to smash the crime gangs is needed, rather than waiting for them to commit offences.  This requires four or five investigating magistrates, one apiece for the Border, Limerick, Dublin and foreign crime gangs, integrated into the Special Criminal Court.  These prosecuting judges should be charged with special powers to subpoena witnesses to break the crime gangs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the fact that Gerry Adams has condemned the outrage that took place and indicated that members of the nationalist community should give evidence to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  I strongly agree with Senator Harris that this awful, brutal incident took place within the context of Republicanism, about which there is no doubt.  The chilling words, &ldquo;Now you know who is in charge here,&rdquo; brought to mind that very remarkable programme, &ldquo;The Killings at Coolacrease&rdquo;, for which I pay tribute to RTE.  It was broadcast last night and Senator Harris played a prominent and distinguished part in it.  He was splendidly forthright, decent and honest.  I was very ashamed by some of the things that were said.  There was a horrible and nasty, small minded bestial attempt to smear retrospectively the Pearson family, which I deplore.</P>

	<P>To hear a young historian say the mistake was that they did not finish them off is repulsive in the extreme.  I could hardly believe what I was hearing.  The ethos that operated in 1921 in Offaly is the same ethos that has operated in the Border counties, and it must be wiped out.</P>
        <P>However, I do not share Senator Harris&rsquo;s optimism about the success of the Italian police with the Mafia.  It has not happened, although I wish it would.  The Mafia is not the only group.  There is also the Camorra and the other group with the unpronounceable name whose tentacles have reached into Berlin.  They are very powerful and, like the IRA, they have not gone away.  I wish they had.</P>
        <P>It was also said in that programme that the Pearson girls were very aggressive.  Is that really the case?  When 32 armed and dangerous louts break in, having shot their two brothers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash; and let them bleed to death, why do we describe them as aggressive?  Let us have a bit of reality.</P><Col N="648"/>
        <P>I agree that the episode should be looked at in the context of the Border and I listened to what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about passports.  We already have a passport situation.  The real Government of Ireland &mdash; I speak of Michael O&rsquo;Leary and Ryanair &mdash; makes us produce our passports at the airport, so why should the British not do it?  It will certainly put the cat among the Unionist pigeons.  They will discover how united their kingdom is at the end of the day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to raise the question of the civil registration and domestic partnership Bill which I had hoped to introduce, but for technical reasons this will not happen until at least after Christmas.  I would welcome it if the Government introduced the Bill in its own time because the situation is becoming urgent.  I have a file of e-mails from people, including one from an Irish citizen who points out that last April the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform transposed the free movement directive into Irish law.  This means that an EU citizen from outside Ireland can freely bring his or her partner, of the same or opposite sex, into the country but an Irish citizen resident here has no such right.  There is this extraordinary anomaly and we are lagging behind.  We discussed it in the previous Seanad.  I hope there will be the same consensus in both Houses.  There is time for us to bite the bullet on this issue and I look forward to the Leader indicating whether he will allow Government time for it.  If not, I will have to introduce it after Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader arrange for an urgent debate on the proposed Lisbon European Union reform treaty which was finalised by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week, with the assistance of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche?  It was done very successfully and I commend the Government on how it handled the negotiations.  Ireland is the only country of the 27 members of the EU that will have a referendum on this issue.  It is important that we have a detailed debate, that people know the facts about the negotiations and that the reform treaty will be circulated to every citizen in the State.  Ireland is the focus of attention in Europe because our decision will decide whether the reform treaty will be implemented.  All parties have a major responsibility to ensure we have a thorough debate on the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Taoiseach on ensuring we excluded certain aspects of the treaty and obtained derogations.  The fact that he is the longest serving leader in Europe proves the point that he is now a senior figure.  He has brought about a well negotiated reform treaty which I fully support.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister of State to come to the House and explain the treaty.  We can all act to ensure it is implemented.  We will not have a second bite at the cherry this time and it will not be like the Nice treaty.  We cannot go back every time to see if the people will change their minds.</P><Col N="649"/>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Senator Boyle on becoming chairperson of the Green Party.

	<P>As for the issue I wished to raise on the Adjournment in respect of Bord G&aacute;is, I am aware this matter pertains to the regulator.  The Leader should ask the Minister to raise with the regulator the issue regarding the connection to the network of Moate, County Westmeath.  Bord G&aacute;is was supposed to connect the towns of Moate, Kilbeggan, Kinnegad and Edenderry this year.  However, due to the unfortunate mishap of a fire in Glanbia in Edenderry, the towns in question have been moved to the third phase.  This is completely unacceptable as Moate and the other midlands towns were supposed to have been connected to the network this year.  While all these populated areas want to make progress, they are being pushed back further.  The Leader should intervene by speaking to the Minister, who could in turn speak to the Commission for Energy Regulation to try to make progress regarding the connection of these towns, which had been promised such a connection in 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the report published yesterday by the constituency commission.  As Members are probably aware, 75% of the submissions made to the commission came from County Leitrim.  They came from people across the political spectrum who sought the county&rsquo;s location within one constituency or other.  The net result of the constituency commission&rsquo;s decision published yesterday is that were a candidate to secure every vote cast in either section of Leitrim, he or she would have only 0.75 of a quota.  This comes close to disenfranchising the people of County Leitrim, who are not now in a position to elect a Deputy of any political persuasion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is unsatisfactory and I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to attend the House to explain the reason the constituency commission did not take cognisance of the submissions made to it from across the political spectrum.  Several other configurations could have been put in place that would have allowed Leitrim to remain as a single entity within one constituency.  Obviously, however, this constitutes another attack on the weakest part of the country.  I demand that the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come before <Col N="650"/>the House to discuss this issue before the publication of any legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will call on the Government to reject this report.  Members will have noted how part of south Offaly has been thrown into Tipperary North and west Limerick has been put into Kerry North.  Every area in the country has been facilitated except for its weakest region and I appeal to the Leader to ensure the Minister comes before the House to discuss this matter.  The constituency commission report should be rejected across the political spectrum as the submissions it received demonstrated the depth of feeling regarding what has been proposed.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I also wish to raise the student support Bill that was promised by the Minister for Education and Science for early 2007.  She made this promise to students last year, as well as prior to the general election.  A commitment was also given in a reply to a parliamentary question from a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy.  However, the student support Bill has not emerged.  As many Members are aware, the USI organised a protest at the gates of Leinster House yesterday, which I had the opportunity to address.  The view of the students and my party is that it is essential the student support Bill is published as quickly as possible.  However, it is just as important that there is proper consultation with the USI on what is to be included in the Bill.  Some local authorities and VECs are holding back grants for various reasons, placing students in financial difficulties and forcing some of them to drop out of college because their grants are not forthcoming.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to pick up on a point made by the deputy leader, Senator Dan Boyle, about the fact that Polish people in Ireland were able to cast their votes in the recent election.  Senator Boyle suggested that Irish citizens abroad should be allowed to vote in presidential elections, which I hope is a new direction being taken by the Government.  I ask the deputy leader and the Leader to bring this issue to the attention of the Taoiseach.  A first step might be to allow Irish citizens not abroad but in this country to vote for the Head of State.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been making this proposal for many years.  If we are seeing a <Col N="651"/>change in direction by the Government, it will be welcomed by Irish citizens north of the Border.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It was with interest that I listened to a number of comments on the issue of crime and gangland activity.  I welcome the comments which suggested that we should be tough on crime.  It is important that we hold together and show unanimity in our desire to address this problem.  Equally, we must show our allegiance and solidarity with the agencies of the State which are doing tremendous work in the fight against crime.  I wish the incoming Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, every success in his position.  I offer a word of caution to Senator Regan, who seemed to criticise the detection rates of our tremendous Garda force.  We should tread cautiously when we start cherry-picking.  Everybody does a great job and we should give them our support.</P>
        <P>Next Friday, 26 October, is Telethon day.  I wish to take this opportunity to encourage everybody to participate in this event and to congratulate all those involved.  The People in Need Trust has given out more than &euro;35 million in grants to groups throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I am concerned about the two accounts of rogue solicitors that have come to light in the last few days.  This is a very serious issue.

	<P Just="Left">Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Donovan, O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle, Regan, Harris and Norris expressed their horror at the two brutal murders, one in a taxi and one in a barn, that took place in recent days.  Who would ever have thought a few years ago that we would be seeing Ireland in the position it is in today?  The challenge of crime, and everything that goes with it, is a serious one for us democratic legislators.  I stated here a couple of weeks ago that the fear is gone out of the law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened attentively to what Senator Harris had to say about 30 day detention.  I will bring these strong views to the Minister and I will afford time for this issue to be discussed in the House in the next few weeks.  It is a serious challenge to law and order.  I know all parties in the House stand shoulder to shoulder in support of anything we can do by way of a new initiative, and any investment that needs to be made by the Government should be supported.  When other such challenges were laid down previously they were met.  It must be made known to those involved that the fear will be put back into the law and if sentences need to be increased, from 25 to 30, 40 or 50 years, where people go to prison and stay there without one day&rsquo;s remission, then let that be so.  That is the challenge facing us as legislators.</P>

	<P>I will allow time for such a debate and I ask Senators to prepare their submissions so that we can have a meaningful open-ended debate with the Minister present in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Hannigan expressed strong views on the position on passports under the Good Friday Agreement and the Government&rsquo;s policy in this regard.  I will also allow time for a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Hannigan and Keaveney expressed strong concerns about the ESRI.  I wish to inform Senators that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will be in the House tomorrow.  Many Senators have been expressing concern about various articles written in publications <Col N="653"/>from time to time regarding the upcoming budget.  Tomorrow will provide an opportunity with the Minister present for Senators who have expressed their concerns on the Order of Business and I look forward to hearing the concerns expressed  aired tomorrow.  We will allow at least three hours for the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any fair-minded person looking back on Ireland over the past ten to 15 years would have to say we have achieved much and there is much more on which we can build.  I would not be as pessimistic as the sentiments expressed in many of the articles we read in the newspapers today, and most Senators probably agree with me.</P>

When is the right time to do the right thing?  The county of Meath has been split in three parts.  What is the logic in being told the county boundary is sacrosanct?  It is time to examine this matter and to put together the figures when we have clear heads.</P>

    <Title>Suicide Prevention Strategy: Statements.</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Jimmy Devins.  As it is his first visit to the House since taking office, I congratulate him on his new portfolio and wish him well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a statement in the House on the Government&rsquo;s current strategy for suicide prevention.  Suicide affects all age groups and communities.  Few of us escape being touched by the devastating effects of suicidal behaviour in our lifetime and the emotional, social and practical repercussions of suicide are felt by family members, friends, neighbours and work colleagues.  Suicide knows no boundaries, geographical or political.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society &mdash; health, social services, other professionals, communities and community leaders, and voluntary and statutory agencies.  It also requires fostering the development of a culture in which people in psychological distress do not hesitate to seek help and one that recognises the signs and signals of distress and is willing to help.  Thankfully, the level of discussion and openness on mental health issues, including suicide and self-harm, has increased significantly in recent years.  This is a welcome development but we still have a long way to go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Mental Health Awareness and Attitudes Survey, January-February 2007 was commissioned by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, to obtain a comprehensive view of attitudes to mental health among the adult population.  The survey findings, which were launched in April this year, indicate that there appears to be a significant underestimation of the prevalence of mental health problems among the population, with only 5% of respondents in the survey stating that one in four people may have a mental health problem at some point in their life.  Crucially, however, the research highlights specific areas where targeted education and awareness building are required.</P>
        <P>Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of launching the national mental health awareness campaign to promote positive mental health, which is a joint initiative between the National Office for Suicide Prevention here in the South and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland.  The main aim of this campaign is to influence public attitudes to mental health.  The campaign, which is designed specifically to alter negative attitudes and promote positive attitudes and a greater understanding of mental health, involves television and radio advertisements.  An information booklet is available through the Health Service <Col N="679"/>Executive information line and the Rehab Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Headsup&rdquo; texting service is also being promoted.  Since the campaign launch on 9 October, more than 1,000 information booklets have issued and 170 detailed queries about services were received.  The website, <i>www.yourmentalhealth.ie</i>, has received 182,710 hits and 5,693 unique visits, with an average number of pages viewed per visit of 9.84.  Bebo has received more than 12,000 profile views and 370 registered friends.</P>
        <P>We live in an information age in which technology plays a significant role in our everyday life and the use of the Internet is especially prevalent among young people.  In the area of suicide prevention the use of the Internet can be an ally and a foe.  Recent media coverage has highlighted the issue of Internet prompted suicides which have brought a new and worrying dimension to our work.  I am pleased to note the recent announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the establishment of an office for Internet safety and an Internet advisory council whose responsibilities include dealing with reports of illegal content on the Internet, developing Internet safety awareness campaigns and monitoring compliance with the Internet service provider industry code of practice.  I hope to meet Internet providers shortly to discuss the effective use of the Internet in the area of suicide prevention and positive mental health.  Ireland, as an island, is united in its efforts to tackle this and many other health issues.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the National Office for Suicide Prevention in the South, colleagues in the Department of Health, Social Security and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and the Health Protection Agency in the North for putting together the first all-island action plan for joint work on suicide prevention last year.  I recently met my counterpart from Northern Ireland, Michael McGimpsey, and discussed the further development of our existing plan to provide for more North-South joint activity.  Following that meeting I was pleased to announce the launch of a new deliberate self-harm registry pilot scheme in the Western Health and Social Services Board area of Northern Ireland.  A national registry of deliberate self-harm has been operating in general hospitals in the Republic of Ireland since 2001.  The registry pilot in Northern Ireland will help identify trends of self-harm across the island, which will help target resources more effectively.  This is just one tangible example of how we can learn from each other in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Self-harm services are in place in the majority of accident and emergency departments whereby, in addition to medical care, people presenting with deliberate self-harm also receive a psycho-social assessment, following which they are admitted to the treating hospital or psychiatric hospital or discharged.  There are 32 posts of specialist nurse in accident and emergency <Col N="680"/>departments to respond to deliberate self-harm presentations.</P>
        <P>The National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork is examining best practice in this area to standardise the approach to service delivery.  I would especially like to see further development of the service in respect of aftercare and follow-up services.  I am pursuing this objective with the National Office for Suicide Prevention with a view to developing a more systematic approach to follow-up care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reach Out &mdash; National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 states: &ldquo;Information on suicidal behaviour is vital in order to guide the planning of effective services and supports&rdquo;.  It also states that, based on current information sources, the potential &ldquo;to answer fundamental questions about suicide has yet to be realised&rdquo;.  Action 25.2 of Reach Out is to &ldquo;establish a comprehensive, routine, national, confidential inquiry into deaths from unnatural causes including suicide, collating data from all of the relevant agencies&rdquo;.  The action is to be &ldquo;[i]nformed by a commissioned scoping paper&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The National Suicide Research Foundation receives core funding through the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention.  As part of the service planning process for 2007, the NSRF was commissioned by the NOSP to conduct the background scoping paper on the proposed national confidential inquiry.  Based on the evidence presented in the paper, the national office and my Department recommend that the foundation be supported to develop on a pilot basis a national confidential inquiry into deaths notified to the coroner.  The NOSP has met the coroners and feedback regarding their participation has been positive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reach Out &mdash; National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 was published in September 2005.  It represents Government policy and sets out 96 actions to be taken during the 2005 to 2014 period.  The report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, The High Level of Suicide in Irish Society, set out detailed recommendations based on written submissions and presentations to the committee by a range of statutory and voluntary groups, academics and researchers.  The 33 recommendations include practical interventions and research priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the tremendous work carried out by voluntary and statutory agencies in providing services for those who may be experiencing a personal crisis.  More than 100 organisations work in the area of suicide prevention, from local groups in their communities to national organisations.  Yesterday, I had the privilege of visiting the Dublin office of the Samaritans to meet volunteers and discuss issues around suicide and emotional distress.  I was able to see at first hand the type of calls the Samaritans receive, their training methods, volunteer support and volunteer experiences.  The Samaritans provide a fresh pair of ears every three hours, 24 hours a day, <Col N="681"/>seven days a week to listen to people in emotional distress.  The provision of a helpline that promotes active non-judgmental support is a vital resource to individuals experiencing feelings of depression, loneliness, isolation and despair.  The Samaritans and many other organisations provide lifelines for vulnerable individuals.  I would like to channel that commitment and energy.  I am exploring the viability of making available a national helpline with an easy to remember number that would be accessible EU-wide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant additional funding of &euro;3.05 million was provided in 2006 and 2007, bringing the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to &euro;8 million.  It is being used to develop and implement the recommendations outlined in Reach Out.  The Government is committed to the provision of quality mental health care.  The current level of expenditure on mental health care is unprecedented, having trebled since 1997.  This year, approximately &euro;1 billion will be spent on mental health services, including an additional &euro;51 million allocated in 2006 and 2007 for the development of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and for the implementation of Reach Out.  The NOSP oversees that implementation and has taken on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on the high level of suicide in society.  I am committed to encouraging and supporting all measures aimed at achieving these targets and preventing the further tragic loss of life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, thank him for attending the House and wish him success in his important portfolio.</P>
        <P>Some of the points raised by the Minister of State were disturbing.  For example, he quoted from the recent mental health awareness and attitudes survey which showed that the public underestimates the prevalence of mental health problems in the population.  This is a continuation of the denial on mental health issues we have seen due to ignorance, fear and lack of education on mental health issues.  It shows the significant challenge that remains to normalise attitudes to mental health difficulties.</P>
        <P>I recently spoke at a breast cancer seminar run by the Marie Keating Foundation.  As I went in to talk I met a nurse who has been working with breast cancer patients in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital for a long time.  She remarked that it was wonderful to see the level of support now for breast cancer patients which was not available ten years ago.  There was complete silence on breast cancer and it was almost stigmatised.  Thankfully that is changing, although not for all physical illnesses.  Cervical cancer still attracts quietness, denial and even stigma, and people are nervous about discussing it.  However, we have made great advances.</P><Col N="682"/>
        <P Just="Left">In mental health a significant challenge on dealing with stigma and denial must be met.  On the Order of Business I said Senator Harris noted that by discussing it in the House, we help change the tenor of the debate and ensure mental health issues, including those relating to suicide, are spoken about and normalised.  It is clear from the research the Minister of State quoted that every family is affected by mental health issues, just as every family is affected by physical health issues.  We must create a society in which people can easily get the help they need so that they can resume their normal lives quickly.  Dealing with stigma in mental health is still a major issue and a real challenge.  I welcome some of the innovative approaches being taken which the Minister of State mentioned.  They are very important.</P>
        <P>However if a child has a mental health difficulty which his or her parents want to have assessed, most local clinics will tell them there is a waiting list and that unless the child is suicidal or it is an emergency, he or she cannot be seen.  Will the Minister of State take an interest in this to see what can be done to change it?  It is all there in A Vision for Change, but most parents seeking help for children with mental health difficulties cannot access help quickly.  Some clinics have closed their waiting lists, which are up to two years.  Most clinics have waiting lists of several months.  It is critical that there is prevention and  that action is taken at an early stage when a child experiences problems, yet this is difficult.  The same applies to adult mental health care.  It is difficult to access help quickly, and in mental health, as in physical health, this is critical.  Access to help and counselling remains an issue, especially for more vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.  It is not easy to get the counselling help needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister of State said in his paper, thousands of people attend accident and emergency departments owing to self-harm.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention says the figures we have are probably an underestimate.  While I note the Minister&rsquo;s point on more nurses being available at accident and emergency departments, many who attend hospitals with self-harm do not get the help they need after the episode.  That is another area in which we must invest more resources.  Spending on mental health as a percentage of our gross domestic product is low by international standards.  I welcome the work being done by the National Office for Suicide Prevention and the Irish Association of Suicidology, whose recent conference in Killarney was excellent.  It was addressed by President McAleese.  I will mention later some of the points that arose at the conference.</P>
        <P>Everybody knows somebody who has dealt with a mental illness or a mental health issue and somebody who has recovered from such an illness and gone on to resume normal life, which is an important message to convey.  Ireland&rsquo;s record of dealing with mental health and assisting those <Col N="683"/>with mental illness is shameful and inexcusable but, thankfully, we are moving away from that.  However, we must work in partnership to change cultural attitudes to mental health issues.</P>
        <P>The National Office for Suicide Prevention has initiated some innovative measures.  Its campaign, Your Mental Health, is worthy of mention.  The Minister said the worldwide web can be an ally or a foe.  It is most important that we use it as an ally in the area of mental health.  The potential to reach the young people who are most at risk of suicide by using the Internet should be developed.  The number of hits the Your Mental Health campaign has received on the Internet is a positive sign.  That young people have been making positive comments on the Bebo site is tremendous because these are the people we must reach.  Young people, particularly young men, are very vulnerable and if we can reach them through more modern methods, we should develop that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of course, more funding is needed in this area.  I urge the Government to invest that money; it is money well spent.  The priority areas that require funding include supporting mental health awareness campaigns to reach vulnerable young people.  We have learned a great deal from research reports and should implement some of their findings.  We should also support community and voluntary organisations.  Pieta House in Lucan in my constituency provides people with tremendous counselling support.  In addition, we must focus on accident and emergency departments.  It is a cry for help when people come to those departments after harming themselves.  This is where we should reach out to them and ensure they are given counselling and ongoing help.  That is not happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another obvious area, in which everybody has a responsibility to take action, is the disposal of unwanted medicines in family homes.  Such medicines are a crucial risk factor for young people, as has been well documented.  We must convey the important message that, where people suffer from conditions which sometimes carry frightening names such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or depression, these conditions are manageable, people can get on with their lives and there are effective and helpful treatments available.  We must ensure the stigma that undoubtedly continues to be associated with mental health issues is removed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The suicide statistics are shocking.  It is now the greatest cause of death among men and women under the age of 35 years on the island of Ireland.  While in recent years an average of 11,000 people have presented at hospitals following deliberate self-harm, the Irish Association of Suicidology believes this figure represents only the tip of the iceberg.  It believes the real figure for deliberate self-harm could be up to 60,000.  This is a huge number of people.  It is suggested that more than 25% of adolescents have had suicidal thoughts at <Col N="684"/>some point in their lives.  There is obviously a difference between having suicidal thoughts and deliberate self-harm or being at risk of suicide, but it is a serious epidemic.  For that reason it is important we are discussing it in the House today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">President McAleese gave a wonderful address about suicide in Killarney.  She said each statistic represents an untold story of loss, depression, social dislocation, breakdown in relationships, substance abuse, distress or some combination of those experiences.  Great credit is also due to the President for mentioning an issue that has not received a great deal of coverage in the context of its relationship with mental health issues or suicide, that is, the link between suicide, attempted suicide and sexual identity.  This is most important.  The Oireachtas committee which dealt with suicide prevention during the term of the last D&aacute;il noted that young homosexual people were far more at risk of suicide than their heterosexual peers.  This is an area to which we must be increasingly sensitive.  There is still a great deal of homophobic bullying in schools and we must challenge that behaviour and declare it unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Teachers, parents and everybody who has a role in education must address this issue.  It has not received the attention in the context of the suicide statistics that it deserves.</P>
        <P>Alcohol and drug abuse are also important.  The Minister should pay particular attention to the emerging research on cannabis and drug use in general and mental health issues.  There is disturbing new information from new, well documented research on the sequelae of drug use where mental health is concerned.  For vulnerable young people where there might be a predisposition to depression or mental health difficulties, drug use can precipitate serious mental health problems.  We should ensure that more people are exposed to the research and understand what it means.  The Minister should examine this and ensure the information is disseminated to a wider audience.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael has made a number of proposals on this issue but I do not have sufficient time to discuss them.  Suffice to point out that support services for young people are critical, while the waiting lists for child and adolescent psychiatry must be addressed.  Last week I informed the House that 159 young people are still being admitted to adult mental health facilities and adult psychiatric wards.  This is unacceptable; it is not the way our mental health services should respond to young people in need.</P>
        <P>Clearly, cross-party support is required to ensure the best prevention methods are put in place.  In that spirit, I ask the Minister to give due and careful consideration to the proposals Fine Gael has made in this area.  I welcome this <Col N="685"/>debate.  There is a great deal of work to be done, culturally and socially, to create a climate in Ireland for discussing mental health issues and to give confidence to people who have had mental health difficulties to speak about them.  There is a long way to go, although there have been major improvements in recent times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad to facilitate the discussion on this crucial topic.  As he said, suicide knows no boundaries or barriers and will affect, in some way, many in our community.  Official figures indicate that between 400 and 500 people will die by suicide each year.  This is on a parallel with the number of citizens dying as a result of road traffic accidents.  Unofficially, many believe the actual incidence of death by suicide is higher.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of particular concern in the Irish context is the fact that men under 35 years account for approximately 40% of all Irish suicides.  Currently, the highest rate of suicide is found among young men in the age group 20-29 years.  This contrasts with most other countries where suicide is more frequently observed in older men.  Deliberate self-harm is also a significant problem, with more than 11,000 cases presenting to accident and emergency departments each year.  As the Minister said, &ldquo;Preventing suicide and reducing the rate of suicide is an issue that goes right to the heart of our efforts and policies to create a healthy, prosperous and socially inclusive Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">International evidence shows that reducing the suicide rate requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society &mdash; health and other professionals, social services, communities, community leaders and voluntary and statutory agencies.  Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention, can provide the strategic framework required for that collective effort.  The strategy builds on the work of the national task force on suicide and takes account of the important strategic and operational initiatives developed by the former health boards.  A fundamental aim of the strategy is to prevent suicide and deliberate self-harm and reduce levels of suicidal ideation in the general population by addressing the contributory factors.  It also aims to ensure those affected by a suicide or deliberate self-harm can receive the most caring and helpful response possible.  It recognises the importance of valuing the mental health and well-being of the whole population, ensuring that mental illness is more widely understood and offering effective support to those who are experiencing difficulties.  It aims to be evidence based, drawing, where possible, on published scientific research and the experience of those working in suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>An excellent initiative to mark the launch of this strategy was the establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  Interim targets for the office include a 10% reduction in <Col N="686"/>suicide and a 5% reduction in repeated self-harm by 2010, with a further 5% reduction in self-harm by 2016.  I ask the Minister of State to consider these targets with a view to achieving a larger reduction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The questions, suggestions and comments I put to the Minister of State concern the four levels of action that were identified by the strategy as the means of achieving its overall aims.  Those levels of action have been categorised by the national strategy as a general population approach; a targeted approach; responding to suicide; and information and research.  In considering the general population and the targeted approaches, it goes without saying that improving access to quality mental health services is an essential part of any suicide prevention strategy.  Considerable improvements have been made in these areas but more remains to be done.  It is essential that implementation of A Vision of Change, the national mental health framework, is completed as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE&rsquo;s recent advertising campaign is to be commended for seeking to promote greater awareness of mental health and more openness in discussing difficulties and seeking help.  However, as we cultivate an environment in which people can speak openly of mental health difficulties and decrease the stigma attached to experiencing those difficulties, it is essential that we ensure a<Insert>n a</Insert>dequate response and treatment opportunities and services are in place.  The goals of encouraging people to come forward by decreasing stigma and providing mental health services must complement each other.</P>
        <P>Our schools also have a crucial role to play in promoting from an early age the importance of maintaining good mental health.  Modules such as social, personal and health education make a crucial contribution in this regard.  Other fora which can contribute significantly to the normalisation of mental health discussions include colleges, businesses, employers and Government sponsored programmes such as Youthreach.  An allocation of &euro;1.85 million has been made this year to develop and implement national training programmes and complete the availability of self-harm services through accident and emergency departments.  I would appreciate an update from the Minister of State regarding the progress of this training and the people accessing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The strategy recognises the necessity for addressing other contributory factors and specifically identifies drugs and alcohol.  As previously noted, it is essential that strategies for the prevention and treatment of drug use and alcohol abuse complement each other.  We can clearly see in our communities the links between the use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol, particularly among the younger population.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to recent research which identified the additional dangers associated with the use of drugs.  Similar research has been available for a number of years but perhaps it did not receive the recognition it <Col N="687"/>deserved.  It is of concern that several drugs which are considered soft or less dangerous in fact constitute significant risks and, in some situations, can act as environmental triggers for the onset of mental illness.  It is important that awareness is raised on this issue in the context of possible campaigns for decriminalising softer drugs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In seeking to ensure adequate and fast responses to suicide ideation and the development of fast track priority referral systems from primary care to community based mental health services, a number of pilot projects have been funded through the national strategy.  One such pilot project is being implemented by Cluan Mhuire services in my own area.  This project currently serves a specific catchment area but I ask the Minister of State to consider its expansion and similar projects from a catchment area to a regional basis.  Restrictions to catchment areas may result in insufficient demand and, particularly within urban areas, can prevent the promotion of such services if knowledge of their existence is limited to local general practitioners.  The Cluan Mhuire pilot project operates until 7 p.m. during working days and is not available during weekends or bank holidays.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Expanding such services regionally may provide the capacity to ensure their availability on a 24-hours a day, seven days a week basis, thereby reflecting a more realistic whole life experience of suicidal ideation.  Furthermore, expansion to a regional basis would allow for the open promotion, advertisement and, most importantly, knowledge of such response services to extend beyond GP practices.  This is particularly important in the context of research which indicates that a significant number of people who take their own life do not come into regular contact with the health service.  A recent study found that the last visit of a patient to a GP prior to committing suicide was either in excess of one year or unknown.  This illustrates the importance of ensuring that knowledge of services for people with suicidal ideation is available through a variety of channels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the allocation of additional funding specifically for suicide prevention initiatives and the establishment of a suicide review group.  I ask the Minister of State to commission research into the reasons for the variance between Irish and international figures regarding men who take their own lives.  Internationally, the prevalence is higher among older men but within Ireland the reverse applies.  I suggest that monitoring continue of what appears to be an emerging trend of young Irish women taking their own lives.  Research should also be conducted into deaths by suicide in the past 24 months in order to establish the extent of contact with the pilot projects in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome the recent innovations on utilising new technology such as text services, I am concerned about the accessibility of sites <Col N="688"/>which provide people with information on taking their lives.  I welcome the proposed establishment of an office for Internet safety.  I ask the Minister of State to consult his colleagues with a view to determining what international collaboration can be undertaken in regard to Internet safety.  It appears that many of these websites operate from other countries and are not Irish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deaths by suicide result in considerable distress, grief and loss and the number of such deaths may exceed that pertaining to road traffic accidents.  In tackling the carnage on our roads we have harnessed a national determination to reduce such deaths.  I ask the Minister of State to note the determination of this Chamber to play its role in reducing the number of deaths through suicide.  I urge him to continue with the implementation of the national strategy, take on board the constructive comments in this Chamber and seek to harness a national determination to reduce such tragic instances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek to share time with Senator Pearse Doherty.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the initiative of taking these statements but I hope the matter goes further because this is a serious problem.  I also welcome the fact that we have progressed from a time when we thought there was no suicide in Ireland.  The subject was covered up and we used to cock a snook, so to speak, at Sweden and criticise liberal, Protestant northern European countries where people supposedly commit suicide like lemmings.  Now we know some of what is happening with regard to suicide in Ireland and this is a hopeful development because facing reality is the first step.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation regarding suicide is nightmarish for individuals who feel they must end their lives.  This is especially clear on wonderful days such as this when everything looks so beautiful in places like Merrion Square.  The idea that a person can be driven to such despair that he or she would seek to end his or her experience of this world is terrible.  The impact on families is crushing and they often blame themselves.  Further services should be provided in this respect.  Copycat suicides are frightful and seem contagious.  I know of a family of which three members committed suicide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The elephant in the room regarding a debate on suicide in Ireland was mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald.  I am glad she did so, but I wish there were more references.  One of the most significant elements in suicide is the issue of sexual orientation and sexual identity.  I honour President McAleese for her recent passionate speech in County Kerry in which she referred to this matter.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[Homosexuality for young gay men] is a discovery, not a decision and for many it is a discovery which is made against a backdrop where ... they have long encountered anti-gay atti<Col N="689"/>tudes which will do little to help them deal openly and healthily with their own sexuality.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">As the multiplier effect relating to suicide is significant for young gay people and is an established fact, I will outline supporting research, of which I hope the Minister of State is aware.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State said &lsquo;Reach Out &mdash; National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 states: &ldquo;Information on suicidal behaviour is vital in order to guide the planning of effective services and supports&rdquo;.'  That is correct, but does the Minister of State possess such information?  Does he have such information with regard to young gay people, who are more vulnerable to suicide by a multiplier of six?  If so, what is he doing about the situation?  Why was it that it was left to Belong To, the gay youth group, to contact the Minister of State&rsquo;s organisation to be included in the survey?  That is what I mean when I refer to the elephant in the room.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This issue is not about some old weirdo from North Great George&rsquo;s Street with a background in Trinity College.  I was contacted by the wonderful Doherty family in Donegal who asked me to raise this matter.  They had a marvellous young son, Alan Doherty, who was 32 years old and had been bullied in school because he was gay.  He wanted to become a priest but was told that he could not do so by the church and was later shunned by some members of it.  He moved to England, had a relationship that dissolved, found balance and returned to Ireland.  Within a short time of coming back and successfully running an art gallery, he was taunted by schoolchildren and others on the streets of his home town.  He killed himself shortly thereafter.  His family wrote to me and asked me to raise the issue and I was the only Member of either House who replied to them, which is shameful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must acknowledge this problem, examine it and look at the relevant research and statistics because it is very worrying.  Belong To is a remarkable group that produced some information for me on young people who access its services.  Such young people are concerned at being bullied and victimised in their schools and communities.  They perceive a lack of peer support and fear communicating the problem to family members so that, unlike other minority youths, they may not receive support from such a source.  Regarding education, they see a lack of inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexuality in existing school programmes.  They feel poor self-image can be a consequence of negative societal attitudes to their sexual identities and may internalise homophobia owing to their experiences of it.  They will see homophobia in school and the church.</P>
        <P>I wrote in the Irish newspapers about the homophobic diatribes of the then Cardinal Ratzinger that created an intimidating storm.  I was approached in this regard, in a work context, by a decent young man who I did not even know <Col N="690"/>was gay.  He told me not to let anyone stop me speaking out because when he was 19 years old such stuff was read from the pulpit of his church and caused him to try to kill himself.  He said he would be dead but that his mother found him in time.  He asked me not to stop speaking out because nobody else would.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a great deal of homophobic bullying in schools and teachers are aware of it but do not respond.  In this regard, is it appropriate that the State funds schools controlled by a church that has shown itself unworthy of working in the area owing to its handling of serious child abuse while simultaneously engaging in homophobic attacks from the pulpit?  The church was given an exemption from equality legislation by a mealy-mouthed Government.  In light of the Ferns Report, it is important that we examine whether that exemption should continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school of education studies at Dublin City University, DCU, conducted a study that found that 94% of social, personal and health education, SPHE, teachers in single sex schools and 82% in co-educational schools were aware of verbal homophobic bullying in their schools.  The study also found that 25% of these teachers in single sex schools and 17% in co-educational schools were aware of instances of physical homophobic bullying.  In the study, 90% of teachers indicated that there was no mention of gay and lesbian related bullying in their schools&rsquo; bullying policies.  This is a catastrophic failure because we know there is such bullying, we know the terms of abuse, we know it can be both verbal and physical and we know that the teachers know this and do nothing about it.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department to address this situation as a matter of urgency if we are serious about suicide, especially when one considers the multiplier effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My old university, Trinity College Dublin, conducted a study that found that 50% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth had been bullied at school in the past three months, which compares with 16% of the general youth population.  Of this group, 76% had experienced verbal abuse, 39% had experienced physical abuse and one in ten had left education earlier than they would have wished.  This is an appalling situation and we know that, regarding suicide, there is at least a sixfold multiplier effect for young gay people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These figures are reflected outside the State.  An American study and a Northern Ireland study also lie behind what I have quoted.  The Government must research this area because we have done no research so far.  Helen McNamee&rsquo;s study of 2006 from Northern Ireland found that more than one quarter of young gay respondents had attempted suicide, of whom 70.8% had attempted suicide more than once.  Almost three quarters of respondents had thought about taking their own lives, 80.5% of whom said it was related to same sex attraction.  Almost one third had self-harmed, <Col N="691"/>64.4% of whom said it was related to same sex attraction and over one third had been diagnosed with a mental health problem, the most frequent diagnosis being depression.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the House, in light of this catastrophic situation, not to just sit or make speeches.  We know there are young, vulnerable people being bullied in our schools and people being driven to the point of suicide.  We can do something about the situation, but we must stop being mealy-mouthed.  We must stand up to the bullies, not only those in the schoolyard, but also those in the churches.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.  He outlined the state of emergency with regard to suicide.  He referred to a young lad from Donegal, Alan Doherty.  Unfortunately, there are too many Alan Dohertys throughout the 32 counties who are not with us today because, for one reason or another, they have taken their own lives.  One of my concerns is that the Government is not doing enough to put in place supports to fund suicide prevention initiatives throughout the State.  Alan Doherty is an example.  After his death a fund was set up to help communities address some of the issues relating to suicide prevention.  Does the Minister really believe we are taking the issue seriously, when we only have an investment of &euro;8 million per year for suicide prevention?  We need to go much further.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Government suicide prevention strategy in as far as it goes.  However, very little has changed since the mental health commission annual report for 2004 showed the Government was falling far short of international obligations.  That report highlighted the lack of services, the under-resourcing of existing services, poor management, a wide variation in clinical practice across the State and inconsistency in service availability between regions.  It is a system in need of fundamental change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The high level of suicide in Irish society was again confirmed by the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, published a year ago.  That report was particularly critical of the state of our mental health services.  It points out that people with mental health illnesses are known to be at greater risk of death by suicide, but notes that the type of mental health service one can access is a matter of luck.  It goes on to say that funding for mental health services is allocated in a random manner, with scant regard for need.  In the context of suicide, the most damning comment of all is the assertion that the provision of mental health services for adolescents is high on aspiration, but low on action.  This is a severe indictment of the State&rsquo;s management of our health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The same is true with regard to the conclusion that despite 11,000 admissions to accident and emergency units each year, following suicidal <Col N="692"/>behaviour, we have not yet put in place swift and appropriate standardised interventions to treat this high risk group, thereby reducing repeat acts.  The Government and the Executive in the North must take on board all the findings of the joint committee.  The report makes 33 detailed and costed recommendations for covering increased public awareness and improving mental health services, especially at primary care level and in targeting those most at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that Government assistance is given to support networks for families affected by suicide.  This point was made at a seminar on suicide prevention organised at Stormont by the Sinn F&eacute;in president, Gerry Adams, last month.  Bereaved families participated in that seminar, as did members of other political parties from this House.  Sinn F&eacute;in has identified suicide as a priority area, requiring concerted co-operation between the Governments North and South, the health services, the voluntary sector and communities.  We have made a number of policy recommendations which the Government needs to take on board.  We must all act together and work collectively to target this emergency in society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the priority policy proposals is that we look at suicide prevention as an area of co-operation under the all-Ireland Ministerial Council to give the issue the strategic co-ordination it requires.  We must frame and implement a fully resourced, comprehensive all-Ireland suicide prevention strategy, including actions to promote mental health among the general population, and deliver it through the schools, youth services, workplaces and the media.  We must develop mental health promotion actions targeting specific sections of the population, incorporating their needs into tailored suicide prevention sub-strategies, and develop mental health promotion and suicide prevention actions targeting groups identified at higher risk of suicide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to see action to assist individuals identified as being at risk of suicide and those bereaved through suicide.  We need to see investment in further clinical and community based research on suicide prevention and develop national mental health awareness and anti-stigma campaigns to help tackle the issue of suicide.  We need to include the people at risk of suicide in all of this.  We must also include the families of people bereaved by suicide and of those at risk of suicide in policy making on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We agree with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on its call for targets to be set for a reduction of the rates of suicide in the country.  Unfortunately, County Donegal has witnessed a high level of suicide, particularly among those of my age group, young males.  We need to work collectively to address the issue and get to the root of the problem.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is welcome, but it needs to go much further.  Senator Norris asked whether we were going to take the issue seriously.  If we are only <Col N="693"/>going to spend &euro;8 million per year on suicide prevention, the answer is we are not taking it seriously.  I ask the Minister to take on board the recommendations my party and I have made, with those of other Members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, to the House and thank him for his presentation.  I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the important issue of suicide and the adequacy of the Government&rsquo;s current strategy on suicide prevention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Doherty used the word "emergency" in the context of suicide.  It is increasingly clear that suicide is an urgent public health issue and a serious problem.  Senator Corrigan mentioned the true statistics for those who die by suicide here each year, somewhere between 400 and 500.  The research I have looked at suggests the figure for recognised suicides is close to 500.  It is a grim statistic that this number of people choose to end their lives through suicide.  Ireland has the fifth highest youth suicide rate in the European Union.  Suicide accounted for 22% of all deaths in the ten to 17 years age group in 2004.  The phenomenon of this increasing level of suicide has a marked impact on our young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are marked gender differences in the levels of suicide.  Men under 35 years of age make up 40% of all suicide deaths, which is a fact we cannot ignore when trying to make an adequate response to the issue.  Some 11,000 cases of deliberate self-harm are seen in hospitals every year, 21% of which are repeat acts.  However, many of those presenting in these cases do not receive any form of psychiatric assessment or aftercare.  This is something to which we must attend.  We must not allow them leave hospital to rejoin the community without some form of aftercare.  Half of the 800 drownings that occurred in the Republic of Ireland between 2000 and 2005 were attributed to suicide.  We can only guess at the number of suicide attempts involved in single vehicle crashes that result in death or injury.  The statistics are grim and compelling and we need to take the issue seriously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In examining the impact of suicide on society we must not just look at the individual impact.  When an individual chooses to take his or her life through suicide, the immediate impact is on the family and the extended family.  Having been a member of the Bray Suicide Support Group, I am very aware of the recovery process for families who are left grieving and in denial about the fact that one of their family members may have chosen to end his or her life.  It is a long and tortuous process requiring high levels of support, the right information and advice at the right times and the integration of other services.  The Coroner Service was mentioned earlier, as was the long period many families bereaved by suicide must wait until the inquest when all of the issues surrounding the death of the family member <Col N="694"/>through suicide are raised and gone through in a forensic way.  That is very difficult for the family members.  We must try to design those services in such a way as to minimise the negative impact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As well as the families we must mention the peers.  We have talked about young people.  We can only imagine the impact on the network of peers of any young person who chooses to end his or her life through suicide.  Young people engage in copycat suicides, and the phenomenon has been recognised.  When one member of a gang or a group of young people decides to end his or her life through suicide, it has a powerful effect on that individual&rsquo;s peers, and we can expect to see more of that in coming years.  Unless we can design the right kind of prevention strategies, young people will emulate each other&rsquo;s behaviour and go on to attempt suicide themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We cannot ignore the fact that there is also a wide impact on the community.  For every person who chooses to end his or her life through suicide it has a wider impact on all of us who register that death because, in a sense, it is a verdict on a wider society.  If we find there is a growing trend towards young people, especially young men, choosing to end their lives through suicide, that is in some way a reflection on the society in which they live.  We must examine the kind of society in which we live where there are dominant, consumerist, market-led values and where life, in a sense, is not valued in the same way as it used to be.</P>
        <P>When we were much less a competitive society dominated by the issue of economic growth, we had more time for each other and for building community.  Religion was stronger in society and we placed a much greater value on each individual human life.  With the secularisation of society, there is not a sufficiently robust value system to help and comfort young people who sometimes struggle with serious existential issues.  As a community and society, we must examine how we can change that and promote a different value system to allow us to help young people to recognise that even when they are going through psychological difficulties and experiencing extreme psychological distress, their lives have a value and that it is worth seeking help.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are problems in the system.  As we discuss the strategy &mdash; it is positive that we have a national suicide prevention strategy, the National Office for Suicide Prevention and a comprehensive programme &mdash; we must recognise that we must put more funding into our mental health services.  It has halved in the past 15 years.  We must at least double the amount we are spending on our mental health services.  I hope that by having this debate and recognising suicide as a priority for attention, it will encourage all of us in government and in opposition to support the increase in the mental health budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well with his brief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Suicide is the single most distressing subject of our time.  To take their own lives people must overcome that tremendous urge everyone has to live.  People must be so overcome with despair that they see no other option.  It overcomes all their instincts &mdash; personal, familial and parental &mdash; and the option of suicide takes on the appearance of a viable alternative.  That is desperately difficult for us to understand, yet approximately 500 people every year succeed in doing it.</P>
        <P>Some commentators claim that those who take their own lives are selfish, that suicide is a selfish act. Those who suggest that fail, at a fundamental level, to understand the nature of suicide.  They are simply wrong.  Suicide is a difficult and complex issue and our society&rsquo;s challenge is to find a solution that will bring about a meaningful intervention for those at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a public health problem, suicide is recognised as one of the most intractable issues we face.  Fifteen out of every 100,000 people die by suicide each year.  The highest rates are reported in the 15 to 24 and 24 to 44 age groups, while youth suicide in Ireland is ranked fifth highest in the 25 countries of the European Union.  Male suicides exceed those of females in this age group by a factor of 7:1.  Behind those stark figures lie the personal stories of 500 Irish people, their families, friends and communities.</P>
        <P>We appear to be a society in crisis, yet we appear to be in denial as well.  I acknowledge the work of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I note the range of pilot activities throughout the country, which are welcome, but I despair at the pitiful budget we allocate to suicide prevention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005, there were 399 deaths on our roads and &euro;29.45 million was spent by the Department of Transport on road safety initiatives.  That was very welcome but when we compare that figure with the &euro;500,000 spent on suicide prevention in the same year in which 431 people died by suicide, it shames us and confirms to me that we are in denial.  Money will not solve everything &mdash; it never did &mdash; but without resources we will achieve nothing.</P>
        <P>In 2006, &euro;1.8 million was allocated for the purpose of suicide prevention.  In Scotland, with an annual rate of suicide of 600, &pound;18 million sterling was allocated over three years to support a similar strategy.  We must increase our spending to achieve real results and demonstrate that we, as a society, are serious when we speak of suicide prevention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Suicide is a complex issue, a point made by many speakers this afternoon, and if there were easy answers, we would find them.  The causes are multifaceted and involve an interaction of biological, psychological, social and environmental risk factors.  More than 100 years ago, a French sociologist, Emile Durkheim, identified the sense of detachment from society, which he called <i>ano<Col N="696"/>mie</i>, as a major risk factor.  Today, as our society undergoes immense change, statistics show that between 1980 and 2002 the rate of suicide in Ireland doubled, something mentioned by other speakers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a link between mental illness and suicide but it cannot be definitely stated that mental illness is the cause of all suicides.  Figures suggest that the majority of those who completed suicides had no prior contact with the mental health services.  One recent study has shown that of those who completed suicide in Ireland, 33% had been known to be referred to the mental health services at some point, of whom less than half had been diagnosed as suffering from a depressive illness.  That is not to deny the reality that depressive illness is a major risk factor in suicide.  We must remember that two thirds of people who are depressed do not consult their general practitioner while just 8% contact mental health service providers. Those figures clearly point to a difficulty in accessing mental health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We recognise the historical under-investment in the mental health services, especially in suicide prevention, and we see that people are reluctant to access or have difficulty in accessing the existing services.  We must also see that changes at societal level have seen a doubling of suicide rates in 20 years.  We have put in place the National Office for Suicide Prevention and suicide prevention strategies.  That is a good start but I am not convinced we are doing enough to tackle the problem.  When depressive illness and suicidal ideation are such individual and personal experiences, we can ask the despairing question of what to do and where to start in seeking an answer.</P>
        <P>There is a wide recognition that the problem has its source in society, yet our response seems to be primarily medical in nature.  While it is undeniable that there is a major role for the health services to play in the prevention and response to suicide, perhaps we are overly reliant on the medical model.  When 55% of those who die by suicide do so at their first attempt, medical attention is obviously too late.  We must seek the answer in the problems faced by individuals in society and put in place a structure where the response is not just medical but embraces a wide range of other disciplines where high risk groups and individuals are identified and interventions can be made before it is too late.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are familiar with the heart-wrenching story of the young man &mdash; it is disproportionately young men &mdash; who successfully completed suicide.  He had been behaving as he normally behaved but was found dead by his distraught parents.  What had happened to that young man who had taken his own life?  We may never know but we cannot just console his parents, wring our hands and say that it was one of those things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every town and village has been visited by the spectre of suicide.  Every person here knows someone who ended his or her own life.  That ter<Col N="697"/>rible figure of 500 people every year represents 500 sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, our friends and, God help us, our family members.  It is time for us as a society to take responsibility for this problem and as politicians we have a role to play.  It is up to us to give priority to the issue of suicide and we need to place it at the top of the political agenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can see in the story of the young man who took his life that there were no indicators that he was about to do so.  Nobody had noticed that he was harbouring those darkest of thoughts and the first realisation came when he was found dead.  It is clear that society failed this young man.  There was no medical response to his needs whether the services were available, and if we had the most sophisticated health service in the world it would have made no difference.  It is time for us to make a difference now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to make a suggestion, which might form part of the solution.  Currently, some 11 resource officers are employed by the HSE with responsibility for implementing the suicide prevention strategy.  In an ideal world we would have a resource officer in every population centre.  Let us expand the role and create the position of community support officer with particular responsibility for suicide prevention.  Let us place this community support officer in each town, thus creating structures that mirror those of the public health nurse network.  Let us pilot this scheme in a particular area.  To illustrate the idea, I could cite the case of Tipperary as I know the area so well but I will not be parochial.  The community support officer could be based in community office space and the role would involve liaising with schools, youth groups, voluntary bodies, sports clubs and all other formal and informal networks within the community.  The officer&rsquo;s role might also involve liaising with GPs, public health nurses, community mental health nurses and community leaders.  The community support officer would not replace health professionals but would complement their role.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A colleague recently told me that in his town there were four incidents of self-harm among young people in a three-month period earlier this year.  Fortunately, none was successful but it really was a case of mere good fortune.  This town is the location of a large mental health facility which employs 150 fully trained, highly experienced and dedicated mental health nurses.  Not alone did the local mental health service have no response to these crises, it was also unaware of them until after the event.  The GP was not aware of them either and they had not been picked up on in school.  There seems to be no prism through which these events could have been seen sooner, so something is terribly wrong.  A community support officer immersed in the community and working within local social networks might have provided an early warning system in these cases and perhaps also in the case of the young man about whom I spoke.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P Just="Left">Let us take a cold and unpleasant look at the economic cost of suicide.  It is estimated by the National Office for Suicide Prevention that the human and indirect costs of suicide in Ireland amounted to &euro;871.5 million in 2001.  Actuarial studies indicate a much greater economic cost given the young age of so many of the victims.  While it is distasteful to refer to an economic cost in this context, it is necessary in order to illustrate the need fully to resource suicide prevention strategies.  The provision of a community support officer on a pilot basis in, for example, four or five towns would cost only a fraction of the aforementioned figure.  It is not an expensive idea when one considers that one cannot put a cost on a life.  I do not know if the proposal is practicable, but I ask the Minister of State to examine it.  I am available to discuss the matter further at his convenience.  It remains to be seen whether the plan would be effective, but it is worth trying given that anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests mental health services are failing to reduce the incidence of suicide.  I propose the introduction of a pilot scheme along the lines I have outlined and I thank the Minister of State for his attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I greatly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  We should continue to highlight the issue, rather than considering that our commitment has been achieved by concluding the debate today.  In the past, society tended to sweep the suicide issue under the carpet, which led to it being stigmatised.  Recently, a mother whose son is suffering from depression told me that if he was suffering from cancer or some other disease, counselling and other help would be available.  However, as depression is a mental health issue she cannot obtain the required support.  In essence, she feels stigmatised as the mother of someone suffering from depression.  The stigma is such that it can drive family members to despair, as well as the person who is depressed.</P>
        <P>In the past, not enough was done by society to discuss the high rate of suicide here, which is one of the highest in Europe.  Suicide is one of the biggest killers of young people and young men in particular.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, must put this to the forefront in dealing with such health matters.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to the House.  He is the right man for the job and is seriously committed to placing suicide at the top of the political agenda.  Our party&rsquo;s spokesperson, Senator Corrigan, will diligently deal with this serious issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Previous speakers have referred to the figure of 500 people per year committing suicide in the Twenty-six Counties.  Behind every such tragic tale there is a grieving family.  Recent evidence has shown that children as young as six are now attempting to take their own lives.  In addition, they are being taught how to do so by sinister <Col N="699"/>websites that have been mentioned.  All of this indicates that we are dealing with a national crisis.  I welcome the Reach Out programme but we need to go further by putting in place prevention strategies, with the required services.  We should ringfence an appropriate part of the health budget for mental health to guarantee sufficient resources to revamp the suicide prevention strategy.  To this end, community-based initiatives must be expanded as they are making a real impact.  In addition, further investment is needed in clinical and community-based research on suicide prevention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A public awareness campaign is required to highlight the dangers of Internet websites.  However, sites such as Bebo and MySpace do have a role to play in promoting and highlighting services to help young people when faced with such problems in their lives.  Parents need to be aware of these sites and should know what their children are viewing on the Internet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the work that has been done so far by the Reach Out programme.  While I congratulate the Minister on opening the first centre for the prevention of suicide and self-harm this year, we should now try to establish such centres in every county.  Pieta House, the community-based facility in Lucan, County Dublin, is doing sterling work.  Its aim is to assist the growing number of people affected by suicide.  I was speaking to the director of that facility last week and it is clear that we need such centres in every county.  Whether they are to be provided by the State, grants should be made available to groups that wish to establish such facilities.  Perhaps we can liaise with local authorities in providing such accommodation in premises that are currently not in use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Suicide statistics are stark.  Worldwide, more people die by suicide than murder or war.  In Ireland, approximately 600 people take their lives annually.  The official figure is 500, as has been stated, but there are far more cases that we do not know about.  These include people who die in road traffic accidents, but we will never know for sure.  That is why research is vital in getting to the nub of the reasons for suicide.  Some 11,000 people per annum currently present themselves to accident and emergency units having deliberately harmed themselves.  It is believed that approximately 70,000 people deliberately harm themselves but do not seek medical attention as a result.  A far greater number have suicidal thoughts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most recent figures that I have obtained for my own county of Wexford are frightening.  From 1990 to 2000, approximately 163 deaths by suicide were registered by the Central Statistics Office, which is much above the national average.  During the same period, many more people were admitted to the accident and emergency unit at Wexford General Hospital as a result of self-harm.  The figures speak for themselves.  We have <Col N="700"/>had many upsetting, high profile cases in the county, which have been well documented by local and national media.  In the aftermath of such cases, people are frustrated and fearful, although trying to help but not knowing exactly what to do.  In considering pilot projects, there is no more deserving county than Wexford and I am not being parochial in saying so.  Wexford Creamery is holding its Halloween milk run to raise money for the suicide prevention group Aware.  That move is to be welcomed but it shows the extent of the problem when the business community feels obliged to become involved at a local level.  More people die by suicide than in road traffic accidents, yet large sums of money are pumped into road safety campaigns.  We need to make people aware of the research to help secure appropriate funding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senators Fitzgerald and Norris that sexual orientation is a cause of suicide, especially among young men.  We need to consider how to bring community facilities to these people.  Drug and alcohol abuse, bullying, workplace stress, money problems, social pressure, isolation, loneliness and being unable to contact support are other causes of suicide.  Mental health problems are only one factor.  While the Samaritans play a strong role it is sometimes necessary to have a community base, a person who is continually available.  As a politician I often feel I am that person which proves that a community contact is vital in addition to the excellent role played by the Samaritans which must continue.  Ringfenced money needs to be invested in providing a helpline in every county, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Suicide affects every part of society and where it occurs in clusters it bereaves families, friends, neighbours and communities, leaving a legacy of hurt, confusion, insecurity and fear.  It is said that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Even one suicide is one too many and a failure of society.  We need to focus our energies on this crisis and I urge the Minister of State to redouble his efforts to tackle it.</P>

        <P Just="Left">There is no comparison between the amounts of money rightly being spent on road safety, and on suicide prevention.  This is a disgrace and shows a lack of seriousness in dealing with this problem in recent years.</P>
        <P>There are 96 recommendations in Reach Out and the Minister of State will be judged on the progress he makes in implementing them.  We look forward to a further debate on mental health and suicide a few years from now, to see how much progress we have made.

	<P Just="Left">The first time I heard of suicide was when as a young man I heard that Kurt Cobain had taken his life.  In his suicide note he wrote that it was &ldquo;better to burn out than to fade away&rdquo;.  Many young men in our society learn about suicide through popular culture.  We must examine how that knowledge is disseminated through Internet sites and music lyrics and act accordingly.  I encourage the Minister of State to come down heavily on groups and websites which do not take their responsibilities seriously enough.  While I know this is a problem for young women, there are too many young men who see these sites in an unregulated environment and receive the worst possible education and information on this subject.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The vulnerability of men and women who leave school between the ages of 16 and 18 increases intensely once they have fallen out of the network.  I encourage the Minister of State to work with the National Educational Welfare Board and ensure that it has adequate resources.</P>

I agree with Senator Cummins that we should have more time for the debate.  If the House wishes to have the debate in the future, I would be pleased to return.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While my brief encompasses disability and mental health I have priorities.  I am targeting suicide prevention in the mental health area.  Suicide is a multi-factoral problem for which there is neither a simple cause nor answer.  I have noted the points made by each speaker but wish to deal with them globally first.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has adopted A Vision for Change as policy but speakers are right to say that its rate of implementation is slow.  That is why my predecessor set up an implementation body to assess its progress and report annually. <Col N="702"/> The first report was published last May.  I recently met the chairperson of the implementation body, Dr. Ruth Barrington.  The next report is not due until January 2008 but I may not receive it before April or May.  That is too long to wait and I have asked the chairperson to furnish an interim report.  This is an issue on which we must all push for progress under the terms of A Vision for Change.  I will be delighted to discuss the interim report with Senators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has long been a stigma attached to mental health and silence about suicide.  When I was a general practitioner, my colleagues and I noticed that suicide was swept under the carpet.  I was pleased to launch the mental health awareness campaign two weeks ago.  This aims to make the community aware that we all have mental health and must not discuss it only in negative terms.  Most of the time most of us have positive mental health, but unfortunately for some people it is negative.  Research shows quite conclusively that if when people feel down or blue they are prepared to talk to their friends, family or workmates it will help their overall situation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Internet is a problem. Many of the sites are provided from outside the country and there are issues in international law.  I am hoping to meet some of the service providers in the near future, but they are service providers in this country.  Most, if not all, of them are very responsible and we will be looking to them for help in solving this problem.  However, when it comes from outside the country, there are obviously issues that we might not be able to ease, but we will work on them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some speakers also referred to the issue of funding, to which there are two aspects.  The first is related to suicide prevention.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention was established in 2005.  Its budget for 2007 is approximately &euro;8 million, which is roughly a 30% increase on 2006, itself a 25% increase on 2005.  I would love if more money were allocated for suicide prevention and when the new budget is announced next December, I hope that will happen, but that is dependent on the Minister for Finance and the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second aspect relates to mental health in general.  One speaker made the point that the percentage spend on mental health has been reduced.  That is true but it must be considered in the context of the amount of money that was being spent specifically on mental health.  The money spent in 2007 is close to &euro;1 billion, which is an enormous amount of money compared with the amount spent in 1997.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Prendergast referred to a community support officer, which is a very interesting idea which I would be happy to discuss in more depth with the Senator.  Senator McFadden referred to the course in Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training, or ASIST.  I congratulate her on taking this excellent two-day course, which is part of the <Col N="703"/>Reach Out programme and organised by the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot solve the problem of suicide here today &mdash; neither can Members &mdash; but everybody in Ireland working together can help reduce the rate.  Reference was made to the actual rate.  I agree the official rate probably does not reflect the true figure.  Unfortunately, deaths were recorded with the term causes unknown or other causes, which is not a true reflection.  I am committed to doing my part and I will be very happy if we reach the Government target of a 5% reduction in the suicide rate by 2010.  That is a huge challenge and I would love to see it bettered.</P>
        <P>I thank Members who have contributed and the House for affording me the opportunity to speak today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: </P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the Government for its commitment to lifelong learning and upskilling;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends its commitment to implementing the national skills strategy and improving accessibility to further education; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />endorses the Government objectives set out in the social partnership document Towards 2016, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the national action plan for social inclusion which identify in particular the benefits of further education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu.  T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm go bhfuil an Teachta Haughey freagrach as c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais, foghlaim fad-saoil, an c&oacute;ras iompair do phaisin&eacute;ir&iacute; scoile agus, ar nd&oacute;igh, an cl&aacute;r oibre don &oacute;ige.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil a intinn agus a chro&iacute; istigh san &aacute;bhar sin agus go bhfuil s&eacute; ag deanamh jab maith thar ceann an Rialtais.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Deputy Haughey is certainly a very able Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, working diligently to promote the issues of lifelong learning, youth work and school transport.  I am delighted to move the motion.</P>
        <P>Provision for the educational needs of adults who wish to study outside the higher education sector is the responsibility of two Departments, namely, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.  The principal target groups for the further education section in the Department of Education and Science are young early school leavers; school leavers who, on completion of <Col N="704"/>senior cycle in post-primary, want additional education and training which will provide them with an alternative route to employment and-or higher education; adults who left school without qualifications and who are seeking a second chance in education in a variety of settings and contexts, including formal, non-formal and informal; as well as labour market entrants and re-entrants who want to upskill and gain accreditation.</P>
        <P>Further education provision addresses the educational needs of all adult learners, but it particularly addresses the needs of disadvantaged groups, including Travellers, the unemployed, lone parents, migrants, the disabled, adults with less than an upper secondary education, recipients of welfare benefits and people in employment with low skills.  It aims to give adult learners a second-chance education in a non-threatening environment that is centred on the learner.  The suite of available programmes provides learners with options that cater for their particular needs.  Further education aims to ensure that adults have the knowledge, skills and competence to partake in a socially cohesive society and be actively involved as participants in our knowledge economy, where everyone has access to lifelong learning and opportunities to upskill.  Further education plays a central role in promoting people&rsquo;s life chances in the context of lifelong learning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lifelong learning programme will be a cornerstone in enabling Irish participants to engage in the pursuit of continued education and training on a lifelong basis.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme can only enhance and contribute to the development of a knowledge-based economy.</P>
        <P>An adult education guidance initiative is available to support existing and potential learners.  It provides them with the knowledge and advice to make informed decisions and choose programmes that will address their particular needs.  Support towards the cost of child care is also available and will enable learners with child care responsibilities to re-embark on their lifelong learning journeys.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Distinct features of further education include its learner-centred approach, diversity and breadth of provision and linkages with other services such as employment, training, other educational institutions, welfare, youth, area partnerships and schools, as well as the justice, community and voluntary sectors.  A wide range of governmental and non-governmental organisations are involved in the provision of services for students participating in further education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This issue also falls within the remit of the aforementioned Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It aims to invest further in training those in employment, targeting low- skilled workers especially.  Two key agencies, namely, F&Aacute;S and Skillnets, work to maintain and increase the investment in the training of the employed.  The overall objective is to ensure the provisions for the development across the economy of skills that match anticipated requirements <Col N="705"/>provide a co-ordinated, user-friendly and easily accessible system of workplace learning and upskilling, and are geared to employability and competitiveness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">F&Aacute;S and Skillnets have a number of key initiatives focusing on specific areas of educational development and the provision of opportunities for those with lower skill sets.  Towards 2016, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the national action plan for social inclusion all allow for an expansion of the programmes, which will result in a more flexible and appropriate means of delivery.</P>
        <P>The further education sector will receive unprecedented levels of funding in 2007.  The allocation of &euro;169 million constitutes an increase of &euro;19 million, or 12%, on the 2006 provision and I commend the Minister of State in this respect.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s social partnership agreement, Towards 2016: Ten-Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, the further education sector received 1,000 additional places for Youthreach in 2008, 7,000 additional places in adult literacy by 2009, 2,000 additional places in the back to education initiative by 2009, and additional funding for the development of the post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses sector.</P>
        <P>The Department can continue to be proactive in ensuring the services provided are those most appropriate to addressing the needs of the learners through working partnership arrangements with key players such as the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, the 33 vocational education committees, VECs, the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and AONTAS.  It is worth mentioning the 33 VECs that serve education in Ireland to commend them on their ongoing commitment to education and the approach they take.  In particular, I commend the work of the County Donegal VEC and its chief executive, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Long&aacute;in, who is to the forefront in developing further education initiatives in Donegal in conjunction with the Department.</P>
        <P>Through partnership, those with the lowest levels of educational achievement will be targeted and encouraged to re-engage in learning in order that they can move along the lifelong learning spectrum and, in the process, gain the knowledge skills, competence and confidence to become active citizens in their own knowledge communities and to adapt to the changing labour market, thereby becoming key participants in the knowledge economy.  Such a dual approach will ensure Ireland will achieve social cohesion and will become globally competitive, thereby achieving the Lisbon Agenda goal.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, in October 2003 has created a single coherent award system for learners.  The framework is a structure of ten levels that facilitates access, transfer and progression by learners in a highly transparent manner.  It enables and encourages all learners to achieve <Col N="706"/>accreditation throughout their lives at a level that is appropriate to them.  Awards at NFQ levels one to six are available to adult learners from the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, upon successful completion of validated programmes.</P>
        <P>The report of the expert group on future skills needs published in 2007, Tomorrow&rsquo;s Skills: Towards a National Skills Strategy, has set out its vision to 2020 of the skills profile needed for our knowledge economy.  For Ireland to remain competitive in a global market, the group emphasises that the skills levels of the current workforce must be enhanced.  It notes that by 2020, 7% of the labour force should have an education equivalent of NFQ levels one to three, 45% should be at levels four to five and the remaining 48% should have achieved qualifications at levels six to ten. The participation of learners in the suite of programmes available in the further education sector will assist in enabling this vision to be realised, especially at levels one to six.</P>
        <P>Improved participation by adults in lifelong learning has two purposes.  It benefits the learners and enables them to become active citizens in a socially cohesive society.  Moreover, it allows adults to improve their skills through participation in different further education programmes.  This is also good for the economy as it enhances the learner&rsquo;s employment prospects.  In addition, it has a social and personal development dimension.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Increasing participation by adults in further education has been highlighted in Towards 2016: Ten-Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015.  It has also been described in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, which states that for people of working age, &ldquo;top priorities will be to address the low literacy levels of the Irish adult population and the large numbers of Irish adults who have not completed upper second-level education&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government emphasises the development, provision and funding of further education.  The Government is playing a pivotal role in allowing citizens to obtain second-chance education where it was not freely available to them.  I acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s input in this regard.  From speaking to participants in such programmes, I understand it is enormously advantageous and beneficial to them in terms of self-confidence, gaining alternative or better employment and their future life prospects.  I commend the motion to the House and thank the Minister of State for his attendance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  Thomas Jefferson, when speaking as President of the United States, stated that &ldquo;If [one] expects [people] to be ignorant and free ... [one] expects what never was and never will be.&rdquo;  This was true in his time and remains true today.  While his remarks were made in the context of remaining free from foreign domination, education is still <Col N="707"/>the key to freedom.  It constitutes the freedom to achieve a better future for individuals, families, communities and the nation.  Many people mistakenly consider education to be the key to continued economic prosperity.  While this is the case, it is far more than that.  Although it brings economic success, the education system, be it preschool, primary, secondary or third level, education towards a knowledge-based economy or towards lifelong learning, is not simply for the creation of workers and improvements in the gross national product.  It also pertains to creating better and active citizens who will contribute to a better community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Education will be improved beyond all recognition through social partnership as outlined in the Towards 2016 document.  The education system that obtained in Ireland in 1916, which was rightly described as &ldquo;the murder machine&rdquo; by Patrick Pearse, will be gone forever.  I commend the Government on its introduction of the civic, social and political education, CSPE, programme.  While this programme is not perfect, it is a step towards creating a generation of more rounded students and a system based not just on points or results achieved in examinations.  The implementation of the national skills strategy is a vital part of our future.  If it has not been implemented by 2020, we will have a continued shortage of third level degree holders, a deficit of 139,000 third level certificate and ordinary degree holders and a surplus of lower educational levels with a large number of low-skilled individuals who will be underemployed or inactive.  Globalisation requires a flexible workforce.  Ireland is a small, open economy, and we must be able to respond to changes in the world economy and the technological environment.  Only a well educated population is able to respond in this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The objectives as set out in the national skills strategy, the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the national action plan for social inclusion and the social partnership document, Towards 2016, will result in improved education and training and will also yield a social dividend, with better social cohesion and public health and reduced poverty, crime and social welfare dependency.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />put in place clear mechanisms for the implementation of the National Skills Strategy.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House, as this is my first time to meet him.  I am pleased that the Fianna F&aacute;il Members have tabled this motion.  Adult education and lifelong learning have for too long been the poor relations in the education sector.  As the evidence will show, the Government cannot justifiably be proud of its record in this area.  In preparation for this debate I spoke to numerous providers, including the National Adult Literacy Agency, Galway City and County VECs, the Irish Vocational Education Association, the umbrella body for VECs, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and the Educational Research Centre in Dublin.  The outcomes of these discussions were damning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will first deal with the area of investment in literacy education for adults.  I know these learners as I have worked with them.  As Mark Daly said, literacy is their only chance of freedom.  It also improves their chances of finding employment and increasing their own confidence.  It is their passport to independence.  Currently, investment in adult education and literacy budgets is inadequate to meet the established needs as documented by VECs nationally.  The current low levels of literacy reinforce the poverty trap.  Last year Galway County Council, in its poverty profile, estimated that 29,000 learners needed help with literacy but that only 4% to 5% of these receive it.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The VECs in Galway are bursting at the seams with the demand.  Their budgets are so tight they must refuse ten hours of tuition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1996, the international adult literacy survey, IALS, was conducted in this country.  This showed that 25% or one quarter of the adult population had significant literacy difficulties.  Is <Col N="709"/>it not odd that no further assessment has taken place since, despite the fact that this was promised in the White Paper on Adult Education in 2000?  What is the basis for the distribution of funding suggested by the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, since they do not have up-to-date information?  It is clear from talking to providers that more and more people are presenting with literacy needs.  This is good.  In addition, more people are arriving in this country with language and literacy needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2007, the Government committed &euro;30 million towards the budget for adult literacy, of which &euro;26 million went to VECs, covering about 40,000 learners with an average of two hours&rsquo; tuition each week.  The other &euro;3 million or so went to F&Aacute;S for the workplace education budget.  However, &euro;10 million of the total budget will go to ESOL, English for speakers of other languages.  Thus, the real commitment to literacy is about &euro;20 million.  The area is still very under-resourced.  County Galway VEC, of which I was the chairperson two years ago, is to receive &euro;430,000 for adult literacy programmes, but it needs two and a half times that budget to meet the needs it knows of, which will require in the region of &euro;1 million.  Last year the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science stated in its report that the budget needed to be quintupled from &euro;20 million to &euro;100 million, with increases of 27% each year, to meet the targets set out in its recommendations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During my discussions with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, it was suggested that students who drop out at second level or do not progress to third level should be entitled to 180 credits of free higher education &mdash; in other words, a three-year course &mdash; as is the right of any other citizen.  This is something we should seriously consider.  The problem is that because these students would be part-time, they would not qualify for free fees.  This is discrimination.   I call on the Minister of State to consider the provision of a voucher system that would enable every citizen to have three years of free higher education whenever they wished to cash in their vouchers.  This would be a wonderful initiative as it would address many of our current needs in the area of upskilling, which the previous speakers identified as being important.  Some 650,000 people have qualifications at junior certificate level or lower, of whom 10% have no qualifications at all.  The proposed voucher system would go a long way towards addressing that need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My second point is the Government&rsquo;s lack of investment in ESOL and teachers in this area, TESOL.  This is having a negative impact on integration in Irish society.  Everyone agrees that integration is a major issue, but the area is fraught with difficulties.  For example, the 2006 census shows that 250,000 people come from non-English speaking countries.  The Minister of State has committed only &euro;10 million to these people.  As I said, this is the tip of the iceberg.  The <Col N="710"/>benefits of investing in this area would include better integration of the new Irish into society, elimination of so-called white flight from our schools and continued economic growth and opportunities for creativity and mutual gain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My final point concerns the area in which I condemn the Government the most.  I am stunned by the line in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion concerning investment in education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This has been the Government&rsquo;s greatest failure, as can be seen from the education and employment outcomes.  What are the problems we see in socially disadvantaged environments?  Children have difficulties in securing school places.  Attendance in school, examination results and attention levels are poor.  A total of 20% of second level students are underperforming.  This is a national statistic and is therefore averaged over all environments.  In disadvantaged areas the number is far higher.  Why is this?  It is because the adults in these areas are not equipped to help their own children at school.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I carried out research in this area when I was working in a third level college.  My results showed that adults in disadvantaged environments have great intentions, but they are not consistent.  Literacy is intergenerational.  The problem continues from one generation to another, and we will not break this cycle unless we invest in lifelong learning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of lifelong learning and adult education, the overall numbers are very bad for the Government.  The report card on measures of investment in adult literacy, English language classes for speakers of other languages and education in socially disadvantaged environments shows that the Government has failed.  This is its opportunity to make a change.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I remind Senators to use the title &ldquo;Senator&rdquo; when referring to other Members of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&iacute;or f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis.  Ar shon Fhine Gael, t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm an leas&uacute; seo a mholadh.</P>
        <P>I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  Senator Daly gave us a good quotation at the beginning of his remarks.  We should take cognisance of where we stand.  A couple of weeks ago the chief executive of Tesco, Sir Terry Leahy, warned that low standards of literacy and numeracy among the young have left the British economy more exposed to competition from countries like India and China.  In many ways we in this country face a similar situation.</P><Col N="711"/>
        <P Just="Left">I speak as a director of adult education in my previous incarnation where I was involved in the provision of adult education in encouraging people back to education.  Empowerment through education is the key.  We will share common ground in that regard.  Access to education of all types for all is important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is against that background that my party has put forward our amendment, which recognises &ldquo;that of the current workforce of 1.43 million, 440,000 have at most lower secondary education, including 165,000 aged 35 or less&rdquo;.  I will begin by looking at the provision of third level education for adult and part-time students.  Thankfully, there are no fees for full-time students but there is a barrier for mature students who wish to return to full-time education where they must pay fees for third level courses.  That anomaly should be immediately rectified.  I ask the Minister of State to take a look at it.  The cost barrier is a strong one for many trying to attend third level and while the Government motion has listed a plethora of achievements, in one aspect it is just pure rhetoric.  The treatment of part-time students and mature students is not reflected in the motion.  If we take the Government motion as suggested, then the Government should commit itself to lifelong learning and upskilling people by making these third level course fees free.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national objective, to ensure that of those attending third level 5% will come from among the disadvantaged and 15% will be mature students, is not being attained.  In some universities the achievement is significantly less than the national target despite all the rhetoric about access to third level education.  In essence the national targets are not being met.  I suggest that the targets in the case of mature students are quite modest by international standards.  According to the OECD report Education at a Glance 2007, our spending on all aspects of primary, post-primary and third level education is less than the OECD average.  That is hardly commendable in the context of the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This morning in the <i>Irish Independent</i> the director general of F&Aacute;S, Mr. Roddy Molloy, issued a strong warning to all of us on the need to upskill our people and the facts facing the economy.  What action have we taken or seen on the national skills strategy, outlined as Government policy?  Participation by Irish adults in ongoing education and training remains low, at 8%, in comparison with other EU countries.  In addition, one third of our workforce have at most lower second level education, of whom 165,000 are below the age of 35.  In the context of the national skills strategy, over 500,000 have level three &mdash; junior certificate &mdash; education or less, of whom 10% have no qualifications, which is frightening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The White Paper calling for the upskilling of the workforce has never been properly addressed.  At policy level there is a need for greater har<Col N="712"/>mony and co-operation between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science, which should be working together to create a changing emphasis and pattern regarding third level and access to upskilling of our people.</P>
        <P>The national development plan identified significant investment regarding the upskilling of our workforce.  The figure involved is &euro;2.8 billion, although I am open to correction.  In the context of the Estimates, there is only &euro;3 million in the education fund for F&Aacute;S.  Will the Minister of State honour the commitment or will we see more cuts in the Estimates in the provision of funding for upskilling and access to education?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to expand the national qualifications framework.  If I might dwell on that in the context of FETAC, I am all for the national framework of qualifications awards, which are an excellent concept.  It has brought all of them in under the one umbrella but, as somebody who has been very involved in the implementation of this and in the day-to-day running of it, I see some anomalies which need to be addressed regarding the on-line use of FETAC.  In that context, I ask the Minister of State to provide more resources for FETAC to allow easier access to the website to input examination results and to input the names of students for examination.  The FETAC members of staff are second to none and are accessible, but we need to make it easier for providers of adult education to become involved in the FETAC awards scheme.</P>
        <P>We seem to have created another tier of bureaucracy with the FETAC award schemes.  I do not wish to denigrate FETAC, but we need to make it easier for providers to entice people to take up these courses and to make it more enjoyable for the provider to engage with people.  In my experience it has turned people off taking on FETAC courses in the community and voluntary sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of our amendment, there is a need to put in place a framework for the implementation of the strategy, for greater co-operation and harmony between the Departments, and to look at the skills strategic vision as outlined through F&Aacute;S because there seems to be a deficit.  It is a worrying concern.  Reading the remarks this morning by Mr. Molloy, one would wonder if the picture painted by Members on the opposite side of the House is different from that which we all face.  There has been a great deal of work done and there has been significant investment, but then we have lived in a cash cow economy, although that has now changed.  Participation levels are not as good as they should be and are below the OECD average.  There are people who are encountering barriers to participation.  We are not enticing people to participate as much as we should.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We on this side of the House recognise and will support any efforts and enticements to people to upskill, to participate in further education and <Col N="713"/>training, but there is a need for meaningful implementation of strategies and resourcing which are not evident.  There is much rhetoric but there is a need for action.  The figures speak for themselves.  I commend the Fine Gael amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on tabling this motion on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, on his appointment as spokesperson on lifelong learning, and on his comprehensive understanding of all aspects of further education and upskilling as seen in his contribution.  I also thank Senator Daly for seconding the motion and for outlining the value of education and upskilling for society and the economy.  I will deal with the contributions of Senators Healy Eames and Buttimer in the course of my contribution.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to reflect on recent progress and provide an overview of the direction and developments that will take place in the important area of adult and further education over the term of this Government.  In June, my brief was extended to include lifelong learning which introduced a cross-departmental role between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The education and training sectors have now been amalgamated under the lifelong learning agenda.  This will allow me to determine the best policy, in the light of views from both Departments.  This move strongly reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to lifelong learning and recognition of the changing economic horizon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an exciting time for adult and further education.  There is a growing awareness that education should be a lifelong process.  Gone are the days when one was considered to be fully educated when formal schooling ended.  We must now ensure the skills and knowledge of our population can keep pace with a fast changing world.  The quality of our education system is the key success factor in the transformation of the economy into one of the most successful economies in the world.  Ireland&rsquo;s sustained investment in high quality second level education and the exceptional expansion in third level enrolment have been the critical drivers of our outstanding economic success and social progress.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A strong focus on lifelong learning and training, combined with increased levels of investment in research, technology and innovation, will be key factors in maintaining our competitiveness in a constantly changing global environment.  This will require an ever increasing number of graduates qualified to the highest international standards, interlinked with a proactive lifelong learning strategy for all citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principal objectives of programmes in the further education sector are to meet the needs of young early school leavers; to provide vocational education and training opportunities for labour <Col N="714"/>market entrants and re-entrants and alternative pathways to higher education; and to provide second-chance education for adults.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A suite of Government-funded full-time and part-time programmes are available within the adult and further education sector attaining to each of these goals.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill outlined these in detail.  They include Youthreach, the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, senior Traveller training centres and post-leaving certificate courses, PLCs, which are all full-time initiatives.  Part-time programmes are available to accommodate those who have other commitments to fulfil.  Community education, evening classes and adult literacy programmes are a big part of this sector.</P>
        <P>Of all the disadvantages people face, problems with literacy and numeracy can have the most profound effect in preventing individuals from leading a fulfilling life and from participating in their community and wider society.  Adult literacy has been the top priority in adult education for some years now and it is singled out in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to respond to the criticism made by Senator Healy Eames.  An increase of &euro;7.4 million, or 21%, in the budget for adult literacy and community education was provided this year.  This increase has allowed for 3,000 additional literacy places this year and will bring expenditure up to &euro;30 million.  Approximately 4,000 additional places will be available up to 2009, bringing the total to 42,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Great efforts have been made, in conjunction with stakeholders, to promote equality of access to education, especially for people whose initial experiences may have been discouraging.  Family literacy groups, involving adults and their children, are running successfully.  A family literacy initiative is being developed under DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, an action plan in educational inclusion.  In 2006, a new intensive tuition in adult basic education, ITABE, programme commenced within the VECs.  There are also a number of schemes targeted at people with special literacy needs.  To cater for the literacy and basic education needs of immigrant groups, classes in English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, are funded through the adult literacy budget.  In 2006, 12,000 students availed of tuition in English under the English for speakers of other languages programme, comprising 30% of participants in adult literacy programmes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is separate funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has engaged consultants to examine the language <Col N="715"/>needs of migrants and they will report shortly.  New measures in that regard will be brought forward in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should provide a separate stream of funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>These matters are being examined in the Department with the assistance of outside consultants.  I agree the issue requires to be carefully examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national skills strategy made the recommendation that literacy and numeracy development should be embedded in all publicly funded programmes and sets out an economic imperative for the upskilling of workers with low or no qualifications.  We must adhere to this.  The back to education initiative, BTEI, involves the provision of programmes on a part-time basis.  The BTEI plays a key role both in addressing the needs of those with minimal or no educational qualifications, and in providing for those who wish to upgrade their skills in line with emerging needs.  An increase of &euro;1.35 million for the expansion of part-time options under this programme is being provided in 2007.  The recent introduction of FETAC qualification levels one to two is also an important move in this regard.  This development will particularly assist those partaking of adult basic education programmes.</P>
        <P>I note the comments of Senator Buttimer on FETAC.  Sanction has been given to that body for a comprehensive new computer system which will deal with many of the issues he raised.  The provision of financial and guidance supports is critical if we are to encourage people to take advantage of the schemes on offer and help adults overcome the obstacles preventing them from making the decision to return to education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The adult educational guidance initiative is one initiative in that regard.  Annual grants are given to VECs towards the cost of child care support for those partaking of full-time programmes such as Youthreach, senior Traveller training centres and VTOS.  Extra finance has been provided this year to extend child care support to the back to education initiative, a part-time programme.  An increase in funding will be provided for child care in 2007.</P>
        <P>To underpin the significant progress made in recent years in second-chance, adult and continuing education, the Government has provided increased funding on an annual basis.  As Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, my aim is to achieve a strong further education sector which is fully recognised, staffed, structured and resourced and which is treated on a par with first, second and third level education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government fully realises that to sustain our economic growth we must continue to invest in the skills of our workforce.  We must ensure <Col N="716"/>we have the necessary blend of skills required to succeed as a knowledge-based economy.  As Senators stated, Ireland is competing in an ever increasing global competitive marketplace, where the key to success is establishing competitive advantage.  Despite our recent economic feats, we cannot afford to become complacent.  We must constantly review our education and training provision to ensure we are meeting the needs of industry and the economy.  We must prepare for the future by taking action today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Accordingly, we must encourage greater participation in lifelong learning by facilitating and motivating employees to increase their skill levels and qualifications, to acquire new skills and knowledge in different areas and to renew existing skills to stay abreast of technology and other developments.  This is something on which the Government has been focusing in recent years and it will continue to do so.  In 2007, the Government will invest approximately &euro;70 million in the provision of training programmes for those in employment.  Senators will agree our commitment is clear if we compare this to the &euro;8 million that was the equivalent State investment in 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s key providers for the provision of training for those in employment are F&Aacute;S and Skillnets.  F&Aacute;S, through its One Step Up programme, aims to encourage employees to increase their competency levels and promote an ethos of lifelong learning in the workplace.  This will ensure skill and qualification levels match present and future human resource requirements for continuous economic growth and competitive advantage.  It will also enable employees to cope with frequent and ongoing changes in the workplace.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Skillnets, on the other hand, is an enterprise-led support body whose mission is to enhance the skills of people in employment in industry to support competitiveness and employability.  It is funded from the national training fund and its stakeholders include leading employer and employee representative bodies.  Between them, F&Aacute;S and Skillnets will provide training for approximately 55,000 people this year.  In accordance with Government commitments contained in the Towards 2016 agreement, F&Aacute;S and Skillnets have been instructed to focus on the provision of training for the low skilled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted to state that on foot of this direction last month, the F&Aacute;S board gave approval to enter into six strategic alliances with representatives of the trade union sector to support employment prospects through raising skills levels, especially through training those with low skills levels or in vulnerable employment.  These strategic alliances will provide training for almost 3,500 people at a cost of &euro;8.8 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was because of the importance of education and skills for Ireland&rsquo;s economic development that the expert group on future skills needs was convened to undertake comprehensive research to underpin the development of a national skills <Col N="717"/>strategy.  This report sets out clear objectives for developing Ireland&rsquo;s human capital through upskilling, training and education up to 2020.  Delivering on these objectives will ensure our education and training systems meet the skills requirements of the economy.</P>
        <P>The national skills strategy is not a stand-alone policy initiative.  Instead, it builds on existing Government policy such as the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the national development plan, in which the Government entered into specific commitments aimed at upskilling the workforce.  The national skills strategy also complements the vital strategy for science, innovation and technology which was launched by the Government last year.  These publications support skills development from the foundation level to the very highest academic level.  Together, these four documents have set the agenda and objectives for what Ireland must achieve in the medium term if it is to maintain and enhance the living standards of its citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In an ever increasing global marketplace, the Government is committed to ensuring Ireland continues to embrace its transition to a dynamic, knowledge-based economy.  The objectives contained in the expert group&rsquo;s report have provided us with a road map that will assist us in achieving our potential.  The Government is determined to achieve the vision contained in the report, for which it has already initiated an implementation process.</P>
        <P>While the State has a key role to play in achieving the vision contained in the national skills strategy, enterprises and individuals also need to play a major role.  The expert group on future skills needs is examining specific measures to spur employers and employees to engage in training and education, which is a significant challenge.  Proposed initiatives include paid learning leave, individual learning accounts, tax measures, brokerage services and the possible establishment of regional skills advisory groups.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise needs to identify and articulate clearly its short and long-term skills needs.  These must be proactively communicated to education and training providers at regional, sectoral and national level.  Enterprise also needs to work in collaboration with providers in developing programmes which respond to those needs.  Individuals need to recognise the benefits further education and training can provide them for both their career and personal development, and they must also have the initiative and commitment to undertake these programmes.  This will require having confidence in investing time and money in their own future.  Only by taking co-ordinated action through this three-pronged approach can we hope to realise the vision contained in the national skills strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed to the development and maintenance of a high quality education and training system which is democratically managed, publicly accountable and <Col N="718"/>provides opportunities for learning on a lifelong basis.  Equality of access and participation, relevance and quality assurance are the cornerstones of our educational policy.  The cross-departmental element of my brief puts emphasis on the education and training spheres at Government level.  The Government has undertaken to develop the further education sector in line with the recommendations set out in the national skills strategy.  Much remains to be achieved in the adult and further education sector which has huge potential.  I look forward to maximising this potential to the benefit of everyone involved.</P>

	<P>Lifelong learning relates to everybody &mdash; everybody matters.  It has to do with the learning of each person from cradle to grave.  This motion could have considered how the Government is performing in a range of sectors but it clearly refers to the adult learning experience.  There may be a need to widen the context of the debate at some other time but the focus in this debate should be on the adult learner.  I wish to speak in particular from my experience as a lecturer at third level in the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and to examine some of the trends as they affect those who teach and learn as part-timers and lifelong learners returning to student life.</P>
        <P>The central role of lifelong learning was outlined in the European Commission&rsquo;s 1994 White Paper on competitiveness, which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Preparation for life in tomorrow&rsquo;s world cannot be satisfied by a once-and-for-all acquisition of knowledge and know-how ... All measures must therefore necessarily be based on the concept of developing, generalising and systematising lifelong learning and continuing training.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">There has been a plethora of reports and documents, from the 1995 White Paper, Charting our Education Future, to the report of the task force on lifelong learning in 2002.  More recently, in 2004, the OECD reaffirmed the importance of lifelong learning to the economy and its future success, a link which is ever present.  In a speech in 2005, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, stated: &ldquo;The education system as a whole must serve the needs and aspirations of each individual and must also promote the well-being and cohesion of the communities and societies.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">Lifelong learning is universally endorsed in Ireland.  However, when we turn to policy development and implementation, the picture is much less clear.  Any real developments that have taken place in Ireland have been in the area of <Col N="719"/>vocational training where the Government can choose relatively familiar and uncontroversial measures.  This is because this area has particular legitimacy.  It is safe in political terms.  In respect of training for the unemployed in particular, there is an established area of direct intervention.  Much responsibility for implementation and delivery rests with relatively local actors such as vocational education colleges, employment offices and F&Aacute;S because there is the prospect for hard, short-term targets such as jobs found, qualifications gained or people trained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What we have had is increased funding at VEC and post-leaving certificate, PLC, level, that interim level between early or normal school leaving and the third level experience.  Whole structures have been created for the engagement of lifelong learning in each county, with career guidance counsellors and so on being available.  The VEC has funding to provide free education in some cases and courses in everything from hairdressing to information and communications technology and literacy.  While applause may be deserved for this, the experience is different with regard to third level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has invested funding in skills training because it can show that X number of people have been put through IT courses such as ECDL and so on.  The problem is that it has invested nothing in the third level sector.  All part-time third level education is delivered on a cost recovery basis.  For example, if the institute where I teach wants to deliver a part-time course to students, it must recoup 100% of the cost of that course.  Therefore, the course is priced accordingly.  A market fee is charged as distinct from the normal capitation fee of &euro;600 to &euro;800 payable by a student, so a part-time learner might have to pay &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,700 per year.  Also, if institutions want to promote such courses, they must engage in the normal business practice of identifying courses in which people would be interested and then marketing them.  All of this ends up in the cost paid by the student.  Moreover, there is also the problem that while some of these courses are tax deductible, there is an inequity between the person earning at the higher tax rate and the person earning at the lower rate.  If we are serious about making part-time third level education part of the lifelong learning strategy, students should not have to pay more than the normal capitation fee.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">A further problem arises in this regard.  The absence of financial support for part-time third level education means that full-time lecturers are not appointed and has resulted in colleges training part-time lecturers on the hoof.  This creates a danger that courses may not be of the highest standard.</P>
        <P>When adults take time off work to engage in part-time learning, the process must work for them as they could otherwise be lost forever.  Where the system works, many of those involved <Col N="720"/>in part-time learning thrive and complete PhDs.  However, those lost to the system due to a failure to invest properly in the courses available to them will be lost forever.  This is bad for the economy.</P>
        <P>A report on inclusion in the United Kingdom was entitled Every Child Matters.  Our philosophy should be that every person matters, which would mean providing education at all levels, including third level, in an effort to get people to upskill and develop for the future economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, to the House.  A few years ago, I had the pleasure of offering promotion to a long-term employee of mine who rejected my offer because, as I later discovered, he could not read or write.  Having known the man for years, it came as a jolt to learn this.</P>
        <P>I support the motion even though it does not go far enough.  On that basis, perhaps I should support the Fine Gael Party amendment.  The motion strikes a note of complacency as opposed to urgency.  In other words, it seems to argue that everything is all right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been a long-time champion of lifelong learning for two reasons.  First, this form of education addresses the reality of modern life, namely, that the knowledge we acquire at school is insufficient given the advent of new technology and other developments.  We will fall behind if we do not continue to learn following school.  Second, I champion lifelong learning because, as the motion hints, it provides an opportunity for the less fortunate to catch up.  In these affluent times it is too easily forgotten that we have a hard core of long-term unemployed who, in many cases, cannot secure jobs because they have a lack of basic skills such as literacy.  At least the man to whom I referred had a job and had managed to hide his problem for many years.  Many others fail to find a first job.</P>
        <P>I make no apologies for repeating a point I made during last week&rsquo;s debate on competitiveness when I raised the IDA&rsquo;s efforts to attract overseas direct investment.  The question of investment in education is for me what the phrase <i>Carthago delenda est</i> was to Cato the Elder who repeated these words until Carthage was destroyed.  We need a quantum leap in the level of investment in all parts of the education system.  The calibre and skills of our people will depend on how much we invest in education but not nearly enough is being invested to realise our aspirations.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><P>Investment in education must not be increased in line with increases in Government spending in other areas.  It is not sufficient to place education at the top of the queue each year when the various Departments do battle in the run-up to the publication of the Estimates.  The radical increase we need in educational investment cannot be delivered incrementally but must be provided in one fell swoop.  The OECD used the term &ldquo;quan<Col N="721"/>tum leap&rdquo; to describe what was needed in this regard.  This is not just a soundbite but describes exactly what is required.  Treating the problem with the seriousness it deserves means making education our most important national priority and being prepared to provide proper funding for it before we begin to consider other demands on resources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two weeks ago I attended a conference in Venice at which Queen Noor of Jordan and other speakers addressed the topic of education.  Queen Noor argued that in trying to solve world hunger, the best investment one can make is in educating women because so many women around the world do not receive an education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>She stated that while this may not solve the problem of hunger this year, women who have received an education will be able to educate their children.  Education is not given the recognition it deserves in terms of the opportunities it provides to solve problems domestically and around the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Investment in education must be made a priority if we are to succeed in meeting our national aspirations.  Current policies do not reflect this position and educational expenditure is not adequately prioritised in the national development plan.  Either we begin to recognise that education is our first national priority or the money we are pouring into building new roads and other physical infrastructure will be largely wasted.  The only way we will be able to successfully compete in the world of tomorrow is through the quality of our people.  We must pay a high price to achieve this objective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For some years, I had the rewarding task of chairing the leaving certificate applied committee.  This examination was introduced because too many people were being left behind in the education system.  By the time those who find themselves at the back of the class at age seven, eight or nine years reach 14 or 15 years they discover they are unable to catch up.  The leaving certificate applied was brilliant because it operated on the basis that instead of measuring intelligence in a three-hour examination at the end of sixth year, it would nurture other skills and types of intelligence.  The objective was to avoid leaving people behind as currently occurs in the education system.  We need lifelong learning both for those who have been left behind and for those who have received a good education as it enables them to improve their skills as they go through life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and commend the Government on the support it has given to lifelong learning.  The integration between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is a welcome development as it helps integrate and amalgamate the education and training sectors and ensures proper co-ordination between <Col N="722"/>the Departments in their efforts to promote the various aspects of lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s strong emphasis on the importance of lifelong learning in promoting economic growth and ensuring workers are in a position to adjust to the demands of a changing economy.  While these are valid reasons for supporting a policy of lifelong learning, preparing citizens for the knowledge economy to which we aspire is not the only compelling reason for promoting such a policy.  Lifelong learning has a very important role to play in personal development which also provides a guarantee of social inclusion.  Despite their best efforts, those who have not attained acceptable levels of functional literacy are excluded in many important ways from full participation in society.  Lifelong learning helps to develop skills and competencies across a range of areas and means people are more likely to feel they are personally effective.</P>
        <P>Earlier, the House debated the unfortunate phenomenon of suicide.  When people feel competent and able and have had an opportunity to develop their skills to their full potential, it is less likely they will feel the sense of alienation or lack of belonging which sometimes contributes to psychological distress.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government on the approach it has taken.  Several indicators demonstrate its sincere commitment to a policy of lifelong learning.  The Minister of State referred to a 21% increase in the budget for adult literacy and community education this year, while the national development plan has committed &euro;2.2 billion towards further education, with particular priority being given to further education for those with low literacy levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Functional literacy presents a significant challenge.  Despite considerable investment in adult literacy services, an estimated one in four citizens experiences basic literacy problems that affect activities such as shopping, reading newspapers, filling in essential forms, etc.  We must address this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the national development plan's commitment to reducing the levels of illiteracy and low literacy in primary schools from 30% to 15%.  While we can set general objectives, it is important to set clear targets to measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;how we are doing and what we are achieving.</P>
        <P>I welcome the White Paper on Adult Education&rsquo;s extension of the remit of adult literacy services to cover asylum seekers.  Significant pressure is placed on those services because many non-English speaking individuals try to access the courses.  As it is estimated that 27% of adult literacy learners are non-English speakers, we must develop a clear policy.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government and statutory bodies on their roles in promoting adult literacy.  For example, An Post sponsored a television and cinema campaign that promoted adult literacy, <Col N="723"/>featuring people who went through and benefited from the programmes in question.  Adult literacy courses will attract considerable interest from those who may have previously been reluctant to take up such offers.  This will put pressure on the services but we must continue to provide sufficient resources to meet need, as stated on the other side of the House.</P>
        <P>It is important to continue upskilling workers.  Conditions within certain sectors of the economy are changing significantly.  For example, the construction industry experienced a good decade, but circumstances are changing.  Some individuals may seek to upskill and move into different sectors.  We must give people the opportunity to upskill and undergo appropriate training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the elimination of back to education fees in respect of participants with a junior certificate education or lower.  If they are part-time workers, they can avail of the back to education initiative without paying fees, which is a positive development.</P>
        <P>Unlike 15 other EU countries examined, Ireland has no statutory entitlement to paid educational leave.  We should consider this matter.  Other European countries have successful upskilling programmes and are good at keeping workers&rsquo; skills updated.  We must examine policies that have worked elsewhere.  As a developed economy, Ireland should consider a statutory entitlement to paid educational leave.</P>
        <P>Computer and information technology skills have become prerequisites for most forms of employment.  Often people who start with functional literacy problems have difficulty acquiring computer and information technology skills.  The Government should place considerable emphasis on this matter to ensure all workers develop basic computer skills, an essential requirement in the workplace regardless of the job.  More resources should be targeted in this respect.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Government on its approach to lifelong learning and I look forward to further improvements.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The global economy is forcing many western countries to examine how to remain affluent.  For many years, we have known that industries such as textiles and manufacturing are moving east.  Until recently, we were under the illusion that IT companies would remain here, but they have begun moving east, creating problems for Ireland in terms of retaining jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Education was a key reason for so many multinationals moving to this country, namely, we are an educated English-speaking people.  Countries in the developing world have learned from us.  For example, China and India can offer similar skill sets to ours at a lower cost.  As the days pass, technology and those countries change, we must ensure that we change.  If we cannot keep up with other countries, we may lose much of what we <Col N="724"/>gained in recent decades.  To stay strong, we must continue to value and invest in our education system.  Our goal must be to ensure no one leaves these shores to find work.</P>
        <P>Issues of taxation, employment law and enterprise must be dealt with, but this debate is on education and we must address a number of priorities.  For example, we must examine the matters of adult literacy, how to keep children in school for as long as possible, how to engender a greater sense of business awareness among schoolchildren and how to encourage lifelong learning and upskilling.</P>
        <P>It is of concern that, according to recent figures from the Department of Education and Science, up to 40% of children in disadvantaged areas suffer some form of literacy disadvantage and 60% have considerable difficulty with basic mathematics.  The last international adult literacy survey found that 500,000 Irish adults experience some form of reading, writing or mathematical difficulty.  Consequently, while we have invested additional money in adult literacy services, we must invest more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">CORI states that Government targets in respect of adult literacy are unambitious, illogical and unacceptable.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current target is to reduce illiteracy levels to between 10% and 15% of the population by 2016, meaning 500,000 will have basic literacy skills.  It is an unacceptable target and must be changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department has been advised of the Right to Read campaign which seeks to improve literacy among schoolchildren.  According to the campaign, it is important that children have room to learn in each family house.  It campaigns for larger apartments and for the housing guidelines to be changed to allow children more space in their homes.  I welcome Dublin City Council&rsquo;s recent attempt to introduce regulations that increase the size of apartment blocks.  This initiative should be extended throughout the country because children must be given space to learn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many children in Dublin are in homework clubs whereby they go to local libraries, learn with other children and share school experiences.  We must consider extending library hours throughout the country to enable as many children as possible to benefit from such clubs.  The earlier we intervene, the more likely it is that children will excel at primary and secondary school level and continue on to third level.</P>
        <P>It is important to retain children in the education system because many leave before they should.  Some 18% of children leave the system without any qualification, a figure that has remained stagnant since 1991.  On the County Meath coast, one out of every four children leaves school early.  Elsewhere, that figure can rise to 60%.  Our economy needs children to stay in school because it is their best hope of finding jobs and contributing to the Ireland of tomorrow.</P><Col N="725"/>
        <P>A school&rsquo;s quality is a factor.  It is unacceptable that some children go to class in toilets or converted gyms.  It is important that they be given the facilities they need to learn in comfort.  We should also examine locating classes close to where the students live to ensure parents can get involved in school through sports days or parent-teacher evenings.  The further a school is located from the family, the more difficult it is to involve the parents.  It is essential that parents are involved in the education of the child.</P>
        <P>We should examine extending the way we teach business in schools.  We must engender a better awareness of what it takes to run a business.  We must make it easier to set up businesses and encourage more people to establish businesses at home.  I would like a system whereby secondary school students are mentored by local business people to teach them what it is like to set up a business and to encourage them to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must make it easier for people to go back and study.  The Labour Party in government abolished third level fees and we must extend this.  We need to reach out to people in further education, many of whom attend classes at night and at their own expense.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has proposed the abolition of fees for approved part-time courses taken by people who do not already have a qualification and whose income is below the national average.</P>

	<P>These people need to be supported by us.  Everybody has the right to go back to school or college and upskill and learn new skills.  We must help middle-aged workers who are out of a job and give them the skills to take part in the information economy.  That is how we make our workforce stronger, retain multinationals located in this country and encourage new companies to come here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Ireland we spend 4.5% of our gross domestic product on education.  France and Austria spend 6% while Denmark spends 8%.  Limited education, access to education and quality of education will limit economic growth.  Spending more on education and constantly reviewing and improving the quality of our education system are the best ways to ensure a sound economic future for the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Private Members&rsquo; motion.  As a person who went to school when I was three and left the teaching environment at 27 when elected to Parliament, I have, perhaps, spent more time in school than I should have.  However I did some courses over the summer and would do more if I had the time because nobody can get enough education.  Education gives phenomenal empowerment.  To be able to continue to broaden one&rsquo;s horizons at any age is one of the most important things we can facilitate people to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A great deal is taking place.  Last year my mother, who has little experience of computers, took the opportunity to learn about them and <Col N="726"/>talks about doing her European computer driving licence, ECDL, course.  It is good for people of all generations to have opportunities.  Much of it is happening in the community where I live.  There is access to computer training.  Whether it is used for a job, social interaction or to be able to relate to one&rsquo;s children or grandchildren, all reasons for taking such training have validity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Preschool is important.  Although there is a child care debate on the change of schemes, grants and subventions, there is no debate on content in child care.  I am not talking about the mathematical syllabus but asking if there is a play value that will yield an educational value by teaching how to work together and engage with each other from the youngest age.  I will speak about mother and child bonding.  Lifelong learning must start at the very beginning, as it is said in &ldquo;The Sound of Music&rdquo;.  When I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I took on the issue of music therapy.  Another issue was mother and child bonding.  When children are not educationally focused, are not able to engage educationally or drop out of the education system, it can sometimes be traced back to the fact that the mother and child did not bond.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine the committee&rsquo;s report on music therapy which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The structured, non-verbal nature of many musical activities or improvisations can be very reassuring for families who have been engaged in verbal conflicts, and the delicate issues of control can be addressed.  Above all, relationships that have become mainly negative can again be seen in a more positive light as families rediscover the ability to have fun together through music making.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That might sound airy fairy when taken out of the context of the report.  It also states: &ldquo;Music therapy seems to enhance the bond between mother and child, enable mothers to gain new insights about their relationships with their children and in many cases improve the quality of life for the child and the mother&rdquo;.  If children get the best possible start, their ability to engage in formal education, whether at preschool or primary level, enhances their potential.  Then the need to intervene when they are aged eight, nine or ten might arise less frequently.  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, I am talking about budgets.  If we invest early, we might not have to invest later.  That is a worthwhile aspiration.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Early Education, Ready to Learn, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for children up to six years of age and also focuses on those with special needs or disability.  I encourage the Minister of State to think of lifelong learning as starting there and to work with other Ministers of State and the Minister for Education and Science to ensure this is prioritised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been great investment in the capital building programme, although it was criticised earlier in this debate.  In my area some places <Col N="727"/>aspired to new school buildings for decades, on which there has been a substantial move and to which I alluded in a debate on education earlier in this session.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business I mentioned the ESRI&rsquo;s report, Gearing Up for the Exam: The Experience of Junior Certificate Students, which was published today.  The domination of the State examination system and whether classes should be streamed are important issues.  I was in a secondary school where we were not streamed.  Mixed abilities shared classes and I found it useful.</P>
        <P>The debate on vocational versus academic training is large.  We all know some people are vocationally organised and some are educationally organised.  The two should not be mutually exclusive.  We have been training people in reading, writing and arithmetic to get them through exams, and if that becomes the exclusive goal too early, it will fail many students.  It merits a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">State exams should not be abolished or replaced entirely with continual assessment.  However, if the fun has gone out of learning, we must find a way to bring it back.  As a teacher I tried to ensure I made each subject as intelligible as possible to the students.  Some teachers do that, some will not.  Some are good at it, others are not.  I do not know of a simple solution but we should ensure every option is not closed down by the choices students make at the age of 12 or 13.</P>
        <P>Education should have a broad background.  One can get a job from the arts.  I did.  I got a bachelors and masters degrees and a teaching qualification.  There is a list of letters after my name the length of my arm.  However it also broadened my horizons and my ability to deal with matters.  It enabled me to stand in this Chamber and address a crowd.  That was not in the job description when I studied music but as a result of having to perform in front of people, I have acquired other skills.  People who are not involved in the arts do not see that the arts have a potential role beyond somebody being able to sing a song or write a piece of music.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Donegal is keenly aware of the need for lifelong learning.  Many of its children left school early to go into the textile industry which offered immediate jobs with good wages.  However, it collapsed and many people lost their jobs.  According to the last study of the subject, Donegal did not do well from the point of view of the people&rsquo;s educational qualifications.  I have spoken about this to many school principals.  They are a little concerned about the construction industry attracting male students from school too early.  We must keep our attention on that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people who have had to leave school early are anxious to get back into education.  I congratulate the Government on a number of initiatives and I congratulate communities on seeking to establish courses in their areas.  I launched a course recently in Clonmany, which is an outreach centre of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  A great deal is taking place but we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball.  It <Col N="728"/>is important to realise the importance of education and to remove the impediments facing people accessing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not fair of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP to claim in their manifestos that they oppose fees and then, when in government, impose fees which have prevented Donegal students from having the same free access to Northern colleges as they had in the past.  They tried to do the same with the higher and further education colleges but that was shot down on the basis of segregation, whereby they intended to charge students from this jurisdiction but not those from Northern Ireland.  The difficulty appears to be that the Northern fees apply to all students and, therefore, it cannot be called segregation.  However, if one states in a manifesto that there will be no fees and one subsequently introduces them, one is preventing access to education.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Doherty advocate on behalf of students in the Republic with regard to when their grants should be paid.  I would be happy if my student constituents in Donegal were still able to do as I did &mdash; go to the University of Ulster or other colleges without having to pay fees.  If the Minister of State wishes to put pen to paper about this matter for the Northern Executive, I would be pleased to offer him support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Fianna F&aacute;il group on tabling this motion.  The most important thing one can have in life is a good education.  As previous speakers have said, education never stops.  While formal education might stop, it does not mean one&rsquo;s ability or hunger to learn should stop.  However, what will influence that is one&rsquo;s economic circumstances and intellectual capacities.  The Minister of State has one of the most enviable jobs in the Government.  He has the power to transform people&rsquo;s lives as a result of the strategies he adopts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution and noted his commitment to his task.  The pleasure he gets from it is obvious, and the importance of that task cannot be over-estimated.  It affects early school leavers as much as people for whom the conventional route through education was not available for whatever reason.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution was very good, especially when discussing the reaction when one discovers there are still adults with literacy problems.  The strategies of the Department being overseen by the Minister of State are committed to eliminating that experience and trying to encourage people, in a practical way, to get back into the education system.  For that reason, the Minister of State has an enviable job.  It is what politics should be about &mdash; the transformation of people&rsquo;s lives.  The Minister of State is overseeing its most important aspect &mdash; the education system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A characteristic of the Irish nation and what is believed to underpin our economic success is the high standard of education.  One sees the disaster taking place in Zimbabwe but before matters deteriorated there, Robert Mugabe proudly <Col N="729"/>boasted that he was educated by Irish people.  We are unlikely to pat ourselves on the back about that now but at one time he was seen to be delivering something for his country when it gained its independence.  Unfortunately, matters have gone a little awry since.  Nevertheless, the Irish education system that was brought to Africa, largely through religious orders, delivered a strong education.  It is something of which we can be rightly proud.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also mentioned that an element of complacency might be setting in with the Government congratulating itself on the delivery of services.  I do not entirely agree.  When the Government has made achievements and there have been increases in the budgets, which are proven by the statistics, there is an entitlement to acknowledge that.  However, that is not complacency.  With our literacy levels we cannot afford to be complacent.  As Senator Hannigan said, everybody deserves a chance in education.  That is true for every child but we also cannot forget the people for whom the formal education system did not deliver or who were obliged to leave education.  They, too, deserve a second chance and we must encourage them back into education in whatever way we can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State pointed out that his functions and responsibilities transcend two Departments, the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That is most beneficial as it makes us examine our skills shortages.  As Senator Hannigan said, we must ensure we are aware of the evolving needs of people and our economy in that regard.  For that reason the issue of innovation and the amount of energy, time and focus we put on it in our education system is important.  With that in mind, I must mention one of my pet projects, the Science Bus from DCU.  I am glad to see the Minister of State is familiar with the scheme because the college is looking for money for it.  I hope the Minister of State will bring it to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to hear that.  It is a practical example of how we can enthuse schoolchildren.  The bus, which contains science laboratories and the expertise to use them, travels to schools that do not have such laboratories.  When the bus was running, there was a two-year waiting list of schools that wanted a visit by it.  It ignites children&rsquo;s interest in science.  I can recall from my school days that an interest in an area could be ignited and even lead to a career.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore, these are the skills the economy needs.  It is acknowledged - the Minister of State will be familiar with the relevant figures - that we have a shortage of science graduates and that it will generate problems in a few years, just as we are trying to keep this country within the knowledge economy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on lifelong learning and education in general.  I want to discuss the delivery of educational facilities in rural areas.  Irrespective of the efforts invested in better education, difficulties remain in reaching out to people living in remote areas.  I am from Waterford, which has encountered challenges in terms of expanding educational schemes to rural parts of the county.  People who wish to engage with the education system find it difficult to access the resources and programmes on offer because, for example, broadband penetration is limited.  Broadband and other supports must be put in place if we are to be serious about delivering education to the regions.</P>

	<P>Too much emphasis is placed on academia, with the result that a race takes place for points and the best academic qualifications while vocational education is neglected.  I have a background in vocational education, having taken a F&Aacute;S apprenticeship which opened a large number of doors.  People are not aware of the benefits to be gained from completing apprenticeship courses through F&Aacute;S and other agencies.  The challenge lies in giving people the confidence and resources to engage with the system.  The VECs, F&Aacute;S and other agencies are working well in that regard but more can be done through the institutes of technology and universities to provide third level education on an outreach basis.</P>
        <P>I was astonished when a number of my friends from primary school recently revealed to me they were unable to read or write.  Other Senators have described similar experiences.  I was happy to help my friends and the VECs were able to respond to their needs.  However, there must be thousands more who are not coming forward.  I accept that the Minister of State is genuinely trying to help them but we must put systems in place <Col N="731"/>to encourage and support them in re-engaging with the education system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the introduction of free education in the North and the South.  That is not the same as the free education introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il under which registration fees have increased by 260% in the past ten years.  Part-time students continue to pay fees, which is a disincentive to going through third level education.  The motion brought by Fianna F&aacute;il is merely an exercise in backslapping but if we are to be serious about lifelong education, we need action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no more jobs for life and with rapidly changing skills and employment, it is imperative our workforce is constantly retrained and upskilled.  Education and training must be lifelong to ensure full employment.  The facts, however, are depressing.  Approximately 500,000 Irish adults have problems with basic reading and mathematics which means one in four Irish adults has problems with everyday literacy tasks such as reading instructions on medicine bottles.  The Government&rsquo;s response has been lacklustre to say the least, with only 7,000 additional extra literacy places announced in Towards 2016.  That target is unambitious and merely scratches the surface given that we are starting from a low base.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a national literacy crusade with specific targets and dates for the incremental eradication of illiteracy.  As such campaigns have been successful in other developing countries, there is no reason we cannot do the same.</P>
        <P>My party also supports the call for paid educational and learning leave.  Every country in the EU 15 except Ireland allows paid educational leave as a statutory entitlement.  Here, however, such leave is left to the discretion of employers.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated by the ESRI that any downturn in our economy would have disastrous effects on the estimated 400,000 or more unskilled adults in low wage marginal jobs.  As a result of various problems with adult education provision, educational uptake among adults is significantly lower in Ireland than in other EU countries.  The Twenty-six Counties has a rate of only 8% compared with more than 25% in Scandinavian countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the responsibility of the Government to plan proactively for possible future developments in the economy, including the future of workers.  The collapse of the textile industry in County Donegal and the resultant haemorrhage of job <Col N="732"/>losses is an indictment of the Government&rsquo;s failure to ensure the workforce was retrained in advance of the jobs being lost.  Employment in County Donegal is heavily reliant on construction and the low paid service sector.  With the inevitable busts and booms of a capitalist economy, these workers are vulnerable to unemployment unless they are trained and upskilled.  At approximately 18%, County Donegal already has to contend with the highest rate of unemployment in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is clear on the priorities for protecting against unemployment.  We need to eradicate illiteracy, introduce paid educational leave as a statutory entitlement and make work-based learning and training available to all workers.  That is what the Government should propose instead of the backslapping in which it has engaged.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his heartening and informative contribution.  All sides of the House will recognise that the heart of the Minister of State lies in developing education and lifelong learning for all citizens, on which I commend him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the contributions on both sides of the House to this important debate on lifelong learning.  In last week&rsquo;s debate on employment I noted the role of the Industrial Development Agency and the opportunities available now in employment and education that were not available a few years ago.  Ireland is a young, independent country that is developing at a very fast rate and it is important to acknowledge that we have come from a poor base.  When we are addressing this issue we should remember this context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My father and people of his generation had to leave these shores in search of employment having not had the educational opportunities now widely available to young people of our generation.  I had the opportunity to study at primary, secondary and third level, for which I am grateful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to adult literacy and community education.  I welcome the fact that there is an increase of &euro;7.4 million, or 21%, in the budget for these areas that will provide a further 3,000 educational places.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s programme proposes to increase the number of places by 4,000 by 2009.  This would mean the Department would facilitate 42,000 people in availing of adult literacy education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State mentioned that the budget for adult and further education has increased by &euro;56 million this year, an increase of 50% from 2002 to 2007.  This must be welcomed by all.  He said that in 2007 the Government will invest approximately &euro;70 million in training programmes for those in employment, compared to &euro;8 million in 2004, which adds F&Aacute;S and Skillsnet to the equation.  Senators Doherty and Keaveney and others referred to those who have lost jobs but most of the jobs lost in Ireland have been lost because we are not competitive enough to remain in the mainstream manufacturing sector.</P>

I will not make remarks that could impinge on the potential of the county and its people.  Senator Doherty made reference to my colleague Senator Keaveney.  It is my understanding that the Northern Ireland Assembly is a power-sharing Executive.  The burden of responsibility should, therefore, be shared in that institution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 55,000 people are in the F&Aacute;S and Skillsnet programmes this year.  This is to be welcomed.

    <Title>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2007: Second and Subsequent Stages. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P><Col N="734"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to present the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2007.  This is a short item of legislation to rectify a legal anomaly that has recently come to light in the law relating to bail.  The anomaly has arisen in relation to the acceptance of recognisances by prison governors.</P>
        <P>Bail is often granted on condition that recognisances are met.  Recognisances are those under<Col N="735"/>takings or conditions that the person granted bail must satisfy.  They may be in monetary or non-monetary form.  In many instances, the person is remanded in custody pending the taking of the recognisance.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I want to outline the context in which the present difficulty has arisen.  Section 22(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 provided that judges of the District Court and peace commissioners could take bail recognisances.  Prison governors are also peace commissioners and in that capacity they had been able to accept recognisances from persons remanded in custody pending entry of a recognisance.  However, since the governor was acting in his or her capacity as a peace commissioner, he or she could not delegate this function in the same way as he or she could delegate other functions to, for example, a deputy governor.  This gave rise to logistical difficulties, given the turnover in governors and the fact that, following an agreed change in work practices, they are not available 24 hours a day.  In order to deal with this difficulty, the Prisons Act of this year, which modernised and updated prison-related provisions generally, amended section 22(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act to provide, at section 41(2), that prison governors or prison officers designated by the governor could accept recognisances from people remanded in custody by the District Court pending the entering of a recognisance.  This provision came into operation on 1 May this year.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P Just="Left">However, section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 also amended section 22(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act and removed the reference to peace commissioners.  This was done as several references in the 1967 Act to the role of peace commissioners had already been removed by the Bail Act when it was passed in 1997.  Following the same analogy, it was decided to remove the reference to peace commissioners in relation to the acceptance of recognisances.  The amendment in section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act brought this about.  It substituted the entire section 22(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 rather than deleting the reference to &ldquo;peace commissioners&rdquo;.  Hence, the new subsection provided for judges of the District Court to take recognisances but made no mention of prison governors or other designated prison officers.  Section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 came into operation on 1 July this year, and, being the most recent of the amendments, I have been advised that the effect of the subsequent Act was to effect an implied repeal of the previous legislation.  Unfortunately, the full implications of the relationship between these two amendments was not realised until it was brought to the attention of my Department on 11 October by the Courts Service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is the context in which the present difficulty has arisen.  The operational implications for <Col N="736"/>the prison system of the changes in the legislation have prompted me to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Since the recognisances can no longer be taken by a prison governor or other designated officer with respect to a person in custody, the prison authorities must now arrange to bring the person before a judge of the District Court.  This has serious implications for the Irish Prison Service in terms of providing prison escorts and ensuring the availability of judges at short notice.  I am aware that certain short-term arrangements have been agreed between the Courts Service and the Irish Prison Service to minimise the difficulties but those arrangements cannot continue in the longer term.  I am satisfied that the difficulties, if left unchecked, would have serious implications, especially for the Irish Prison Service, in terms of staff deployment and overheads.  There is a concern that it could create tensions in prisons if persons on remand felt their release was being unduly delayed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I emphasise that while there is an operational and logistical problem - it is a significant problem - it does not in any way affect the granting of bail or the conditions under which bail is granted.  Any person affected by this anomaly will already have been granted bail by the District Court and remanded in custody pending entering of a recognisance.  There is no question that any person has been released who should not have been released.  I emphasise that the only issue at stake here is the question of who is authorised to receive the recognisance that has already been stipulated by the District Court.  This amending legislation will resolve the practical difficulties that are arising.  The Attorney General has advised that the most appropriate response to deal with the current position is to bring forward legislation on an urgent basis.  I thank the other parties which are represented in this House, as in the Lower House, which have facilitated the rapid passage of this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will restore the position to that which obtained prior to the commencement of section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, that is, prison governors and prison officers designated by them can accept recognisances from persons remanded in custody.  Since the taking of a recognisance is essentially an administrative consequence of an earlier judicial decision, the opportunity is being taken to include District Court clerks in the list of persons who may accept recognisances.  I have decided also to reinstate peace commissioners as persons empowered to take recognisances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now deal with the content of the Bill which has just two sections.  Section 1 is the substantive section which amends section 22(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967.  It substitutes a new subsection (3) for that inserted by the 2007 Act.  The new subsection provides that a judge of the District Court, a District Court clerk, a prison governor, a prison officer designated by a prison governor and a peace commissioner designated by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="737"/>Law Reform may take recognisances.  I have decided to reinstate peace commissioners as persons empowered to take recognisances for practical reasons.  However, as the role of peace commissioners in relation to bail matters has changed, I am inserting a provision whereby they must be designated by ministerial order rather than including a universal empowerment provision.  As already indicted, the opportunity is also being taken to extend the provision to include a District Court clerk in the list of persons who may accept a recognisance from a person on remand.  Section 2 is the standard provision providing for the Short Title and citation of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before I conclude, I acknowledge that it should not be necessary to introduce a short item of legislation such as this to address an unfortunate and regrettable oversight.  However, when the issue arises we must face up to it and deal with it as quickly as possible.  In that regard, let me express again my appreciation for the co-operation of the Members of this House in facilitating the introduction of this Bill at short notice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The net effect of the current difficulty has not been in any way detrimental to our legal system.  The accidental omission of the reference to prison governors or those designated by them has, as I have indicated, resulted in operational and logistical difficulties for the Irish Prison Service.  It has not resulted in any difficulties of a legal kind for the granting of bail by the courts or the setting of conditions to bail.  Nobody is out on bail who should not be at liberty.  In a nutshell, the simple issue at stake is the question of who is authorised to accept a bail recognisance.  My major concern is to eliminate disruption to the system that has worked well and to ensure the efficient operation of the courts and the Irish Prison Service.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on this matter and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and appreciate that he has personally presented the Bill to this House.  I have no difficulties with the Bill and, in fact, the matter to which it refers has only recently come to light.  A number of criminal law practitioners brought it to my attention last week.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive explanation.  It was an inadvertent oversight and essentially a technical error which, as the Minister stated, has not affected the bail system.  When Bills are introduced in a rushed manner, this type of error can creep into the legislative text.  Will the Minister assure the House that legislation passed in the past two years which contained comprehensive amendments to the corpus of criminal law has been checked for any other errors we may otherwise have to revisit?  I support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the Bill.  As this is the first opportunity I have had to address the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, <Col N="738"/>since his appointment to the Cabinet, I wish him well in his new post.  I have known him for more than 20 years and I am delighted he has been appointed as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In this day and age, the portfolio comprises an onerous, difficult and sometimes unenviable task.  I have no doubt, however, that he has both the calibre and experience to deal with it.  In my former role as Chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the Minister was my predecessor and we worked closely together on many issues.  I always knew he would rise to Cabinet office and I am delighted for him.  I wish him and his family good luck.  Although it can be a difficult job, I have no doubt that he will carry out his functions with aplomb.  I have great faith that he will do an excellent job in that Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill seeks to rectify an oversight caused by the enactment of the Prisons Bill which brought about this error.  For example, if a judge at Schull District Court tomorrow decided to imprison a young man from Dublin or the midlands on a serious charge and there was nobody there to act for him and fix recognisances, he could end up in Cork Prison over the long weekend.  It may be decided on Friday that the man was entitled to get out, but if the prison governor or another member of the prison staff could not act because of this anomaly, he would remain in prison until Tuesday.  That is a simple example because a District Court judge would not be sitting over the weekend or on a bank holiday Monday.  If the matter were quite serious, they would sit, but that creates all sorts of anomalies and difficulties.</P>
        <P>I fully understand what has happened and I support this amending legislation.  I appreciate that my colleague Senator Regan also supports the Bill.  All parties in the Lower House also realised that this was an error which has done no damage.  I commend the Courts Service which picked up on this matter and brought it to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  The Courts Service is a relatively new phenomenon but in this case it has succeeded in bringing the issue to light.  It may be a minor issue but it has major practical implications.  I fully support the Bill which I hope will attract support across the floor of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will cause a minor upset for the Minister, although he is welcome here.  I accept what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has said in that the Minister often attends the House personally rather than sending a Minister of State to deputise for him.  I was impressed by what Senator Regan said because I have a problem with rushed legislation of any kind.  It seems that when we have such legislation, we must revisit it because we did not cover the matter well enough initially.  Yet again we are being subjected to the undignified task of cleaning up the mess the Government has left behind.</P>
        <P>I object in principle to emergency legislation, but in this particular case I have a more fundamental objection.  I call into question not the cor<Col N="739"/>rective measure before us &mdash; I have no doubt it is correct &mdash; but the original Act whose purpose it is to repair.  In my time in the House I have taken part in many debates on crime, but I am now beginning to wonder whether the way we approach this question is creating results that end up being counterproductive.</P>
        <P>It is easy for people in our position to create public hysteria about crime, or add to it when it is created by others.  The ordinary citizen, quite reasonably and understandably, is always concerned about the level of crime.  Listening to the radio today, one could hear how concerned people are.  It is one of the few hot button issues that is virtually guaranteed to provoke a response from ordinary citizens.  Since politicians and especially journalists know that, however, they are all too likely to pander to ordinary people&rsquo;s concerns rather than addressing the issue directly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the media, their sin &mdash; I am happy to say I think it is one &mdash; is the way they present crime stories as if they were much more common than they are.  They rarely point out that even with the dramatic increase in violent crime we have certainly had in recent years and of which we have heard a great deal today, nonetheless, Ireland still has a relatively low level of criminal activity by international standards.</P>
        <P>Too many politicians yield to the temptation to snatch a quick headline by playing up a crime story, but what concerns me more is the way the crime argument is presented in terms of political debate.  No matter what party is in power, it is always under constant attack by the Opposition, although I accept that Senator Regan did not attack the Government on this occasion.  The Opposition usually presents the latest crime situation as a total failure by the Government of the day which, it claims, either does not recognise the seriousness of the situation or is indifferent to it.  In addition, the Opposition often suggests the Government is incompetent in dealing with the situation.</P>
        <P>The motion we considered here this day last week fell neatly into that pattern.  It could be seen as the usual political argy-bargy, until we look at the effects it often has.  Since Governments of all colours invariably turn out to have thin skins, they react to criticism of this kind by becoming overly defensive.  Governments invariably find themselves tending to talk down the incidence of crime, while at the same time Opposition parties find themselves talking it up.  They invariably tend to be overly confident in the steps they are taking to combat crime and present a rosy scenario of the future as they see it.  The Minister did not do so today, however, and I am not talking about it in that context.  Rather, I am using this opportunity to comment on the general point.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the motion that was before us last week also falls neatly into this pattern.  It does not, however, stop with talking, and this is my main problem with the Act that we are amending here.  Governments have the power to <Col N="740"/>act, and sometimes they use that power for the wrong reasons.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that some, if not most, of the recent legislative action on the crime front has been driven not by an honest attempt to cope with a real-life situation on the ground, but by political considerations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is part of this yah-booh political shadow boxing that goes on all the time, and of which last week&rsquo;s debate was a part.  Too often the Government produces criminal justice legislation not because it is really needed but because it thinks it will convince people that it is on top of the situation, and doing everything possible and necessary to address the problem.</P>
        <P>Hence my belief that creating hysteria about crime tends to generate the wrong response.  All criminal justice legislation is, to some extent at least, an invasion of individual liberties, and the question we legislators should ask ourselves is whether the benefits to society as a whole justify the damage we do to the freedom of individuals.  We cannot answer that question the right way if the motive driving the legislation is aimed not at a crime problem, but at a political problem that we have created by the way we approach the issue.</P>
        <P>This is not to suggest that crime is not a serious challenge about which we should be complacent, or over-confident of the means we employ to deal with it.  We need to find a better way of discussing it than we do at present because that approach inevitably results in hasty and disproportionate legislation.</P>
        <P>My words are based on last week&rsquo;s debate rather than on what is taking place today.  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point which he has explained well and I support what he is trying to do but I am unhappy at the way we handle crime in these Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with Senator Quinn.  I have tried to say the same in recent debates but have probably done so less sensitively.  Our debates on crime must be conducted on proper terms.  I am glad that there is no contention about correcting the anomaly set out in this Bill.  I also agree with some of Senator Regan&rsquo;s points.  Emergency legislation of this type is usually needed to correct emergency legislation that was badly introduced in the first instance.  Both Acts under discussion, the Criminal Justice Act and the Prisons Act, introduced earlier this year, however, had a long lead-in time for publication and considerable Second Stage debate.  The problem arose with the introduction of a raft of amendments on Committee and Report Stages which, in effect, produced new Bills.  Many of the difficulties might have arisen on the introduction of these amendments, and the guillotine on speaking and scrutiny time.  It may be necessary on Second Stage of the legislative procedure to audit those features to determine if there are similar anomalies in the system.</P><Col N="741"/>
        <P Just="Left">In correcting this anomaly the Minister is ironically restoring the original Bill, obviating the need for the original amendment.  This raises the position of the peace commissioners.  There is a need for a proper updated register of peace commissioners, within either Garda administrative areas or court areas.  My father was a peace commissioner for many years, a role in which he took great pride.  His name remains on lists furnished by local authorities although he passed away seven years ago.  That happens around the country.  These lists should be available through the citizens information centres, in libraries and local authorities, and for every elected representative.  If this Bill gives us an opportunity to consider how peace commissioners are appointed, their role within the judicial system, one aspect of which the Bill addresses, and how citizens interact with them, it will be a worthwhile debate.  I urge the Minister to consider those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I am glad to hear him say that there are lessons to be learned from this process because it helps no one when legislation is rushed through Parliament.  My colleague in the Lower House referred last night to the fact that soon afterwards we uncover the inevitable mistakes and loopholes.  It has been remarked that the content of the amendments introduced by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor was greater than that of the original Bills.  The Criminal Justice Act is not the first instance in which we have had to return to amend loopholes and mistakes.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the amendment proposed to this Bill.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s word for it that nobody not entitled to do so has accepted recognisance.  Criminal justice legislation is too important a subject to be rushed through the House.  It impacts on many aspects of our legal system.  When it is rushed mistakes are made and amendments are needed at short notice.  This is an unacceptable way to proceed.  I support this amendment but would prefer that such amendments cease.  I also support Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments on peace commissioners.  A database would be beneficial to us all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for their broad welcome for the legislation.  In the Lower House I was asked for the opinion of the Attorney General on the validity of anything that had happened from 1 July until the Courts Service brought this to the attention of the Department and the corrective arrangements were put in place a few days ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is that there can be no doubt that the persons released on bail since 1 July are validly released.  The bail orders were made by the courts.  The Attorney General also advised that in so far as recognisances were taken by prison governors, in circumstances where the recognisance was a money amount no issue arises because a term of being released on <Col N="742"/>bail was the handing over to the State that amount of money as security.  That advice bears out the adage of possession being nine tenths of the law.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General has further advised that the fact that the person who may have physically taken custody of the money was not authorised by statute does not alter the position as the money is in the State&rsquo;s possession and can be forfeited by it.  In addition, in so far as the recognisance was a bond then the bond has been validly given pursuant to the court order by the person giving the bond and its validity is not affected by the fact that the person who takes the bond does not have a statutory authority to do so.  The technical irregularity does not affect the validity of the bond which is an obligation undertaken to the State.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan said that there has been substantial legislation passed recently on the basis, as Senator Boyle puts it, of mass substitution of amendments to Bills.  I have asked my Department to check through recent legislation to ensure that there have not been other inadvertent oversights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for his kind wishes on my appointment.  I was interested in Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution and agree with much of what he said.  The public debate on crime determined the nature of the response to the issue and it is important to have a responsible debate on it.  In interviews today following the publication of the crime statistics numerous commentators asked me why I had no new proposals in this area.  We have enacted a great deal of legislation in this area upon which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must act, which it must implement and for which it needs to be resourced.  Senator Quinn has no particular objection to this Bill, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to the proper consideration of legislation and the question of the peace commissioner.  The tradition was that a record of peace commissioners in a particular Garda district was kept by the district officer, which would seem to be the appropriate procedure.  However, Senator Boyle is right that in recent years, it does not seem to be the case that all districts have an accurate picture of all the peace commissioners.  The Supreme Court cast some doubt on the validity of peace commissioners exercising powers in criminal matters in recent years, which has led to an erosion of their functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay a particular tribute to the peace commissioners and to those who exercise their functions.  They do so without any monetary reward.  It is an express term of the appointment that they can receive no reward or remuneration for the performance of their services, so they are effectively citizens who voluntarily perform civic functions.  I have initiated a review of this area since my appointment because they can perform useful functions and can save judicial and police time in the performance of those functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hannigan referred to the same issue and made the point that criminal justice measures <Col N="743"/>are too important to be rushed through this House.  I agree.  On that note, I thank Senators for their contributions on Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this issue.  I also thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise it.  There has been much discussion recently about the need for diversity and how we provide for schools and look after our pupils.  One of the movements that has been to the forefront of this is the gaelscoileanna.  One such gaelscoil in my constituency, Gaelscoil Bharra, was founded in 1996.  It is an exceptionally successful school with around 200 pupils.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister of State because of the circumstances within which the students are trying to learn and within which the staff are doing their best to teach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am happy to speak about this matter because in spite of their circumstances, the recognition of the school in my community and the way the pupils and the parents speak about it are fantastic.  While we spend so much time talking about the difficulties with which we must deal as a society, I have no doubt that if every school had the reputation of this school, those difficulties would be much smaller.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The entire school is housed in prefabs.  It is very close to where I live and for many years before I became active in politics I was always under the presumption that those prefabs were changing facilities for the local GAA club while the fine building next to the prefabs was used by the <Col N="744"/>school.  Shortly after I was elected to Dublin City Council, I got a letter from the school and went to meet its representatives.  I discovered to my horror that the pupils were in the prefabs and the fine building was the GAA club which had provided the land for the school as a significant gesture to the community.  I went into the school and got a tour from the principal who took me to the area used for teaching pupils with special needs.  The same area serves as a storage facility for the school&rsquo;s cleaning materials.  Pupils who are brought in for special needs education must sit beside a mop and bucket and some spare dusty computers that happened to be there when I visited.</P>
        <P>We are all full of intent and nobody accepts that this is acceptable in this day and age.  In spite of all that intent and the attitude that the Minister of State will speak about, the fact is that this school is 11 years old and has received many promises.  The pupils and teachers have got to the point where they just do not have any faith because it is so slow in moving forward and promises made in the past have not been fulfilled.  Teachers are now considering industrial action because they are so exasperated.</P>
        <P>This is why I have brought the matter to the attention of the House.  None of us can be proud of this.  I ask the Government to act as rapidly as possible to ensure a school that is flourishing can get the premises and facilities it deserves.  I again thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in educational projects and to outline the position regarding Gaelscoil Bharra.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Modernising facilities in the 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The reality of this commitment is that the demand for additional accommodation has increased exponentially.  In 2006, more than &euro;500 million was invested in schools infrastructure, which funded the delivery of more than 1,300 building projects.  This compares with the sum of slightly more than &euro;90 million that was provided for school buildings in 1997.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the national development plan, &euro;4.5 billion is being invested to improve existing school buildings and provide extra accommodation for an expected growth of 100,000 in the schoolgoing population in the coming years. <Col N="745"/> Together with the improvements in planning that have already been put in place, as well as those provided for in the new programme for Government, this will enable the Department of Education and Science to meet the future needs of developing areas.  The Cathaoirleach will agree that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to this sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for the matter raised by the Senator, Gaelscoil Bharra is a co-educational all-Irish national school.  The school had a September 2006 enrolment of 218 pupils and its enrolments have been on an upward trend of 12% during the last five years.  The school has a current staffing level of a principal, eight mainstream teachers and one permanent learning support teacher.</P>
        <P>Officials in the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science are considering a number of options for the long-term solution to the school&rsquo;s accommodation difficulties.  While one such option is the building of a permanent structure on the school&rsquo;s current site, a number of issues have arisen in respect of this proposal.  However, it will be pursued in tandem with a number of other options being considered.  The Department acknowledges the need for a solution to the school&rsquo;s accommodation difficulties and is committed to working to achieve a satisfactory solution as soon as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding this particular school project and to highlight the enormous amount of work being undertaken by the Department of Education and Science in implementing the school building and modernisation programme to ensure that facilities of the highest standard are available for the entire schoolgoing population.</P>

    <Title>Rail Services. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As a Member from County Donegal, I seek a direct train service from Dublin to Derry, which potentially might continue into County Donegal.  I do so because neither air access nor the welcome improvements to road access are sufficient and rail access is also required.  While it might have been difficult to achieve this in the past, this is no longer the case.  Formerly, trains from Derry terminated in Belfast&rsquo;s York Street station while those from Dublin terminated in Belfast Central Station.  However, as there is now a bridge linking the stations, there is no physical reason to prevent a direct Dublin to Derry train service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accompanied the Into the West rail lobby to Stormont last Thursday and the First Minister, Ian Paisley, was also present.  He spoke lovingly about his train trips in the past from Ballymena to Portrush.  I wish to underline the issue from the perspective of Into the West&rsquo;s founder, Eamonn McCann, who is well known in Derry.  A decision by the Department for Regional Development on whether to approve a railway spending plan that <Col N="746"/>does not include money for the Coleraine to Derry route in the second investment strategy for Northern Ireland is now imminent.  The lobby group seeks a plan that does include money for the Coleraine to Derry line to prevent it from falling even further behind the rest of the network.  If this is not achieved now, the upgrade of the line will be postponed until 2010 or 2012, by which time it will be too late.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a long-term vision for a modern all-Ireland rail network that will serve the north west as well as other regions.  However, unless the immediate demand is achieved, such long-term aspirations will become academic.  The 55 miles of train track from Ballymena to Derry is now the worst section of track in Ireland.  The track&rsquo;s deterioration has been accelerated due to the tonnage of the new 150-tonne trains.  While one department complains the new trains are damaging the track, the mechanical department complains that the poor state of the track is damaging the new trains and decreasing their longevity.</P>
        <P>The Into the West group has suggested the solution to both problems would be to weld the track and remove the outdated jointed track.  There are three densities of rail, namely, 70 lbs., 90 lbs. and 113 lbs., which are calculated on a weight per yard basis.  The existing jointed rail track is mostly 70 lbs. and has a shorter lifespan than the 113 lbs. rail.  Depending on funding, the company has plans to weld the existing 70 lbs. rail under a life extension plan and asserts this should prolong its life.  However, the Into the West group believes this to be a false economy.  An expenditure of &pound;60 million now would deliver 98 mph track, which would reduce journey times from Derry to Belfast to 90 minutes.  This would get rid of the aforementioned false economy.</P>
        <P>It was announced last Thursday that &pound;12 million will be spent on the Ballymena to Coleraine section of the line.  While undoubtedly this will help improve a section of the track, the investment that is badly needed and which has not been forthcoming is that from Coleraine to Derry.  The provision of passing lanes and the upgrade of the existing track are required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One might ask what this has to do with us in the South.  This line serves the north west as much as would any other form of access.  People from the region continually call out for more investment in tourism and jobs.  The mantra when buying a house is, &ldquo;location, location, location&rdquo; and when trying to sell a region, it is, &ldquo;access, access, access&rdquo;.  New trains have been deployed on this route and usage has increased by 60% since 2001.  There is an economic argument for investing in this line.  The State has taken a role in respect of the Belfast to Dublin Enterprise train service.  Tonight, I seek clarification as to whether there is an impediment to designating it as the Dublin to Derry service instead.  If the State was able to secure European funding for the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise train service, there is no reason not to rename the route the Dublin to Derry service.  One could make use of the existing track, <Col N="747"/>the new trains that run on it and the real economy.  Moreover, one could cite the argument regarding the false economies involved in doing patch-up jobs to which one must revert continually.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is not present this evening, to consider the findings of the recent report on this matter.  While there have been decades of neglect, it is being reversed and there have been line speed upgrades and more trains as a result of providing passing points.  It would be useful if such improvements could effected on the Derry to Belfast route and on the section between Derry and Coleraine in particular, as there will be an investment of &pound;12 million from Coleraine to Ballymena.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has his own connections to this region and while I do not suggest he should take a personal interest in this matter, it is highly important to the people of the north west.  I hope the work that has been done on the western rail corridor in respect of bringing rail services to County Donegal will ultimately yield a high quality all-Ireland rail service.  However, my immediate concern pertains to the issue under discussion.  I can discern no reason to prevent the establishment of a Dublin to Derry train service.  The Minister of State should either give me an answer this evening or ensure that the Minister for Transport responds with reasons the State cannot make such an investment and designate it a Dublin to Derry, rather than a Dublin to Belfast, service, which would provide the people of the north west with a service they badly need and deserve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Transport is aware of Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s sustained efforts to improve transport links in the north west, including Derry.  The Minister for Transport will raise the matters she has brought up in this House with the Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">However, Transport 21, which is the medium-term investment framework for transport, does not provide for a direct Dublin to Derry rail link.  Our resources for rail investment under Transport 21 are focused on the implementation of the railway safety programme, the complete transformation of rolling stock and projects such as the western rail corridor, the Cork-Midleton link, the Navan link, the Kildare route upgrade project and the interconnector in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently, rail services to Derry are available via Belfast.  The Minister for Transport understands this service is being considered by the Northern Ireland authorities in the context of overall plans for the development of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s railways.  Both larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland Railways are also working on proposals to improve the Dublin-Belfast service in terms of service frequency and journey times. <Col N="748"/> The North-South Ministerial Council will consider this matter again at its December meeting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In considering the case for a direct Dublin-Derry rail link, it is important to bear in mind the improvements that have been made in transport links generally to the north west.  In recent years major upgrades of roads serving the north west, such as the N2, N4 and N15, have been completed.  Substantial support is also being provided for air services between Dublin and Derry and between Dublin and Donegal Airport.  These links are supplemented by hourly bus services between Dublin and Derry, including nine daily services each way operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Senators will also be aware of the Government&rsquo;s intention to make available a contribution of &pound;400 million sterling, which amounts to &euro;580 million, to help fund major road projects in Northern Ireland and in particular to upgrade the route serving the north-west gateway to dual carriageway standard.  The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed its acceptance of this funding.  At its meeting on 14 September, the North-South Ministerial Council agreed on the management structure for the project and to the early appointment of consultants to enable a route corridor study for the project to commence.  The management structure is now in place and arrangements to procure the consultants are proceeding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Investment under Transport 21 will result in further improvements in the transport infrastructure serving the north west, including the Atlantic road corridor, which will link the Derry-Letterkenny region to Cork and Waterford.  In recognition of the need to move quickly ahead with this corridor, the national development plan provided for the acceleration of funding for the N18 Crusheen-Gort and Gort-Oranmore schemes.  Both schemes will now commence in 2008.  Between them, they will provide a total of about 50 kilometres of high quality dual carriageway, forming an important artery in the west of the country.</P>
        <P>Good progress is being made, therefore, in improving transport links with Derry and with the north west generally.  This must be taken into account in considering proposals for a direct Dublin-Derry rail link.  I thank the Senator for her contribution and will bring her comments to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Turoe Stone is acknowledged as one of the finest remaining examples of La T&egrave;ne Celtic art in the world.  It has been located at Turoe, near Loughrea in County Galway, for more than 2,000 years.  Experts within the OPW and the National Museum have concluded that the stone must be moved indoors to afford it the protection that an artefact of this value requires.  However, for some strange reason the decision has been made to move the stone to a location 30 kilometres away from Turoe to the middle of Galway city and an <Col N="749"/>environment far removed from the rolling hills of the east Galway landscape.  The proposal is to leave a meaningless replica in Turoe and to take the original stone out of its geographical context as the centrepiece of what was a large Celtic settlement in Turoe and its environs.  The observation by the OPW and the National Museum that the stone needs protection indoors offers us a wonderful opportunity to create a new visitor centre at Turoe, where there is a wealth of heritage and where a new initiative of this type could give a massive boost to tourism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a recent e-mail from the National Museum, an expert cited some precedents for the moving indoors of archaeological monuments such as the Turoe Stone.  I expect the contents of this e-mail will feature prominently in the Minister&rsquo;s response.  Its author refers to Clonmacnoise and other locations as examples in which replicas have been placed outdoors and the originals placed indoors.  However, she neglected to mention that the Clonmacnoise replicas of our valuable Celtic high crosses remain indoors in Clonmacnoise, that the cross of Kells remains in Kells and that the Iron Age road discovered in Corlea, County Longford, remains in Corlea.  The expert also incorrectly asserts that the Turoe Stone was moved a considerable distance 150 years ago.  This is totally untrue.  The stone was moved, but only about 400 metres from one area of Turoe hill to another.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The sad aspect of this debacle is that no consultation took place with the local community, its elected representatives or the local authority, Galway County Council.  In fact, the county council heritage officer, who is charged with the protection of our national heritage, was not even aware of the plan to move the stone until informed of it by locals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am surprised and disappointed that the order to move the stone has been signed already by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, whom I have always believed to be a passionate proponent of the devolution of powers to local government and particularly to local communities.  In his speech at the opening of National Heritage Week last August, he said:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">At a time when there is concern about a decline in civic responsibility it is inspiring to see that so many are willing to give generously of their time to their communities and neighbourhoods ... Recent research carried out by the Heritage Council highlights the public&rsquo;s support for a more proactive approach to protecting our heritage.  It also articulated that this could be best achieved by increasing public awareness and empowering communities ... Tourism remains one of the key industries that benefits from regional development and generates employment in rural areas and it is set to continue to grow over the next decade.</P><Col N="750"/>
        <P FLI="0">The community of Turoe was not consulted before the loss of its most precious artefact was proposed.  This community is more than willing to continue acting as the caretaker of the Turoe Stone, as it has done for generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that the Minister make himself aware of the depth of feeling in east Galway on this issue.  More than 3,000 signatures have been collected requesting that the Turoe Stone be left in Turoe and that an adequate home for it be constructed in acknowledgement of the rich archaeological heritage in this area.  I plead with the Minister to revisit the issue and to see the opportunity, rather than the obstacle, with which he is now presented.  The building of a new visitor centre in Turoe would be a major step forward and would acknowledge the commitment of this rural community to keeping the Turoe Stone in Turoe.</P>

	<P>Treasla&iacute;m leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Cannon as ucht a bheith roghnaithe mar Seanad&oacute;ir.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as ucht deis a thabhairt dom freagra a thabhairt d&oacute; thar ceann an Aire, an Teachta Gormley.  I thank Senator Cannon for the opportunity to set out for the House the considerations that have led to the decision to move the Turoe Stone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Turoe Stone is a national monument in State ownership located in the grounds of Turoe House near Loughrea.  The land on which the stone is located is in private ownership.  The stone is carved with a series of spirals, trumpet designs, curves and incised lines in a Celtic art style known as La T&egrave;ne.  It is believed to have been carved sometime between 300 and 100 BC and is generally considered to be the finest example of its kind in Europe.  Given the international importance of the stone, there is clearly an onus on the State to secure its integrity in the longer term.</P>
        <P>In 1996 a report commissioned from a stone conservation specialist found that the stone was undergoing weathering, leading to serious surface attrition together with disfigurement due to organic growth and iron staining.  The specialist recommended that the monument be carefully cleaned and removed to an indoor display area with appropriate environmental parameters.  In 2005 a follow-up inspection by the same specialist concluded that the stone had undergone additional surface attrition, with further reduction in its carved detail.  The location of the stone was also leading to damage from human contact and it required a greater level of protection than it was possible to provide at its present location.</P>
        <P>In the course of subsequent discussions between the Department and the OPW on how best to protect the stone, it was agreed as an initial temporary measure to build a small shed-like structure around it to prevent further weathering.  This work was carried out in 2005.  A <Col N="751"/>further report in 2006 concluded that putting the stone under cover had inhibited organic growth and this had resulted in reduced staining and greater clarity in the carved detail on the stone.  The report also found, however, that putting the stone under cover has been only partially successful in reducing the risk of irreversible damage.  The report confirmed that it would be necessary to move this national monument to an environmentally controlled indoor location where the surfaces could be cleaned and stabilised under expert supervision and where it could be permanently protected from further damage.  This view was shared by the director of the National Museum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of all the expert advice available to the Department, the Minister has agreed there is no viable alternative but to move the stone, under archaeological supervision, to an environmentally controlled indoor location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, there is no location in the immediate vicinity of the stone&rsquo;s current location which meets this criterion.  However, the National Museum has indicated it is satisfied, following discussions and an inspection, that the new Galway City Museum is a suitable location for the Turoe Stone.  A high quality replica will be put in place at the same time as the original is moved.  On 25 July 2007, the proposed approach in this case, which is fully in accordance with archaeological best practice, was communicated to local public representatives and to the landowner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of whether monuments under threat of damage require protection from the <Col N="752"/>elements by covering them or by moving them indoors is considered on a case by case basis.  Such action has been taken in the case of a number of well known monuments.  For example, the high crosses at Clonmacnoise were moved to the visitors centre at the site, while the high cross in Kells was moved from its location in the centre of the town to a new location outside a heritage centre some distance away, with a canopy erected over it.  A stone carved in the La T&egrave;ne style formerly located at Killycluggin, County Cavan, was taken into the care of the National Museum in 1974 and subsequently loaned to the Cavan County Museum opened in 1996, while crosses at Durrow, County Offaly, were moved to an adjacent disused church.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cross from the Rock of Cashel was also moved into a medieval building at the site.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Detailed discussions are taking place between the Department, the OPW and Galway City Museum on the arrangements for the Turoe Stone&rsquo;s transfer and the siting of the high quality replica at Turoe.  The National Museum has also agreed to provide expert advice for the Department to ensure best conservation, custodial and presentation practice is adhered to at all times.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the desire of some members of the public that the Turoe Stone should remain in its current locality, but unfortunately this is not an option open to the Minister at present as there is no suitable location to house the stone.  He would be happy to discuss these issues further with local representatives should they wish to meet.</P>
