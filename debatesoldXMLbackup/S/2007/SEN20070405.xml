	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion, which was referred to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business for consideration, which concerns an order which will come into effect on 1 May 2007 and will refine the class of media mergers which must be notified to the Competition Authority, and it will also revoke the Competition Act 2002 (section 18(5)) Order 2002 (SI No. 622 of 2002) which is in operation since 1 January 2003, to be taken without debate; No. 2, a motion, which was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for consideration, which relates to the Schengen Convention and provides for the elimination of border checks between participating states and for a number of law enforcement compensatory measures, following Government and Oireachtas approval, Ireland successfully applied to participate in certain aspects of the general Schengen Convention, including the Schengen Information System, through which relevant information is exchanged electronically via a central system, the proposed Council decision is part of a set of instruments to provide a legal basis for Schengen Information System II which is required to improve performance and to cater for new functions, to be taken without debate; No. 3, the Pharmacy Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 12.30 p.m.; No. 4, the Consumer Protection Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 12.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 1.00 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The House owes a debt of gratitude to the work of Mr. Paddy MacEntee, SC, on the publication of his commission of investigation report into the 1974 atrocities in Dublin and Monaghan.  The conclusions reached by Mr. MacEntee that there was no evidence of collusion and the Garda deliberately wound down the investigation are important.  People who were in the Garda and the then Government are still alive and have to deal with allegations touted against them.</P><Col N="1970"/>
        <P>At another level, it is difficult for the families of the victims.  They must still live with the memory of the events and do not have closure.  A system to help these families and those affected by the Troubles must be established.  I ask the Government to work with the Opposition and the new Northern Ireland Executive in developing an initiative which recognises the real and lasting pain and sorrow of the victims&rsquo; families.  If there is one lesson to be learned from this process of investigation, it is the need to support those victims, particularly the families of the Dublin-Monaghan victims who have had to deal with difficult times since 1974.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With the MacEntee report and the chief inspector of the Garda inspectorate, Ms O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s recent speech to the AGSI, there is a strong case for a debate on the Garda force.  We need to see a rebuilding of the trust and confidence in the force.  A structure needs to be in place where individual issues do not take from the reputation of the entire Garda force, which is inclined to happen willy-nilly.  Serious mistakes were made in the past for which the Garda Commissioner has apologised.  New legislation has been introduced to plug holes in the structures.  The Garda force needs to know it is a crucial part of our democracy and one in which we need to have trust and confidence.  While there will be incidents such as cross-Border collusion, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, Abbeylara or Donegal, it must be known we are cleaning these out of the system.  Garda&iacute; must know they can look to us as voices in support of them and examine deficiencies in the force in a balanced way.</P>
        <P>Recently on the Order of Business, I asked why the Government will not ban incandescent light bulbs, leading the way for the rest of the world.  Afterwards, I discussed the matter with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He was positively disposed towards my suggestion but he pointed out that the Irish Government, of its own volition, may not ban a product that is on sale in the EU, by virtue of the Treaty of Rome.  This needs to be addressed.  The Minister must be given an opportunity to explain this position to the House and the Government&rsquo;s recently published climate change policy document.  While I have disagreements with it, I also see positive aspects to the document.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, Senator Mansergh praised the work done for island communities by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Erosion on islands is a matter that should be examined by the Minister, the sea wall in Valentia being one example.  Local people are forced to pay to build walls to keep out the sea.  They might as well be in the Netherlands.  This should not be left to local communities.  Coastal erosion is a result of global warming.  If the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, wants to find ways to help the Kerry community, he could do so in a more positive way than what he has chosen to do so far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made by Senator Brian Hayes on the importance of supporting the families of the victims of the Dublin-<Col N="1971"/>Monaghan bombings.  I call on the Leader for a debate on the MacEntee report before the general election.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s calls for a review of the Garda force.  The various tribunals into Garda conduct have shown there is a culture in the Garda of circling the wagons if anything happens.  This has been evident in other incidences that have not been the subject of tribunal inquiry.  There is a need for a radical reform of the Garda.  Senator Maurice Hayes has pointed to how Garda recruits are trained.  They should not be sent to Templemore but integrated with other students of other disciplines to get a broader outlook on life.  The most important reform the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not grasped is the need for an independent Garda authority.  We need a similar structure to the policing board in the North to ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is radically reformed and the necessary accountability and transparency is provided. While the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is a welcome initiative and it will commence its work on 8 May, we also need to establish an independent Garda authority.  I would like a debate, if possible, on that matter.</P>
        <P>One of the findings in the recent report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services is that patients in mental health institutions are often left wandering aimlessly all day &mdash; they are not provided with the appropriate therapies and such assistance.  The conditions in some institutions are very poor and not at all fitting in terms of the conditions that should be in place in those institutions in this day and age.  I would like a debate, if possible, on that report before the forthcoming election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. MacEntee, SC, is one of the most eminent lawyers in this State.  He has been noted down through the years for his tenacity in the pursuit of real justice.  I have no doubt he made a valiant effort in this case to break through a wall of silence to find the truth, to bring solace to the families whose lives all these years have been a living hell, and to bring some semblance of closure to this case.  What is significant about the report is not the questions that have been answered but those which could not be answered because the information was not available or had gone missing.  This has been another blow to these families.  At this stage I believe they will continue and persist until the truth is found and, if they do not succeed, their children will persist with this.  We should engage at all times with those families to help them in whatever they are trying to achieve not only now but in the future.  </P>
        <P>I do not believe that closure has been brought to this case.  I am not in favour of Garda bashing.  I have always defended the Garda force on all occasions in this House.  We should continue to do that because the vast majority of garda&iacute; have served this State very well.  The answers in this case lie elsewhere, not with the garda&iacute;, but in <Col N="1972"/>other circles.  It is important that we do see this report as being the end of the road.  I for one, like many others, will continue to engage with the families who have suffered and try to help them in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would also like to compliment Mr. Paddy MacEntee, SC, on the thoroughness of the report and everything he was able to discover despite some difficulties and obstacles.  I also compliment his senior assistant, Mr. Felix McEnroy, SC, in this matter.  As was said by Senator Brian Hayes, the important point at this stage is that we should act, in so far as it can be done, more positively as regards the victims who have put up with an awful lot and perhaps did not get all the assistance they deserved in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a separate matter, I welcome that the Environmental Protection Agency has decided, albeit a little late, to step up the monitoring of water quality throughout our lakes and water sources.  I also share the concern expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the erosion of the sea wall at Valentia.  I appeal to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, through the Leader, to address the problem of the much more serious erosion of the sea wall at Inch.  It is threatening the main artery or road south through Killarney to Dingle.  Kerry County Council has had to proceed with that work.  The matter also involves the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  It is important that the necessary assistance is made available.  This is a main tourism artery.  People are experiencing enough difficulty with the signage.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly said, if the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, could be more positive in this regard, perhaps he could provide some assistance to address this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, we need to remind ourselves from time to time there is much we can learn from continental Europe.  The last couple of days have seen inaugurated, or at least by way of experiment, a new TGV that travels at the equivalent of approximately 320 mph or 515 km/h.  A comment has been made that this is a success for the French model, often denigrated, <Col N="1973"/>which is founded on a partnership of the State and public enterprise with the private sector to produce the latest in technology and provide infrastructure.  In many ways, that aspect of the French model is very suitable for this small country of Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been some discussion in the House about the Garda.  Again looking to Europe, the members of the German army, the <i>Bundeswehr</i>, are referred to as citizen soldiers.  It would be good if our soldiers, garda&iacute; and judges thought of themselves and were regarded as citizen soldiers, citizen garda&iacute; and citizen judges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The child poverty figures published recently are startling.  The figures startled me because the figures have disimproved.  Up to last year one child in ten suffered what is regarded as poverty but this year the figures have reduced to one child in nine.  In spite of all the money that has been thrown at addressing this problem, it is a huge scandal that we are allowing this to happen in one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  The evidence available clearly highlights that something can be done to address this problem at pre-school level.  It is possible to identify at a very early age children who will end up at the bottom of the class, children who will be among the 20% who do not finish school and those children who, as teenagers, will end up being in breach of the provisions of anti-social behaviour legislation.  Investment to address this problem is needed at pre-school level, but we have not taken even the first steps in that direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mention that issue because I received in my mail today details of the proposed charities Bill from the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to be introduced shortly after Easter.  The document he circulated outlined the main provisions in the Bill.  I have sought the introduction of this legislation for a long time but if there was ever a point of saying too little too late it is in this instance, although it is better late than never.  The Leader might advise what will happen in regard to the passage of this proposed Bill.  If it is published in Easter Week, when it is likely to come to the floor of the House?  Will the same Bill be handled by a new Government?  Does it make sense to publish Bills at this time of the year just before an election?</P>
        <P>I also received in my mail today a free copy of a magazine, which other Members have also probably received.  It is not a magazine I read, it is targeted at younger people, certainly people younger than me.  However, out of that magazine fell a promotion for smoking, a free product for smoking.  I will not give any details that might encourage it, but it must be against all the legislation we introduced to prevent the promotion of smoking.  Apparently this product is produced in Spain and it was included in this magazine, which I believe Members of this and the other House received free.  Given that has happened, either <Col N="1974"/>the magazine is at fault or we are at fault in allowing our postal circulation to be used for the distribution of product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am slightly reluctant to talk about the garda&iacute; because I have been doing some informal work for them in regard to management, other such matters and the giving of general advice.  It is important to underpin the morale of the Garda.  At a time when it is being buffeted from all sides as it reorganises and reforms, it is also important for it to see the body politic is behind it.</P>
        <P>If we are to have a debate on the Garda, which would be a good idea, it might be sensible to wait until Inspector O&rsquo;Toole has produced her next report.  I noticed in the newspapers yesterday that she said it would be on policing and the organisation of policing into the future.  That would give us a focus for a debate.  By that time, my group might have a report as well on management issues, which might be helpful.</P>
        <P>I wish to say something which is linked to the MacEntee report.  It is unfair to judge a police service of the 1970s by the standards of what is done today.  Things which are taken for granted now and which are basic tools of investigation were in their infancy in 1973.  For example, DNA, forensic testing of one type or another and data processing were in their infancy.  We have seen police force after police force in Britain going through the trauma of handling huge investigations and having to learn from them.  It is unfair to castigate today&rsquo;s Garda or even the people at the time because they did not know what we now know.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that there is an enormous need, North and South, to deal with the hurt of victims, to sustain them and to help them find settlement to the extent we can.  I do not believe one can do that by way of serial inquiries.  If there was one person in this country I would have chosen to find out what happened, it would have been Mr. Paddy MacEntee who is a most able lawyer and a resolute and persistent man.  If he cannot get at the truth, perhaps it is not possible to do so for many reasons.  Rather than delude people that we can get at the truth, perhaps we should look at other ways to help them to bear the cross they must carry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Quinn said about children and poverty.  Later today Barnardos will launch what it calls an election manifesto, which is opportune.  It will highlight the fact that one in nine children lives in consistent poverty.  The figure is up from last year when one in ten children lived in consistent poverty.  Consistent poverty is the best way to measure the poor circumstances in which children live because it takes an overall view of how they live.  It takes account of whether there is enough food in the house to feed them and whether they have warm and suitable clothing and footwear.  It also takes account of their environment in terms of play facilities.  It is a shocking indictment of our society and of Government spending that the number of children living in poverty is increasing each year.</P><Col N="1975"/>
        <P>There was a booklet on my desk this morning from the Combat Poverty Agency which I did not have time to read.  It also highlights the poor in our society.  As I mentioned yesterday, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul highlighted the same issues.</P>
        <P>Barnardos also provides figures on early school leavers.  One in five children leaves secondary school early.  Some 2,000 children are waiting for psychological assessments.  They are just some of the figures being highlighted by Barnardos today and we should all read them.  The parents of many of these children will not go out to vote because they feel so detached from the political system and so let down.  We need to focus on this area.  I would say to the Government that after ten years in office, it is a shame the number of children living in poverty is growing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the report of the joint Oireachtas committee on the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern.  It covers the issue of collusion in many of the atrocities which involved various agencies in Northern Ireland, not only the police and the military but also the Northern Ireland Office, the Secretary of State and the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s office.  It is all well set out in that document.  I do so rather than call for a debate on the MacEntee report.</P>
        <P>We decided to await the MacEntee report before having a debate on Kay&rsquo;s Tavern.  In fact, the report of the joint Oireachtas committee calls for a debate in each House.  The MacEntee report adds very little to the information already known.  The main questions put to the commission of investigation were as follows:  Why was the Garda investigation into the largest mass murder in the history of this State wound down within two or three months and why did crucial evidence and files within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform go missing?  We are no wiser today, two years after the commission of investigation, about the answers to those questions.</P>
        <P>Many Members have expressed a wish to support the victims who want the truth.  Following the historic events yesterday at Farmleigh, it behoves everybody to bring closure to our sad history, particularly our recent sad history.  That can only be done if the British Government comes absolutely clean about its involvement and active participation, through its agents, in some of these terrible events.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As always I listened with interest and respect to my colleague, citizen Mansergh.  He is perfectly right that historical files are never destroyed.  It would be pretty difficult to destroy them since they have all been tossed into a bonfire or a skip or have been lost.  That subject should be addressed, namely, the extraordinary inefficiency in the management of archiving.  Within a couple of months, the Garda managed to get rid of fingerprints, photographs of fingerprints and photographs of suspects supplied by the RUC.  It was an astonishing performance.  We should criticise the Garda and I make no bones <Col N="1976"/>about so doing.  That is a very minimal level of management and it has nothing whatever to do with DNA or scientific developments.</P>
        <P>The most crucial elements of the investigation were dumped and within such a short time of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, assuring the public that no stone would be left unturned and that the people who perpetrated this monstrous act would be brought to justice.  Within a couple of months, everything was thrown on a bonfire somewhere.  That is not acceptable now, nor was it at that time.  We are not talking about the dark ages.  There is a real question of very poor management of archive material and the public, and certainly the relatives, deserve to be reassured about that.</P>
        <P>I am sure many people, in addition to myself, heard Vincent Browne&rsquo;s radio programme last night on which a very dignified and composed woman spoke.  She gave a clear, factual and unemotional account of what happened to her.  At first she thought she had been struck by lightning.  I had no idea Vincent Browne, who I sometimes criticise, played such a role.  He displayed great courage and initiative in trying to go to the assistance of members of the public given the appalling things he confronted.  He said he tried to pick up a woman, but she disintegrated.  What a horrible thing to deliberately do to another human being.  We are entitled to look into this matter.  I do not accept we are at the end of it yet.  There has been a lack of co-operation in certain instances from the British Government.</P>
        <P>In addition to the missing files, there is a missing chapter in the report because for technical, legal reasons, which have been explained to the Taoiseach, a particular line of inquiry about somebody in regard to whom information was made available to the Garda could not be pursued.  When that person was called to the inquest, he got legal advice to stop his appearance.  There are many unanswered questions.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Government why we have been strongly criticised by the OECD for not fighting corruption?  We have apparently signed up to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption but the proper implementation of this convention relies upon the generation of domestic legislation and we have not done this.  There are situations where companies here could bribe figures in other parts of the world.  I would like to think that we would try to establish good standards.</P>
        <P>At the instigation of Pax Christi which is a very admirable organisation, I submitted an item on the Order Paper on the topic of cluster bombs.  I will end on a good note by informing the House that the British Government last week introduced legislation for a complete ban on the use of cluster bombs, these filthy things which kill so many children.  The British Government has committed itself to destroy the stockpiles of this material, which is to be welcomed.  I think further action is required but this is a good day&rsquo;s work on the part of the British Government.</P>

Our system of voting is quite complex.  People probably have a vague idea of what it involves.  Over the next few weeks, we will all hear phrases such as, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget you&rdquo;, and, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a vote&rdquo;.

	<P>I support Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Maurice Hayes in their call for a debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Last Tuesday, Senator Cummins and I had the pleasure of attending the AGSI conference dinner in Wexford at which we had the pleasure of meeting Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole and listening to her speak.  Her appointment comes at a crucial time for the force.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that we as leaders should support the force and tell the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what a good job it is doing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the young female faces who are garda&iacute; which shows the force is changing.  I was delighted to hear that the maximum entry age for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now 35 years.  People can have a career and join the force with a wealth of experience.  I am delighted to hear the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is pleased with the Garda reserve force.  The culture of secrecy is being weeded out and people such as Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, together with the young force, will show us that in 30 years&rsquo; time when the archives are examined, as Senator Norris said, they will not be contaminated nor interfered with but will be preserved.</P>

	<P>As everybody in the House knows, the D&aacute;il will be dissolved soon whereas the Seanad will not be and the business of Government will go on.  In view of the fact that many Members of the Seanad have raised issues they want debated, could the time be used when this House is still in session and the D&aacute;il is not to debate those matters which several Senators wish to have debated?  There is a lacuna in the parliamentary process whereby when the D&aacute;il is dissolved the Seanad <i>de facto</i> dissolves itself even though <i>de jure</i> it is not.  This time could certainly be used because the business of Government goes on without challenge in that period.</P>

	<P>Important things are happening in the nation and in the economy in particular.  The economy is now hitting very choppy waters.  One issue which is worth a debate is the danger to the economy posed by the multinational reservations about what is going on.  The broadband issue should also be addressed because Ministers have continually paid lip-service to the need to install broadband in every house and business in the country but have failed to do so.  I anticipate a period, which may or may not happen but which has happened before, whereby if the D&aacute;il is re-elected and there are difficulties in forming a Government, no meaningful legislation or parliamentary discussion could occur until October.  It would be helpful if the Leader of the House considered ways whereby the Seanad could monitor what is happening in the Government during that period.</P>

	<P>The issue of children going to school hungry and being neglected was highlighted recently in the House.  It was suggested that this topic should be part of a wider debate on the role and fabric of today&rsquo;s society.  I have significant experience of dealing with the disadvantaged in Dublin city.  I know that some of what has been said in the House are untruths.  There is a psychological service working very well within the disadvantaged areas but the problem lies with the parents in these areas.  They have money but there is no doubt they neglect their children.  They do not turn up for appointments made for their children.  This has been well documented.  All the stakeholders such as education, health, schools, parents and the community at large must be included in the discussion of the topic.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the role of the EU in dealing with domestic matters and how we may not be permitted to ban products.  A debate was held yesterday regarding the updating of legislation so that the Oireachtas will play a part.  Any EU regulations and directives should be discussed.  It is my strong opinion that the role of the European Union must be diluted in terms of how we handle our national affairs.</P>

	<P>I was unavoidably delayed and I have tried to check that none of my colleagues referred to the TASC report on which many of the newspapers commented this morning.  The report in question was issued by a think-tank that was established some years ago and it criticises the manner in which government in general and the parliamentary system operate.  Members on all sides have raised this issue from time to time.  Will the Leader, particularly in light of her zeal in this area and the initiatives she has put in place to reform the Seanad, consider making time available to consider this report after the Easter recess?</P><Col N="1980"/>
        <P>This is an important issue in the context of the future of democracy in this country.  I urge all politicians, particularly those in this House, to obtain the report &mdash; Power to the People?  Assessing Democracy in Ireland &mdash; to which I refer because it not only deals with the way the whip system works but also with the way government has operated since the foundation of the State, namely, that the Government makes proposals that are disposed of by Parliament through the former&rsquo;s majority therein.  Dissent is rarely allowed within the party whip system.  The latter increasingly applies in respect of Oireachtas committees and a number of examples of this are cited in the report.</P>
        <P>I am proud to be a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  However, as everyone is aware, there are upsides and downsides to being a member of a parliamentary party.</P>

        <P>I support Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s request for a debate on the Final Report on the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern, Dundalk, which was issued by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  It may be, as Senator Maurice Hayes stated, that the truth relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings is unobtainable.  However, I am of the view that, in view of the number of people involved, there must be some way to uncover the truth.  One would want to be an idiot to believe that all the files relating to this mass murder that were held in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na either disappeared or were destroyed.  I do not believe that what happened in this instance was an accident.  Further investigation is required until the truth is finally revealed.</P>

We cannot continue to call for further reports because those that have been already produced did not arrive at the results we wanted.  It is clear files have been destroyed or that they cannot be found.  It is a matter, therefore, of dealing with the victims.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s request for a debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Senator also referred a conversation he had with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, regarding why we cannot ban products &mdash; incandescent bulbs &mdash; that are on sale in the State.  He also called for a discussion on the strategy for climate change.</P>
        <P>The final point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole related to Valentia.  Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Coghlan are the kingpins of Dingle and they should allow me, due to the fact that I visit every year, to be the queen of Valentia.</P>

It seems both stupid <Col N="1982"/>and odd for such a product to be included with a magazine.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes called for a debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but stated that it might be useful to wait for this until Inspector Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole produces her next report.  The Senator also stated that we are judging past events on today&rsquo;s standards.  In historical terms, it is wrong to do so because we do not take account of the conditions, circumstances, standards, etc., that obtained when certain events occurred.  The Senator also stated that we should not continue to hold inquiry after inquiry.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry referred to the election manifesto being launched by Barnardos.  She also referred to the things for which children are waiting.  Chief among her concerns is the fact that 2,000 children are awaiting psychological testing.</P>

        <P>Senator Leyden referred to yesterday&rsquo;s signing of a contract worth &euro;605 million in respect of the N6 from Ballinasloe to Galway.

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister <Col N="1984"/>may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to oblige Senator Browne.  Many of the amendments were made in the D&aacute;il on the basis of suggestions by Senators.  These include the name in Irish of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, substituting &ldquo;pharmacy school&rdquo; for &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; and ensuring that when pharmacists are elected by the society, they are automatically nominated by the Minister, which was always the intention.  All these matters were addressed in D&aacute;il amendments on foot of the Seanad debate.  A number of other amendments are technical in nature, involving commas and spelling changes.  For example, the &ldquo;e&rdquo; was left out of &ldquo;judgement&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan or Senator Henry asked whether a doctor giving evidence to a fitness to practise committee would have immunity.  We have ensured that will be the case by making an amendment to that effect.</P>
        <P>With regard to the sections pertaining to conflict of interest and fitness to practise, we would all acknowledge that the decision to prescribe should not be contaminated by any beneficial interest in a pharmacy business.  After legal advice from the Attorney General, the view was taken that legal effect could best be given to this matter by way of conflict of interest provisions in the legislation.  These were introduced on Committee Stage in this House, as I had indicated when the Bill was published.  A lengthy debate took place and Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas were contacted.</P>
        <P>The intention was never to stop landlord and tenant arrangements.  Anybody in this country can own property and rent it out at normal market rates.  We never sought to prohibit that, although it was suggested that we did.  It was also suggested that we might foster ambiguity through the use of the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; and that &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; might be a more appropriate word.  I asked the Attorney General to advise on the matter and he felt &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; was the more appropriate word because, if somebody rents a premise, it is an economic relationship.</P><Col N="1985"/>
        <P>In a business with two partners, whether two doctors or two pharmacists, the Seanad amendments provide that both partners can be brought before the fitness to practise committee where one behaves unethically, which is clearly unfair to the person who has not transgressed.  We have provided that where a partner becomes aware of unethical behaviour, he or she has 21 days to report it to the regulator.  If the partner is unaware or knows nothing, he or she cannot be brought before the fitness to practise committee in respect of the activities of his or her partner.  I consider that fair and reasonable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the rubric of fitness to practise, we have given strong powers regarding unethical behaviour to the Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in regard to doctors and pharmacists, respectively, to ensure some of the behaviour we have heard about in this country can be properly investigated.  If the behaviour is found to recur, the society can take the ultimate step of having a practitioner struck off.  However, the legal bar will have to be high because the decision will have to stand a test in the courts.</P>
        <P>What we are doing in regard to this Bill is appropriate and ethical and will ensure prescribing and dispensing are not connected through any beneficial commercial arrangement.  Most people accept the Government&rsquo;s decision in that regard.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have addressed them briefly to be helpful to Senator Browne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will speak on the subject matter of all the groupings and Senator Browne will have one opportunity to speak before the Minister concludes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill in general, and the Minister has clarified several issues.  I am aware the IPU would have preferred a blanket ban on the collocation of pharmacies in primary care centres but I understand why that did not happen.  I am happy we have clearly set out in the legislation that pharmacies must have separate entrances to primary care centres.  I reiterate the need to introduce urgently the concept of writing clearly on a prescription that it can be used in any pharmacy in the country.  This will remove any doubt about an obligation to use the nearest pharmacy.  These are all important steps.  </P>
        <P>People ask what exactly is the purpose of the Bill, and I am still a bit confused.  We all spoke about the need to prevent a scenario where a doctor gains financially from a prescription because of an economic relationship whereby a pharmacist rents property from the doctor or where the turnover of a pharmacy is related to the rental income.  Clear conflicts of interest arise in these situations.</P>
        <P>For everyone&rsquo;s sake, will the Minister clarify whether a blatant capitalist can get involved in primary care centres, establish a few doctors there and rent space to a qualified pharmacist?  Does this Bill tell a doctor or a pharmacist that <Col N="1986"/>they cannot get involved in these areas?  I imagine this would go against constitutional rights.  I am sure everyone is entitled to own property and earn an income.  Does this Bill state to doctors and pharmacists that they cannot own these centres or they risk going before the Medical Council or pharmaceutical society respectively?</P>
        <P>It is important that we include a review mechanism to see how it works in practice.  It would be worthwhile if a guarantee could be given today that we will review this in three years&rsquo; time.  The next D&aacute;il, Seanad and Minister for Health and Children, who perhaps may be Deputy Harney again, can then see whether it has worked out as we envisages or requires further tweaking and fine-tuning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I read through the amendments made by the other House, most of which are technical and deal with typographical errors.  With regard to the section referred to by Senator Browne, the subject matter of the representations made to me are addressed in the Bill.  As a consequence, I am satisfied.  The Bill continues in the spirit of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act.  Having a prescriber and dispenser doing the same job is outlawed by the Bill and the pharmaceutical profession was anxious to ensure this happened.  If the Bill does nothing else, it has done fine work by doing this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To respond to Senator Browne, I am not sure I understand what &ldquo;blatant capitalist&rdquo; means.  I do not want to have a row with him about ideology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, I heard a doctor being interviewed on the radio.  He established a for-profit hospital but stated he did not do so for money.  I tried to figure out what he meant.  Pharmacists can own premises where doctors have a medical practice.  Doctors can own premises where pharmacists have a business.  A normal landlord and tenant relationship can exist between them and planning authorities can give planning approval for these facilities.</P>
        <P>If a group of doctors come together and advertise for someone to collocate with them and in a normal market situation the highest bidder is a pharmacist, no issue arises.  However, it would be prohibited for somebody to demand extraordinary amounts of money for a pharmacist to locate there.  It would not be normal market conditions and therefore outside the scope and would facilitate the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland or the Medical Council having an inquiry into fitness to practise.</P>
        <P>The Bill will not allow any unethical behaviour or any benefit to the doctor from having the pharmacist on the premises and <i>vice versa</i>.  A pharmacist, apart from those who sell other products, depends for his or her pharmacy business on prescriptions from doctors.  Being close by, whether beside one or in the same shopping mall, is a huge <Col N="1987"/>convenience and a bonus factor.  Other than those normal conditions, nothing can happen.</P>
        <P>With regard to a review, this is new and pioneering legislation.  It will give powers to the regulators, which is appropriate, to deal with these issues on the basis of fitness to practise and ethical guidelines.  The society must draw up such guidelines on foot of this Bill.  I am a strong fan of those being regulated having an understanding of what is required and permitted.  This will be a challenge for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and I have great confidence in its capacity to be able to do it.</P>

It has been passed by the Oireachtas, completed its parliamentary process and within the next ten days will be signed into law by the President.  It is truly an historic moment for pharmacists, the pharmacy profession and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I especially thank Members of the House, the Bills Office which was put under enormous pressure, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and, last but not least, Mr. Colm Desmond and Mr. Tom McGuinn, who sat behind me during the debate, and Mr. Tom Monks who is not present today.  These three officials worked extraordinarily hard under a very tight deadline to ensure this became law.</P>
        <P>I gave a commitment that this Bill would be passed into law on my watch, which is not to state I do not intend to have a watch after the rendezvous with reality in a few weeks&rsquo; time.  I was determined this would be done and I am very pleased it has been.  It provides a modern framework for the regulation of the pharmacy profession in Ireland.  It is long overdue and it is terrific we now have it.  It will be a cause of great solace to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  I thank it and the IPU which made invaluable contributions to the formation of the Bill at many stages.  Their contributions were insightful, well informed and helpful and the Bill is the stronger for their co-operation and input.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, her officials and the Bills Office for their assistance.  I have a greater understanding of the health services after four weeks of debating health Bills in the House.  I thank the IPU, the Irish Pharmaceutical Society and the hospital pharmacists for their assistance.  I acknowledge the role played by the Irish Pharmaceutical Society during the past 135 years and wish it continued success in its new guise and role.  It has plenty of work ahead of it.  The legislation has put a great onus on it.</P>
        <P>I am not 100% convinced we did the right thing in the Bill and it remains to be seen how it works in practice.  My main concern is that when <Col N="1988"/>patients go to a doctor, they are not prescribed drugs because of commercial interest.  I hope this never happens and I hope no one is prescribed or over-prescribed drugs he or she does not need.  The main aim of the Bill is to ensure patient safety.</P>
        <P>The business world is unusual and it is difficult to prove matters after a while, which was proved recently by tribunals of inquiry.  Although we may have heard innuendo about politicians in the past, many of us in the House have been flabbergasted by the truth, which was much worse than any of us ever suspected.  I hope the Bill will go some way in regulating this area.  Although I would have been happier to see a built-in review, perhaps we will ensure it happens when Fine Gael is in Government and Deputy Twomey is Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may as well dream here as in bed.</P>
        <P>As the spokesperson for health and children on this side of the House, I am very pleased to have been associated with the passing of this legislation.  I compliment the Minister, as others have done, who has been very pioneering with legislation in general, and not just this.  I also compliment the IPU and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, who could give lectures on how to appropriately make representations.  Their representations were very balanced, well researched and very well informed.  I know many of them and only in the past few days I have spoken to a number of them.  They are happy with the legislation in the main.</P>
        <P>This legislation is long overdue and in the fullness of time, although there may be doubt from some quarters over its potential effectiveness, I am convinced it will present itself as very well informed and useful legislation.  It will not alone serve the pharmaceutical profession well, but society in general.  The latter group is what it is all about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I add some words of congratulations.  The Bill is very comprehensive and was clearly not simple.  It takes the place of Acts dating back to 1875.  I congratulate the Minister for the manner in which it was taken.  The heart of the Bill was patient safety and health, and the officials and content of the Bill have taken this into account very capably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers in offering my congratulations to the Minister and her officials in bringing forward this piece of legislation.  The points made are valid and great recognition is due to the commitment shown by the Minister in bringing forward this legislation and honouring the promise she has given since she took over as Minister for Health and Children to replace legislation which was lacking.</P>
        <P>Senator Browne is not sure that we have got it right, but I have not seen any amendments suggesting it would have been any different if it had come from Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments were put down.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1989"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all interested in patient safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator had his opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments were put down on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The prescription of drugs is done by doctors, not by pharmacists, who would dispense the drugs.  That is the difference between them.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the IPU for approaching this legislation in the manner that they did and the contributions they made behind the scenes in informing people and stating the case, as Senator Glynn noted.  It was very difficult legislation in that it had to acknowledge the commercial realities, company law and the Constitution while affording people the rights to trade and enter into business.  It equally seeks to protect the interests of patients and ensure their safety.</P>
        <P>With this legislation we now have recognition of the role of pharmacists and pharmacies as an integral part of our health service.  For all those professionals working and in contact with so many members of the public on a daily basis, the legislation gives them the due recognition they deserve.  By building on this I hope we will see far greater use of pharmacists in delivering a comprehensive health service in this country which the public so richly deserves.</P>

    <Title>Consumer Protection Bill 2007 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill that has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister of State will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House.  Senators may contribute once on each grouping.  The only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The first grouping deals with amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive; 10; 12 to 19, inclusive; 22 and 23; 30 to 35, inclusive; 41 to 45, inclusive; and 51.  These are technical drafting amendments proposed on the advice of the Office of the <Col N="1990"/>Parliamentary Counsel in order to remove possible legal uncertainty, ensure consistency between different sections of the Bill, or correct grammatical or typographical errors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second group deals with the function of the agency as relating to financial services.  It relates to amendments Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11, 24, 25 and 49.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The second group of amendments amends the Central Bank Act 1942 to make the enforcement of the unfair commercial practices provisions of the Bill a statutory function of the bank and the consumer director of the financial regulator in the case of regulated financial service providers.</P>
        <P>The amendments provide the regulator with the necessary powers of investigation regarding breaches of the provisions of the Bill.  The amendments include particular provisions specifying the financial regulator as a body with whom the agency shall enter into a co-operation agreement as provided for in section 21 of the Bill, as well as allowing for the disclosure of certain information between the regulator and the agency.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Act 1942 is further amended to assign to the financial regulator parallel functions given to the agency under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995.  The effect of this amendment will enable the financial regulator to apply to the High Court for orders prohibiting the use of terms in contracts for financial services which the court adjudges to be unfair.  Specific provision is also made in the amendments to ensure that there is no duplication of activities on the part of the financial regulator and the agency and further to prevent any person being subject to enforcement action by more than one party to a co-operation agreement.</P>
        <P>These amendments were introduced having regard to the financial regulator&rsquo;s particular expertise in regulating financial service providers and also take cognisance of the specific statutory responsibility given to the financial regulator to promote consumers&rsquo; interests in the financial services sector.  The amendments set out the basis on which the agency and the financial regulator shall work together to ensure that consumers of financial services can enjoy the important protections provided for in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The fourth group deals with the prohibition of surcharges and includes amendments Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive, 36, 38 to 40, inclusive, and 46.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>We just dealt with group 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We dealt with groups 2 and 3.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is correct.  The third group relates to the functions <Col N="1991"/>of the agency generally and includes amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, 20, 21 and 48.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments involve changes to various provisions in Part 2 dealing with the National Consumer Agency.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 48 involve new provisions dealing with the agency&rsquo;s role in promoting quality assurance schemes.  They arose from an amendment proposed by Senator Coghlan that had merit and that the Minister, Deputy Martin, undertook to consider.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 concern the position of the chief executive of the agency.  Amendment No. 6 provides that, notwithstanding the restrictions of section 14(8), persons who cease to be the chief executive officer are not precluded from holding employment with or acting as consultants to public bodies, Ministers or Departments.  Amendment No. 7 sets out the basis on which the chief executive officer will give evidence before committees of the Oireachtas.  It provides that the chief executive officer will, when requested, give evidence before such committees, the business of which includes the examination of consumer protection policy, in respect of the general activities of the agency.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 remove the restriction that records, documents, etc. obtained by authorised officers in exercise of their powers under section 30 may only be retained for six months.  Similar restrictions in the legislation governing the activities of the Competition Authority and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement have caused difficulties to both organisations and it was not considered prudent to include them in this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful that the Minister took on board the arguments made in this House and included them in the Bill.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments in group 4 introduce new provisions concerning no discrimination and transparency in terms of the method chosen by customers to pay for goods and services.  The introduction arose from an amendment proposed by Senator Cox on Committee Stage, which the House will recall the Minister undertook to consider.</P>
        <P>The principal new provision in the amendments prohibits traders from imposing additional charges by reason of a person paying for goods or services by means of any of the relevant methods prescribed in the amendments &mdash; cash, credit card or direct debit &mdash; as distinct from any other relevant method.  The amendments provide that an additional charge is deemed to have been imposed if the price charged by the trader for a product where a customer uses one of the relevant methods is greater than the price charged for the product where one of the other relevant methods is used.  The amendments also empower the Minister to prescribe other methods of payment as relevant methods for the purposes of the Act.</P><Col N="1992"/>
        <P>The other main provision introduced by these amendments provides that traders who impose additional charges by reason of method of payment and who, by virtue of only accepting payment by one method or by imposing the same charge in respect of different relevant methods of payment, fall outside the scope of the no discrimination provision referred to earlier must include those additional charges within any statement or representation of the price of goods or services.</P>
        <P>Senators may be aware that the introduction of these amendments has given rise to concerns among a number of traders, especially traders in the travel trade.  While I am mindful of the concerns expressed by those traders and their trade associations, I am satisfied that, on balance, the proposed provisions have considerable merit, especially from a consumer protection point of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it possible to ask the Minister of State to clarify a point or would that constitute my contribution to this group?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will be speaking to group 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment that will allow organisations that only accept one type of payment to be excluded from the prohibition on surcharges will also allow bodies such as Ticketmaster, which sells many tickets via the Internet, to make additional credit card charges.  I am not sure I understand the amendment correctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Cox&rsquo;s point because she initiated this amendment.  She prepared a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, but she achieved more by including the provision in this Bill.  I hope the response fulfils what she set out to achieve, namely, to ensure prohibitive charges on credit cards will not be allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I expressed that concern on a previous Stage.  Regarding the travel trade&rsquo;s concerns, of which I learned since we last debated this Bill, I accept what the Minister of State is trying to achieve, but I do not want to do something that could diminish or wipe out a number of our valuable travel agencies in various towns.  By forcing them into awkward trading situations, this provision could obliterate them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cox&rsquo;s point relates to the new section 49, which is being provided in amendment No. 27.  The import of the section is that traders who accept payments by one method only would not have been captured by the new section 48 which seeks to equalise the methods of payment.  The new section 49 imposes an obligation on the trader to be transparent in respect of payments.  For example, if there is a surcharge for a payment made via the only acceptable method, the trader is obliged to include it in the advertised price.</P>
        <P>The travel trade has made its concerns known to us all.  It points out that it incurs an additional cost due to the surcharge imposed when payment <Col N="1993"/>is made by credit card.  The Minister and the Department have taken account of the points made, but it did not prove possible to address them in section 48 or section 49 without diminishing the consumer protection inherent in the new sections.</P>
        <P>Not only is it Government policy, there is significant agreement on the need to move to a cashless society.  There are costs associated with payments by cash for the State and others.  The Minister continues to examine the means open to him to ameliorate the effect on the travel trade in the short term, but it was not possible to make a provision in the Bill that would meet the trade&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying that point.  The Bill has been strengthened by these provisions and I welcome that the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department&rsquo;s officials took this matter on board in a proactive manner.  The Minister of State might allude to when the regulations will be put in place.</P>
        <P>Consumers who have faced unfair charges that create additional profit for providers will be grateful for the Bill.  The real issue is the strengthening of the National Consumer Agency.  The challenge for society is to ensure we continue to force service providers to provide good value for money and to protect consumers.  I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for taking on board my concerns in a positive manner and for following through on the commitment given to the Seanad, namely, to bring the amendment to the D&aacute;il and to include it in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 5 relates to observing the weighing of purchases and is the subject matter of amendment No. 29.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a substantive amendment to Part 3 not relating to the payment method provisions already discussed.  This amendment is a reworking of an amendment tabled by Deputy Hogan to section 57 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad.  It supplements the requirement on grocery retailers under the section to allow any person purchasing a non-prepacked food product to weigh the product or observe its weighing by specifying that this must be done in a manner that allows the person to see the reading of the weight and to be informed of the price before paying for the product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is just one amendment in Group 6 &mdash; amendment No. 37, which provides for representations to be made on behalf of traders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment no. 37 is the only substantive amendment to Part 5 that is not one of the amendments relating to payment methods and the Financial Regulator which have already been discussed.  It seeks to close off a possible loophole that might have enabled traders to evade the obligation on them under section 66 of the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, to establish the <Col N="1994"/>truth of a factual claim in an advertisement they had commissioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 7 consists of amendments Nos. 47 and 50, which relate to directions under certain instruments in respect of product safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 47 and 50 introduce new provisions in the area of product safety.  They will make it an offence to distribute, sell, offer for sale or supply a product that is the subject of a direction by the agency prohibiting the placing of that product on the market, requiring the withdrawal of the product from the market or imposing other restrictions on placing the product on the market.  Any such direction can be issued by the agency under a range of statutory instruments which govern general and specific product safety, as set out in Schedule 7.  The statutory instruments transpose EU Council directives relating to product safety, as set out in Schedule 8.  The amendments will add to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement powers in the area of product safety, thereby helping to ensure that consumers can have greater confidence in the safety of the products they buy.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Martin, for following through on the commitments they gave the House on the Bill, as Senator Cox has said.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for tidying up and closing certain loopholes.  We all agree that the Bill has been improved somewhat as a result.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State say that a small outstanding issue will be the subject of continuing attention.  Perhaps a resolution will be found &mdash; it was not possible to do that within the scope of the Bill, as the Minister of State said.  It would be positive if the genuine concern of the travel trade could be addressed.  I accept the word of the Minister of State on the matter.  In general, the House is happy with the thrust and aims of the Bill.  I compliment the Minister of State and his officials on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and their senior officials who have put a great deal of work into the Bill.  It is appropriate that worthwhile amendments, especially those proposed by Senator Cox, who has done some pioneering work on excessive credit card costs and charges, have been recognised by the Minister and the Minister of State.  They were prepared to amend the Bill in the D&aacute;il before bringing it back to the Seanad.  When I was a Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, I was always pleased to benefit from the wisdom of Members of the Seanad and to include the amendments they proposed, where possible. <Col N="1995"/> I remember the former Senator Kennedy from Limerick, who was very involved in legislating and put forward numerous worthwhile amendments.  It is encouraging to those of us who are coming to the end of our terms &mdash; and hopefully returning for another &mdash; that Ministers are prepared to accept amendments.  I thank my opposite number, Senator Coghlan, who has been most helpful, encouraging and supportive of useful legislation as Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesman for enterprise, trade and employment.  I wish him well in the forthcoming elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen; the Minister, Deputy Martin; and their officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the open and proactive manner in which they have taken on board the thoughts of Senators on credit card surcharges.  They agreed it was not right that companies were allowed to impose additional charges on people who use credit cards to do their business over the telephone, on the Internet or in person in shops and offices.  I thank the various consumer agencies who contacted me to support what I was trying to do in this campaign.  In particular, I thank Mr. Pat Farrell of the Irish Banking Federation, who ensured that I was fully briefed on the views of the federation&rsquo;s member organisations.  I am pleased that the various interests have committed to try to move towards a cashless society, which is important from a security point of view if we are to protect the welfare of people in their everyday lives.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking on board the amendments which were proposed by Senators on Committee Stage, which is always helpful.  The Minister of State introduced proposals in the D&aacute;il on foot of our suggestions, as he said he would do, and then brought the D&aacute;il amendments back to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Martin, and on my own behalf, I thank Senators for their co-operation and support in passing this legislation.  I also thank the staff of the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General who did a huge amount of work in this regard.  I compliment the staff of <Col N="1996"/>the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in particular, on the work they have done on this legislation, which is the first major domestic consumer Bill to be introduced for over a quarter of a century.  I hope the Bill, which draws together ten separate legislative provisions, will make this sector more accessible and easier to understand for all participants in the market.  It will go a long way towards giving Irish consumers a modern, progressive consumer protection code.  The Bill&rsquo;s provisions on unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices will give consumers an updated and comprehensive range of protections.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators, as well as my colleagues in the D&aacute;il, for suggesting ideas that we were able to incorporate in this legislation.  The spirit of the Oireachtas dictates that good ideas should be incorporated in legislation, regardless of where they come from.  Senators Cox and Coghlan asked when the section 48 provisions will be implemented and will come into effect.  The Minister will consider every means available to him to lessen the negative impact that might be felt by the travel trade.  He will see what he can do in that regard.  This is not the last legislation I will present to the Seanad before the upcoming elections.  I expect to return to the House on 26 April next with another Bill.  I will see Senators on that occasion.</P>
