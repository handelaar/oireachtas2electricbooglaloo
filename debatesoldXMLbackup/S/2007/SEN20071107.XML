	<P>I have received notice from Senator Keaveney that, on the adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to clarify the delay in providing an important facility for the RNLI in Buncrana, County Donegal and the implications for safety at sea if this continues.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to review the community employment schemes programme in order to allow all existing participants over 50 years of age to continue to work on the schemes until age 65 if they are unable to gain alternative employment, particularly where evidence exists that such is the case.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to give an update on the decentralisation of Foras Na Gaeilge to Gweedore, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to provide an update on the progress made towards delivering integrated ticketing for public transport.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide an update on the progress and implementation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na-local authority joint policing <Col N="1006"/>committees provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the urgent need for the provision of a new national school at Ballygarven, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Keaveney, Coghlan and &Oacute; Domhnaill and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Donohoe, Leyden and Buttimer may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the community child care subvention scheme 2008-2010, which shall be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and which shall, if not previously concluded, adjourn not later than 5 p.m. and resume, if not previously concluded, on Tuesday next, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and No. 11, motion 32 on energy security and climate control, which shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 1.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to have a debate on breast cancer services before the House takes No. 1.  Senators will share my concerns about what has emerged since the House last met.  Women&rsquo;s faith in the health service appears to have been permanently damaged.  In light of information which has emerged in recent days, every woman who has had a test for cancer will wonder whether her test result was accurate.  Since the House last met, eight women who underwent tests in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, have been diagnosed with cancer, having earlier experienced the wonderful relief of being given the all-clear.  A further six women now face the agony of being retested to determine if earlier tests failed to diagnose cancer.</P>
        <P>While there is scope for cross-party work on this issue, the Taoiseach is behaving as if he has not been in Government Buildings for the past ten years.  It is as if he has suddenly woken up and is asking what is happening.  Fianna F&aacute;il Party Ministers, namely, Deputies Martin and Cowen, had responsibility for health for ten years.</P>
        <P>Why is the plan for cancer services not being implemented?  A report produced seven years ago concluded that specialist centres were needed.  Senators will share my concern about the <Col N="1007"/>lack of a timetable for the implementation of these specialist centres.  In addition, answers to questions about resources have not been forthcoming.  What resources will be made available?  The House should debate breast cancer services to give every Senator an opportunity to speak on the issue.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the response to concerns raised about a 15 year old machine being used in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The Government accepted a pay hike yesterday, yet a 15 year old machine was not replaced when this matter was brought to the attention of the Health Service Executive.  I am also concerned about the breakdown in communications between the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  The health service looks like a ship without a captain.  Accountability appears to be absent and it is not clear who is in charge or responsible for what is happening.  For all these reasons, I request a debate on breast cancer services.  I move the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only right, proper and sensitive that the House debate the health services.  While I support the proposal, it does not need to be taken before No. 1.  After 7 p.m. may be an appropriate time, as people could get organised.</P>
        <P>I am loath to get involved in a blame game, but we must examine the matter seriously.  Benchmarks should be put in place in terms of what we expect from the health service and objectives for waiting lists, accident and emergency queues and cancer care should be set out during the next two years.  People should be given one year to do what is expected before they reappear before the House to determine whether they have delivered.  We should support or criticise them depending on whether things get done.</P>
        <P>The House should debate the serious issue raised by the leader of the Opposition, Senator Fitzgerald.  Each time there are problems, whether in terms of planning permission, interpretative centres and so on, people believe the situation will be improved if the politicians are removed.  However, people ask about who is responsible the minute the politicians have been removed.  Good or bad, we decided to take this matter out of politicians&rsquo; hands.  We should reconsider the issue.</P>
        <P>I regret that I did not have the opportunity to make this point last week, but I call for a debate on the report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  The body produced an excellent report, works for little pay and examines something that must be addressed.  It exists because people would not trust politicians to do its work.  The Taoiseach was 100% <Col N="1008"/>correct to accept his pay increase.  He would have been a laughing stock in the country&rsquo;s pubs and elsewhere had he turned it down.</P>
        <P>What should the Taoiseach be paid?  I am regularly involved in negotiations.  The body looked after our salaries five years and ten years ago.  The Taoiseach is paid less than one tenth of the amount paid to someone running a bank, one half of the amount paid to a consultant and somewhat less than the only published figure for an amount paid to a daily newspaper editor.  What should the Taoiseach be paid and what increase should he be given later?</P>
        <P>I have examined the matter and there is no fair international comparison.  Has anyone examined how much Members of other Parliaments receive in expenses?  Peter Robinson and Gerry Adams, Westminster MPs, claimed expenses of nearly &euro;250,000 each last year.  We should compare like with like, read the information and discuss the issues.  If we do not like who is the Taoiseach, we should get rid of him or her, which is a different ball game.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach will recall that the House addressed this matter previously.  During the benchmarking process, some of my esteemed colleagues did not want to accept their increases.  The Minister for Finance and I came up with the idea of a salary increase opt-out.  The Taoiseach should bring that idea to the Cabinet.  As to those whingers who, on the one hand, state they do not want increases but, on the other, put it in their back pockets, at the next Cabinet meeting the Taoiseach should give them little forms to sign for pay increases.  If they do not sign, they can do without the increases instead of having it both ways, namely, whinging about it into microphones and going to banks with it at the end of the month.  It is not on.  We should support the review body and debate the report.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on cancer services.  Political accountability is a fundamental part of this discussion and Senator O&rsquo;Toole touched on this, the notion that politics should be taken out of politics, in other words, that difficult issues should be taken out of politics.  While the Taoiseach is bemused that people wish to politicise the issue, the question of health service funding and resourcing is a political one.  Is there another way to describe it?  Money for a serious public service was voted by the Oireachtas and the HSE, having been warned some time ago, knew of issues with the hospital equipment.  The Taoiseach, members of the Government and all parties to the Government have a political responsibility to account to the public and to the Houses for what is happening in the health <Col N="1009"/>service.  For that reason, I support the call for a debate in this House.  Ministers can go on radio and television and make themselves available for debates, and if this House is to be relevant, I see no reason a Minister cannot come here and deliver political accountability for an issue that is important to people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely raised the issue of political accountability when he asked about the Health Service Executive and who is responsible and in charge.  The HSE was established to ensure efficiency in the management of health services.  This essential reason was backed up by concerns and allegations about local councillors.  It was never supposed to be an alibi to allow the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health and Children to say the issues are not their doing but somebody else&rsquo;s.  The Taoiseach has said that and Members of the Government have suggested that certain health matters are not matters for the Government.  The Leader of the Seanad has also said that such issues are matters for the HSE.  Although this may be true day to day, Ministers should account for themselves in this House.  If they can do it in the D&aacute;il and the media, they can do it here too.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Deputy Leader of the Seanad, Senator Boyle, to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to address this House on the possible legislation required and permitted for the use of Garda surveillance as evidence in courts and criminal proceedings, which the Minister has outlined.  We would like to give him the opportunity to come to this House and outline the requirements of the Oireachtas in support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I commend the Garda on last Friday&rsquo;s highly publicised operation in Celbridge connected with a planned security van robbery.  It was professionally organised and I congratulate Assistant Commissioner Martin Donnellan, Chief Superintendent Noel White, Superintendent Tom Neville and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation which led the operation.  I also congratulate the garda&iacute; involved in the other two successful Kildare operations over the weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Leyden seek a debate?  We will see what the Deputy Leader has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the point.  While Garda surveillance is legal, it is not allowed as evidence in court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want Senators to comment on anything before the courts.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1010"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  I compliment the Garda on the wonderful operation.  The Minister said he requires extra support and legislation to allow surveillance and phone tapping to be used in such cases.  We should support the Minister and the Government in the fight against crime.  Either the criminals or the citizens will win.  We must uphold the law and fight to ensure we, not the criminals, win.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful if we could have a debate soon on the needs of elderly people, especially those in nursing homes.  The nursing homes support scheme Bill is to be published soon and it will be an interesting debate about the financing of nursing home care.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, will be involved in the registration and inspection of nursing homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is another aspect to the experience of life of our elderly in nursing homes, namely, loneliness.  When the Cathaoirleach recently launched Muintir na T&iacute;re&rsquo;s community alert awareness week it was disclosed that loneliness was responsible for the majority of calls by elderly people to monitored home alarm systems.  Most of us have visited elderly people in nursing homes.  Despite the best efforts of staff, elderly people are often in a television room watching programmes that are not age appropriate and have no relevance to their experience or their state of capacity.</P>
        <P>I would like to think that we would address not just the financial issues around nursing homes.  RTE Lyric FM, for example, exists for a section of the community which is clearly represented and has a voice.  Elderly people have no comparable service in television or radio.  The hand that rocked the cradle in the past might not have been a maternal or paternal one but it was a caring hand nonetheless.  These people are now often without a voice.  It is time this House debated, in a holistic way, the needs of elderly people, particularly with regard to nursing homes.  I hope that debate will be facilitated soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in seeking a debate on the HSE and cancer services.  While I cannot support an amendment to the Order of Business, I am confident the Deputy Leader will try his best to accede to the wishes of the House for a thorough debate on the health service generally and on what, at times, appear to be independent actions by the HSE.  There must be accountability, and there have been a number of incidents in recent days that are unacceptable to the public, not least Professor Drumm&rsquo;s suggestion that public protest was in some way responsible for negatives in the system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>That was extremely shocking.  If it had been a Member of the Oireachtas, regardless of party, there would have been calls for their resignation from one end of the country to the other.  It is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>It would be of great benefit to have a thorough debate on the matter.  Some weeks ago I welcomed the concept of centres of excellence but there have been many developments since then in terms of the criteria for establishing them.  As an aspiration, they are certainly good and Members would support them but, clearly, there are many problems.  This is the single most important issue facing people today.  As we have seen, Portlaoise is a major problem.  I appeal to the Deputy Leader to arrange this debate as a matter of the utmost urgency.  The people are the single most important concern of the Oireachtas and we are losing sight of that in the interests of the opinions of management consultants and some people&rsquo;s selective interpretations of international best practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, for the second time this session I call for a debate on balanced regional development, with specific reference to the national spatial strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Like many other Members I am concerned about yet another breast cancer crisis and I deplore the incorrect diagnoses that have been given to eight women in Portlaoise.  I feel for the six women who are currently waiting and worrying.  These women have been wronged by our health system, despite the fact that, yet again, advance warning was given by letter noting the faulty, old and often dirty equipment that was being used to read these results.  It was warned that this could lead to unreliable results.  A similar warning letter issued in the case of Barringtons Hospital in Limerick.  Is anybody listening to these warnings?  Who is listening to the health experts when they write these letters?  Who is accountable in the HSE?  Is the Minister for Health and Children being informed of these letters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator supporting the amendment?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is agreed to, everybody will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seconding the call for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Members wish to speak.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1012"/>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I received a call from a woman who said she had waited, worried and been given the all clear.  She wanted to know if that result was still valid.  How reliable are the results that have been given to other women throughout the country?  These results have not had the benefit of being read by a multidisciplinary team.  Are they valid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the debate, Senator.  I wish to allow as many speakers as possible to contribute on the Order of Business and if the amendment is supported, there will be a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s point.  On a separate issue, I note the speech by the president of DCU at the graduation ceremony this week about the need to look at other ways, not necessarily reliant on the points system, of assisting secondary students in securing places in third level education.  Unfortunately, the concept of a lottery was not helpful but it is timely to examine and debate the issue of entry to third level education.  I spent yesterday with 50 leaving certificate students and having listened to them, and others around the country, it is clear that the points system does not serve the needs of second level students.  Some 20% of our students under-perform and drop out after junior certificate level.  I would appreciate if the Acting Leader arranged for a debate on entry to third level education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to hear the concerns I and other Members have with regard to the policy she proposes to introduce for gaelscoileanna, namely, two and a half hours of obligatory instruction through English.  I was at a meeting last night in Greystones, where a new gaelscoil is proposed.  Many of the parents and those involved in Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Scoileanna L&aacute;n-Ghaeilge have expressed their concerns that this will undermine their policy of total immersion, which applies in the early years of gaelscoil education.  The Minister should come to the House and listen to the concerns being expressed.  The argument being made by the gaelscoileanna is, that at the least, the Minister should base her decision on research into the effectiveness of total immersion education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of other Senators on the situation in Portlaoise, where a number of people who were told last year that they did not have cancer have now been told they have the disease.  While I agree the issue should not be made a political football, there are important lessons to be learned from this disaster.  One can only imagine the torment, <Col N="1013"/>upset and misery brought about by human failure, or whatever source, for these people.  We need to learn from this disaster and ensure that it is never allowed to be repeated.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator MacSharry and the former Leader of the House, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, in their outright condemnation of the flippant comments by the chief executive of the HSE on this issue.  We cannot blame public protest for a systems failure, particularly where the state of the equipment was brought to the attention of the hospital management.  It is a bit rich to see political immunity being granted to the political system, no matter who is the Minister for Health and Children.  The HSE is masking responsibility on this issue, which is not right.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Two members of the current Cabinet have said they would be agreeable to revisiting the pay increase issue.  It is not right or proper to compare the Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary with that of the CEO of a bank, as the Taoiseach runs a country, not a bank.  In the context of the pay increase, we need to consider other comparable situations, namely, the situation of leaders of other countries within the European Union.  In that league alone, the Taoiseach is way out on his own.  The sum of money involved, &euro;38,000, is not insignificant.</P>
        <P>The Acting Leader said in his opening comments that an issue may be raised next Tuesday.  Will he confirm whether the House will sit next Tuesday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, and the week before, I raised the question of whether the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could come to the House to discuss the boundary commission report and the possibility of setting up a cross-party committee to discuss the electoral system.  Has the Acting Leader anything to report on that matter?</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the need for more balanced regional development.  Other Senators have also called for this debate which would be of benefit, particularly prior to the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Fitzgerald and others who commented on the tragic situation of the women who attended Portlaoise hospital.  I do not know at what rate such machinery goes out of date or whether 15 years is excessive, but it is intolerable that we might have equipment that does not function properly because it is dirty.  There is a serious issue of cleanliness and hygiene throughout the hospital system and a problem with management.  Management did not address the issue because if it did so, it would have led to expenditure.  There is plenty of expenditure for managers but, in the <Col N="1014"/>interests of patients, there also should be expenditure for services and equipment.</P>

        <P>On 18 October, I raised the fact that the Defamation Bill was being introduced on Committee Stage rather than on Second Stage.  At the time, the Leader, Senator Donie Cassidy, said it would be sensible to reintroduce the Defamation Bill on Second Stage as 35 of the 60 Members of the Seanad are new since the Bill was previously discussed on Second Stage.  Does the Government propose to be sensible, as Senator Cassidy said, or does it propose to be foolish as newspaper proprietors would wish?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a debate on rendition, perhaps when the Irish Human Rights Commission issues its report on that subject?  I understand the report will be very damaging.  The head of the commission, former Senator Maurice Manning, is a pretty restrained person with a distinguished record in this House.  He indicated that the Government had been trying to interfere with this report and that if it continued to do so it would have &ldquo;a bloody fight on their hands&rdquo;.  The commission has been infuriated by the Government&rsquo;s attempts to soften what may well be a damning report on rendition.  It will confirm what people, especially those on this side of the House, have had to say about the subject.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we can examine an issue of concern which was revealed in the <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last weekend under the heading &ldquo;Garda&iacute; remove non-EU students from school&rdquo;.  If this report is correct, it is an astonishing thing to have the country&rsquo;s police force entering the education system.  The report stated: &ldquo;Several school principals in Dublin&rsquo;s inner city have been contacted by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in the last six months and told that some of their students will have to cease attending immediately, regardless of what stage they are at in their education.&rdquo;  The principals in these schools are outraged by this.</P>
        <P>It would be appropriate if at some stage we paid tribute to the extraordinary work of Nuala O&rsquo;Loan who has just retired as Police Ombudsman in the North of Ireland.</P>

	<P>I wish to add my voice to those seeking a debate on cancer <Col N="1015"/>services.  A number of years ago, I went to London to meet some of the main members of Europa Donna.  Their central point was for politicians not to be political about the issue of cancer services and that the most important thing was for patients to have access to a more holistic and multidisciplinary service.  We must ensure we have the best possible survival rates and not necessarily the closest location for treatment.  As a politician it is difficult to say that without the remarks being taken up in a different way.</P>
        <P>This is male cancer awareness week and, as a woman, I am not in any way undermining the issue of breast cancer screening.  Sometimes, however, other cancers which can be equally lethal need to be kept to the fore of public awareness.  If we are to have a discussion on cancer services it should concern all cancers, including male cancers.  Prostate cancer, for example, is as much if not more of a killer than other forms of cancer that may be more commonly spoken about.</P>
        <P>A new report from the principals of various primary schools in Dublin 15 has found that some teachers are afraid to report misbehaviour by immigrant children to their parents for fear those children will be physically abused because they have a different culture to ours.  If such children misbehave their parents may take the matter more seriously than happens in our own culture.  The report also revealed a lack of social skills among some newcomer children, which is leading to disruption.  It also reported that some children from certain countries had less respect for female teachers.  I am not sure whether this is a matter for the Department of Education and Science, which is doing great work in providing English language supports for immigrant children, or a matter for the Minister of State with responsibility for integration.  In any case, I seek a debate on the outstanding education issues being experienced in multi-ethnic schools.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Transport should attend the House at some point.  New legislation from the EU will deal with noise from modified car exhausts.  There is an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today about boy racers, particularly in Donegal, and on the renewed clampdown on their cars.  Coming from a county that has suffered drastically due to the deaths of young males, it is important that this issue is taken seriously.  If these boy racers get a kick from noisy exhausts, then we must examine the new EU legislation that is being introduced.  I ask <Col N="1016"/>that the Minister for Transport come before the House to explain the implications of that legislation and how we are to implement it, to ensure it is effectively enforced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join with my colleagues in saying that cancer services should not be subject to a political discussion, but I agree that we must have a debate on what is a very serious issue.  These are not numbers, but women waiting to hear whether they have the all clear in terms of their health.  They have been deprived of an early diagnosis, which is so important when dealing with breast cancer.  The BreastCheck service is available in Offaly at the moment and I ask that it remain there a little longer, which might go some way to reassure the women that are suffering, worrying, wondering and waiting.</P>
        <P>I would also like to raise the issue about the poor girl in Australia who lost her life in a car accident.  Her mother was requested to produce a certificate to show that her daughter&rsquo;s body was free from infection, despite the fact that she had donated her organs and that the Australian authorities had given her the all clear.  In a time of such stress and anxiety, the idea of having to wait to obtain clearance from our Government is absolutely appalling.  As our national airline is no longer what it was, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should also explain Government policy on the transporting home from abroad of the remains of our loved ones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in calling for a debate on cancer services.  We must have clarification on this and I have no doubt the Minister will be anxious to debate the issue in this House.  Senator Mullen spoke about the needs of the elderly, which is an issue that is close to my heart.  That brings us back to a debate that I looked for earlier on the role of society.  It is important that the elderly in our society are looked after and not neglected and cast aside.  The Leader should arrange for the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Hoctor, to give this House an outline of her brief and how to move in the right direction.  We need to think about life and those beyond the norms of everyday society.</P>
        <P>Another area that is very important to me is how Irish Aid helps the poor in the developing world.  There was a White Paper on this issue two years ago and it is important to have an update on how it is working on the ground.  More than &euro;370 million was spent on Irish Aid in the past two years and by 2012 we are expected to reach the overseas development aid target of 0.7% of GNP.  We should know how and where that money is being spent.  The Irish people deserve to know this.  In the near future, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State with <Col N="1017"/>responsibility for Irish Aid should come before the House to provide a detailed update on the White Paper.  Having listened to Niall Mellon report on the Township Trust on which he is working at present, I believe the Government should enter into a partnership and I welcome its move to enter discussions with him.  Another issues concerns how the Government works with other stakeholders to ensure that value for money is obtained.  I am somewhat worried about this subject, which is very close to my thinking.  I seek a detailed update on the White Paper in that regard.</P>

	<P>I note reports that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is already considering the deferral of those income tax cuts he promised six months ago, despite asking people at the time to trust him in this regard.  I hope this change in economic scenery will not result in his slashing of budgets in sectors such as the arts.  Yesterday I learned the Arts Council seeks funding of &euro;100 million this year to help provide funding for 1,700 applications it receives from projects such as the Drogheda Samba Festival or the proposed new archive for the Irish Film Institute in Dundalk.  While Ireland has a global reputation as a country of culture, most other European countries spend a greater proportion of their gross domestic product on the arts than do we.  I ask the Deputy Leader to impress on the Minister that he must ensure that funding for the arts is maintained and, if possible, increased.</P>

	<P>In common with other Senators, I call for a debate on breast cancer services.  Unfortunately, for obvious reasons I do not support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  However, I liked Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposal to hold such a debate later this evening or perhaps tomorrow at the latest.  Last night, I listened keenly to a lady who appeared on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme with whom I grew up and went to school in Tullamore.  I noted she stated that politicians fighting would not help her or any other woman and Members should bear in mind this when this issue is debated.</P>

They also should be made aware they are in the thoughts and prayers of Members, who will do what they can for them.</P>
        <P>It is also important not to scare away other women.  This morning I heard a Professor O&rsquo;Keeffe state that negative results rarely or never come from a BreastCheck clinic or dedicated breast unit.  This must be borne in mind and people must be made aware of it.  It is also important to point out to women who may be listening that, unfortunately, 2,000 women present every year with breast cancer, the majority of whom are treated effectively and receive treatment for their breast cancer.  It is important to point out this and Members must not engage in scaremongering.</P>

	<P>As Senator Keaveney noted, the country has experienced another week of horrific deaths on its roads.  Members should remind themselves that each death constitutes a tragedy for a family.  This week I was stunned to learn that this year alone, the number of speeding offences detected by the Garda came to 116,000.  There must be a change in mindset in this regard.  Ireland led the way in respect of the smoking ban, the plastic bag tax and a number of other areas.  We should find a way to become leaders in making it no longer acceptable to speed.  One encounters speeding every day on the roads.  People are somewhat shy about wearing a fur coat or being seen with a plastic bag.  We should make people feel ashamed if they are caught or even seen to be speeding.  We should set a challenge in this regard and if this were done I believe the number of deaths on the roads would be reduced dramatically.</P>

	<P>I appeal to the Cathaoirleach to exercise discretion because I wish to earn my salary by dissenting from the remarks made by almost all other Members regarding the health service.  I do not support an amendment on a debate on cancer any more than I would support an amendment on a debate on, for example, the use of computers in fighting crime.  What we need is an honest debate on the health service, not a debate on cancer.  We should not be driven by one tragedy, much as I share in the commiserations of everybody else.

I remember from my childhood that he had to threaten to train local authority workers to give injections of streptomycin to break the consultants&rsquo; attempts to smash his health reforms.</P>
        <P>Everybody knows what the problem with the health service is.  The Fitzgerald report, the Tierney report and the Hanly report laid it out in simple terms.  It is not a matter of money.  There is no point in throwing money, for example, at the Garda if the money is going into the hands of a bouncer in a Spar shop who will not do anything with it.  Similarly, there is no point in throwing money at the health service unless a number of simple reforms, which were laid out in these reports, are carried out.  First of all, Portlaoise is not a suitable place to be doing that sort of thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is a proposal before the Government to increase the fee by &euro;7.  I ask the Leader to have this debated in the House or at least to draw the attention of the relevant Minister to the fact that this should not be granted automatically.  In many hostelries and hotels there are multiple televisions and the cost could be quite prohibitive.  It is a serious issue.</P>
        <P>Government must always be careful about contributing to inflation and there must be constant monitoring of Government allowed increases.  I would welcome a debate in this House on inflationary exercises by Government, including this proposed increase and ESB increases in the past that have been questionable.  Every proposed increase in charges from a Government agency should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be painstakingly examined, and not be granted on the nod.</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to call on the Minister for Transport to come to the House for a debate on the current <Col N="1022"/>situation at the M50 roundabout, where it is a lottery as to which direction one might take.  It is simple to give clear directions for necessary works.  That is one issue.</P>
        <P>Another, the question over Ryanair&rsquo;s current advertisement, is possibly one for the regulator.  It is not appropriate for a fine company, which has opened up air travel for all of us and which has done such great work internationally, to use an icon of a foreign country in what is basically a rude gesture.  It is not good enough.  It is not funny.  It does not serve the purpose for which it was meant.  Especially in a foreign country, to use Uncle Sam in that way with the two fingers salute is not appropriate.  It is not witty.  It is crass.  A fine company can do without that.</P>
        <P>By all accounts, the petrol station on the quays is the first most people will meet when they come off the ferry.  Looking forward to cheaper prices in Ireland, they pull in to this station to fill up and find themselves paying &euro;1.70 per litre, whereas it costs &euro;1.20 elsewhere.  We dealt with this in the last session and we got some action.  Could we have some action on this again?  Charging 50 cents over the odds to people who are just coming off the ferry is wrong.</P>

Any Senator who rises here to speak should be listened to.  They represent entire regions and entire facets of our communities.</P>
        <P>Seven years ago there was a cancer strategy announced and there is still inaction in Government.  I support the call of my leader in the House, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, for a full debate on cancer services in general.  We are hearing about the human tragedy in Portlaoise, but I know of regions, including my region of the south-east, that do not have radiotherapy services.  BreastCheck is not available in Waterford city, the fourth largest city in the country.  There is also a vast amount of work to be done on testicular cancer and prostate cancer for male patients.</P>
        <P>However, I wish to touch on the more fundamental issue of public accountability.  Will we, as politicians from all sides of the House, hand over power to the executives of this country?  We see many examples of this.  We are speaking about the HSE today.  We see this with the NRA, with city and county managers, and with VECs.  There is a fundamental threat to the running of this country and unless we &mdash; I include us all &mdash; take back control of our country and how we want to <Col N="1023"/>run it, we are going down a very dark alleyway.  I call for a debate on both of those issues, the cancer strategy and the fundamental issue of democracy in our country and who is accountable to the people who elect them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt as to what the common theme on the Order of Business is today.  I assure Members that the anxiety that has been expressed for an early debate on this is shared and that already efforts have been made to have a representative from the Department of Health and Children come to the House at the earliest possible time to facilitate such a debate.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has already indicated that she would be willing.  In fact, she has expressed her desire to take part in that debate.  I put it to the Members that, subject to the Minister&rsquo;s availability, we will arrange such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am afraid that is not possible today, but we will have some indication later as to when the Minister will be available for such a debate.  The matter was raised by Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, McCarthy, Norris, McFadden, Feeney, O&rsquo;Reilly and Coffey.  We will take on board the additional points about a need for a more general debate on the health service and the question of accountability.  Many Members share the sense of powerlessness about the establishment of many recent bodies and the effect this has had on political accountability.  Whatever else about political involvement, we can be sure lines of communication and responsibility are available when such political involvement is allowed.  We may need to revisit the workings of many State bodies to see why that does not happen any more and what can be done to change it.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole revisited his past glories as a wage negotiator in terms of the remuneration body report.

	<P>Senator Hannigan referred to the proposed deferral of tax cuts.  I am not too sure whether he wants to put that ahead of the areas of increased public spending to which he referred.  One cannot square that particular circle.  The arts funding to which he referred is something which, to be fair, the Government has increased significantly in recent years.  Last year alone, funding to the Arts Council increased by 30% and that was one of the largest increases in allocation.  I am confident that even in the current climate, additional resources will be made available in that area.</P>
        <P>Senator John Ellis called for a debate on electoral boundaries.  As these are by tradition decided independently, they are rarely rejected by any given Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I suspect the boundaries will be accepted in their present form.  The call for a debate might be best taken when the full boundaries are decided for the local elections, which it is anticipated will happen in April or May.  The legislation that will follow for the D&aacute;il, European and local elections will probably be done in a single Bill.  It will provide the ideal opportunity to negotiate these areas.</P>
        <P>Senator Joe Reilly referred to the increase in the cost of television licences and the inflationary impact of decisions of Government.  In reality, the decision on television licences is one of the few areas of public services costs that has any impact on a decision of an individual Minister.  It is the establishment of regulatory bodies that determines prices in areas such as electricity and gas supply.  A new Oireachtas committee has been established to deal specifically with how the regulators are performing.  It would provide a better forum in which to raise these matters.</P>
        <P>Senator John Hanafin asked the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss a number of issues.  Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca <Col N="1026"/>asked the Minister for Education and Science to address the concerns regarding new regulations on the teaching of English in gaelscoileanna.  Another education request was made regarding the situation in Dublin 15, a matter that has arisen on the Order of Business on several occasions in recent weeks.  Either we will ask for a number of debates in this area or, if the Minister is available, we will seek a more general debate on education.</P>

	<P>I have just been reminded of other items about which I had forgotten.  Access to third level might be addressed in a general debate or in its own right.  While free fees do not seem to have brought about the level playing field many of us had hoped for, there is movement in terms of the individual access programmes run by each of the third level institutions, which seem to be having at least partial success in this area.  If we have a debate, perhaps we should recognise the work being done in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to overseas development aid, I am sure the Minister of State would be willing to come to the House for a debate.  It is prominently mentioned in the programme for Government that not only do we seek to reach the 0.7% target by 2012 but that during the Budget Statement every year the Minister for Finance will give an account of how we have progressed and how we intend to progress in the following year.</P>

    <Title>Community Child Care Subvention Scheme 2008-2010: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the announcement of the new community child care subvention scheme in July this year, my officials and I have taken every opportunity to communicate the details of the new scheme, as it stands, to those who will be most directly affected by it, the wider child care sector and the public generally.  There continues to be misunderstandings as well as genuine concerns on the part of many community child care services about the new scheme.  There is even the impression that the Government will somehow walk away from its &euro;1.1 billion investment in child care from 2000 to 2010, more than half of which has been spent to date.</P>
        <P>The policy under the equal opportunities child care programme of putting community based child care at the heart of our investment in child care, continues to be a fundamental principle under the national child care investment programme, NCIP.  I am conscious of the contribution community volunteers and local effort have made to the success of both programmes.  The new scheme is being introduced to continue this recognition and support for the community not-for-profit sector.</P><Col N="1028"/>
        <P>The Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006, known generally as the EOCP, was the Government&rsquo;s first major investment programme in child care and was co-funded by the Exchequer and EU Structural Funds.  The programme has provided capital grant aid to child care providers to assist them with the building and refurbishment costs of their facilities.  As a programme with a particular focus on disadvantage, a clear distinction was made between private sector grant recipients and community based, not-for-profit child care groups, with grants for the full building or refurbishment costs of community facilities being provided up to a ceiling per project of &euro;1.4 million.</P>
        <P>It was recognised that, even where the full capital cost of these projects was met through grant funding and despite being non-profit bodies, community child care groups which were located in disadvantaged areas and had a strong focus on disadvantage might not be in a position to become self-sustainable in the short to medium term.  As a result, a specific allocation of funding targeted at disadvantaged parents and their children was made available through the EOCP staffing support grant to assist this category of community providers in their start-up years.  The grant was given on a three year basis as a support towards the services&rsquo; staffing costs.  It took this form because supporting employment for child care workers qualified for grant aid under the EU rules governing the programme.  The original three year funding under this scheme began to end for some groups from 2004 onwards.  In most <Col N="1029"/>cases where the community services receiving staffing grants were able to confirm their continuing focus on disadvantage, they were approved for continuation funding to bring them up to the end of the EOCP in December this year.</P>
        <P>The ability of projects which receive developmental aid to become self-sustainable over time through funding support in their developmental stage is an underlying principle of both European social funding and the Exchequer.  The principle of self-sustainability was built into the EOCP from the outset and has been an explicit condition of grant approval since 2004 when the continuation funding commenced.  As a result, every existing EOCP staffing grant recipient has agreed to operate a tiered fee system tailored to the differing economic circumstances of its client group which ensures that child care places subsidised by the programme are targeted towards those most in need.  In effect, the grant recipients were required to use their grant aid to give a high degree of subsidisation to very disadvantaged parents, a lesser degree of subsidisation to less disadvantaged parents and no subsidisation other than the general benefit of the capital grant aid to non-disadvantaged parents.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer funded community child care subvention scheme will continue to be based on the tiered fee system.  Many but not all community child care groups complied with this requirement under the EOCP and operated effective tiered fee systems which enabled disadvantaged parents to access child care at reduced costs.  For community services which were not implementing an effective tiered fee system until now, the new scheme may appear to be an intrusion into the way they operate their services.  It is true that more could have been done to ensure these services implemented effective tiered fee structures following their introduction. However, the EOCP was administered in the spirit of a partnership approach to foster and support community services and the invaluable work and contribution to local child care services.  As with any programme, particularly an innovative and developmental one such as the EOCP, there are lessons to be learned and we will build on the very substantial progress that has been achieved.</P>
        <P>The value for money review of the EOCP made recommendations for a new community support scheme under the NCIP, which it identified as a transitional programme that should complete the development of new child care services, while longer-term child care policy would be considered in the context of a third child care programme for 2011 to 2015.  These recommendations emphasised the need for the NCIP community support scheme to be based on having in place effective tiered fee structures with appropriate minimum and maximum fees.  In addition, eligibility for funding should be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure all services move towards sustainability when this is possible and the new scheme should be less <i>ad hoc</i>, more <Col N="1030"/>structured and transparent and better targeted at appropriate groups, including social excluded groups.</P>
        <P>In considering those aspects of the staffing support scheme which could benefit from more structured and transparent systems and criteria, it is clear that a more consistent approach is required in determining the level of grant aid and the way it is used than was the case under the EOCP.  To qualify for the staffing grant scheme community child care groups were first required to show they were located in a disadvantaged area, with the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes as the two key indicators in this respect.  After that, the group was asked to demonstrate in its grant application that it would adopt a strong focus on disadvantage.  This was largely a self-reporting system with no clear data, particularly as time went by, on what was the actual level of disadvantage in the services.  Clearly, with the economic upturn and high employment rates now enjoyed in Ireland, the profile of disadvantaged parents using the services has possibly changed considerably.  Unless brought to our attention, this change in circumstance was not generally reflected in the level of grant aid provided.</P>
        <P>As the profile of services in receipt of grant funding changed over time, different services responded in different ways.  Many services implemented effective tiered fee structures enabling the broad range of parents and their children to benefit based on their ability to pay and ensuring a good social mix.  Where services did not implement an effective tiered fee structure but charged reduced fees across the board, in some cases this resulted in very low fees for all parents, including non-disadvantaged parents, sometimes leading to an inability on the part of other, non-subsidised private sector providers in the area to compete.  Where services combined the grant aid with their increasing ability to collect more substantial fees and adopted a higher, across the board rate, this often resulted in a very high quality of service provision but one that was outside the reach of disadvantaged parents for whom the grant aid was intended.</P>
        <P>Another weakness of the present scheme is its non-transparency and the fact that the broadly drawn criteria resulted in a high level of subjectivity in the assessment of grant applications.  There have been cases where applications from services with very similar levels of disadvantage and service provision were approved for substantially different levels of funding.  Again, the subjectivity of the criteria was not assisted by the degree of self-reporting on which the system relied.  In addition, the current scheme penalises large-scale services which have very disadvantaged profiles as the level of grant funding is capped and disadvantaged parents using a community service not located in a disadvantaged area could not avail of the subsidised fees as the scheme is defined by reference to the area rather than the parent.</P><Col N="1031"/>
        <P>All these issues highlight that in meeting the needs of the existing grant aided community child care sector as well as moving forward to any future child care programme of initiatives, we need to address a series of diverse and complex issues.  However, the fundamental principle which must guide us in meeting these needs while, at the same time, further developing child care policy is that we ensure we find a fair and equitable approach to targeting disadvantaged parents using community child care facilities which is underpinned by transparency and accountability.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The new scheme has been portrayed widely as a cutback in funding for the community sector and disadvantaged parents and their children.  Nothing could be further from the case.  The new scheme has been given a total funding allocation of &euro;153 million over three years.  In 2008, some &euro;47 million will be available to the new scheme while &euro;37.25 million was available under the EOCP staffing scheme in 2007.  It is a clear indication of our intent to build on the scheme and to provide additional funding.  This substantial increase is intended to ensure the largest number of children and parents using community-based child care services benefit.</P>
        <P>In the absence of sufficient data to enable my office to quantify and cost accurately a more generous scheme under the new, more transparent arrangements, it was decided to identify the most disadvantaged categories of parents at the outset.  We could not disregard those parents and start at higher income levels, but we could not commit to a scheme that goes beyond the most disadvantaged categories until we were in a position to quantify and cost the outcome accurately.  For this reason, an innovative and transitional approach to the introduction of the scheme was adopted.  As more than 800 services are in receipt of staffing grant support, the first priority was to continue their funding during the transitional period.  All existing grant recipients who apply for funding under the new scheme will receive their current level of funding during the first half of 2008.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the information provided through applications, officials in my office will be able to establish a profile of each service in terms of the type of services provided, the profile of the parents using the services for their children, the operational costs and any other relevant data indicating a special need that requires a particular approach.  At every opportunity, my officials and I have stressed that the data is essential to enable the assessment of the scheme as announced to be undertaken urgently to facilitate the existing services to move to the new scheme without disruption.</P>
        <P>I expect that all services applying in the next week or so for funding under the community child care subvention scheme will be notified of their approval for transitional funding by early December.  Subsequently, my office will be in <Col N="1032"/>contact with these services regarding the funding levels indicated from the information provided with their applications.  The analysis of the data will be completed to enable me to report back to Government, as required in early 2008, with any further proposals to expand or improve the scheme.  Subject to the Government&rsquo;s decision and any changes agreed, my office will be in further contact with the services.  I cannot be specific in advance of any Government decision as to possible changes, but the way in which the scheme will be implemented will maximise the outcome for parents and children using community child care facilities and the funding provided for this purpose has been enhanced.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on a number of accusations made about the new scheme, including the accusation that it will lead to the segregation of children, with only the children of disadvantaged parents in community-based services.  While capital grant aid is available under the EOCP and the NCIP to community-based child care services in disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas, the staffing support grant was intended for disadvantaged community services only.  Non-disadvantaged community services were dependent on fee income alone.  The new scheme will be available to all community-based child care services regardless of their location, thereby facilitating disadvantaged parents to access community services, which may not be the case currently, and improving the social mix.</P>
        <P>As was the case under the EOCP, the tiered fee system underpins the principle that fee income plus grant aid equals operational cost.  The community service will either charge the full operational cost to parents in respect of whom they are not receiving grant aid or the operational cost less the subvention being received in respect of qualifying parents.  With some improvements on the EOCP, the profile of parents using a service will be cost neutral to the service.</P>
        <P>A serious accusation levelled at the new scheme is that it penalises working parents, is targeted at parents on social welfare who do not need child care services and is a poverty trap.  I refute these accusations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme has started from the point of the two most disadvantaged categories of parents, namely, those in receipt of social welfare payments and those in receipt of family income supplement payments.  Parents in receipt of the former and availing of full day care services must pay the cost of the service as reduced by the subvention.  Generally, this relates to those participating in back to work or community employment schemes, training or education, lone parents and young mothers completing secondary education.  It is crucial that parents in receipt of social welfare payments can access affordable pre-school services for their <Col N="1033"/>children, for which reason the subvention scheme will be necessary.  This latter category was excluded under the EOCP, as it was an employment support programme.</P>
        <P>The scheme&rsquo;s other key target group is working parents on low income.  As our starting point, we have identified the threshold for low income on the basis of eligibility for the family income supplement.  The current net income threshold for this payment is &euro;550 per week for a family with two children, which compares to a minimum wage income of &euro;346 per 40 hour week and an average industrial wage income of &euro;615 per week.  An analysis of the data being received in the Department will enable us to consider changes to the income threshold.</P>
        <P>Last week, some services stated that they have tiered fee structures in place where parents on social welfare payments are charged &euro;6 per day.  Where both parents are working, the charge is &euro;8 per day.  I do not accept that a difference of &euro;10 per week between a family where both parents are working and a family where both are on social welfare payments represents a reasonable tiered fee system.  Some 80% of child care services do not receive any subvention.</P>
        <P>It is a misunderstanding that the community services are being asked to means test the parents using their services.  The new scheme will use existing means tested criteria.  In applying for funding, services will be asked to attach declaration forms completed by parents and containing a minimum amount of information, consisting of their PPS numbers, the number of children they have attending the service and whether they are in receipt of a social welfare entitlement or availing of various programmes or schemes.  This will be a simple once per year exercise on the basis of which services will be advised of their funding levels for the following calendar year.  Where the parent profile changes during a year and gives rise to an increased grant payment, the service can seek an adjustment at any time.  In the majority of cases, the parent profile will not change significantly from year to year.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that there may be particular issues for smaller scale services, but they will be considered when the data due to be returned this month is analysed.  It is worth noting that the Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied with the proposed scheme and that parents will be invited to complete the declaration forms and provide their PPS numbers for the purposes of subventions under the scheme.</P>
        <P>I hope the details I have outlined have addressed Senators&rsquo; concerns.  The community child care subvention scheme will provide an effective and equitable framework to continue supporting community child care services and targeting disadvantaged parents and their children.  I am committed to completing the process of bringing the scheme into full effect in July 2008 following its final consideration by the Govern<Col N="1034"/>ment on the basis of the comprehensive data analysis that I hope to complete in early 2008.</P>
        <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to outline to the House some of the scheme&rsquo;s aspects.  I would gladly return next week to respond to the particular issues raised by Senators.  The Government is determined to build on the substantial progress made since 2000 in building a child care sector.  To date we have invested some &euro;530 million in the provision of new facilities and in assisting staffing costs. Another &euro;575 million will be invested in the coming years.  We are determined the child care subvention scheme will be effective, that those intended to benefit will do so and that the scheme will continue to assist in the provision of additional child care places in urban and rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>Since last July, Department officials and I have been at pains to reiterate to each community group that we wanted the data for further analysis.  One of the heartening revelations from that data is that the profile of the parents is changing because many people have had an opportunity to enter employment, which everyone in the Oireachtas welcomes.  We are determined to ensure people on lower incomes will not be disadvantaged by the new scheme.  We will ensure that when the scheme is finalised as a result of the analysis of our data, it will continue to build on the successful and substantial achievements under the equal opportunities child care programme.  I would be glad to listen to the debate and deal with any issues that arise when we have the concluding debate next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to know where to begin.  Many community groups are in panic about this measure.  This has been introduced in a clumsy way and without adequate consultation with the sector.  Had there been adequate consultation, meetings would not be taking place throughout the country, every partnership in the country would not be calling meetings of their providers to try to tell the Minister about the severe distress this is causing to community groups.  I will give several examples of the concerns local community play groups have.  I will give the Minister of State a document detailing these concerns.</P>
        <P>I will begin by reading an e-mail a woman recently sent me:</P>
        <P LI="1">Today the Government made the decision for me that I shall only have one child.  Up to now I had been trying to hold my ground against the grinding increases in all of life&rsquo;s necessities, but finally my husband and I must admit defeat.  The Government has introduced the community child care subvention scheme.  This will affect the cr&egrave;che our daughter attends.  Under the new scheme the level of grant aid to each facility will be based on the number of disadvantaged parents, which makes sense.  However, parents will only receive assistance if <Col N="1035"/>they are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  So once again couples like ourselves fall into the ever-widening and, frankly, terrifying gap.  We both work &mdash; this is a necessity &mdash; therefore we will not be eligible for a reduction.  Give up work, you say.  Although the Government appears to be pushing me this way, we cannot afford to live on one salary.  Whatever remains after child care is needed to pay bills.  Up to now I thought I could muddle along, but now things have changed.  This morning it seems the Government has won.  This in one final increase we cannot overcome.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the feeling from one parent who is trying to access child care and who is extremely concerned based on what her local community child care group has told her about the implications of the scheme.  Many people are concerned</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech is detailed and I am trying to take everything in.  In this extraordinary statement he almost admits what that woman said:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the absence of sufficient data to enable my office to quantify and cost accurately a more generous scheme under the new, more transparent arrangements, it was decided to identify the most disadvantaged categories of parents at the outset.  We could not disregard those parents and start at higher income levels, but we could not commit to a scheme that goes beyond the most disadvantaged categories until we were in a position to quantify and cost the outcome accurately.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Why cannot the Department do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Department not have the data?  Why does the Minister of State not know how much the scheme would cost if he were to make the changes and still include many of its beneficiaries, who come under the label of disadvantaged and who need the child care service?  It seems decisions were made far from the reality of the desperate need of parents to access child care.  There seems to be an assumption that these parents can go somewhere else.  Only one in four applicants to the Clondalkin community child care service gets a place.  There is a shortage of accessible, affordable child care.  To make these changes and almost to rule out a number of the beneficiaries suggests that the Minister of State is far removed from what is happening.  Is he aware that it is causing panic?</P>
        <P>In the first line of the Minister&rsquo;s statement he says there are many &ldquo;misunderstandings&rdquo;.  I am glad he adds there are &ldquo;genuine concerns&rdquo; because it is not just about misunderstandings.  How can one tell Clondalkin Partnership, which has been involved in running, supervising and developing community child care places for the <Col N="1036"/>last seven years, it is &ldquo;misunderstanding&rdquo; the scheme?  It has analysed it in detail and shown how much more expensive the system will be and how many child care services will have to close.  It is not making this up.  These are genuine concerns.  It will have detrimental effects on families and parents throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While we welcome any increase in child care funding, extra funding is not an acceptable excuse for the adverse effects the new scheme will have on community creches.  It will impose intolerable financial pressures on may parents by increasing the expense of child care.  Parents in employment but not receiving social welfare will be penalised under the scheme.  They will be excluded from benefiting from current child care subventions.  I speak of parents on modest incomes who do not qualify for family income support.  They will face increased child care costs if the Minister of State proceeds with this scheme without changing it or adding a new element for this group of parents.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if the Minister of State said the Department will design a new scheme once it has all the data, which it should have had from the beginning.  It looks like he said that.  I hope he will extend the eligibility criteria as a result of the reaction.  This scheme could force some parents out of employment as they will not be able to afford to pay for their children to be cared for while they work.  The Minister&rsquo;s scheme will act as a disincentive to seek and remain in employment.  Under the new scheme the prospects of parents working in the home returning to the work force or obtaining essential training and education will also be undermined.</P>
        <P>Many community playgroups providing not-for-profit child care services have a legitimate concern that as a consequence of the new arrangements it will become financially impossible to continue to provide services.  I have been informed that in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West, 400 child care places and 40 jobs are under threat should the Minister proceed with these changes.  Such cr&egrave;ches cannot recruit permanent staff as they do not know whether they will be able to pay future salaries.  This proposed scheme takes predictability and stability from community cr&egrave;ches.  It strips the base out of the community child care system and operates on the belief that community schemes are cheaper to run than reality dictates.  I am concerned that the scheme will militate against the creation of new community cr&egrave;ches, and at a time when only one in four applicants to such cr&egrave;ches receives a place this will be problematic.  We need more of these schemes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State knows many of these schemes have been hard developed by people.  Many of the women involved spent years working as volunteers trying to establish community cr&egrave;ches.  Many have been there only seven or eight years.  The Minister of State should not have undermined and frightened them in this way.  He should have offered further support and if <Col N="1037"/>changes were needed, he should have engaged in consultation in a way that would have brought the sector with him.</P>
        <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of State to the effect his proposed changes will have on the funding of a number of community cr&egrave;ches in Clondalkin.  The Cosy Kids after school child care facility will see a reduction of &euro;53,664 in funding while St. Ronan&rsquo;s playgroup and Lime Tree Community Childcare Centre will face income reductions of &euro;60,216 and &euro;40,560, respectively.  These figures have been supplied to me; they have not been made up.  The sector fears that these are the amounts of money that will be lost and, as a result, child care places and access to child care will be more limited.  Community child care has been a success story.  Why should the facilities face such reductions?</P>
        <P>Over recent weeks I have consulted a number of interest groups and organisations and, as a result, I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister of State.  How much more will people in receipt of social welfare and family income supplement have to pay each week for child care as a result of the reduction in funding to community child care facilities?  Why is the Minister of State removing the child care staffing grant when the value for money audit of the equal opportunities child care programme advocates its retention and on a multi-annual basis?  If an audit is carried out of how a scheme is working and it makes recommendations about the staffing grant, why is the Minister of State not going along with that but proposing something different?  Research indicates that more than 30% of community child care facilities will close in 2008 because of the shortfall created by this.  Does the Minister of State know how many facilities built by Government and EU funding in the past two years may have to close or not open as a result of the subvention scheme?  When will all existing cr&egrave;ches be informed of their staffing grant allocations for the six-month transition phase?</P>
        <P>In addition, the Minister of State should respond to the concerns expressed by One Family, the support service for one-parent families in Ireland.  The policy manager for this organisation, Candy Murphy, said yesterday that the child care subvention scheme contradicts the Government&rsquo;s proposed changes to the social welfare code which focus on getting people back to education and employment.  The subvention scheme will create the opposite situation where parents on social welfare will be less likely to move into work for fear of losing income and being left with unmanageable child care costs.  She went on to say that the scheme will increase the challenges for lone parents trying to move away from social welfare and to access meaningful and sustainable employment.  Research shows that one-parent families face significant difficulties in making the transition from social welfare to work, including rising child care costs.  Government plans to assist parents in overcom<Col N="1038"/>ing these difficulties are wholly undermined by the proposed scheme.  It must be re-examined.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must go back to the drawing board on this issue.  He must engage in much more widespread and thorough consultation with the sector so its fears can be allayed.  Whatever changes are introduced, they must be introduced in a way that ensures the community cr&egrave;ches survive and that there will be more, not fewer, child care places.  I read for the Minister of State the e-mail I received from a mother who is very concerned about this.  There are serious genuine concerns among the public about this issue.  Detailed consultations with the Minister of State and his Department will be required to allay them.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the scheme seriously to ensure the people who enjoy the advantage of child care under it will continue to enjoy it and that even more places are created by the establishment of more community child care cr&egrave;ches.</P>
        <P>Access to child care is still a major issue in this country.  It is still very expensive and consumes a huge proportion of parents&rsquo; income relative to the situation in other European countries.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s attendance in the House today and thank him for his detailed speech.  However, what I have outlined today reflects the real concerns that exist among the community and the parents using the very successful community child care scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>In my document, A New Approach to Childcare, recommendation No. 5 states that the Government should provide greater financial supports for parents to break the cycle of poverty and unemployment.  As spokesperson on children on the Government side of the House, I have studied this matter in detail so I believe my remarks will be balanced and informed.</P>
        <P>The main motivation for the new scheme is to make child care funding transparent, measurable and accountable.  It will allow the Government to help disadvantaged parents in a way that benefits them directly.  It will also help by being focused on non-disadvantaged areas where there are very disadvantaged parents.  How will this be done?  Over the next two years there will be an increase of 16% in the money available to help parents who are disadvantaged.  That represents a budget of &euro;153 million.  The new scheme aims to help those who are most disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance requested a value for money review of the staffing grant scheme.  There is nothing wrong with that.  This involves taxpayers&rsquo; money and the Department of Finance, on behalf of the public, has a responsibility to ensure money spent on the child care sector is spent with integrity and fairly.  The recommendations from that review gave rise to the new child care subvention scheme.  I do not claim the scheme is perfect but am simply explaining the idea or plan behind it.</P><Col N="1039"/>
        <P>The Minister of State could look at the example of the Athboy community child care centre, which opened in 2004.  It is a state-of-the-art facility, a beautiful building that blends with the area&rsquo;s environment.  Athboy is a bustling town in the commuter belt.  Many people have moved from Dublin to live in Athboy.   Senator Fitzgerald mentioned an important point which I believe has not been given adequate attention by the Department.  The Athboy child care committee was established by a group of volunteers in 2000.  The volunteer community group engaged an architect, secured the site from Meath County Council, and applied for planning permission and a capital grant.  It succeeded in securing &euro;2.25 million, which covered 100% of the cost of the building.  This was a group of volunteers, altruistic people who wished to meet the needs of their community.  They gave their free time, were unpaid and put a considerable effort into delivering the beautiful building in Athboy.  I recommend that everybody who has an interest in children and child care pay a visit to the centre.</P>
        <P>This community child care centre operates from 7.30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday to Friday, and is open for 51 weeks of the year.  It provides full-time day care, part-time day care, breakfast club, after school club and all the food the children require.  It costs &euro;170 per week.</P>
        <P>There is huge misunderstanding about the new scheme among the public.  People&rsquo;s nerves appear to be rattled.  Today, I urged one lady who runs a cr&egrave;che to calm down, continue her work in the cr&egrave;che and leave me to fight her corner with the Minister of State and his Department&rsquo;s officials.  She is dealing with parents who are terrified that they will have to pay Dublin prices for their cr&egrave;ches.  There are 84 children in the Athboy community child care centre.  The typical parent commutes to a job in Dublin, Navan or Monaghan.  Of the 84 children, the parents of 52 are in the subvention scheme.  Nine of that number are in bands A and B while most of the parents are in band C but, as Senator Fitzgerald said, they are struggling.</P>
        <P>Significant numbers of young parents are struggling to make ends meet.  The lady who commented in the e-mail said she could not afford to go to the cinema or afford any luxuries.  Young parents pay high mortgages or rents and are under pressure.  I support the motivation of the Minister of State in gearing subvention towards assisting those who are disadvantaged.  However, I wish to highlight the fact that people are nervous and terrified they will have to give up their jobs and stay at home.</P>
        <P>Three weeks ago <i>The Irish Times</i> published the results of a survey on what women want.  I asked my Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues what they thought women wanted, but none of them came up with the answer.  The response from the survey was that their top priority is financial independence.  Women achieve that by working.  There<Col N="1040"/>fore, we cannot allow a situation develop where women will have to give up their jobs and their financial independence.  The image of modern young women is that of stressed and worn out women with black rings under their eyes as a result of all their commuting and minding of children.  However, the reality is that women with a job are happy, because they have a choice and their own money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The newspaper article also referred to a survey conducted by Fionnuala Kennedy, who was on the Commission on the Status of Women in the early 1990s, for which she read more than 600 submissions.  She was not surprised by the results published in <i>The Irish Times,</i> because her results, at the cusp of the Celtic tiger era&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I said I supported the motivation behind the scheme, and the Minister of State understands that.  I am speaking of the group left out.  Among the submissions received by Fionnuala Kennedy was a letter from a surgeon&rsquo;s wife in County Cork, who did not have the money to buy a pair of tights.  Another submission came from the wife of a high-ranking Army officer who had to plead for the few pounds necessary to meet friends for a coffee.  The marriage bar is gone now and there are huge employment opportunities.  Women yearn to develop their potential, receive training and have financial independence.  The people using child care are not just those who are working, but also those who are going back to college for an education so that they can get a better job.</P>
        <P>The community cr&egrave;che in Athboy will have a deficit of &euro;54,000 if it does not continue to get the nine staffing grants it currently receives.  I told the manager today that I believed, as a business person, it should be possible for the cr&egrave;che to continue in business.  If it has 84 children, it should be able to do the sums and work it out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I advised the manager to calm down and wait for the Minister to get a fix on the issue, and that please God he would be able to introduce a band C group so that people on lower incomes would get some form of subvention.</P>
        <P>Part of the problem with this issue is that the introduction of the scheme and the need for the form to be returned was rushed.  Some community cr&egrave;ches have been active and efficient and able to get the information in on time and the pressure of having everything in by 26 October was not too drastic for them.  However, one manager told me she would love to have had the time to call the parents together to explain to them why they wanted the personal information.  I see <Col N="1041"/>nothing wrong with people having to give their PPS number.  Why not, if the organisation and the facilities are being funded by taxpayers&rsquo; money?  People have complained that they should not have to provide information on whether they are on social welfare, but I do not go along with that.  In any business, people must&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.  The Minister of State has said that the Department will be able to help disadvantaged parents who live in areas of economic advantage.  For instance, Dublin 4 is the most exclusive postal address in Dublin, but there is a pocket of disadvantage in parts of Ringsend.  Those people are terrified their cr&egrave;che will also have to close down.  Most of the cr&egrave;che&rsquo;s clients are working, but they are in low-paid jobs.  Many of them are non-nationals.  They are not in the A or B bands, but many of them live in the O&rsquo;Rahilly and Whelan social housing.  We would like to keep that group at work, retraining or studying so that they can develop their potential.  This group would be the perfect example of a group that should be helped under the departmental brief to help disadvantaged groups in advantaged areas.</P>
        <P>I laud the approach of the Minister of State and the determination to obtain data on those availing of the system to ensure people do not misuse it.  The Department of Finance has a responsibility to ensure that moneys are used properly and data will be effective in ensuring this.  However, there was not adequate dialogue with the people who work voluntarily in these community cr&egrave;ches.</P>
        <P>Ms Irene Cafferkey, the manager of the Roscommon child care centre, did her thesis on <Col N="1042"/>the value of the contribution of the volunteers in the Roscommon area and found the value of the work of volunteer parents in the cr&egrave;ches in Roscommon to be &euro;270,000 a year.  That is the reason parents are upset.  They have not been given enough time for dialogue on the proposal nor has the change been sufficiently explained for them to have respect for the Minister.</P>
        <P>Most of the volunteers in community cr&egrave;ches are women.  I have tried to get this point across at parliamentary party meetings.  We hear that it is impossible to get people to do voluntary work, but there are women in community cr&egrave;ches throughout the country doing voluntary work, for which they should get adequate recognition.  I do not mean they should get financial recognition because that is not what they want.  However, they should get some respect and honour for all the work they do.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister of State is doing his best as a serious politician and I am confident he will address the difficulties in the scheme.  He has said that depending on the information he gets, he will look at the situation again in January.  There is nothing wrong with that approach.  We cannot carve a scheme in stone.  Most businesses or Government policies that fail do so because when schemes are introduced they are carved in stone and nobody ever reviews them to see if they are achieving what they are supposed to achieve.  That must not happen in this instance.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well.  The first call I received this morning was from someone in his constituency involved in the child care area who is rightly very upset with this legislation.  It is not a question of what is in the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal, but of what is missing from it.  That is where the problem lies.  There is an economic strategy to attract people into the workplace.  While I do not want to sound sexist about this, in general, this strategy currently refers to attracting women into the workplace for their economic contribution to the GDP and GNP of this State.  That is what needs to happen but whether we like it or not, the issue of child care is very much a women&rsquo;s issue.  The cost of it is shared but in the main, although not exclusively, the responsibility for it falls on women&rsquo;s shoulders.  I want to make that point because much else flows from it.  If men were more reliant on child care much more would have been done in the meantime.</P>
        <P>What can be done and what is not in the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal?  The Minister of State is technically right in stating it is not means tested <Col N="1043"/>but based on other figures including the family income supplement.  The real issue, however, is that people just above the threshold will feel they are going to be hit once more.  I accept the point the Minister of State is making but what can he do about that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators should re-read the script, which was fairly clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, absolutely.  I said that one must start somewhere but it is incorrect and unfair to say we are talking about people on low incomes.  There is a simple way to deal with those who do not reach the threshold to which the Minister of State referred.  If the State recognised the cost they are paying for child care, the obvious thing is to grant them tax relief on that expenditure.  That would create a level playing pitch and would mean that persons going out to work would not be discommoded as much, although they would still face unacceptable costs.  We are currently losing a major creative input for the economy because large numbers of women in particular do not have this opportunity.  The Minister of State is correct in saying that one must start somewhere and it is important to start with the severely disadvantaged and then move to those working on the minimum wage.  The Minister of State cited the figure of &euro;550 per week, but what can one say to the person above that threshold?  The Department of Finance will say there is always somebody above the threshold, but we are penalising people for going out to work.  </P>
        <P>In my last employment, I lost three superb workers due to the cost of child care.  They were not in low-paid employment but they could not afford the costs involved.  By the time they covered such costs plus taxation and the other displacement costs of going out to work, it was not worth their while to do so.  We are all losing out because of this.  The Department of Finance does not recognise that there is a loss to the State in this.  It looks at the penny-pinching aspects of giving money here or there, but we are all losing as a result.</P>
        <P>To move forward from the Minister of State&rsquo;s points, while recognising what he has done, people above that threshold should be at least permitted a tax break.  If they pay between &euro;200 and &euro;500 per week for cr&egrave;che facilities, depending on the number of children they have, what is the argument against giving them a tax break on that cost?  I would like to hear it.  I will give the Minister of State an argument to use with the Department of Finance in the Estimates debate.  Given that we are losing the creative and financial input of such people who cannot afford to go to work <Col N="1044"/>because of child care costs, what does it cost the State?  We are all losers as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>This is nothing less than a fiasco.  Reading between the lines of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, he acknowledged that there are genuine concerns among parents and child care providers in the real world about the effect of the Government&rsquo;s proposed scheme.  The Government&rsquo;s announcement has caused grave concern for large numbers of parents and child care providers and has thrown them into a panic because of the clumsy and inadequate way in which it has been introduced, and due to the piecemeal method in which child care generally is dealt with by this Government.  The Government has been in power for ten years, yet in all that time we have never had a fully thought out, comprehensive child care policy.  This subvention scheme merely targets the most disadvantaged parents.  A mother wrote to Senator Frances Fitzgerald and others expressing her distress at this policy.  There are many parents like her who are in low-paid work and simply cannot afford child care without State subventions, but this scheme does nothing to address their fears.  The cost of private child care in Dublin is &euro;200 to &euro;250 per child per week from net income.  The Minister said the proposal provides for a net income threshold of &euro;550 per week for a family with two children, but that would only cover the cost of two children in a cr&egrave;che.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is far too low.  Government policy must address the question of parents who are paying for child care in the private sector, yet we have seen nothing in ten years.  The subvention scheme targets those who are most disadvantaged but as the Minister of State said, 80% of child care services receive no subvention.  It is unacceptable that the Government has no tax break policy to support parents struggling to meet the costs of private child care providers.  </P>
        <P>The change announced by the Government has caused grave concern for those just above the threshold who feel the Government has effectively introduced through the back door a one-child policy.  It has removed the possibility for many parents to contemplate having a second child due to the high cost of child care.  In addition, many parents and child care providers have expressed genuine concerns that the effect of this scheme will be to create a segregated or ghettoised system where children of parents on social welfare will remain in community-supported, not-for-profit child care places, while everybody else will have to avail of privately provided facilities.  That is simply not good enough for parents who work outside the home.</P><Col N="1045"/>
        <P>We have long accepted the principle, rightly, that child benefit is a universal, non-means tested payment payable to all parents whatever their incomes.  We must also accept that the needs of all children are universal; they all require high-quality child care if their parents work outside the home.  Yet, in ten years there has been no attempt by the Government to develop a universal child care policy that would address the needs of all parents who work outside the home.  That is the fundamental problem.  This subvention scheme and the change the Government has announced has created particular problems for parents.  It has shown us once again that the Government is capable of making U-turns, as it did on provisional licences, when there is an outcry.  It now seems there will be a change from the original announcement and that the scheme will allow continued subsidy for working parents on low incomes.  The difficulty, however, is, as the Minister of State said in his speech, that we do not yet know what the income threshold or level of subsidy will be.  It is simply not good enough that child care providers and particularly parents will be left in this period of uncertainty, unable to plan ahead.  Many parents will be considering whether they will be able to have another child and at what age their child can avail of child care, but they cannot plan effectively.  They know what their income is, but they do not yet know what the cost of child care in a community facility will be, assuming they can obtain such a place for their children.  As we have already heard, there is another enormous problem concerning the shortage of child care places.</P>
        <P>In so many other policy areas, as with driving licences and road safety generally, we have seen ill-conceived, badly-planned policies being grandly announced, only to be followed by U-turns, changes and other tweaking.  People are then left in great uncertainty without being able to plan ahead.  The difficulty with planning may mean the difference between being able to have another child or not, as the mother from Cork has written.  It is not good policymaking and it is simply not good enough for parents who work outside the home, nor for children.</P>
        <P>The Government should be looking to develop a child care policy that seeks to provide affordable, high quality child care services for the children of all parents working outside the home.  The Minister should take responsibility for the Government&rsquo;s failure over ten years to do so and, at the very least, he should apologise to parents who will be affected by this latest change for the uncertainty into which he has cast them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate what has been said about the need for a more unified thinking around the issue of parenting and child care.  It is vital that we have more family friendly <Col N="1046"/>employment practices.  Today&rsquo;s article by Ailish Connelly in <i>The Irish Times</i> tells of some very disquieting attitudes in the workplace towards women when it comes to taking maternity leave and having children.  This is an economically counterproductive attitude shown by many employers.  As women approach their early to mid-30s, they will want to take time off work but it is a time when they will have engaged in much training and are moving into senior management positions.  By not facilitating the possibility for people to take two years out for those important first years of their children&rsquo;s lives, employers show that there has been little change in their attitudes in this area.  One would expect there to be a more generous attitude by employers.</P>
        <P>In trying to get the balance right between the needs of parents who choose to work in the home and those who choose to remain in the workplace, I disagree with Senator White in her emphasis on the financial independence of women.  The core issue must always be parental choice.  Parents should not be militated against no matter what choice they make.  It is a very personal, family-centred decision about who is responsible for the children and how they are to be raised.  Whereas the tax individualisation policy was introduced to address the chronic shortage of employees in the workplace, we now face a new dispensation in which we have an ageing population and we need more pro-natal and pro-family policies.  As the ratio of those on pension and in the workplace becomes more problematic, we need to plan to ensure we get the balance right.  We need more pro-natal policies.</P>
        <P>It appears that there has been a turnabout in the community child care subvention scheme and the Minister is due to announce a new income threshold next February under which families on low incomes will be able to access subsidised child care.  As has been said by many in this House, there was considerable concern among child care providers about the fact that many people on low incomes would no longer be able to avail of the subvention that was previously available under the equal opportunities childcare programme 2001-2006.  It remains to be seen what will happen but if there was the slightest concern that families on low income were to be excluded from subvented child care, that would be a disaster.  It would go against all our policy intentions.  It would leave people with the choice of either paying for private child care or going back on the live register.</P>
        <P>I have a concern, an ethical issue, about what appears to be envisaged under the new regime whereby child care providers will be charged with seeking information from families about their income status.  One must wonder about the ethics of this when one considers that child care providers, especially among disadvantaged people, <Col N="1047"/>are already tasked with the difficult problem of helping families and children along the way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation and his clarification on some of the issues surrounding this important debate on State subvention for the community child care scheme.  The availability of quality child care services is very important for working parents and parents who want to access education and training.  It is especially important where people from disadvantaged areas are concerned because the only way we will assist people in helping to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage is to make child care available to enable them to go back into education and training which will allow them to take up employment opportunities subsequently.</P>
        <P>Private child care in this country is very expensive and child care costs are among the highest in Europe.  Community child care services cater for low income families and it is important we have a clear vision of how we want community child care to develop.  The equal opportunities childcare programme 2001-06 was successful in funding and supporting community child care centres.  The funding was allocated on the basis of staffing grants which allowed these not-for-profit community groups to set up local cr&egrave;ches.  There was a desirable social mix of children in those centres, some of whom were from disadvantaged and low income families and others who availed of the community service that might not have been in their locality otherwise.</P>
        <P>The proposed change in the subvention scheme has come about as a result of the value for money review that was carried out.  The thrust behind that review was to figure out whether children <Col N="1048"/>from disadvantaged families were getting the best possible support from the State.  The idea was to try to ensure that there is more effective targeting of that funding at the children from disadvantaged families.  As we make the transition from one scheme to another, however, there will be problems and unintended impacts.  The Minister of State should look at how these might be alleviated in the early years.  The difficulty of moving from funding based on staffing grants to funding tied to the individual child may leave some cr&egrave;ches in a position where they may have to put staff on protective notice.  They may also consider the possibility of losing children if they do not feel they have enough families availing of social welfare to use the services of their cr&egrave;ches.</P>
        <P>There may be a possibility of some kind of general grant to these cr&egrave;ches being continued for a period as well as the more individualised, child-centred payments proposed.  Perhaps some consultation between these service providers and the Department might be useful.  I know the Minister of State has been looking for feedback from them on this issue.  It would be helpful to hear constructive proposals from the sector about how they feel the transition problems might be overcome.</P>
        <P>Some Senators have proposed that there be recognition of a category of low income parents that have not been mentioned to date.  The scheme mentions parents on social welfare and the family income supplement, but we may need to look at categories such as parents on a medical card or others who have a general practitioner visit card entitlement.  The Minister of State is well-disposed to this but it would be unfortunate if the new system excluded low income families that happened to fall outside the current parameters. Members are aware of the difficulties associated with categorising funding no matter how inclusive one attempts to be.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to be able to promote and begin what I consider to be a vital debate on the issues of climate change and energy security in the interests of national policy and the people.  In particular, I wish to use this opportunity to make comments or put forward some ideas regarding the proposed new Oireachtas joint committee on climate change and energy security, in which the Government and Opposition parties will participate.  Hopefully this will take place from next week, subject to the establishment of the committee within that timeframe.  I believe it will play a vital role in helping us, both in terms of policy and as a people, to come to terms with these most challenging issues.</P>
        <P>I put together the issues of climate change and energy security and it is correct to so do because they are complementary.  Climate change provides a strong moral imperative to us to act on an immediate basis.  This moral imperative pertains to the future of our planet, the people who live on it and our children.  The issue of energy security provides an economic imperative to this society.  As 80% or 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy comes from imported fossil fuels, we are severely exposed to any international factors that might restrict the availability or increase the price of such fossil fuels.  This provides a major economic imperative for us to change our ways.  If we so do, it will also allow us to achieve many of our climate change targets because most of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions derive from burning such fossil fuels to provide transport, generate power and heat buildings.</P>
        <P>I was honoured to share membership with Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources during the past five years.  The committee engaged in highly valuable and detailed analysis on the issue of energy and at its conclusion, I formed the clear sense that further analysis and explanation was required, it would be necessary to reach greater understanding and further decisions were needed on the key policy areas of energy considered by it.  I was convinced, as was Senator O&rsquo;Malley, that this issue tran<Col N="1050"/>scends normal political dialogue and does not fit into the typical five-year electoral cycle within which politicians tend to operate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the investment decisions that one makes in the field of energy.  If one builds a road, it will last for 100 years.  If one builds a power station, it will be still in operation in 30 or 40 years&rsquo; time.  Even if one buys a car, it will be still on the road in 15 years&rsquo; time.  Consequently, when one makes an investment decision in this regard, be it on a road, a grid, a power station or even a car, cooker or heater, one must consider the long term.  In such circumstances, I believe that if different political parties can come to some common agreement and understanding as to what constitutes the best long-term future development for this country in the energy area, it will help us to make those decisions in the correct context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This means that as householders, individuals, business people or policy makers, we will make investments.  Questions arise as to whether we will build roads or rail, a coal-fired power plant or a renewable energy power plant, a bio-energy efficient car or an energy inefficient one.  If I have some understanding that political agreement exists regarding the broad direction towards which I wish to go, this could, should and will influence the investment decisions we will make.  It will make it easier to change to a renewable future and switch from use of fossil fuels because there will be a common understanding that regardless of election results, the direction on which we are travelling is set.  Such a background understanding spurred me on in recent years to state consistently that the issues of climate change and energy security do not belong to a single political party and are far too important for that.  In the past, our best responses to similar strategic threats have been made when we acted collectively with a common understanding and general agreement on the broad parameters of the requisite policy response.</P>
        <P>Consequently, I look forward to the work of the proposed new Oireachtas joint committee, which will tease out some of the key policy issues faced by Ireland to ascertain whether common agreement and understanding can be achieved, regardless of political ideology.  If this is the case, it will send a powerfully strong message to the administrative organs, the business system and to people at large that this is the direction in which this society wishes to travel.</P>
        <P>The challenge should not be underestimated.  I was interested to note the launch today of the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s latest world energy outlook report.  Four or five years ago, I was engaged in rows with this agency.  While I raised concepts such as peak oil, whereby we face a peak in global oil production if this position has not been arrived at already, the International <Col N="1051"/>Energy Agency, which represents more than 20 of the largest developed countries, asserted that this was nonsense and that there was not a problem as plenty of oil was available until 2030.  However, the agency now has executed a 360&deg; turn.  Its report states:  &ldquo;...the consequences of unfettered growth in global energy demand are alarming . . . if governments stick with existing policies . . . the world&rsquo;s energy needs will be over 50% higher in 2030 than today&rdquo;. China and India account for approximately half of that growth.</P>
        <P>The report goes on to state that vigorous, immediate and collective policy action by all governments is essential to move the world to a more sustainable energy path and that to date, there has been more talk than action in most countries.  Such comments from an organisation that, in common with most such international organisations, is usually highly moderate and constrained in its statements should sound a major alarm because I believe we are close to a peak in global oil production.  In fact, global oil production has not actually expanded in the past two years and is stuck at the same level despite the fact that oil prices have doubled.  Today the price of a barrel of oil is $98 or $99.  That has major consequences for a country such as ours as 60% of our energy comes from imported oil.  Had there not been a devaluation in the dollar which almost matches the increase in oil prices, we would now be paying &euro;1.60 to &euro;1.80 per litre at the petrol pump and that would be the leading debate in the House and in every home in the country today.  We have been shielded somewhat, but we cannot shield the people forever from the geological realities that are associated with the peak in global oil production &mdash; the year-on-year relentless decrease in the availability of oil when we move away from the current plateau and into the decline phase that will follow, as night follows day, in oil production on this planet.</P>
        <P>The exact year of peak oil production is not of particular consequence.  We know it is coming, and we know that we must prepare decades in advance.  Because of the long-term investment decisions which I mentioned, such as power plants, roads and vehicles, even if the peak is in the future, we must act now.  According to the latest studies by the US Department of Energy, we need to start changing our investment decisions two decades in advance to prepare for the peak.  However, we are well past the two-decade warning signal.  We need to make changes now.  Unfortunately, if we consider the energy statistics produced by the agency within the remit of my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland, even taking into account elements introduced under the national climate change strategy and projected increases in renewable energy use, it is predicted that by 2020, in a business-as-usual <Col N="1052"/>scenario, our use of energy will have increased by a further 30% over today&rsquo;s levels.  This is a fairly accurate model for forecasting energy use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The committee on climate change which we are setting up must consider urgently how we can save energy.  The scale of the change required should not be underestimated.  A response of this scale will require a substantial degree of political will and support to achieve.  We should make these changes for sensible economic reasons such as protecting ourselves from rising gas and oil prices.  As a country we are equally exposed in terms of gas supply.  A total of 85% of our gas is imported, mostly from the North Sea, where supplies are being depleted by 7% to 8% per annum.  If people are looking for reasons for the recent spike in energy prices, it is primarily because of our dependence on imported gas.  In the UK in 2006, gas prices shot up to more than &pound;2 per unit, compared with 40p or 50p today.</P>
        <P>We may become used to this, because as UK gas is depleted it &mdash; and Ireland, because we have an integrated market &mdash; will become increasingly dependent on Norwegian gas.  Two weeks ago the Norwegian Government decided not to connect the Troll field, one of its largest gas fields, to the UK market and by extension to the Irish grid.  Although this is of major strategic importance to Ireland, it went largely unnoticed in the media and in political circles owing to the complexity and technical nature of the subject.  However, it is of huge significance to the Irish people.  In the short term &mdash; which I think of as the period to 2020, because we must think long-term in this area.  We will probably use up whatever gas we find in the west or south west of Ireland, and we will then be reliant on Russian gas, because Norwegian and British gas will at that stage be depleted.  Thus, in the short term we are very exposed.  Just as for oil, we must reduce our dependence on this imported fossil fuel.</P>
        <P>The connection between the two subjects of peak oil and climate change is that if we manage to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, this will also help us in tackling our climate change targets.  Among the three policy considerations that must be taken into account in the matter of peak oil &mdash; security of supply, the environment, and competitiveness &mdash; none is predominant.  The issue of climate change is more dramatic and urgent than that of peak oil.  However, scientists have started to be clear and strident about what we need to do, which is to implement a reduction in emissions of at least the amount committed to in the programme for Government.  The European Community has set the lead, and we have already signed up to a 30% reduction on 1990 emission levels at European Heads of Government level as part of a proposed international agreement.  We must work towards an international agreement as part of the UN Framework <Col N="1053"/>Convention on Climate Change process, because the prospect of what would happen otherwise is too frightening for any country to consider.</P>
        <P>If we are to achieve a 30% reduction in emissions, taking into account Ireland&rsquo;s derogation in the first round of Kyoto emission reductions &mdash; an increase of 13% compared with the 8% reduction committed to by the EU &mdash; this brings us to an overall reduction that can only be achieved by implementing a reduction of about 3% per annum every year until 2020.  This is what will be required if we are to achieve our part of a European and worldwide attempt to reduce emissions.  We should adopt the required measures with enthusiasm and agree to go further.  We should view this responsibility not as sharing a burden but sharing an effort.  It is a moral responsibility for all the people of this planet and for our children&rsquo;s future.  If we approach it with a sense of zeal and enthusiasm, as a mission, it will be easier to achieve than if we do it as an obligation due to our membership of the EU or of the UN.  As a people, we are ready to step up to the mark and play our part and, indeed, to lead the world.</P>
        <P>What role will be played by the new committee?  If the Irish people are to agree to that level of enthusiasm, support and commitment, there must be an understanding of the relevant issues which, as I said, are complex and technical.  According to a recent MORI poll in the UK, a country in which the science of climate change is very advanced and where the national newspapers regularly lead with stories on the reality of climate change, roughly two thirds of people believe that the science of climate change is uncertain.  It is the same in Ireland.  Around two thirds of our people are still confused.  They instinctively respond to documentaries such as Channel 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Great Global Warming Swindle&rdquo;, which was broadcast earlier this year and which I believe was a swindle of true science rather than anything else, by thinking, &ldquo;Thank God, it is not really a problem.&rdquo;  We need to move beyond that and understand the problem, and perhaps through understanding we can move on to determination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposed Oireachtas joint committee has an important role in helping people to achieve that understanding.  It could also help in teasing out some of the technical complexities of the issue.  One of these is the issue of bio-fuels, which has been much discussed in recent years.  It is difficult to get a firm grip on the best approach.  There are many variables in the policy issues associated with this area.  Bio-fuels are traded on the international market under World Trade Organisation rules.  In some areas, bio-fuel production may have environmental consequences or effects on world fuel prices, and these also interrelate with existing market variables.  It is a com<Col N="1054"/>plex and difficult subject.  It behoves the Oireachtas to lead the people by teasing out these issues.  What is the reality?  What is the best opportunity or strategy for us?  What is the truth about biodiesel, bioethanol and all the other second generation fuels?</P>
        <P>It would also be useful for the committee to bring in people from outside the Oireachtas to explain their views or to conduct an analysis and present the findings in a report.  This would be of interest to those involved in the agriculture industry because farmers could find out about the opportunities presented by climate change.  It would also be of interest to people in the area of transport to consider what forms of transport could be provided if we suffer from an oil shortage.  Maybe that is one subject that could be discussed and teased out in such a committee.</P>
        <P>Likewise, in the use of biomass in heating, there are different factors at play &mdash; whether we use it in power generation, in heating or in industrial processing, and what crops we grow and how we support it.  There is still an entire policy issue in the biomass area which would benefit from examination by an Oireachtas committee.  This might provide certainty for farmers or business people who want to invest in the area.  If they got back a clear message from an all-party Oireachtas committee that there is a real opportunity in this area in particular, that might help us make the correct investment decisions and have the courage to develop a strategy response which delivers for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>There must be an honest debate in this Parliament about our use of energy in transport.  At a time when oil prices have doubled, our use of oil in transport increased by 6% or 7% per year.  We are so addicted and tied into that type of transport system that we are willing to pay the high costs involved and suffer the congestion and accidents that result from such an inefficient transport system.</P>
        <P>I would dearly like to see an honest debate in an Oireachtas committee on our future transport policies in a world where oil will become more, not less, expensive.  That honesty, on a non-confrontational and non-party political basis in an Oireachtas committee made up of Seanad and D&aacute;il Members, could be of significant benefit.  Electricity, which tends to get all the attention, is also important.  The future for this country will be in the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency which will help us to easily meet those targets of which I spoke earlier, if we are dedicated to the task.</P>
        <P>There are, however, other views.  Rather than denying a forum for people with different views, it is better to have a debate because out of a debate one gets certainty.  An Oireachtas committee is the appropriate forum in which to debate the way forward in terms of renewables, coal or <Col N="1055"/>whatever power supply might be the way forward.  We should bring in experts, let them have their say and draw up a report.  If we can reach common understanding that, for a variety of reasons, nuclear does not make sense, that will give much greater impetus to those who provide the alternative because they will know that we are going down that route and it will make more business and planning sense for them to provide the alternative.  A joint Oireachtas committee can play a vital role in that sense in helping us, as a people, make this considerable and important change to a new renewable energy efficient future.</P>
        <P>As I am conscious I have probably gone over the time available, I will finish by saying this Government is utterly committed to the task ahead of us.  It will take time to achieve certain of the changes one might want.  One does not change matters in energy overnight.  It takes time because those investment decisions have a legacy period.  We will take into account the future interests of the Irish people in making a switch from our use of fossil fuels.  We are moving towards an all-Ireland market because that would bring about a much more transparent and competitive energy system.  We are doing this in co-operation with our neighbour by having greater and wider interconnection into the rest of Europe and being part of an open European energy market system.  We will introduce the likes of LNG facilities, which give back-up supplies when main pipelines can no longer feed us.  As announced last week, we will put smart meters into every home.  This will start with 25,000 houses in a pilot scheme and then every house in the country will be provided with a smart meter in order that people can play their part by monitoring their use of energy, cutting down and saving money.  We will build renewables on a scale which will make us an international leader, particularly in wind energy but also possibly in other new areas, such as biomass, ocean and microgeneration, where all that is holding us back is imagination and political and business commitment.  We will do this, but only when there is clear political leadership and there a clear understanding on the reasons for doing it, and the reality of the challenge facing us.  That understanding will come from discussion and from teasing out the issues in Cabinet, in the Oireachtas and from there to the rest of the country.</P>
        <P>I commend this House to that task.</P>

Only a few weeks ago, the Independent Senators, in fairness to them, moved a motion on climate change that won cross-party support in the House.  Their motion set the bar high, as they stated on the day that it will require the Government to achieve what it says it will achieve.  We, as Opposition parties, will work with the Minister because climate change is an issue for the planet, for Ireland and for the people who we represent, and it must be taken seriously.</P>
        <P>I do not want to have to quote statistics because we all are clear on the matter.  It is important that we debate issues such as climate change, not only here in the Oireachtas but at every level in society.  Whether in the schools, the playgrounds, the pubs or the shops, the more we talk about it, the more awareness of it we create and the more education will be disseminated on the challenges that lie ahead for us all.  We accept that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are some stark facts we must examine.  Only 4.5% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy supply comes from renewables, which alone is a considerable challenge, and fossil fuels still account for approximately 92.5% of all energy used in Ireland.  It is easy to come in here and state what we will do, but we must also look back and ask what has the Government done for the past ten years.  It has propagated an economy driven by a heavy overdependence on fossil fuels, construction and on many areas that contribute to the evident climate change.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the formation of the new Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, it must work in a tangible and practical way to deliver results.  To date we have seen many policies on climate change, whether on wind energy or renewable energy, but we have seen few resources or tangible supports to drive those policies.  The challenge is there for us all.  I am looking forward to sitting on an Oireachtas committee that will drive the policies the Government will bring forward and to which we, as Opposition, can add.  I hope the Minister will listen to what we have to offer because we represent a large constituency in this country.  We will bring proposals to committee that will be tangible and workable and we hope the Government can take them on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to build the necessary interconnecting infrastructure with other electricity markets to which the Minister referred.  There needs to be a significant increase in generation from wind energy and an increase in the research and development funding in the offshore hydro-electric sector to ensure established targets are met.  We also need to set clear targets for the wood <Col N="1058"/>energy sector in order to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s overdependence on fossil fuels.  As the Minister stated, we need to make Ireland less car dependent by fast-tracking high capacity commuter public transport.  This is something that has not happened to date.  One can travel on any road in Ireland and see the congestion with cars and heavy goods vehicles.  We need to do more in the area of public transport to improve matters in this area.</P>
        <P>I ask also that we examine reform of the vehicle registration tax through the establishment of a system of energy efficiency labelling for motor vehicles.  We should provide people with incentives to drive cars that are more energy efficient.  As there are many such cars available, it should be relatively easy for the Government to do so.  I ask that we examine that as a way of tackling, in a small way that could have a major impact, the climate change issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, according to the EPA.  An establishment of a carbon fund of &euro;270 million, managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, was announced in Budget 2007.  A fund of &euro;270 million for indigenous renewable energy could have a massive impact.  We need to reverse our thinking on how we apply our funding to provide incentives for renewable energies rather than buy our way out of trouble which seems to be the way we are going.  The &euro;270 million investment in Kyoto credits does nothing to secure energy supply; it just serves to let the Government off the hook regarding its responsibility to cut CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Neither does it do anything to ease our overwhelming over-dependence on oil as an energy source.  This is most worrying, especially when one considers the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s announcement today regarding oil prices, a point to which the Minister referred.  This is a stark warning to us all which we should not even need at this stage.</P>
        <P>In its election manifesto, Fine Gael called for the establishment of a centre for excellence, incorporating Sustainable Energy Ireland, a body which does marvellous work with limited resources.  The greener homes scheme had a good impact in terms of promoting renewable energies for domestic dwellings.  However, I picked up on some negativity regarding the scheme.  The pioneers of renewable energy in homes who invested in this area when no grants were available were left behind when this scheme was introduced.  The Minister may be aware of the feelings on this matter also.  These people did not qualify for grants because they had already installed renewable energy technologies in their homes.  They were left out in the cold when the grants were introduced, even though they were willing to take a risk and invest in renewable energies when nobody else was doing so.</P><Col N="1059"/>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland is doing good work and creating awareness in communities and it needs all the help it can get.  A centre of excellence incorporating Sustainable Energy Ireland should be attached to an institute of technology and this centre would encourage, incentivise and develop the alternative energy sector with the objective of replacing a major percentage of energy imports and securing supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we wish to address issues of climate change and energy security such a base of research and innovation is imperative and has the potential to form a lucrative component of Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy.  David Taylor of Sustainable Energy Ireland believes the market for ocean energy may be worth up to &euro;2 billion for the Republic if developed properly.  It is certainly worth looking into this option.  The Irish company, OpenHydro, which designs and manufactures marine turbines which are used to generate renewable energy from deep-sea tidal currents, was awarded almost &euro;2 million in grant support from the Scottish Executive.  The aim of this UK Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s initiative is to become a world leader in supplying marine technology.  Only a few countries such as Portugal and Ireland have the potential to rival Scotland&rsquo;s marine and wind energy resources.  Ireland has significant potential in terms of this natural resource.  We are surrounded by water and we have rolling hillside that could support wind farms if managed and developed properly.  The potential is significant if we are serious about exploiting this area.</P>
        <P>We should support and invest in our own green entrepreneurs.  I hope the Minister takes on board this point.  We can have all the policies and committees we like but it is crucial we must support entrepreneurs to promote renewable energies both economically and in terms of a mentoring system.  We must provide support for their drive to achieve.  Currently we have policies, but support on the ground is lacking.  This is an issue worth addressing in more depth in committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept there will be other opportunities to discuss the range of other issues I wish to address.  A proper feasibility study needs to be carried out on the east-west interconnector.  The Minister has proposed the installation of a 500 MW interconnector.  A feasibility study must be carried out on an interconnector.  For very little extra investment we could install capacity for 1,000 MW without building the stations at both sides.  We could install the cable to carry that capacity and leave room for expansion that may be required in the years ahead.  We can then import and export electricity at a better rate and we will not be as constrained as is currently the case.</P>
        <P>This debate has provided much food for thought.  We in Fine Gael are serious about green <Col N="1060"/>issues such as climate change and energy security and we always have been.  We will work proactively in the committee system in this regard.  The measures outlined in the Fine Gael amendment are tangible and practical ways for the Government to achieve results in terms of climate change.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for attending this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I join with my colleague, Senator Coffey, in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for his maiden speech in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the thrust of the two previous contributions, and from all reasonable debate on this area, that in future there must be a push for increased use of geothermal energy in housing and on a larger scale in power stations.  There should be an increase in grants to entice developers in the construction industry to use the greener home scheme as much as possible in new projects.  The Government must provide a combination of grants and tax allowances in an imaginative package to incentivise developers to go down the road of using geothermal energy in new housing schemes.  I am proud that some of the largest developers in the country are from my county and operate there and in Dublin.  I hope they will take on board this approach.  This would also incentivise other people and get the public involved and help to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>The Italian transport service has tested and validated the use of solar panels on trains.  I urge the Minister to examine this possibility here.  It appears solar panels can work well and this technology could be used here on the Luas and in other rail systems to conserve energy.  This approach could have great potential.</P>
        <P>A push is required for more re-use of waste from the construction industry.  Waste materials should be re-used when old houses are being demolished or refurbished.  A study was carried out in Wales which showed such an approach could be successful.  Building rubble can be used for roadways and a variety of other uses.  I urge the Minister to examine this option, perhaps in a committee.</P>
        <P>It is likely that the environment committee of the EU is about to introduce legislation to cap carbon emissions from cars.  It appears it will adopt a similar system to our vehicle registration tax system which would, in effect, mean it will not be possible to use cars above a certain power.  We must examine this area.</P>
        <P>The major issue which I would urge the Minister to examine is the re-introduction of a national railway network.  I accept this is a national debate rather than a parochial one but I wish to use an example from my area as I know it best.  I refer to the possibility of the establish<Col N="1061"/>ment of a Navan to Dublin rail link.  There is already a commercial line from Kingscourt to Navan and one could provide park and ride facilities in Navan.  This would allow people to travel also from the commuter belt of Cavan and north Meath to Navan and from there to Dublin by rail.  The rail system should be extended all over the country as it is a critical mode of transport.  The public does not see enough of a commitment to rail services by the Government.  This issue is so important it should be more high profile in the Government&rsquo;s objectives.</P>
        <P>We have an abundance of wind as a resource in Ireland.  Generating electricity from wind results in no CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and can thus make a valuable contribution to meeting our requirements under the Kyoto Protocol.  The Minister spoke at the opening of the Bindoo wind farm at the Mountain Lodge near Cootehill in County Cavan, the area where I was reared.  This was one of the most pleasant exercises we had enjoyed in a long time.  The wind farm is marvellous in terms of what it will contribute to the grid in terms of renewable energy.  It is also marvellous in a secondary way.  The delight of the local farming community that day was palpable in terms of the income it will provide to small farmers, the farming community in general and other landowners in this area.  I welcome this income, especially given the difficulties in the cattle trade and so on.  It is important that this be done.</P>
        <P>I share the concern that grants are not adequate for the introduction of solar panels and the use of wood chip burners to provide geothermal options in houses.  I note the Minister has recently reduced the grants, the argument being, as I understand it, that these technologies generate their own activity and no longer need to be supported.  I argue that to achieve a proper culture with regard to the use of such technologies and to achieve proper change, the premature reduction of the grants should be reconsidered.  Those who take the alternative route need an incentive.  This would make good economic sense in the long run and is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
        <P>Increased use should be made of small wind turbines for private houses and communities of houses.  Yesterday, on the invitation of a friend and in preparation for this debate, I visited some of the old flax and corn mills dotted throughout counties Cavan and Monaghan.  These traditional mills were powered by water and it seems a reasonable supposition that they could now power alternators and generate electricity.  The Minister should investigate this suggestion, which I commend to the attention of a future committee.  We must think outside the box in this regard.  Water is a natural, God-given resource so why not use it?  I cannot believe such a project would not be sustainable.</P><Col N="1062"/>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  It underlines the gravity of the threat of carbon emissions and the lack of emphasis on renewables.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We have observed him in Opposition and since he came to ministerial office as one who has quite a grasp of this subject area.  I fully subscribe to his request that the issue should be approached on a non-party basis.  It is a pity an amendment to the motion has been tabled.  I appreciate that the phrase &ldquo;commends the Government&rdquo; probably invited an amendment but it strikes me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very good amendment.  Did the Senator read it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is the collective wisdom of and the cross-fertilisation of ideas across the House which will bring the suggestions we need to harness to tackle this serious challenge.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the three related areas of security of supply, environment and competitiveness.  This is a global problem and the target is to cut global emissions by 70% over the course of this century.  This is a very challenging target which requires significant world leadership.  When the major economy in the world, the US, does not fully embrace the Kyoto Protocol, this raises concerns.  It is probable that within the next quarter of a century we will have a new world economic leader in China.  As it grows, it will undoubtedly add considerably to emissions, as is happening at present.  Real issues and challenges arise in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been interesting programmes on this topic on television and other media.  It is interesting to note that experts will often differ.  Some set out the seriousness of the problem and what needs to be done to address it.  Others, however, will point out that in the millions of years the planet has existed, change has been cyclical and there has been tremendous climate change, as we know from our school days when we learned about the ice age.  The gases to which we refer were always in the atmosphere but industrialisation has significantly increased their concentration.  We know also of the harmful health effects of ultraviolet radiation which is now getting through as a result of damage to the ozone layer.</P>
        <P>Television programmes show us images of glaciers melting near the North Pole and polar bears stranded on icebergs in the middle of the sea.  I found on the Internet that experts believe the largest glacier in South America, the Upsala glacier, which is 870 sq. km., is retreating by 60 m per year, and has been doing so for the past 60 <Col N="1063"/>years.  This underlines the rate at which climate change is having a serious effect on ecosystems as well as on rainfall.</P>
        <P>The impact of this will be negative, with serious consequences for every continent.  It will have an effect on northern Europe, which will be more vulnerable to floods, while southern Europe will become more susceptible to drought, with a consequential effect on agriculture.  The northern region will experience increased yields while there will be decreased output in the southern region.  While we could, given our situation, take a selfish view that our temperatures will increase by a couple of percentage points in the next 50 years, this would be very short-sighted because the effects will have such dramatic adverse consequences for countries and peoples across the globe as to ensure we will also be seriously affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Coastal erosion and flooding are further issues.  We have witnessed an increase in flooding in all continents in recent decades with the serious consequences this brings.  In Europe, the Netherlands will be particularly susceptible given that much of the country is below sea level.  Many islands, such as the Seychelles, will be in danger of severe flooding, as will parts of Asia.  A recent report stated that all of Bangladesh and much of Vietnam would be completely covered by water and many coastal cities in Japan will suffer the same fate.</P>
        <P>Climate change in Africa will be severe.  Desert areas will increase in size and the loss of productive land is expected to accelerate, which will have an impact on food production.  Given the problem of famine in Africa, this change will only accentuate it.</P>
        <P>The case for taking effective action is incontrovertible, which brings me to the question of what action we have taken in this regard.  Ireland has embraced the Kyoto Protocol.  It was to reduce its emissions by 13% by 2012 and, effectively, it is on target to achieve this.  Nonetheless, much more can and should be done.  Senator Coffey decried the fact we were buying credits as a means of meeting our targets.  There is nothing wrong with that because this is a global problem and a global challenge.  We are a small island and we must play our part but it is only through all nations coming together in partnership and focusing their efforts on a common goal that we can hope to make the significant reductions that are necessary.  It is a complex area, however.</P>
        <P>To some extent the reductions to be achieved challenge policies in other areas.  All of us in these Houses are supportive of our overseas development aid programme.  We recognise that Asia, Africa and many other Third World countries need economic support to allow them achieve a sustainable economic level and support them<Col N="1064"/>selves.  That, in turn, will lead to a significant increase in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> but it is not within our remit to advocate that they should minimise their goals and objectives of developing their economies in order for the international community to meet its targets.</P>
        <P>An aspect that has not arisen in the debate so far is the need for a real emphasis on improving technology and investing in scientific research to ensure the technical changes can come about as well as trying to reduce emissions in that area.  It is only in doing that that we can cut our emissions from fossil fuels and the like.</P>
        <P>I was in China in 2000 and had no difficulty driving through the centre of Beijing.  There were not many cars to be seen.  I returned to China two or three years later, however, and there were traffic jams everywhere in Beijing.  Apparently, that arose because of the SARS epidemic where people opted to buy cars to move about rather than use public transport because of the danger of contracting SARS on public transport.  It was interesting to see the different influences that can be brought to bear that can skew the efforts being made in that regard.</P>
        <P>As Senator Coffey said, we have much to do in this regard.  We talked about that this morning in the office.  The heating was on but it was too warm and we had to open the windows.  There is a certain contradiction in all of that.  Likewise, as Members leave their offices this evening I have no doubt they will see televisions and computers on in empty rooms.  Good housekeeping starts with ourselves and if we do not take personal ownership in the first instance, and that comes back to generating awareness and people seeing it as the partnership the Minister identified, the progress we seek will not be achieved.</P>
        <P>I concur with the comment made by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly about the national rail line, particularly in the commuter belts, but as someone who served as president of the Irish Road Haulage Association and would have examined rail transport, I believe our country is too small to generate a transfer of major tonnage from our roads to railways.  We need a good road network.  That is why I welcome the building of motorways.  We need much better traffic management.  If one wants to see bad traffic management one only has to go out to the roundabout at the Red Cow Inn.  That was designed not too long ago but international practice has superseded what was done there.  All those delays in traffic give rise to many of the emissions.  I would not deny that we need better public transport also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned investment earlier.  Wind energy was mentioned also and in my county and on the Arklow bank, many wind farms have been erected.  There is a limit to what they will contribute but none the less they are an important component in getting from 15% to 33% sufficiency <Col N="1065"/>by 2020, although wave energy must have real potential.  I believe it was Senator O&rsquo;Toole who said in the House recently &mdash; I saw the report in the newspaper &mdash; that somebody was developing a machine in Galway.  We must support that type of research to ensure that kind of modem for generating energy is developed.  Given our pivotal position on the west coast of Europe, the potential for us as a nation is strong in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the issue of bio-fuels, should we be looking at set-aside?  Bio-fuels will now have an effect on food prices.  Why should we be setting aside land if there is a demand in terms of other crops for doing that?</P>
        <P>While nuclear energy is clean and may help us on reducing emissions, we do not have the right &mdash; I opposed this from the first time I was elected to Wexford County Council in 1979 &mdash; to give a legacy to future generations of a waste that will be radioactive for thousands of years.  We should look to alternatives.  It would be a last resort and one that I would find difficult to support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my colleagues, Senators Quinn and Norris.  I will speak for three minutes.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  All of us recognise and appreciate his genuine commitment to developing an effective policy on energy security and tackling climate change.  However, the Fine Gael amendment deserves our support because it recognises, realistically, the true extent of the challenges we face in developing that sort of policy.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I want to mention a Bill I introduced in the House on 3 October that Senator Coffey has already mentioned, the Climate Protection Bill currently on the Order Paper and for the debate on which the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Gormley, was present in the House.  I am delighted to say the Bill got general cross-party support and will be debated again in Government time in the House in December.</P>
        <P>The idea of a Bill would underline and emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to policy in this area.  An Oireachtas committee is one thing, and it is welcome, but it does not go as far as legislation and does not go far enough to secure binding commitments from this and future Governments to meeting what the Minister has described as both our short-term and long-term commitments to reducing climate change.  The Bill sets an ongoing statutory goal of reducing emissions by at least 3% per year, starting from 2010, and also includes the long-term goal of reducing emissions by at least 60% in 2050.  All of those relate to Kyoto commitments to which Ireland has already signed up.  It is not a radical proposal but it is one that would secure a commitment beyond the security provided by the political promises in a programme for Government.</P><Col N="1066"/>
        <P>This programme for Government is to be welcomed.  It is radical in its approach to climate change and energy security yet we have seen in the past political promises being made and broken on vital issues like hospital waiting lists and road safety.  We have seen promises not being met because they are not underscored and emphasised by a legislative commitment and sanctions.  That is what the Bill, which I commend to the House, represents and that is why I ask the Government to support it.  I support the Fine Gael amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for sharing her time.  The Minister is welcome here as are his words.  The aim of every Member here is the same as that of the Minister.  It is a question of how best we achieve it.</P>
        <P>I am a great believer in the marketplace.  The market driven economy achieves a great deal, sometimes much more than legislation.  I am on the board of the Food Market Institute in the United States and chairman of EuroCommerce in Brussels.  It is interesting that in the past, the battles between supermarkets for competition was based on price and range.  The battle is now based on how green one is and whether one is effective in that regard.  It is interesting to see that in Europe and throughout the world.</P>
        <P>I do not get the sense that we have made the necessary mindset change here to ensure people recognise the challenge.  The Minister said that earlier.  Any national strategy must take, as a starting point, our overdependence on oil.  The whole strategy must develop out of that reality, something the Minister touched on, because that is the threat we face and which we have to work to counter.</P>
        <P>In addressing the threat, our policy must rest on two pillars, each of which must be pursued with equal commitment.  Most of our efforts appear to be devoted to the second pillar, the production of energy from alternative sources.  I concur with Senator Jim Walsh on this issue.  Ireland tends to overlook the first pillar, energy conservation.  It is not necessary to find or pay for energy which is not consumed.  Part of our national energy problem is the reckless profligacy with which we use energy.  It is an unfortunate side effect of our current prosperity that we behave almost as if it were a virtue to waste energy.  This applies to the manner in which we build houses and use cars and to practices such as not bothering to switch off lights and so on.  Everywhere one turns one observes the waste of vast amounts of energy.  This may be foolish today but it will be madness tomorrow.  The national strategy must address energy conservation before dealing with other matters.</P>
        <P>Last week, Ireland and Britain lost an hour of daylight when the clocks were put back.  Ireland <Col N="1067"/>should take the lead by adopting central European time.  If the Minister took this single step and showed no regard for whether Britain followed suit, we would gain a substantial benefit through energy conservation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time and welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to the House.  It is good for the Irish people and the House that the Green Party has entered Government, although I am not certain it is good for the party.  I believe the party will act on our behalf while in Government. </P>
        <P>The optimism of the Minister is also good, although he may be a little over-optimistic in his view that refrigerators, cars and so forth have a life of 15 years.  Unfortunately, planned obsolescence is a concept we must attack because many items do not last for 15 years.  With regard to cars, we should consider introducing a tax based on fuel consumption rather than engine size.  I and many others have old cars.  I walked to the House today, although I used to cycle here.  Unfortunately, it has become too dangerous to cycle in Dublin, despite the fragmented cycle lanes.</P>
        <P>Addressing these issues earlier today, Professor Frank Convery, a distinguished environmentalist, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Setting targets on climate change and sustainability is painless, but meeting them requires putting in place the right policies; sufficient resources and well-motivated and functioning institutions at national, regional and local levels.  To be effective, sustainable development policy must involve many Government Departments and agencies working together and must interact productively with stakeholders in business and the community.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Given the lack of communication we observed in a single area, the health service, it will be a major challenge to the Green Party to develop the type of networking approach required with Ministers from other parties.</P>
        <P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, on producing the Climate Protection Bill 2007.  I will follow its progress with great interest.  The Green Party will learn that there are harsh political realities, as might Senator Bacik, although she is very much a realist.</P>
        <P>Ireland appears to be leading the field in wave energy.  For example, some of the technical problems of harnessing the bobbing motion of waves have been solved by Irish scientists.  This is a welcome development in which the Government should invest.</P><Col N="1068"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine a specific matter.  During the debate on Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill, I handed a letter to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.  I ask his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to ensure the issue is followed up.  The letter was written by individuals with whom I have had contact in Cyprus and Switzerland who have developed an interesting and sophisticated high frequency ignition system which will save considerable amounts of fuel.  I ask that the Government investigate this technology with a view to possibly investing in it or assisting its development.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to have the system assessed?  In this regard, I am pleased that a large company, Dodge motors, has today announced the launch of a new green car.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to ensure that the media and certain political sources lay off the Shell to Sea group, whose campaign is perfectly right.  I am one of the old-fashioned pinkos who believe we should own the wealth of the country and the means of production and distribution.  We should take control of our resources, which may increase as we drill deeper under the Atlantic Ocean.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. </P>
        <P>One of the more interesting features of Standing Orders in this House is that the Government side has Private Members&rsquo; time to highlight what it regards as interesting developments in specific policy areas, a facility not available in the other House.  The side effect of this is that Government motions may sometimes appear self-congratulatory and other Senators may view their role as being to prick this pomposity.  The motion is well written, referring, for example, to the commitment to developing a policy, rather than stating that actions taken to date have been done well or things are as they should be.  It also points out that we have a considerable distance to travel.  As a result of the formation of this Government and the agreements in the programme for Government we at least have an acknowledgement that this is a policy priority and an issue on which the Government and my party&rsquo;s participation in it must be judged.  On those grounds, I had hoped for a more generous response from the Opposition than that which I have heard so far in the debate.</P>
        <P>While I do not disagree with the sentiments expressed by the Senators who moved and seconded the amendment, nevertheless, the decision to move the amendment runs counter to the spirit of the motion.  Although I do not disagree with the amendment&rsquo;s core elements, the difficulty is that it includes a checklist running to several times the length of the motion.  What the House needs is a discussion on how to secure <Col N="1069"/>cross-party support for political action on meeting our targets.</P>
        <P>I get a sense from the amendment that it is a case of opposition for the sake of it, an exercise in finger-pointing that is meant to imply the Government is not doing its job and the Opposition would do a better job if it was in power.  That is not the correct approach to this issue.</P>

	<P>I welcome the debate, even if it might lead us down some dark alleys.  In moving the motion, I set out to acknowledge the direction of Government policy.  While we have not yet achieved anything in some areas, some Government initiatives are important in their own right.  For example, the establishment of the committee on climate change and energy security and the existence of a Cabinet sub-committee on the same subject demonstrates that this policy area is a Government priority, one on which we will be judged. </P>
        <P>The targets in the programme for Government are ambitious and require a political price to be paid if implemented directly by the Government.  It is easy to oppose the effects of trying to reach these targets and I have listened to some of the comments on the construction industry and access to private transport.  If we are to reach climate change targets we must make dramatic changes in the way we live.  The figures cited in the amendment, for example, that fossil fuels account for more than 90% of our energy consumption and that more than 80% of our energy requirements are imported, do not make environmental or economic sense.  We are cutting off our nose to spite our face.  If we take collective action, it must benefit the country socially, environmentally and economically.  As yet, this is not understood.  As we go deeper into the debate and use the new mechanisms available to us, such as the Oireachtas committee, understanding will permeate political discussion.</P><Col N="1070"/>
        <P>Other measures are worth acknowledging.  Nothing has been achieved because it is early in the Government&rsquo;s life, but new building regulations &mdash; 40% to 60% to 80% towards totally energy efficient houses &mdash; have been drafted.  This week, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced that 25,000 homes would receive smart meters.  Such is the poverty of information in and the quality of this debate that, when these measures were introduced, some of those who debated against them, including members of the media, purported that energy efficient building regulations would increase the cost of housing.  They ignored the fact that people would spend less on the running of their houses.</P>
        <P>When the smart metering announcement was made today, a national newspaper carried a story from the Commission on Electricity Regulation and claimed that installing smart meters would increase the price of electricity.  This is nonsense because the meters will give people the opportunity to determine how much electricity they use so that they can work towards reducing that amount and offer them the opportunity to sell electricity to the grid.  When there is such misreporting or misunderstanding, some of it deliberate, one sees how far there is to go to put together a coalition of the willing in respect of the environment.  I am almost afraid to use that term.</P>

We are dealing with ignorance and vested interests, to whose advantage our continuation in this way would be.  Without the ability to tackle the issue collectively, we will make our problems worse.</P>
        <P>I disagree with statements to the effect that the paying of credits alone is a sufficient policy measure.  In the programme for Government, it is no longer the sole measure.  We must work together on an agreed policy to ensure the use of credits is minimised to the smallest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The main Opposition party should reconsider tabling its amendment, which does not add to the motion.  The list of individual measures is too small, as hundreds more should be included.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Often, Government motions are amusing and this motion is no exception.  Senator Boyle believes it might be pompous to raise this subject, but asking us to support and commend the Government on its commitment to develop a policy is amusing.</P>
        <P>A Government must be real.  Rather than promising to do something in future, it must do something now.  Ireland produces too many greenhouse gases.  Greenhouse gas emissions in the northern hemisphere must be considered.  While the United States of America is the largest producer of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, Ireland and Europe do not fall far behind.  We should not be proud of our record.  Every year, each EU citizen produces 11 tonnes of greenhouse gases and households produce 16% of our emissions.  The production of energy accounts for 61% of Europe&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions and transport accounts for 21%, half of which comprises freight, to which Senator Walsh referred.  The other half comprises private car usage.</P>
        <P>The EU is racing to change these figures, but Ireland is lagging behind.  According to the European Union Environment Agency&rsquo;s June figures, EU greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 0.7% and Ireland&rsquo;s increased by 2%.  While other European countries are improving, we are falling behind.  The agency&rsquo;s report led to a statement by Commissioner Dimas to the effect that many states must accelerate their efforts &mdash; it is clear that he included Ireland in this &mdash; if the EU is to meet its Kyoto Protocol targets.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I regret that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is not in the House because I have specific questions.  I will put them to the Minister of State instead.  Why is Ireland not investing sufficiently in renewable energy sources, why do we remain content to burn so much fossil fuel and how will the Minister get a commitment from his Government partners to do something about climate change?  I do not doubt his or his party&rsquo;s commitment, but they have not achieved many of their aims since their involvement in Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to the debate going down dark alleyways.  If he did so with his Government partners, he would go in green and <Col N="1072"/>come out black and blue.  How does the Green Party expect to get its policies and commitments on energy, climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases through the rest of the Cabinet?  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion.</P>
        <P>It is not right that Senators must listen to self-congratulatory motions lauding the Government on its commitments for the future when we are lagging behind other European nations.  My party and I will support the Fine Gael amendment.  It might be distasteful for the Government, but the amendment reflects reality.  The 1997 Kyoto Agreement places tight obligations on us.  We were not supposed to exceed a 13% increase in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions between 1997 and the turn of this decade, but they have increased by 180%.  Leaving carbon trading aside, nothing has been done by the Government.  It is not fair to tell the House that the Government wishes to meet its Kyoto Protocol targets in some way or another after Ireland has already exceeded those targets.</P>
        <P>The Government cannot deny that a mere 4.5% of our energy is supplied by renewable sources and that fossil fuels account for 93%, but its Senators will vote against the amendment.  It is not right for them to do so or for the Government to try to deny that the use of fossil fuels in transport has exploded by 150% in the past 15 years.  The Government is disinterested in solving the issue.  If it were interested, it would support the Fine Gael recommendations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One sixth of our emissions comes from housing.  We must prioritise areas in which we allow housing to develop.  There is a great deal of zoned land, but it should be given to developers who will produce and build eco-residential towns and estates rather than monolithic rows of houses.  The estates should take into account energy conservation and the recycling of waste water supplies and provide more cycle and pedestrian paths and live-work units so that people need not travel to work.  We must examine how we design and prioritise the development of our towns and villages.  We must think about how we produce our energy.  The amendment calls for a review of the national spatial strategy to cater for major renewable energy infrastructure sources.  As 60% of our emissions come from energy production, it is vital that we re-examine how we produce energy.  We must examine wind farming and offshore energy.</P>
        <P>Transport accounts for 21% of our emissions.  We must improve the public transport network and supply to encourage more people to leave their cars at home and take the nearest bus or rail line.  Thousands of people travel to Dublin every day on trains.  The train service from Dundalk to Drogheda is packed virtually every day of the week.  People, including pregnant women, have to stand because the seats are taken.  It is also difficult for disabled people to find space.  We cannot <Col N="1073"/>hope to encourage more people onto transport without first providing facilities for them.</P>
        <P>I would like the catchment area for rail services to be expanded.  The Navan-Dublin rail line should be prioritised, as should schemes such as the re-opening of stations to make them more accessible and closer to centres of population.  I refer the Minister of State to potential schemes such as new stations at Killucan.  I would be interested to know his views on expanding the rail network and the number of stations to encourage as many people as possible onto public transport.  I will not support this motion because enough has not been done. If we are serious about tackling climate change we must do better and do it soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share my time with Senator Brady, who will speak first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with many of the Minister&rsquo;s comments to this House.  All sections of society have a role to play.  I will not repeat what everybody has said.  We all know the challenges facing the world due to climate change.  State agencies and trade unions must get involved.  People will have to change how they behave at home and at work.  We cannot bulldoze into this.  These people must be consulted and made aware.  As a former trade unionist I have discovered many times that Irish people do not like change.  If one moved a person from the bottom to the top floor, there was protest.  One must create awareness and bring people along.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan mentioned public transport and he is correct.  The public transport in my area is good.  However, CIE and other agencies such as local authorities are not playing their part with measures such as park and ride facilities to encourage people to use public transport.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh made a point about waste of energy, particularly where lights are left on in buildings all day.  In my house I see the children leaving lights, radios and televisions on all day.  We must provide a schools education programme.  We can only bring people along if we raise their awareness.  I congratulate the Department of Defence, which is inspecting its buildings with a view to having stand-alone systems in each room whereby lights and heating automatically switch on and off when a person enters and leaves.  That is welcome.  Companies such as Eircom and State agencies such as Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus must be consulted.  That involves discussions with trade unions.  We could trigger strikes if we embark on changes without making people aware of what we are doing.</P>
        <P>I have strong views on pollution, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly knows.  I am from Cavan and I fish there.  Farmers and factories can put rivers and lakes out of commission for years by polluting them.  This has a significant effect on global <Col N="1074"/>warming and climate change and has a detrimental effect on soil.  However, the fines are so small that they make no difference to the polluters.  The fine for pollution is approximately &euro;500, which is a pittance.  We do not want to take sudden harsh measures but we must teach people that this is no longer acceptable, that we must change how we behave at work and at home.  We must involve people.</P>
        <P>This is a major problem worldwide and we have to catch up because events have run ahead of us.  Ireland must play its part.  The Government has outlined what it intends to do, and I will not repeat it, as everybody is aware of it.  This demands all-party agreement and an all-party approach.  We cannot make this a political issue.  This is for future generations as well as this one.  If we do not work cohesively we will face disaster.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak but am sorry the Minister is not here.  However, if he were here we might have descended into a mutual admiration society.  During the last Government he was one of the most impressive members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and pioneered the notion of working on an all-party basis.  I am sorry to tell Senator Coffey that while other parties supported this, although the Labour Party was reluctant, Fine Gael opposed it.  That was a pity because in the long term it is the one way we can deal with this together.  It is an issue for the next generation and there is no politics to be gained from it.</P>
        <P>Regarding energy security, the brief could not be in better hands.  The Minister is committed to dealing with energy and has tremendous understanding of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator O&rsquo;Malley thinking of joining the Green Party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke without notes.  He is committed to this issue.  We could not have a better person responsible for it.  I wish him well and have every faith that he will make a real effort to deliver on the target results.  His commitment to diminishing carbon emissions is unsurpassed in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security is welcome, but I wonder how it will operate with the existing committee.  I hope there will not be much conflict.  As a person interested in the energy future of the country I wanted to see on which committee one would be best placed.  I like to think the two committees will work well together.  We must examine this issue.  The Minister gave good ideas on the agenda of the committee and he will make himself available <Col N="1075"/>to both committees.  I am very focused on this and am looking forward to the establishment of the committees.  When one is not attending a committee meeting every week, one finds one is not on top of an issue in the same way as one is when one is meeting regularly with people and representatives from an industry.  However, I am concerned about how the two committees will interact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister spoke about concentrating on bio-fuels.  I became interested in this area roughly four years ago and, in that time, I have noticed that the thinking has moved on and changed dramatically.  What people would have commonly believed to be best practice back then has now led to unintended consequences, for example, on the international price of grain.  It is having a devastating effect and even causing famines.  We must have the courage to think again about what was thought to be the right way forward.  The Minister does not lack courage and I believe he will have the courage to do this.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by making a small, party political point.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator going to join the Green Party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a point about my party but about small political parties.  The Green Party has demonstrated the importance of smaller political parties.  I spent my five years as a Member of the D&aacute;il trying, with the help of others, to get the building regulations changed.  We worked in the background to get the Minister to change them.  We also pursued the issue of smart metering.  Within six months of the Green Party going into Government, the change has been established as policy.  If that does not deliver a good result for the Irish people in terms of policy focus, I do not know what will.  It demonstrates the need for focused, smaller political parties.  Long may small parties continue in the Irish democratic system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Doherty.  I support the amendment put down by my colleagues.  It is somewhat rich of the Government side to laud itself for putting down this motion when one considers that it has been in office for six months and this committee is only now up and running.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal we can do in this area.  I have a few questions which the Minister might consider.  One relates to the grants for renewables.  At present, there is no grant for domestic wind turbines.  These should be made available.  The grant for solar powered and heat exchange <Col N="1076"/>systems only covers the insulation costs.  The Minister should examine the grant system because many people would be willing to change.  As many Senators said, they will have to change.  I believe they are willing to do so but the Government can make it happen faster with a small initiative.  A large outlay is required to change to wind turbines or solar power systems for household energy so people will require assistance.  I hope the Minister will consider upgrading the grant system.</P>
        <P>Senator Brady spoke about education.  We can do a great deal in this regard.  People often leave lights on outside their houses and, in many cases, those lights are hazards.  Motorists on rural roads who see the lights often think it is an oncoming car.  There could be more education on such issues.  Some time ago the former leader of Fine Gael in the Seanad, Deputy Brian Hayes, put down a motion on the building regulations and the use of hollow blocks in buildings in Dublin.  Is this covered in the new building regulations being put forward by the Green Party?  I hope so.  The Government should act on this matter immediately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to bio-fuels, a number of licences were allocated in the last year or two.  However, in some cases people are already up and running in the production of bio-fuels but they are not licensed, and are unable to get a licence.  By contrast, some licence holders and running for the next two years, which is a disgrace.  The Minister should revisit this matter with a view to giving licences to the people whose production is up and running.  It is codology that people who are already producing bio-fuels are not able to get a licence, while those who are due to put their systems in place in two years have the licences tied up.  I ask the Minister re-examine this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Paddy Burke a thug cead dom, agus am dom, labhairt ar seo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the amendment which points out the shortcomings in the Government&rsquo;s strategy to address the issue of climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We are heavily dependent on imported oil and gas.  While there is a European requirement that bio-fuel replaces 5.75% of petrol imports by 2010, the Government has set even more ambitious targets.  While I welcome this, I do not believe the necessary measures are being taken to ensure that the target will be met.  This could simply mean that dependency on imported fossil fuels is replaced by dependency on imported bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>We must build our own strategic indigenous fuel production.  That is the reason Sinn F&eacute;in has argued not only for the need to promote the growing of energy crops, for which this country is <Col N="1077"/>eminently suited, but also for the former sugar factories in Carlow and Mallow to be converted to producing a thick syrup from sugar beet for ethanol production.  To build such plants from scratch would cost many millions of euro and there are doubts about the viability of building new plants in the immediate future.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the extension of fiscal incentives for energy crop grants to encourage the development of an indigenous bio-fuels sector.  We also support the development of other renewable energy sources such as wind, wave and solar power, which have considerable potential to be expanded and to increase the share of energy demand that is met from those sources.  There is also a need to promote greater energy efficiency in domestic and commercial buildings.  Those responsible for the Oireachtas buildings are becoming more proactive on this.</P>
        <P>However, I am not satisfied that EU legislation regarding building insulation is adequate.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the inclusion of all those in receipt of fuel allowances in the greener homes and insulation grant schemes.  While this will involve a considerable initial outlay, it will be cost effective in reducing energy loss, cutting fuel bills and tackling fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the amendment, it is important that the national spatial strategy is revised to take into account the need to ensure that renewable energy infrastructure is built.  We must also ensure there is annual reporting to track progress in meeting targets for the reduction of emissions.  Only in that way can the shortfalls be addressed and action taken to ensure the targets are met and, if possible, exceeded.</P>
        <P>Later this month, Donegal County Council will receive a number of lights being imported into Ireland.  For the first time, public lighting will be lit, on a pilot basis, by solar panels.  Initiatives such as these must be promoted and the technology and research involved must be developed.  Incentives should be given to progress that technology.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Government Senators have commented that people should be encouraged to use public transport, with which I concur.  However, the Government must provide the public transport.  When I became a Member of the Seanad and met some of the Members on the Government benches, they asked me how I intended to make the four and a half hour trip to the Seanad every day and whether I took the train.  There is no train service from Donegal, or from Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone or Fermanagh.  If the Government is serious about climate change, it must start investing in public transport.  That means not just train services but also rural public transport.  Everybody could then collectively take ownership of and responsibility for reducing carbon emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With all respect to the Minister of State, I regret that the Minister is <Col N="1078"/>not here.  Having served with him on the committee, there is no doubt of his genuine passion and commitment for solutions to the most significant question facing us and the generations to come that will inhabit this planet.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some comments on the issue.  The motion as put down by the Government commends the commitment to the development of a policy.  There is broad agreement on the issues, but such is the nature of debate here that the Opposition must put down an amendment.  Notwithstanding that, we have started a process whereby great strides can be made in terms of climate change and reducing our dependency on fossil fuels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since 1990, there has been an increase of approximately 70% in the number of cars on our roads and with that has come an increase of approximately 160% to 180% in emissions from transport.  Transport is now responsible for one third of our emissions.  In that regard, there is a significant role to be played in the development of better public transport.  I accept Senator Doherty&rsquo;s point on the need for the enhancement of our rail network.  If we had a good rail network, more people could use the system.  Coming from the west, I think of the proposal to get the west on track.  While I acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s commitment in theory to opening the line as far as Claremorris, north of that line is little more than an aspiration.  I would like to see a firmer commitment to that.  We should look to extending the line into Donegal and make a contribution by encouraging cars off the road.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Great strides have been made on the western seaboard in terms of renewable energy, where we see the establishment of many wind farms.  However, many more farmers have appropriate sites, but they cannot get permission to go ahead with them, some for planning reasons and some because there is no facility to connect them to the national grid.  I would like to see this area prioritised.  Let us seize the day and get on with the job.  Energy consumers are indifferent as to whether their energy comes from wind, wave or elsewhere, but they like to know they are playing a part.</P>
        <P>The greener homes scheme has made a good contribution with regard to conserving energy.  There are many schemes in existence, but how many people use them?  I am one of those guilty of not participating in such schemes.  We need to find a way to force the public and people like me to engage in existing schemes that help improve our environment and conserve energy.  The power of one campaign is an example of another good campaign.</P>
        <P>We all need to become involved in conserving energy and must wake up and educate ourselves on what we need to do to play our part.  It always <Col N="1079"/>seems to us to be something someone else should do.  Everyone else should take the rickshaw, but we should still be able to drive a three litre turbo diesel car.  We must engage in a more meaningful way with regard to finding how best we can help to conserve energy.  The best way to encourage this is through incentivisation, whether by tax credits or direct grant schemes.  This would encourage all, particularly businesses.  If it is more financially viable for businesses to engage in conservation practices, we will begin to see a change.  This area should be explored.  I realise something has been done in this regard in the area of VRT on cars, but we need to expand into other areas.  Could we, for instance, provide tax credits to those who move to burning wood pellets or who invest in solar panels?  Otherwise, people will be inclined to say everybody else should do it, but they will not.</P>
        <P>Some Senators mentioned energy crops.  The north west region is conducive to these types of crops and they would serve a useful purpose in making agriculture more viable in the area.  We need to focus more on this area.  Senator Walsh mentioned he was against nuclear power.  I am in two minds about it.  I am against nuclear waste, but nuclear power is the cleanest form of energy.  We need to have a meaningful debate on the issue to weigh up the pros and cons, albeit if we decide it is definitely not for us.</P>
        <P>In terms of dealing with waste that is not recyclable, we need to consider the issues of landfill and incineration.  These are not popular issues, but we should debate them and at some stage pick the lesser of two or more evils.  We need to be mature and debate issues, rather than be fundamentalist on the approach to take.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding the gas that may be available from the Corrib gas field, whenever that happens, the north west, north of a line from Dublin to Galway and west of Mullingar, does not have the option of natural gas, which is cleaner than oil.  We would like that option.  Over several Administrations, Ministers have said they are committed to providing it and the extension of the gas national grid to include the region.  A number of reports have been prepared by various outlets, including DKM many years ago for Bord G&aacute;is, and I know another was prepared in the past 12 months.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to check the current situation in that regard?  Government subvention will be required, but let us determine the level required and arrange to have it put in place.  The people of the north west are entitled to equality of opportunity in terms of energy usage.  I am not talking here of <i>Animal Farm</i> type equality, where some people are more equal than others.</P>
        <P>I commend the many initiatives under way, but to get to the level of public engagement required to make a difference, we need to focus the minds of our people.  Sad as it may seem, to do that we need to have some kind of financial incentive. <Col N="1080"/> The reality is that tax credits or some form of reward are required.  It may not be pleasant to have to accept that, but it is what we need to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome this debate.  While some aspects of this issue may be rocket science, others are not.  One that is not concerns driving into the city on any of the main highways on the north side &mdash; the N1, N2 or N3.  For anybody who comes to the city on these routes, there is no place for them to park and ride and use public transport.  The car parks of pubs along the N2 are filled each morning, not with people who are in drinking, but by the cars of people who have nowhere to park and ride.  This is a simple area that could be addressed and should be considered because it would have an immediate impact.</P>
        <P>I wish to re-emphasise the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley.  The decision by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the building regulations on insulation, is the most progressive made in this area since I entered the Seanad.  Senators are well aware that I and former Senator, Deputy Brian Hayes, have pushed this issue for years.  I contend that since 1998 we have built over 250,000 sub-standard insulated houses despite being well aware they did not meet the regulations.The Government invented a new form of measuring heat loss through the roof when the rest of the world measured it on the basis of the amount of energy required to heat a cubic metre of house space annually.  I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has now introduced that system.</P>
        <P>I have also been seeking the introduction of smart meters.  I was pleased to hear the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources say during the week that if people have wind generators or micro-generators at home they can feed surplus energy back into the grid and be paid for it, however small the amount.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions recently, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has raised the question of waste-derived fuel and variations of it.  Effectively, this is a basic scientific idea but it is not rocket science.  It captures methane from landfill waste.  There is a more progressive method of creating waste-derived fuel, which is being developed at the University of Limerick.  A company currently investing in this method is building such plants for local authorities in England, which will involve 100 million tonnes of waste annually.  It could replace incineration here were we to opt for it.</P><Col N="1081"/>
        <P>Triple glazing should also be grant aided.  Senator Burke referred earlier to the need for such grants and he is right.  There are no grants for wind generators on a house but I do not know why.  I have spoken to Sustainable Energy Ireland about this matter but no one can give me an answer.  There is no reason for not providing such grants.</P>
        <P>A year ago, I proposed to the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that as well as changing the building regulations, which has now been done, as a second step, every new house should be required to have a wind generator or solar panels.  There are many other things that could be done but that would be a simple measure.  It has been done in other parts of the world.</P>
        <P>We also need to start constructing railways.  Many people in Ireland believe that railways are somewhat outdated, old-fashioned and Victorian things.  Recently, I drove from Barcelona in Spain to Perpignan in France where they are building a brand new TGV rail line which will cover that intercity route in one hour.  They have already built a new TGV line on the eastern side of France.  They are still building all the time while we are looking at renovating one rail line.  We have been talking about bringing the railway line to Navan for the last 15 years.  Two former Ministers for Finance have promised to do so but why is it not happening?  What is the problem?  We should just do it.  It would take less time and space to construct than a road.</P>
        <P>Every new motorway should have a railway track alongside it.  While it may be too late, I would ask the Green Party to take this proposal on board, which I have been making for ten years.  It is a simple thing to do and is undertaken in many countries around the world.  The land is already there and such a line would take up little additional space, but it means that new trains could be run there.</P>
        <P>We also need to discuss the issue of nuclear energy, although I am completely opposed to it.  I listened earlier to Senator Walsh confirm that both he and I had similar views on these matters back in the late 1970s when those in favour tried to wreck his county.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Something has changed, however, and it is rocket science.  It is the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.  Fission involves a nuclear isotope running wildly in an enclosed space and is uncontrollable, as we saw in Chernobyl, which will still be causing trouble in 1,000 years&rsquo; time. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Nuclear fusion is different because it is when both are put together.  It is much more controlled, less difficult and poses <Col N="1082"/>fewer dangers once used.  I am not suggesting that we should go into that but we need a discussion on it, if only to rule it out.  It could form part of the discussion that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, suggested we might have.</P>
        <P>In the last month, BMW has put 200 hydrogen-powered cars on the market.  This is basic science as opposed to nuclear science.  Water, designated as H<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>O, comprises two molecules of hydrogen to one of oxygen.  The separation of hydrogen from water produces the cleanest source of energy on the planet, and when used the waste is clean water.  It represents the future and while it is possible to do it now it cannot yet be done efficiently.  In other words, it takes almost as much energy to extract hydrogen from H<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>O as the energy the hydrogen would produce afterwards.  In real terms, therefore, the game is not yet worth the candle but it will develop as a future energy source.  We should be examining that possibility now.</P>
        <P>We need more rail lines and park and ride facilities.  There is empty space where the M1 and M2 meet the M50, so it would not be difficult to locate acres of parking space there, building underground if necessary.  I do not know why it is not being done.  If I were Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I would take such a decision within two weeks.  I see no reason why it cannot be done.  We have been talking about it for ten years whenever we discuss building standards, yet nothing has happened.</P>
        <P>The capturing of methane from landfills also needs to be undertaken.  While the building regulations are welcome, triple glazing should be encouraged by grants.  All new houses should have an alternative energy source.  I telephoned two local authorities recently to ask if they would give any preferential treatment in terms of seeking planning permission for a proposal to build a totally eco-friendly house.  The answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo; and as far as I know nobody does it.  We have had long debates about one-off housing but if somebody proposes to construct something that clearly does not damage the environment, is self sufficient and uses its own energy, we should encourage it.</P>
        <P>Any community in any part of Ireland which puts its hands up and offers to take full control and responsibility for all its waste and energy requirements should be given a tax break.  That can and should be done because it is not that difficult.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for allowing me to share his time.  In view of the fact that we have failed to meet our responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol and that greenhouse gas emissions are double the overall target figure, the Minister should undertake a carbon footprint audit of this House.  It would be interesting to see what fuel is used to heat the Houses of the Oireachtas and how we <Col N="1083"/>damage the environment in doing so.  The audit could be extended to all Government buildings and local authorities.  </P>
        <P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole concerning rail transport.  There is a rail link from Athlone to Mullingar which is ready to be operated but it has not even been included in Transport 21.  I ask the Minister to expedite that route.  I also concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the provision of new park and ride facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have had a good debate on this important topic.  All of us who have contributed to the discussion would agree that it is a challenging and complex area.  It covers a range of issues which can be difficult to grasp if one does not have a technical background.  Nonetheless, we can all appreciate how essential it is for the future well being of the planet to address this issue effectively.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A number of points have been made which need to be re-emphasised.  Senator Quinn referred to energy conservation, which is an important component of the general energy issue.  It can make a significant contribution because there is a waste of energy in all spheres.  We are all guilty of it to a greater or lesser degree.  I cited the example of the heating system in the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it is not easy to regulate such matters and unless somebody is policing energy conservation it tends not to happen.  It could, however, form a significant part of our contribution to the overall reduction.</P>
      
        <P>I agree fully with what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said on park and ride.  The amount of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions due to traffic jams in cities is very noticeable.  Someone once told me that if I wanted to conserve my petrol consumption, then I should switch off my engine at a traffic light and there would be a noticeable improvement in mileage from petrol use.  Park and ride is the way to approach that.  There is not enough planning done regarding these issues.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also mentioned fission versus fusion in the nuclear energy debate.  I am not an expert on it, but I remember the debates about it on Wexford County Council in the late 1970s, as <Col N="1084"/>the proposed nuclear plant was to be at Carnsore Point.  As a consequence, we were more up to speed than other councils and it was a burning issue.  Even though the Government at the time was strongly in favour of this happening, I was pleased that it did not come to fruition and we managed to cater for significant economic development in the meantime without having to resort to nuclear power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There needs to be a debate on nuclear energy and it may well be that technology has ensured that there is less danger.  However, I have a principled objection as we inherited a planet Earth in our generation that was relatively free from pollution.  The industrialisation of the last century has given rise to much damage to the planet.  We have an obligation to pass it on in an equally good condition to future generations.  Much of the waste from nuclear plants has been buried at sea, but nobody knows the adverse health consequences of that.  Who is to say that any release of radioactivity in the sea is not having an effect on our marine life?  Let us not solve today&rsquo;s problems by creating a bigger problem in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Progress is being made in areas such as bio-fuel use.  People are involved in this industry in my county and in Wicklow.  A new plant is currently being built in my own town that will produce bio-fuel.  Production of oil seed rape increased by 50% between 2006 and 2007, from 12,000 acres to 18,000 acres.  That is driven by Government policy and there is a new energy crop payment of &euro;80 per hectare, as well as establishment grants of &euro;1,400 per hectare.  However, the significant move by the Government was to provide about &euro;200 million in excise relief, which has provided the scope for people to participate in this industry.</P>
        <P>It is a pity the House will divide on the motion, because I agree with much of what is in the amendment.  I wonder if Fine Gael would be prepared to accept the Government motion and continue with the second part of its amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter this evening and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to my ongoing concern about an issue that is relevant to him and his constituency.  The sinking of a fishing vessel is something with which people in my area are very familiar.  Some families whose members were on the <i>Carrigatine</i> know at first hand the feelings of those who suffered losses in the <i>Maggie B</i> and <i>P&egrave;re Charles</i> disasters.  It is tough for entire communities when victims are not found.  I hope there may be good news for the families of the crew of the <i>P&egrave;re Charles </i>in the coming hours.</P>
        <P>I mention this because the emergency services are usually involved in marine incidents, some of which have the potential to turn into tragedies.  When something goes wrong a great onus is placed on volunteers in the RNLI and other organisations to respond and save lives.  Phil Coulter wrote about their great work in his composition &ldquo;Home from the Sea&rdquo;, which included the refrain &ldquo;Carry us safely home from the sea.&rdquo;  As with all emergency services, not enough thought is put into the service until disaster threatens.  I wish, therefore, to put on record my disappointment at the lack of priority that has been afforded to the issue of a breakwater for the RNLI at Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
        <P>The existing group of RNLI volunteers have distinguished themselves over the years by their achievements and their dedication to the people of the north west.  They have never turned their backs on call-outs for any reasons of their own.  Their work, however, has been seriously impeded <Col N="1086"/>by silting at Buncrana Harbour.  The crew has earned the right to bigger boats that are as safe, fast and modern as those of any other station of the RNLI fleet, but its ability to use the boats has been increasingly restricted.  There have been incidents in which the RNLI volunteers themselves have been almost in need of rescue.  This is unfair.  Volunteers who give of themselves in the course of trying to assist others should not be constantly battling to access their own boats in a safe manner.  Over the years, there has been a threat to withdraw the boats from the organisation, which would be a true scandal if it were allowed to happen.</P>
        <P>The quest to have this problem addressed goes back many years.  There have been many and varied attempts to dredge the area in order to free it for use by the RNLI, which is to all intents and purposes the only user of the facility.  This did not work, as the sand returned as speedily as it was being removed.  Frankly, it was a waste of money.  In March 2004 Donegal County Council, which is responsible for Buncrana Harbour, received approval for the construction of a breakwater.  This would be a real solution for the RNLI.  However, the approval was accompanied by a huge valuation on the lease.  This could not be justified in view of the limited use of the facility and the lack of any obvious new marine activity in the harbour.  Years later, the Department of Finance agreed that if the council could confirm that the breakwater was for the exclusive use of the RNLI it would waive the rental charge, or if the RNLI was a part-user there would be a reduced rental charge relative to the percentage used.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is very simple.  The only group that needs the facility is the RNLI.  The need was urgent in the past and remains urgent now.  Moneys were in place both from the Department and from the local council to build the breakwater, but time has ticked by and it is only by great fortune that disaster has not been visited upon us due to the inability of the emergency services to attend to a distress call.  Some people have tried to muddy <Col N="1087"/>the waters on this issue and, indeed, to throw mud.  The fact remains that a lease for the sole use of the RNLI could easily have a clause inserted stating that if the usage of the breakwater should change the Department of Finance or the Department of Transport will have the right to increase the rental charge.  This is not rocket science.  It would be easy for people in the Departments to add clauses to protect the Departments.</P>
        <P>At present our tourism organisations seem to place no value on marine leisure, although in time that may change.  I hope in the future to see increasing use of our rivers, lakes and seas.  When that happens, there will be a need to re-evaluate who pays what.  However, in the meantime, there is a real problem which urgently requires a solution.  I ask the Minister of State to tell me that this problem is now solved and that our emergency services can go back to what they do best, which is saving others, rather than worrying about how to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  </P>
        <P>There are two aspects to this matter.  The first relates to siltation at the harbour.  A dumping at sea permit was issued to Donegal County Council on 22 December 2006 to facilitate maintenance dredging.  I understand that the maintenance dredging has taken place and I will refer to this in more detail in a few moments.</P>
        <P>The second aspect of this matter is the drafting and acceptance by the relevant parties of a lease in respect of the proposed breakwater at Buncrana.  The council requested a reduction or total waiver of foreshore charges on the basis that the facility was to be used only by the RNLI.  Following extensive discussions and as an exceptional matter, the Department, with the agreement of the Department of Finance, informed the council that it would consider waiving the rental charges if the council could confirm that the proposed facility would be for the exclusive use of the RNLI.  In addition, the council was informed that if it was unable to confirm that the facility would be used exclusively by the RNLI, the Department was prepared to apply a reduced rental charge based on the ratio of usage of the facility by the RNLI.</P>
        <P>On 20 December 2006 the council confirmed that the facility proposed at Buncrana Harbour was solely for the use of the RNLI and was not being constructed for the benefit of any other party.  On foot of this confirmation, the Department entered into detailed discussions and correspondence with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor with a view to preparing an appropriate draft lease which would best facilitate the council&rsquo;s proposal while safeguarding the State&rsquo;s <Col N="1088"/>ongoing interest in the management and protection of the foreshore in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The draft lease will involve the insertion of specific conditions which will reflect the fact that the arrangements involved are unusual and are based on the need to provide a permanent location for the RNLI which will enable the launch of its boat on a 24-hour basis.  The Department&rsquo;s discussions with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office have focused on the public interest provisions of the Foreshore Acts, the arrangements which the council will need to make with the RNLI and other legal issues designed to protect the interests of all parties.  The lease, when drafted, will require the agreement of all relevant parties.</P>
        <P>A meeting between the Donegal county manager and myself, together with officials of the Department, took place on 25 September 2007 to discuss in some detail both aspects of this matter.  Of primary concern to my Department is that the RNLI is in a position to launch its lifeboat without difficulty, and in this regard my officials sought clarification on the position regarding dredging at the harbour.  At this meeting the county manager undertook to confirm that the dredging in respect of which my Department had issued a dumping at sea permit had in fact taken place.  The county manager has since confirmed, in a letter of 26 October 2007, that dredging took place in the harbour in May of this year and, furthermore, has acknowledged that the council is working closely with the Department to monitor the need for dredging at the harbour in order to maintain conditions which enable the RNLI lifeboat service to operate as safely and as efficiently as possible.  The Department will continue, in consultation with its specialist advisers, to assess with urgency any applications for dumping at sea permits which are required for the disposal of spoil arising from necessary dredging operations, and its engineering division will of course provide all possible assistance to the council in monitoring siltation at the harbour.</P>
        <P>The second issue, namely the property management aspect of the proposed breakwater, was also discussed at the meeting with the county manager.  The county manager has confirmed in writing that Donegal County Council currently has no plans to develop a public marina in Lough Swilly nor does Donegal County Council wish to activate a foreshore approval in Buncrana to develop a public marina in Lough Swilly.</P>
        <P>My Department met with officials of the CSSO last Friday, with a view to advancing preparation of the appropriate lease.  As already indicated, the specific conditions of the lease will need to reflect the fact that the arrangements involved are unusual and are designed specifically to facilitate the RNLI.  In this connection, one of the options which my Department will have to consider is the possibility of offering a lease directly to the RNLI.  It is understood that arrangements along these lines would be acceptable to the council.  In <Col N="1089"/>this regard, on foot of legal advice, my Department has sought an early meeting with the RNLI which, Senator Keaveney will be happy to hear, takes place tomorrow.  However, there are other options which will also have to be explored from a legal perspective.</P>
        <P>The matter of this lease is being given urgent attention at administrative and legal level and while ultimately the final lease will have to be agreed by all relevant parties, I am confident that we are near finality in this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Should the lease issue be resolved, is he confident that the money remains available for the provision of the breakwater at this point in time, given that I asked the same question of the council on Monday and was given a positive assurance on the co-funding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure Senator Keaveney that money is not an issue.  As soon as we have the legalities sorted out we will then be in a position to proceed as she requests.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome to the House this evening the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kelleher, and wish him well in his Ministry.  It is his first time to visit the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join with the Cathaoirleach in welcoming to the House the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and I wish him well and every success in the course of his Ministry.</P>
        <P>We all are aware of the difficulties encountered by people over 50 in sourcing alternative employment.  All in this House, and perhaps in the other House, have been good exponents of community employment schemes because they have transformed towns and villages throughout the country.  Without the input of community employment schemes many of our towns and villages would not look as well as they do and would not have been as successful as they are in the tidy towns competitions.</P>
        <P>Community employment schemes also give people the dignity of work.  Many people on community employment schemes are in the over 55 age group and they would find it difficult to get jobs in the open marketplace, but they are extremely content to do such valuable work on these schemes.  It would be a retrograde step that a person who was on a scheme would have to return to unemployment assistance.  It degrades the dignity which sustained him or her in that job at that time.</P>
        <P>It would also be a false economy.  The extra cost to the Exchequer in training a person on a F&Aacute;S scheme as opposed to unemployment assistance is very small.  Community employment schemes play a useful role and provide benefits <Col N="1090"/>across a wide range of activities, from cr&egrave;ches to people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise that it is important for those with disabilities who are fortunate enough to get on schemes.  They, too, do equally good and valuable work.  It is extremely important that people work in community employment and that we hold them there, if we can, until they reach retirement age.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hear the Minister of State on this subject.  I stressed the difficulty that such people would have in securing alternative employment.  We all are aware of the good voluntary and community work which they do, from cutting grass to cleaning up generally and caretaking in community halls.  The young volunteers who often did this work in the past are not there now.  I would stress that people with disabilities who have been fortunate enough to get on a scheme would be lost without it.</P>
        <P>I would plead with the Minister of State.  I look forward to hearing his response about which I am hopeful and confident.  Please God, that will be positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his kind words.  I am delighted to be back in the House and I appreciate the kind words.</P>
        <P>As Senator Coghlan well knows, community employment, CE, is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  Community employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 the Department revised the three year community employment cap to allow those aged 55 years and over to avail of a six-year period on community employment &mdash; based on participation since 2000.  This was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In July 2006 my Department published its sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  One of the key highlights of this plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities in community employment over the period of the plan and to raise the community employment participation limits for people with disabilities, in order to provide additional training to assist progression to open labour market employment.  For people with disabilities under 55, the participation limit has been raised by one year from three to four years and for people with disabilities over 55, the participation limit has also been <Col N="1091"/>raised by one year from six to seven years.  The upper age limit for community employment participants is 65 years.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is continuing to develop the content of the CE programme.  The new approach involves the introduction of the individual learner planning process.  This is focusing on meeting the learning needs of participants.  The individual learner plan is providing for the planning, organising and recording of the work experience, training and development that each participant receives while working on community employment.  It also includes further training and development for supervisors, a new application process and quality assurance procedures.</P>
        <P>Under this individualised approach F&Aacute;S has proposed four new FETAC awards relevant to both community employment and job initiative, JI, learners.  These include certificate in personal and social employment skills, level three; certificate in vocational employment skills, level three; certificate of applied employment skills, level four; and certificate in specific employment skills, level five.  These new awards will facilitate all the planned learning completed on community employment or job initiative by each participant being rolled up into achievement of a FETAC award.  This will provide added value to the learner and will support his or her progression onto further training or employment.</P>
        <P>Funding for community employment in 2007 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on F&Aacute;S schemes at 2006 levels.  This is important.  At present, there are over 22,000 people employed on community employment schemes nationally.  In delivering these places, F&Aacute;S operates flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.</P>
        <P>However, it should be remembered that in so far as participants remain on community employment, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  We are trying to develop a churn situation where people progress on to the open labour market and somebody else who is on long-term unemployment moves into a community employment scheme or job initiative.  This is something that we all are trying to foster.  We are trying to ensure that the programme delivers and allows people to move into the open labour market.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is committed to ensuring that there is a sponsorship programme in community organisations and if there are deficiencies in certain areas, then that will be looked at.  The Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of community employment in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are <Col N="1092"/>keeping the operation of the scheme under constant review.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan strongly supports community employment.  I recall raising this issue myself previously on a number of occasions.  Nobody wants to see a person on a community employment scheme in the long term if he or she could move into the open labour market but, equally, I accept that there are some at certain ages who will find it difficult trying to secure work in the open labour market.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S continually reviews this scheme in conjunction with the Department to ensure that it is flexible and that there is a churn of people into the schemes and on to full-time employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister of State is saying about being flexible.  That is the point I wanted to stress where evidence exists, as he stated, that people over the age of 50 cannot get back into the market.</P>

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh an st&aacute;das reatha a fh&aacute;il maidir leis an cinneadh Rialtais a rinne an iar-Aire Airgeadais i gc&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is 2004.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; d&iacute;l&aacute;rn&uacute; ar Fhoras na Ghaeilge go Gaoth Dobhair.  T&aacute; an cinneadh sin d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas.  Tuigim go raibh beannacht na hAir&iacute; &oacute; Thuaidh de dh&iacute;th fosta.  Tuigim gur phl&eacute;igh an Aire, an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, &eacute; seo leis na hAir&iacute; eile go minic ag cruinnithe den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach ag Foras na Gaeilge maidir le chur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar an oile&aacute;n.  T&aacute; st&aacute;das Fhoras na Gaeilge t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn uilig, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an &aacute;it ina bhfuil an fhoras lonnaithe.  T&aacute; an fhoras ag obair i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus B&eacute;al Feirste faoi l&aacute;thair.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte sonrach faoi leith roimh an cinneadh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; d&iacute;l&aacute;rn&uacute; ar Fhoras na Ghaeilge go par&oacute;iste Ghaoth Dobhair.  Cuideoidh s&eacute; sin le r&oacute;l an fhoras agus le Gaeltacht Gaoth Dobhair, c&eacute; go bhfuil eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaelach agus Gaeltachta lonnaithe ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  Beidh an fhoras in ann a chuid oibre a l&aacute;idri&uacute; de bharr go mbeidh cuid den chomhlacht &mdash; 30 post agus oifig &mdash; lonnaithe i nGaoth Dobhair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire.  An f&eacute;idir leis an st&aacute;das reatha a mheas?  C&aacute; bhfuil s&eacute; seo faoi l&aacute;thair?  Cathain a mbeidh na postanna lonnaithe i nGaoth Dobhair?  N&iacute; bheidh aon fhadhb ann muna bhfuil cuid d&rsquo;fhoireann an fhoras s&aacute;sta bogadh go Gaoth Dobhair, c&eacute; go bhfuil go leor daoine oilte againn sa taobh sin <Col N="1093"/>t&iacute;re.  Beidh na daoine &uacute;d l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta na postanna sin a l&iacute;onadh.</P>
        <P>In the context of the 2004 budget, it was announced by the Government that 30 positions within the North-South language body, Foras na Gaeilge, would be relocated to Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal.</P>
        <P>Foras na Gaeilge is responsible for the promotion of the Irish language, including support of voluntary and other initiatives and projects, developing dictionaries and terminology and supporting Irish-medium education and the teaching of Irish.  I understand that the North-South Ministerial Council decision of March 2006 was to proceed with the decentralisation as proposed by the Minister for Finance in the 2004 budget.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is present.  I seek an update on the current position regarding the relocation of 30 Foras na Gaeilge posts to Gaoth Dobhair.  The area represents a wonderful location for Foras na Gaeilge.  It already contains a combination of Irish language organisations and businesses, including Radio na Gaeltachta, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an Chrann&oacute;g and the Acadamh of Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh.  The nucleus of Irish language organisations is well established in Gaoth Dobhair.  All of those organisations and the local population extend a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to Foras na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>My question is how soon we can expect the first positions of employment to be filled in Gaoth Dobhair.  Is it expected that the jobs being created in the area by the decentralisation programme will involve the movement of staff from Foras na Gaeilge or other Civil Service positions to Donegal, or will new positions be created locally that will give opportunities to local people who would have high standards in the Irish language to do an excellent job on behalf of Foras na Gaeilge?</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for attending and I look forward to hearing the updated position from him.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

I m&iacute; na Nollag 2003, d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair Rialtas na h&Eacute;ireann tionscnamh m&oacute;r chun Ranna Rialtais agus comhlachtai St&aacute;it a dh&iacute;lar&uacute; chuig l&aacute;ithreacha lasmuigh de Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath mar chuid de chl&aacute;r ioml&aacute;n chun forbairt chothrom r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach a chur chun cinn.
