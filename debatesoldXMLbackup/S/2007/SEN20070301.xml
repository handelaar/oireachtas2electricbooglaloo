	<P>I have notice from Senator Morrissey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline his plans for the future development of Dublin Port and Dublin Bay and to clarify whether it is his policy to allow for the infill of a further 52 acres of Dublin Bay to meet future capacity port requirements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Following the closure of Castlemahon Food Products due to liquidation, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to improve the payment of two week&rsquo;s statutory redundancy by paying the 40% rebate that accrues to the State as a top-up payment to the workers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Control of Exports Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 12.30 p.m.; and No. 2, Credit Union Savings Protection Bill 2007  &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 12.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than  2.30 p.m., with the Bill&rsquo;s proposer and spokespersons having 12 minutes and other Senators eight minutes, and the Bill&rsquo;s proposer to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>In one of his last acts, the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, set a cap on the lawyers&rsquo; fees at tribunals to come into effect from 31 March 2007.  I wish to ascertain whether this is still the Government&rsquo;s position.  I <Col N="714"/>note that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is still in discussion with the Mahon tribunal.  Does the Leader agree that, in respect of the authority of the Oireachtas, it would make more sense for a body such as the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission or a select committee of both Houses to negotiate in future with the tribunals rather than a line Minister?</P>
        <P>I raise this issue in the context of the difficulty experienced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the Mahon tribunal some weeks ago.  It subsequently emerged that the Mahon tribunal had written to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, the previous week, stating clearly that it intended to finish its work by early 2008.  However, this information was not put into the public domain.  The tribunals are creatures of the Oireachtas and are answerable to it, not to one wing or section of it.  It would make more sense for the Oireachtas to organise and control its relationships with such tribunals in order that, ultimately, they would report to the Oireachtas on the progress or lack thereof in respect of their investigations.  This would be considerably less partisan than the present relationship that exists between a Minister or group of Ministers and the tribunals.  I ask the Government to consider this proposal in respect of both future and existing tribunals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note and welcome the current visit to Lebanon of Minister for Defence.  Will the Leader make time for a brief debate in this House on the Minister&rsquo;s return home in which he would report on the situation in Lebanon for our troops and on the general highly volatile political situation?  When the Oireachtas commits troops to other parts of the world, Members of both Houses do so.  Members should review the progress of our troops on the ground.  It would be good for the families at home to see that the Houses of the Oireachtas are debating the matter.  Will the Leader provide time for the Minister to come to the House to make a report and to have a debate on that basis?</P>
        <P>I note in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the President put her stamp of approval on an excellent project in County Meath called F&aacute;ilte Isteach, in which a group of citizens have come together to offer English classes to foreign nationals living in Ireland.  This is an excellent project, which could be replicated throughout the State.  I commend the President&rsquo;s support for this work and we need to support such a practical, community-led initiative to help people master the English language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not refer to Paul Appleby&rsquo;s demand for additional staff on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business because I chaired an audit review committee six years ago which reported to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Mr. Appleby was head of the committee&rsquo;s secretariat.  The report <Col N="715"/>was accepted by the committee and it led to the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement which is headed by Mr. Appleby.  In seeking additional staff, he would not waste one shilling of public money.  His commitment is unquestionable but I am disappointed the Taoiseach said he would have to stand in line.  Protection of investment is needed to attract further investment and I call on the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his position that the Director of Corporate Enforcement will have to stand in line, given that his office is crucial to the economy.</P>
        <P>The news of the various arrests relating to the procurement of a 14 year old for sexual activities is disturbing.  In 20 years as a Seanad Member, I have never met a draftsperson.  We receive advice from them and even Ministers do not see much of draftspeople.  However, many Bills are drafted on the basis of litigation advice from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.  I presume that, as the advisory body to the Attorney General, the CSSO, as opposed to the Director of Public Prosecutions, decides whether the State should defend or prosecute cases.  I am concerned that individuals involved in the investigation or who are connected to the arrests might have influenced decision making, litigation and the drafting of legislation over recent years.  I raised this in regard the Attorney General&rsquo;s office when a similar scenario occurred 15 years ago.  I seek reassurance about this and I do not wish to raise a hare on this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be tabloid, so to speak, but this issue needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>Today is work-life balance day and we should all attempt to achieve a work-life balance.  Members might take the evening off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will do our best.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>If the House was not taking the Senator&rsquo;s Bill, we could go home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, Senator O&rsquo;Toole is not knocking on doors these times and the issue of work-life balance does not arise for some of us.  However, work-life balance must be considered in the context of family friendly policies.  The Government has done little in this regard.  Parental leave, for instance, is still unpaid and Ireland is one of the few European countries that does not have paid parental leave.  Unsurprisingly, the uptake of such leave is much lower as a result than one would expect.  Child care costs remain high with many people paying more for their children&rsquo;s care than their mortgage.  In a number of cases I have come across recently, couples pay more than &euro;1,000 a month for child care.  There is little or no preschool provision and <Col N="716"/>no commitment has been made in this regard.  More parents experience long commutes to work, resulting in them having less time with their children.  The concept of work-life balance is fine in theory but it is not being put into practice through family friendly policies in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A debate on child care would be useful so that we could review the Government&rsquo;s performance on a range of issues.  I am especially concerned that the Competitiveness Council has again pointed out that the failure to provide preschool places for all our children is having a serious effect on the economy.  The education of children is an important part of preparing the workforce to deal with future challenges.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, anybody listening to earlier news bulletins must be concerned about the unfolding story about what appears to be a paedophile ring centred in Dublin.  I reiterate that we must ensure all our children and parents who need information on how to deal with emerging technologies, including the Internet and use of websites, should enabled to obtain it in an accessible way.  Localising such provision through schools would be very useful.  Perhaps the Leader, who is a former Minister with responsibility for education, could give serious consideration to how that could be managed quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the Middle East and Lebanon, particularly in light of the recent visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That would be a good idea and I hope the Leader can facilitate such a debate.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers have referred to the protection of our children in light of the story that is unfolding.  It is important that we carefully examine issues being discussed by the Internet Advisory Board regarding the protection of children.  University College Cork ran a successful project for many years which identified paedophile rings.  A debate on this issue would be welcome and I hope the Leader can facilitate it.</P>
        <P>I thank her for the debate on teacher training earlier this week.  While we may not have agreed on the issues, the debate was useful.  However, I ask the Leader whether the House could debate the issue special educational needs and inclusion before the end of the session.  The issue was high on the agenda a number of years ago and, while it has been advanced, it should be re-examined to analyse the programmes in place and the lack of facilities in certain areas.  A debate with the Minister would be useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The World Health Organisation report on the state of nation&rsquo;s children has generated many headlines over recent days in the media and much attention in the other House, but a serious comment on the education system in Ireland is hidden in the text.  According to the report, 10% of children aged ten years and over exceed the 20-day limit for missed school days, at <Col N="717"/>which point educational welfare officers are called in to investigate the absenteeism rate.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government have failed again.  They introduced legislation and set up a new board but failed to finance it.  Educational welfare officers are only available in a few targeted areas and the rest of the country goes without.  Several counties are not covered by educational welfare officers.  In addition, the Government is withdrawing the home-school-community liaison scheme from schools in Woodford, Loughrea and Athenry in my constituency and in schools throughout the country because it has changed the criteria for eligibility.  Schools are being penalised for their excellence.  The World Health Organisation has identified the problem of absenteeism but no response has been provided by the Minister and the Government.  That means something is seriously wrong.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Minihan&rsquo;s call for another debate on education before the end of term so that we can highlight shortcomings and omissions on the Minister&rsquo;s watch, especially in regard to inclusion.  Why are educational welfare and home school liaison officers, who have been very beneficial, being withdrawn from the system?  I cannot understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We would need an economic policy debate virtually every week if we were to take account of new statistics and European and international benchmarking, one piece of which was just been mentioned by Senator Ulick Burke.  Myth number one, which is more in the media than in the political system, is that the only reason we have full employment is that we have been stuffing the public service.  The latest statistics show that the number of staff in the Civil Service has increased by only 700 since June 2002.  Some people may believe we need more planners or corporate enforcers.  Even the 30,000 increase in the number of garda&iacute;, health workers, teachers and local authority staff is only 38% of the increase in last year&rsquo;s employment, or approximately one in 12 of the new jobs created since 2002.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that not the problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Another myth is de-industrialisation.  Manufacturing output increased by 5% last year and industrial employment is rising not falling.  A narrowing of regional disparity is taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, Senator Mansergh does not live in the west.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The disposal income in the west is higher than in the south east.  Despite the lack <Col N="718"/>of site visits by the Industrial Development Authority to north Tipperary, the disposal income is higher there than in south Tipperary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There are only site visits; there are no jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Mansergh calling for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  On the question of whether we are happy, 46% of the people are very happy, 92% are satisfied with their standard of living and 94% are happy with their quality of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those issues can be raised in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Send him to Davos.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the matter of schools, 78% of people find their local schools satisfactory compared to 62% in the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>May I send my sympathies to the voters of south Tipperary?  This tirade is but the beginning.</P>
        <P>I refer to the matter of Mr. Appleby, which was raised again by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I very much agree with him and believe the language used by the Taoiseach that Mr. Appleby would have to stand in line and could not be moved up the queue was extraordinarily cavalier and dismissive, particularly as the Taoiseach has had to answer questions about business practice, blank cheques and so on and has had to acknowledge that, as an accountant, he did not behave in the way he should have.  We need to be very careful about the standard of behaviour in terms of business life.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on drugs.  Mr. Gay Byrne was extremely courageous in what he said.  I have said similar things in this House over a number of years and I recall John O&rsquo;Connell, when he was health spokesman for Fianna F&aacute;il, state that the case for legalising drugs such as heroin, which he supported, needed to be examined.  I agree with that.  We must legalise, control and regulate.  However, this cannot be done by a small country like Ireland on its own.  All we can do is initiate the debate.  This House would be a good place to do so because there would be various views.  There would be people who would strongly disagree with this point of view but at least we would place the issues before the public in an intelligent way.  However, this is not being done on various radio programmes.</P>
        <P>I heard a very decent woman, who is head of an anti-drugs agency, state on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s radio programme that the driving of someone who smoked one joint would be seriously impaired three months later.  That is simply not true.  One might find microscopically detectable traces of that substance.  However, the debate is not advanced by this type of nonsense.  There are two <Col N="719"/>sides to the argument and Seanad &Eacute;ireann would be the appropriate place in which to make them.</P>
        <P>I refer to affordable housing which the Leader said yesterday we might have the opportunity to address.  Two other aspects have since been drawn to my attention.  A number of the major banking institutions refuse loans if they discover the object of the loan is to acquire an affordable house.  This is wrong and the Government should say to financial institutions that if they are making these enormous profits, they have a social responsibility to make loans available to the more vulnerable members of society.</P>
        <P>In the Dublin area, affordable houses are allocated by a series of draws.  That may well be fair but it is done in a very obscure way.  People who have applied for a house never know when, or if, the draws have taken place or whether they have got a house until they hear through the rumour mill that somebody&rsquo;s sister or cousin has got one.  The process must be much more open and clear so we know the system is being administered fairly.  I am not saying it is being administered unfairly but it is being administered obscurely and inefficiently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the very good debate we had on teacher training on Tuesday, I would like it to be continued, particularly in view of the recommendations put forward in the report.  Senator Minihan referred to special needs and a debate on that issue would be welcome.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to hear Senator Ulick Burke refer to the withdrawal of home school liaison officers from second level schools.  I have no doubt the Minister would like to come to the House to respond to this issue and whether the National Education Welfare Board is playing its part in this regard.  Senator Ulick Burke has made too strong a statement without allowing the Minister to respond because it is not the real situation.  We would welcome the Minister back to the House to debate this issue and continue the debate on the matters highlighted this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes complimented the President on her support for a community in County Meath which has made a commitment to teach English to foreigners.  That is a marvellous step forward which perhaps could be replicated elsewhere.  Communities could take responsibility not only for the teaching of English but for many other issues.  People have done well from this country so let communities give something back and not always depend on other people to help them out.  Let us all take a role in helping in communities in any way we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in highlighting work life balance day.  I hope it is not simply an opportunity to pay lip service to this worthwhile initiative but I believe it is.  After ten years in office, the Government has not advanced the position of many parents who struggle with family <Col N="720"/>and work.  As Senator O&rsquo;Meara said, parental leave is unpaid and there is no paternity leave.  The child care situation is as bad as it was five years ago.  It is beyond the reach of many families to avail of child care.  Parents are unable to access before and after school care.  As a result of long commuting times, many parents are forced to give up work.  I would like to see more action on the part of Government and employers and for them to take on board this very good initiative.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Much work needs to be done before we can start to talk about forcing women to return to work, which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has done, particularly as the services and facilities are not in place.  I am speaking about the lone parents report which is an initiative to force women back to work when the facilities in their local areas are not in place whether it be child care, flexible working times and commuting times.  We need to address many problems before we can begin to force people back into work.  We also need to do a lot more to facilitate those at work and give them a real work life balance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I came to the Seanad, two of my driving passions have been new approaches to child care and to ageing and ageism.  I am afraid my two lady colleagues on my left missed the point.

Too often when a problem arises in an area someone forms a committee and then sends someone to Dublin to seek <Col N="722"/>action from the Government.  This is a real example of active citizenship.  Active citizenship deserves more attention than we give it.  We debate it now and again but we do not do so often enough.</P>
        <P>Active citizenship includes people putting their hands in their pockets to support charities.  However, we have a heavy VAT rate on every charitable donation.  In recent days, a case was made to us by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  It pointed out that for years the European Union did not allow charities to be VAT free.  However, a change was made two years ago and Denmark took a step which enables people to know all money given goes to the charity and no portion goes on VAT.  We cannot make amendments to the Finance Bill, we can only make recommendations.  I want to make this point prior to it coming to the House and draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that another country grabbed the opportunity to ensure all money donated to charity goes to charity without a portion going to VAT.</P>
        <P>During the week, figures showed we are beginning to get somewhere on the number of road deaths.  Let us not take the pressure off.  The change is that for the first time we have begun to enforce legislation and remind people that if they misbehave and break the law they will suffer.  However, we have other legislation which we do not enforce yet.  A person caught without insurance should have his or her car taken off him or her immediately.  A person who is caught driving while drunk is not allowed to continue to drive.  However, a person caught without insurance is allowed to continue to drive home.</P>
        <P>One reason for the dramatic improvement in the figures in Sweden was the introduction of automatic speed cameras throughout the country.  It dramatically reduced speeding in Sweden.  In another country, which I believe is Denmark, one&rsquo;s mobile phone is confiscated if one is seen using it on the roads.  I mention these as examples of enforcement of the law.  We are in danger of relaxing when we see an improvement in the number of road deaths.  We must ensure we enforce the laws we pass.  On that basis we may get to the top of the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in requesting the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House and review the implementation of the special education programme in our schools.  I acknowledge a national framework was established by the Government such as was never in existence previously.  As somebody who had many dealings with special needs children during the 1970s and found the resources and facilities completely inadequate I salute the achievements made.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this and the major resources targeted at special needs in terms of teachers and other supports, inevitably the implementation of any programme will have lacunae.  Senators <Col N="723"/>referred to certain identifiable needs which exist.  I ask for a debate and timely review on the progress of the implementation of the programme under the framework.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding home school liaison, it is well-known an ongoing review of the general area of school attendance is taking place in the Department, and rightly so.  This includes encouraging children and students to complete their education as a prerequisite for having an opportunity for a quality of life.  This not only involves home school liaison, but also the school completion programme and a number of other elements.  As part of this debate, or in a separate debate, we could examine the progress of the review taking place in the Department and perhaps confront the issue about which Senator Ulick Burke is concerned, namely, that the home school liaison programme is in the process of being disbanded.  I do not accept that and know it is not the case.  What is happening is the fruit of success, and success brings its own problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are told rural pubs close at the rate of one per day.  This is the steepest decline ever recorded in the country.  We saw what happened to small post offices and shops.  Rural Ireland is being decimated.  Will the Leader tell the House what plans, if any, the Government has to address this appalling vista?  I agree with the recommendation that the Government should introduce rates relief to rural pubs and reductions in vehicle registration tax for those publicans who provide transport for their customers.  It is an important social service.  We do not want to see the character of our rural villages and small towns disappear.  It is an abominable change and needs to be addressed seriously.</P>
        <P>I agree with the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which deals with many important and serious matters.  Surely the few extra staff required by Paul Appleby can be provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline for us his proposals on salmon conservation and the salmon angling business?  At this stage decisions are being made on the curtailment of angling activity, in particular in a number of catchments where there are no real data on salmon stocks going back four or five years.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in the Clare catchment rivers such as the Fergus, the Dunbeg and a series of smaller rivers where there has been no scientific evidence of catches nor data on salmon spawning etc.  On the basis of little, if any, information these decisions are being made on the curtailment of activity, which will be detrimental to the tourist industry in particular.  I would like the Minister to outline to the House how he proposes to deal with the matter because most of the <Col N="724"/>emphasis has been on the curtailment of drift and draft netting in the estuaries and sea, but there is a range of other affected activities.  Much damage is being done to salmon rivers because of the failure to take action to deal with some of the minor problems in catchments, which impair the development of the fisheries.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s comments on small businesses in rural areas.  It is not only pubs in rural areas which are affected.  A number of small businesses in my constituency have closed down in recent times.  Where there is a case of people drawing down their savings or having to borrow money to meet overheads such as rates and insurance, it is necessary to take action.  I would like the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to comment on this.  I know small pubs and publicans are affected but small businesses in small towns are generally affected by the presence of supermarkets etc.  Many of these small businesses have provided a service for generations and it is time we came to the rescue and acted on this serious developing crisis.  Some 14 small businesses closed down in Ennis recently.  This is alarming and action must be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance that he is to extend the period of tax relief for private developers where they provide facilities for the elderly and the disadvantaged.  Being involved in two voluntary organisations I see first-hand the tremendous work being carried out in this area.  The Minister has now put in place a provision that the services will have to be provided for 20 years.  As this great work goes hand in hand with what is essentially voluntary housing, will the Leader ask the Minister to clarify if these facilities could be extended to pilot projects and projects by private developers put in place for the treatment of alcohol and drug addicts?  That would be essential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan raised an exceptionally important issue, supported by Senator Daly, in regard to the challenges now facing rural Ireland.  Most of the debates we had here over the years focused on one-off housing.  If people are not facilitated to return to live in rural areas and become part of the community, we will face many difficulties in future.  We all bemoaned the mass exodus, leaving empty homesteads, from rural Ireland in the past, but we got a new wave of confidence when people wanted to return to rural areas.  These people can continue to live there only if the infrastructure and services are in place.</P>
        <P>In the past week I was asked to do a television interview on the closure of post offices and I had to be up-front and say I was not happy with the development, as I do not believe it will help rural Ireland.  There is the serious matter of the decline of many rural pubs which, in many ways, were the assembly point for people living in rural Ireland.  I <Col N="725"/>am not arguing we should in any way dilute the rules on drink-driving, but this is happening by stealth and a debate here on the general context of rural Ireland would be worthwhile.</P>
        <P>In County Clare a new community began to emerge, with a hairdresser, a mechanic and so on moving into an area but these services will not continue if the proper infrastructures are not put in place. I am a cofounder of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association and since becoming involved with that body I have seen other instances of development, with little or no publicity.</P>
        <P>At this stage the Seanad could play a useful role in discussing, in a focused and itemised way, the new challenges that face rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, leader of the Opposition, raised several tribunal matters and the cap on lawyers&rsquo; fees in particular, due to be introduced at the end of March.  He asked if this was still the position.  The Senator correctly stated that tribunals are creatures of the Oireachtas and that they should be directed from these Houses.  The Senator also asked for a debate on the current situation in Lebanon when the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, returns from his trip there.  That would be very useful and we would all benefit from his comments on the Army&rsquo;s position there and the current situation in that country.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayes also mentioned the F&aacute;ilte Isteach project in Meath and the President&rsquo;s admiration for such a step.  I also read the article and thought it was wonderful that the group would give of themselves in the language.  This, combined with the many new language support teachers appointed by the Minister to primary schools, is very welcome.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned Paul Appleby and indicated he was careful and would not be profligate in his spending or use of staff.  He argued we should again support his office.  The Senator also mentioned the case of the 14 year old in the news, the information unfolding on the matter and the vista it would open up if the hints about which we have read are true.  This is a very serious matter which I am sure will be considered by the drafters of legislation, and more information will come to the fold.</P>
        <P>The Senator also mentioned that it is work-life balance day.  Let us all have a party and go home.  We cannot do that but I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  I do not know how one would achieve a better work-life balance.  I have always struggled to achieve that.  I do not know how I managed it but I did and I am still struggling with it.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara raised the lack of child care, the unfolding matter of the paedophile ring and what it brings in its wake.  Senator Minihan would support the relevant Minister coming to the House to debate the areas of inclusion and special needs in education.  It would be welcome if the Minister could attend for that purpose.  I thank all <Col N="726"/>the Members who spoke in such fine fashion on the education debate.  It was a welcome debate and I thank the Minister for attending. The contributions from so many Members were also welcome.  It was one of the best debates on education I have heard.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children report.  It states that more than 10% of primary pupils are absent from school from more than 20 days, which is not the norm but the upper limit of what should be the case.  The Senator spoke about school welfare officers, about which I have inquired.  The home school liaison officer scheme has not been abandoned, but as Senator Fitzgerald mentioned, that scheme together with the school retention programme and other programmes are being reviewed to determine  what is best practice.  Long ago, a garda played that role.  If one was out of school for a day, one would dodge into a shop if the garda was approaching because he or she was supposed to ensure that one went to school.  The Senator also referred to a lack of funding for the National Educational Welfare Board.  These matters must be examined to determine whether they can be done better, better linked with one another and have a better effect for pupils.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh pointed out that, despite what is often stated, we are not stuffing the Civil Service.  According to the report published, there is an evident lessening of regional disparity.  It is good that 78% of voters like their local schools.  In the United Kingdom, the figure is approximately 60%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 62%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same thing.  It shows the primacy of the school in local communities.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked for a debate on drugs and their legalisation.  It has come to his notice that some banks refuse loans for affordable housing and that the draw for housing is administered in an obscure fashion.  He does not object to the method of the draw but people should know when and where it takes place.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde asked for a debate on education in terms of inclusion and special needs.  She praised the community spirit in County Meath and stated that people should give back to their community as they get from it.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry referred to work-life balance day and the lack of before and after-school care.  I did not know that any lone parent had been forced to take a job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the lone parents who approach me wish to work.  Their concern lies in balancing the number of hours they can work and their statutory payments.  It can be difficult to make this work.  If a parent takes a job at which he or she is good, the employer may wish him or <Col N="727"/>her to work full time rather than the maximum number of hours allowable.  I have met many lone parents who are keen to work, but they did not believe they were being forced.  I have not heard of anyone being forced.</P>

While there is sometimes another point of view on the Senator&rsquo;s spirit, I like it.  She contributed to today&rsquo;s debate in a fine way.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to steps taken by a community in County Meath and referred to it as active citizenship, which echoed Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s comments, namely, to give back what was given.  He also referred to the charity tax reform group and road deaths.  Driving a car without insurance is a big no-no.  In Sweden, the car in question would be impounded immediately, which should be the case everywhere.</P>

            <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House on Committee Stage of the Control of Exports Bill 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)(i), line 8, to delete &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;resident&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  A short time has passed since Second Stage.  My amendment is clear and I tabled it on Second Stage because of an anomaly, if not an absurdity, in section 3.  Section 3(2) deals with the scope of the brokerage activities addressed in the Bill and applies to such activities that take place in the State.  There is nothing contentious in that respect, but section 3(2)(<i>b</i>) extends the provision to activities carried out by an Irish citizen or Irish registered company outside the State.  A difficulty arises in this respect in that, while I have no difficulty regarding the provision for companies, I question the provision for citizens.  Many citizens leave the country and are never seen here again, but they continue to hold Irish passports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My bemusement arises from how the State could control brokerage activities carried out by a person who has not set foot in this country for 20 or 30 years.  How could the provision be enforced?  If it cannot be implemented, legislating <Col N="730"/>for it is bad practice.  It reduces legislation to an aspirational level instead of making our law something that is enforced and respected.  I focus on the simple practicality of whether it would be possible to enforce this provision, rather than on the wider issue of whether it is right to try to enforce the law on citizens who no longer have any connection with the country.  The standard approach is that the jurisdiction of the State stops at its borders.  There are good reasons this should be so.  However, an argument needs to be made for extending the jurisdiction outside the State, but I am not sure how this can happen and it is a subject for another day.</P>
        <P>For the moment I rest my case on the sheer impracticality of enforcing the provision on Irish citizens who have left the country, and no longer have any links with it, whatsoever.  On the other hand, paradoxically, this section, as it is written, makes no attempt to control what is within our power to do.  It makes no effort to capture brokerage activities carried on outside the State by someone who lives in Ireland but is not a citizen.  We have a possible purchase on activities such as this because of a person&rsquo;s residency.  Under the Bill as it stands the provisions only apply to activities as they are carried on outside the State, so that a person will actually escape if he or she does that.  If someone is a resident here, or purposefully comes here, perhaps, and operates a brokerage outside the State, we can do nothing about it under this legislation.  It is a loophole that should definitely be closed.</P>
        <P>This section, on the one hand, purports to control activities by citizens who may not have had any connection with Ireland for years, but totally ignores activities carried out by residents who are here, simply because they are not citizens.  If they are not citizens and live here we cannot do anything about it.  I suggest both these anomalies could be resolved simply by substituting the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; for &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; in subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) (i).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will set out what section 3 does.  It enables the Minister to make orders or regulations to control brokering activities in accordance with the EU Common Position 2003/468/CFSP of 23 June 2003.  This provides for controls to be imposed on brokering activities undertaken in the State &mdash; and outside the State, if undertaken by an Irish citizen or company. </P>
        <P>The issue of extraterritoriality was a key consideration when framing this section.  A person normally resident here could, for example, arrange for an arms transfer while temporarily outside the State in relation to goods that at no point transit through Ireland.  In the absence of appropriate legislation, on his or her return to Ireland no prosecution could follow, notwithstanding that an arms embargo had been breached or that Irish export control laws could have been evaded.  There are, of course, certain <Col N="731"/>challenges as regards the enforcement of extraterritorial controls.  However, on balance I consider it preferable to have such controls in place so that if documentary evidence concerning illicit arms brokering becomes available, for example, as a result of the sharing of intelligence between law enforcement agencies, then the State has the capacity to mount a successful prosecution.</P>
        <P>On consideration of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s questions on Second Stage, as well as the amendment, as currently drafted the section enables Ireland to comply with the EU Common Position.  However, as I promised last week during the Second Stage debate, the Department has looked into the possibility of expanding the scope of the extraterritorial controls to include persons normally resident in Ireland as well as citizens.  Preliminary inquires indicate this matter will require some investigation and I am seeking the advice of the Office of the Attorney General as to the feasibility of the proposal.  The main issue is that while there are good precedents in international law for exercising extraterritorial controls on a country&rsquo;s citizens and companies, the situation as regards non-national residency is less clear.</P>
        <P>A further complication is that there is no single legal definition of &ldquo;resident&rdquo;.  For example, a person who has resided in the jurisdiction for 183 days or more in one year, or 280 days in two years, is regarded as being resident for taxation purposes.  If one is resident for three consecutive tax years one acquires the status, &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  This is not the same as the concept, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;, which is usually interpreted as an intention to reside permanently in the country.</P>
        <P>As it has not been possible to resolve the issues raised in the time available, the Government is not in a position at this time to accept this amendment.  However, if I am advised that the extension of brokering controls along the lines proposed by Senator Quinn is legally feasible, then it is my intention to table an amendment to this effect when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the clear intention and for the attention he has given to the proposal.  I do not want to see legislation passed that is not enforceable.  I now understand the difficulty as regards the terms &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; and &ldquo;resident&rdquo;, etc.  It is perhaps too facile a solution to just change the words.  However, there were just two objectives in what I was trying to achieve.  One was the fact I do not like to see legislation passed that is not enforceable.  If we introduce legislation purely for the purpose of keeping in line with a EU directive, we should ensure that it is also enforceable.  It might well be that the legislation will be in line with the European directive, but that is not my concern. </P>

	<P>I understand, yes. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="732"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are going to pass legislation here, it should be possible to enforce it.  I do not know how we can enforce it, in the first place, on a citizen who has not been here for years but still holds an Irish passport.  I understand that point, but I leave it to the Minister of State to find the solution.</P>
        <P>The other matter that concerns me more is the fact that brokerage activities could be carried on outside the State by someone actually living here.  I am not sure about the legal definitions of &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; and &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and the Minister of State has clearly explained the position.  I understand the solution is not as simple as what I proposed, perhaps, but I appreciate that he is going to give the matter his attention.</P>
        <P>I am always fearful that matters that take place in the other House give the D&aacute;il credit rather than the Seanad.  I should like to emphasise that this is not just a selfish initiative on the part of a Member of this House.  However, I accept the point the Minister of State makes.  I am pleased he is going to look into it and I hope we find a solution.  I hate to find legislation that is not enforceable or that leaves a loophole.  In this case the substitution of &ldquo;resident&rdquo; for &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; was an effort to achieve that.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and I know he will give the matter his attention.</P>

I believe there should be specifics in the report.  The Minister of State will tell the House what specifics, if any, will be in the report.  This is the worry.</P><Col N="733"/>
        <P>At the outset I want to say I am grateful to Amnesty International for its advice on this matter.  If there must be reports, we should be concerned about the parliamentary structures to be put in place for scrutinising them.  It is reasonable that export licence data should be included in these annual reports providing details of the quantities of goods licensed for exports as well as details of companies exporting dual use goods under open licences.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely oppose this amendment.  The Senator is getting into too much red tape on this issue, and in so far as the disclosure of competitive edges is concerned.  This type of disclosure may be used by other countries to know exactly what we are exporting and when.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I would not be in favour of such disclosure.  It is impractical.  I am not interested in whether it is Amnesty International or the British trade board that is interested in having this provision included in the legislation.  It would be folly to include it and, therefore, I disagree with the proposal to insert it.</P>
        <P>I would make a point that is covered in the Bill, namely, we are the good citizens of Europe all the time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of Amnesty International and Senator Coghlan in regard to this amendment is worthy.  However, Senator Leyden has made a case challenging it.  If such detailed information would be required for all exports, information which would be valuable to a competitor, it would generate a great deal of red tape.  One of our objectives, and I know this is close to the  Minister&rsquo;s heart, is the putting in place of better regulation that reduces red tape.  If we put a regulation in place that is difficult to enforce, generates a great deal of red tape necessitating the collection of information, and does not apply in other countries, that would clearly be a disadvantage.  The objective Senator Coghlan seeks is worthy.  Perhaps the Minister of State might examine if there is a way of achieving it rather than necessarily having to provide the precise details listed in the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="734"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 9 introduces a provision for an annual report of the operation of the Act to be prepared and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is in line with a key recommendation of the first F&Aacute;S review and a response that calls for greater transparency in the area of export controls.  I welcome the opportunity which will be provided by the publication of the annual report to provide accurate information on the export of military and dual-use goods from Ireland and to counter some of the misapprehension which result from sensationalist media coverage of this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to the amendment, the non-governmental organisation sector frequently seeks information on actual exports by named companies.  I would like to be clear about this; I do not consider it appropriate to provide such data.  Information submitted by companies in connection with export licence applications is provided in confidence.  It is almost always commercially sensitive and there may be security and international relations issues around it.  I am also concerned that the disclosure of such detailed information could prejudice or impair enforcement of and compliance with applicable Irish and European legislation.  I am committed, however, to providing information on an aggregate value of actual exports of goods under licence sorted by category and the country of destination, as I am firmly of the opinion that this will present a much more accurate picture than reliance on licensed values which, by their nature, tend to be considerable over-estimations.</P>
        <P>On a more general point, I consider this amendment, which could be interpreted as restricting the information to be provided on the data listed, to be unnecessarily prescriptive and, if accepted, would impinge upon the legitimate policy-making function of the Minister of the day with regard to the scope and content of the annual report.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate what the Minister of State said.  I assure him that it certainly was not my intention to propose a measure that would be restrictive.  I take on board and appreciate what he said about providing information on an aggregate value of exports.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what Senator Leyden might have implied, we are not a secret society type of organisation.  I tabled this amendment on the basis that we are a good, proper and open democracy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who have taken interest in this important matter on Second and Committee Stages and for their contributions to those debates.  I am satisfied that this is comprehensive legislation that will equip Ireland with the tools required to manage an efficient and effective export control system.  Ireland has always been a voice on the international stage for disarmament and arms control.  We recognise that our interests are best served by having a stable, secure, inclusive and co-operative environment.  We will continue to work with our fellow EU member states and other countries to address the challenges to global security posed by the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible use.  This Bill is our tangible commitment to putting in place a robust export control system that can best meet the challenges we face at a time of rapid geopolitical and technological developments.</P>
        <P>I thank my officials for the work they put into bringing forward  this excellent legislation which, I believe, will stand the test of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the work they have put into this important measure.  It will hopefully stand the test of time and provide us with a proper, effective export control system.  It will add a slightly differ<Col N="736"/>ent idea on one aspect, but we have debated that satisfactorily and I am grateful that the Minister of State has agreed to have a further look at Senator Quinn&rsquo;s very worthy amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the officials for their work on this Bill, which as he said, is very comprehensive.  It covers all the areas, but there are two aspects I would like to mention.  Ireland should set its face against exporting arms in any form.  That opinion does not come from our neutrality, as we have shown in the past that we are not neutral in good and bad.  It would be worthy to say that we do not wish to get involved in arms dealing in any way.  In enacting a Bill, we should not do it just because we have been asked to do so by the European Union &mdash; although that is a reason &mdash; but because it is the right thing to do.  That is one of the reasons I was anxious to make sure that the Bill will work.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State listened intently on Second Stage and to the amendments that were proposed on Committee Stage.  We will find a solution that will make it a good law and a law of which we can also be proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister of State on this important Bill.  We are very well served with the quality of the public service in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I had the same experience when I was there.  Coupled with his responsibility over trade, the Minister of State has brought many Bills before these Houses since his appointment.</P>
        <P>This is a well-balanced Bill.  It complies with EU directives and requirements, which is very important for the Minister of State when he attends meetings of the Council of Ministers.  He can say that he is implementing the required legislation.  When we were trying to implement the Single European Act, we were asked how many aspects of it were implemented at a national level.  The Minister of State is in a very strong position as he pushed this Bill ahead of many other member states.  The majority of them have not even brought it forward in their national Legislatures.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill is passed in the other House as quickly as possible and that it becomes law before the end of the session.</P>

    <Title>Credit Union Savings Protection Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.  I appreciate the opportunity the Government has given me to debate this Bill in Government time. <Col N="737"/> I cannot remember the last time I was given such an opportunity, but I am well entitled to it after 20 years in the House, a period slightly shorter than the length of time I have been involved in the credit union movement.</P>
        <P>I declare my interest in the credit union movement and am a founder member of one of the larger credit unions, the INTO Credit Union.  I have been committed to its philosophy and the philosophy of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, for many years.  Nothing I will say is aimed at undermining or in any way taking from the extraordinary work of the ILCU.  I admire it and hold it in the highest regard.  We have a difference of opinion with regard to the Bill, but that is all it is, a difference of opinion.</P>
        <P>My objective in introducing the legislation is to provide that where an independent broker, auditor, adviser, accountant or some such person is asked a simple question as to whether a person&rsquo;s savings in a credit union are as secure and guaranteed as in a bank or other financial institution, he or she may answer with a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Until that is the case, we have left a gap in the area.  It is not the case currently and my intention is to create a situation where it will be.</P>
        <P>There are three means by which what I propose can be done.  It could be done by operating under the section of the Credit Union Act which allows a credit union to operate.  Talks have been ongoing between the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator and the ILCU on that issue for the past three or four years, but they do not seem to have come to any conclusion.  Something could be done under the Act.  Another way to deal with the issue would be to operate a system like that of the Central Bank for the banks, namely, to have a reserve fund.  A reserve fund exists for banks and perhaps we could have one now for credit unions.  It could be brought in under the aegis of the Central Bank with a support structure at that level.  The third way of dealing with the issue is the way I propose today in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I am not saying the way I propose is better than the other two ways of dealing with the issue.  It is the way I choose to bring forward to deal with this crucial issue.  Without raising hares or making a tabloid issue of it, people should see we, as legislators, are concerned about the issues and want to fill the gap and meet a particular need.</P>
        <P>The question might be asked as to why I have come to this position.  I have arrived at it having looked at the available literature and evidence over the period of time I have been interested in the credit union movement.  I will begin with the Department of Finance.  Under the terms of the Credit Union Act, the Department and the Minister at the time established a credit union advisory committee.  That committee wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in March 2005 and stated that since the appointment of the credit union advisory committee the previous September, it was concerned with the lack of any <Col N="738"/>properly constituted savings protection scheme within the credit union movement.</P>
        <P>Every Member and legislator should know savings protection is not just my idea, but also the main focus of the advice the Department has received from the advisory committee.  Furthermore, the committee&rsquo;s letter to the Minister stated that as a result of its concern, it was now preparing a brief report on the desirability of introducing a savings protection scheme for the credit union movement.  It proceeded to set out its recommendations at the end of the letter and those recommendations are in line with what I am trying to do in the Bill.  The issue must be examined and it is crucial that we consider how to approach it.  The advisory committee&rsquo;s letter refers to the existing and other situations that must be considered in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the existing situation.  The ILCU has a particular fund which is purported and is represented as doing what I am trying to achieve.  I say without fear of contradiction that it does not do that and was not set up to do so.  I will prove this.  We need to make provision for savings protection.</P>
        <P>At the world congress of credit unions last July, Mr. Pat Neary, the chief executive of the Financial Regulator, talked about the Irish credit union movement and its experience and raised issues of concern to him, for example, increasing delinquency, inadequate technology and issues of governance.  I cannot imagine three more fundamental issues that should be of concern to us in that area.  Mr. Neary said the situation here was beginning to mirror the international situation and, therefore, we need a savings protection scheme.</P>
        <P>What is the situation currently?  Currently, the ILCU has a savings protection scheme which is a discretionary fund that does not confer any statutory rights and is not independent.  Due to the fact it is not a statutory scheme, it cannot insist its members follow strict instructions with regard to governance and how to run their operation.  It is important to note also that a significant number of credit unions &mdash; a few dozen, some of which are quite large &mdash; are not members of the ILCU and do not have access to the discretionary fund.</P>
        <P>The current scheme, therefore, does not do the business of what I am trying to do.  It is not ring-fenced from the ILCU and is not a separate stand-alone fund.  It has in the past been used to finance other areas.  Members may recall problems the ILCU ran into on the introduction of new IT some years back, which cost a lot of money.  Money came from the fund to meet those costs.  Money also came from the fund to build the headquarters of the ILCU.  There was nothing wrong with that as the ILCU was quite entitled to use the money that way.</P>
        <P>My complaint is not about that aspect or about how the fund has been used to look after credit unions in difficulty.  The current scheme is not independent.  It is not statutory, which is a two-<Col N="739"/>way track in that it, first, does not have the statutory authority to demand certain governance procedures in the credit unions and, second, does not give a statutory right of savings protection to savers.  Their savings may be protected, if somebody decides to so provide, but there is not a statutory base like that required in every other such group.</P>
        <P>There are systemic risks and those of which I spoke are important.  The regulator has been clear in raising the issues in various speeches in recent years.  Those issues include an increase and worsening bad debt profile, an increased investment risk, obsolete information technology in many cases, and governance and non-compliance with legislation and regulations.  These are issues which are arising and being considered.</P>
        <P>In addition, as the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and I will be aware, it is commendable that the credit unions have significantly developed their services.  They now give much larger loans, some of which equate to mortgages in many ways, and many have also started business lending.  There is nothing wrong with such services, except they involve new and additional complexity which requires newer and differing underwriting skills which did not exist previously.  That is another reason we need to ensure a guarantee on savings and that these services are covered by regulation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The regulator demands that such a scheme, whether known as a savings guarantee scheme or a savings protection scheme, must be run independently of anybody else, must be completely transparent, which probably goes without saying, and must ensure certainty of operation.  Those are not my words.  These three elements &mdash; independence, transparency and certainty of operation &mdash; are being demanded from the regulator and that is simply all that I am asking we provide for on this occasion.  There is no easy way out of that in terms of moving the matter forward.</P>
        <P>In reply to the debate I will probably return to the issue of where we are headed.  It is crucial that we bring a sense of trust and confidence.  I want to be able to say, if some time there is a difficulty in a credit union or a run on credit union money, that people would be aware there is a guarantee scheme in place.  That is a requirement.  We remember when the State had to bail out a bank 20 years ago and people thought it could never happen.  It is an issue for which we must provide in this case.</P>
        <P>An issue raised with me by people who were unhappy with what have I brought forward is that it does not meet all-island requirements.  That would also be an issue of great concern to me and I have taken some advice on this subject.  There are over 40 credit unions in the North which are members of the ILCU and the protection of the saving protection scheme, SPS, is available to them, but there are many others in the North which are not members.  In the South, there are a growing number of credit unions which are not <Col N="740"/>members of the ILCU.  This is why there is a need to provide for this on a statutory basis.  It is also why we need to look at something that will cover all credit unions on the island, if that is possible.  That can be done in a number of ways: through financial instruments, inter-Government agreement, shadow legislation as outlined by the Good Friday Agreement and three or four other ways.  Suffice it to say that I have looked carefully at and taken advice on this aspect and it can be done.  There is chapter and verse on where this has been done in other countries.  In the United States a number of credit unions in a number of states are covered by one guarantee system which is an overarching body, and that is another approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The advice that the credit union advisory committee gave to the Minister in 2005 included that it would be an independent savings protection scheme approved by the financial regulator; it would be a separate legal entity under the auspices of the Department of Finance or the regulator; membership would be obligatory on all credit unions in Ireland, which is crucial because every credit union must be a member in order to ensure that people know that their savings will be protected; the rules of compensation be clearly laid out; the power to request special levies of credit unions be given to it; that, crucially, it would have powers of examination and investigation; and that the appointments to the board of the savings protection scheme be made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>On examination and investigation, I did not refer to the worrying anecdotal tales.  I discussed them with the ILCU and I agree with it that they are only anecdotal.  I want them to remain so.  Issues of governance and bad debt provision, which have been raised with me, are enormously worrying and I hope they are not true.</P>
        <P>The advice to which I refer forms the beginning.  I did not go into the details of the Bill and I will refer to that in reply to Second Stage.  In the meantime, I merely wanted to set the scene to state why this is necessary and why every Member of the House should share my concern and support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon.  I particularly welcome this Bill.  I have much pleasure in supporting it, and I commend my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, on the work he has done in preparing it for and bringing it before the House.  It is unusual for a Senator to do this.  Not many Bills have come through from the floor of the House, and he deserves commendation.</P>
        <P>No doubt there is a need for legislation.  Whether it is this legislation is open to debate.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has spoken of the investment risks involved.  At some time or other, there will be a failure in an organisation involved in trade, commerce, banking or credit unions.  It is quite likely there will be a problem and we want to <Col N="741"/>protect ourselves from that problem occurring in the case of credit unions, and the ILCU recognises that.  In fact, it states that section 46 of the Credit Union Act 1997 already provides a mechanism whereby a savings protection scheme may be given approval by the Financial Regulator through the Registrar of Credit Unions, and the ILCU is currently engaged in discussions with the registrar with a view to approval of the SPS in a revised format under section 46.  My difficulty is that the Act has been on the Statute Book for such a long time and this has not happened.  The danger here is that it will not happen unless something pushes a development there.</P>
        <P>There are two brief points I wish to make to add to what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said.  The first is that, while many things have changed in the area of financial services, in the future we will need a successful credit union movement, just as we have needed one in the past.  To declare my interest here, my father was one of the founders, in 1965, of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Credit Union which was the third credit union established in the country.  If I remember correctly, there was one in County Monaghan, one in Donore, and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire one was the third.  A lady called Nora Herlihy was one of the organisers and I got to know and admire her a great deal.  Those who created the credit union copied it from Canada, if I remember correctly, because there was a need for it at that stage.  It has been a booming success.  A wonderful job has been done in the credit union movement.  The ILCU deserves much credit for it, although, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, not every credit union is a member of that league.</P>
        <P>There is a tendency in some quarters to think that we do not need credit unions any more because there is a plethora of organisations offering credit, to any individual who wants it and, indeed, to many who neither need nor want it.  In a few short years we have moved from a position in which many perfectly credit-worthy people found it impossible to get credit from the traditional banks, to one in which those same banks are practically forcing credit on their customers.  Meanwhile, competition among lenders has meant that the costs of borrowing remain comparatively low.</P>
        <P>Although that is the position today, it will no necessarily be so tomorrow.  There is a cycle in financial affairs that is just as reliable as the tide coming in and going out, or the way that night follows day.  One can be fully sure that this generous policy of the banks and other mainstream lending institutions will not continue for ever.  There will come a time when they will seek to tighten credit, and that is when many ordinary people will find themselves squeezed.  Listening to the radio this morning, that time may well be much closer than we think.  It is vital, therefore, that we take good care to do everything in our power to preserve and conserve the credit union movement.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>The day will come when the country will badly need the credit union movement, even more so than it needs it at present.  In difficult times, a self-help organisation, which is essentially what the credit union is, comes into its own.  It provides a mechanism for a community to meet modest financial needs within its own resources and without having to involve the not-always-welcome embrace of the financial services industry.  In a country in which the main banks exercise such wide and largely unfettered power, it is necessary to defend strongly an institution that serves in many ways to counteract that very influence.</P>
        <P>In many important respects it is legitimate to regard credit unions as quite separate and distinct from the financial services industry, but this is not how they would appear to people abroad if a major credit union were to fail and leave its depositors high and dry.  It would be regarded as just one more banking failure.  I am certain that untold damage would be done to our international reputation if people discovered depositors had lost their money because it was not secured properly by guarantees.  Therefore, it is not only the credit unions that have an interest in this legislation but the whole financial services establishment.  As long as deposits in credit unions remain unsecured, the financial service industry&rsquo;s reputation will be on the line and not just that of the credit unions themselves.</P>
        <P>Is this the right legislation?  Senator O&rsquo;Toole touched on some points in this regard, particularly regarding governance.  I am not sure what will happen but it seems that unless the legislation we pass enforces a very strict governance regime, it is unlikely it will meet requirements.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said the scheme must be independent and I have little doubt about this.  There is a very strong league of Irish credit unions but some credit unions are not involved in it.  I accept the point they make that the legislation will only govern the Twenty-six Counties rather than the Thirty-two Counties and we must find a way around this.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to transparency.  There is little doubt but that it is essential.  Unless the form of governance we put in place ensures transparency, it will not work.</P>
        <P>The Senator&rsquo;s third point covered the certainty of operation, which is essential.  I was concerned when I read that the proposed structure has not been set up in spite of there being powers to achieve this.  If the introduction of this legislation will encourage the Minister to say he will address the matter, be it through this Bill or otherwise, it will serve some purpose.  The Bill will achieve our purpose although it will not address a couple of exceptions to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole has drawn attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister should pay attention to this legislation.  It may need some tweaking, perhaps on Committee Stage.  The ideal would be to accept it and pass it as soon as possible in the knowledge that we will be protecting not only those who invest in credit unions but also the financial insti<Col N="743"/>tutions in Ireland which would be damaged by a failure in the future.  I am confident the credit union movement is doing all it can to ensure there will never be a failure but it is very hard to say there will never be one, regardless of the organisation in question or the service it provides.  I therefore believe the Minister should consider seriously accepting the Bill as it stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to this Private Members&rsquo; Bill, sponsored by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Its purpose is to establish a company regulated by the Financial Regulator to maintain a fund, built up through a levy on credit unions, to provide compensation to credit unions savers where a credit union becomes insolvent or financial assistance to a credit union in financial difficulty.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is a strong supporter of the credit union movement and a founder of a credit union.  His objective in introducing this Bill is to ensure that credit union savers have trust and confidence in credit unions and the savings protection they offer.  The Government shares this objective.  It is therefore a matter of determining the best way of securing this objective in a manner that builds on the existing legal and regulatory framework for credit unions, supports the ethos and philosophy of self-help of credit unions and underpins the all-island nature of the credit union movement.</P>
        <P>The starting point in considering this issue is the intention of the Oireachtas, as expressed through the Credit Union Act 1997, that there should be appropriate savings protection arrangements to protect credit union savers.  In particular, section 46 of the Act provides statutory authority for the appropriate regulatory body, now the regulatory authority, to approve savings protection schemes, SPSs, for credit unions.  The statutory framework provided for approval of savings protection arrangements in credit unions under the Credit Union Act and was put in place as part of the broader framework for deposit protection arising from the 1994 EU directive on deposit-guarantee schemes.  This directive, which recognised the role of deposit protection schemes under the responsibility of professional organisations, was transposed into Irish law as the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 1995 for credit institutions other than credit unions.  It is important to note that the deposit guarantee scheme does not provide a State savings guarantee for savers with Irish credit institutions generally.</P>
        <P>In the case of credit unions, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, has, since 1989, operated a SPS for credit unions.  The SPS aims to protect the individual savings of members by ensuring that credit unions are financially and administratively sound and by providing remedial help to <Col N="744"/>any participating credit union that shows signs of weakness in these areas.  Savings of individual credit union members are also protected.  Since 1989, the SPS has been called upon in a very limited number of cases to provide some assistance to credit unions in financial difficulty.  However, it is important to note that no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares and deposits and no credit union has become insolvent.</P>
        <P>The design and operation of the SPS on a mutual basis for credit unions is consistent with the specific regulatory approach adopted for credit unions under the Credit Union Act 1997 on account of their co-operative and not-for-profit status.  Members of credit unions are co-owners of credit unions and on that basis credit unions under the auspices of the league devised and developed the SPS for their mutual benefit and protection of savings.  In line with changes in the regulatory environment for financial services generally, the need for modernisation of the organisational structure and governance arrangements for the credit union SPS became evident over time.  Changes in the movement, structure and scale of the credit union system suggested a need for some reform to enhance the protection afforded to credit union savers and improve the openness, transparency and accountability of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Following its establishment in 2003, the Financial Regulator drew attention to the need for reform of a number of key aspects of existing arrangements.  The evidence presented in the course of the 2004 High Court action on the SPS also highlighted a number of areas where action was required to bolster the safeguards afforded under the scheme.  In response to these issues, a detailed set of proposals to reform the SPS was submitted to the Minister by the ILCU in January 2006.  Under these proposals, the ILCU SPS fund, which now amounts to approximately &euro;95 million, would be transferred into a separate legal entity established exclusively for the purpose of managing the operation of the SPS.  The savings protection company would be incorporated under company law, thus ensuring legal certainty regarding the rules of the scheme and full transparency and accountability regarding the legal roles, duties and responsibilities of directors with regard to savings protection.</P>
        <P>The company would be operated to best-practice standards of corporate governance, including in regard to the appointment of independent directors, and its activities would be overseen by the Financial Regulator.  This would be an important element in ensuring that monitoring and assessment of the sufficiency of the fund would be carried out on a regular basis.  The fund would be ring-fenced for guarantee and stabilisation purposes and would not be available for any other purposes under the company&rsquo;s memorandum of association.  In addition, compensation to savers under the new scheme in circumstances <Col N="745"/>where a credit union became insolvent would no longer be discretionary.  The proposal also confirmed that the scheme would be open to all credit unions in line with the High Court Order made in October 2004.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s assessment was that the league had developed a substantive outline proposal for strengthening and enhancing the current SPS and the next step was for the Financial Regulator to assess this proposal against the objectives set for savings protection with a view to resolving the SPS issue over a short timeframe.  The reform proposals furnished by the Department of Finance to the Financial Regulator in early March 2006 highlighted significant innovations designed to meet the objectives set for savings protection by the credit union advisory committee and the annual reports of the registrar of credit unions.  The Minister has publicly highlighted the importance of SPS reform to the modernisation and change process for credit unions.  He has also emphasised the need to fully examine the potential for SPS approval under the Credit Union Act, in view of the importance of having approved SPS arrangements in place which work to the benefit of all credit unions and their members.</P>
        <P>In May 2006 the Financial Regulator confirmed that he would identify, examine and explore specific changes to the proposals which could allow the reformed SPS to be approved and, assuming a satisfactory outcome to these discussions, it is the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s intention to put the proposals which emerge to the regulatory authority for consideration.  The second half of 2006 saw the successful resolution of issues pertaining to an individual credit union which required support from the SPS and resulted in good progress being made by the Financial Regulator in confirming the legal enforceability of guarantees provided by the credit union SPS, which is a key requirement of a legally robust savings protection scheme.  The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s strategic plan published last November reiterates the commitment to evaluate and respond to the league&rsquo;s proposals.  The Minister has made it clear to all parties that action is required on this issue and that the issues pertaining to the entire credit union system, including credit unions which are members of either, both or neither representative group, would be addressed.</P>
        <P>Since the start of the year, the Registrar of Credit Unions has been holding a structured series of regular meetings with the ILCU to examine the SPS reform proposal.  The registrar is currently reviewing the following key modules of the proposed reform.  These include the structure and governance of the SPS company, operational matters, financial structure and Northern Ireland issues.  The discussions are aimed at identifying common ground with regard to how savings protections based on the ILCU&rsquo;s proposal should work.  I understand the process is being conducted in a constructive and positive manner by both <Col N="746"/>parties.  The league is committed to pursuing its discussions with the registrar with the aim of achieving agreement on any revised scheme that may be approved under section 46.  It is hoped that discussions will be finalised by the end of March.</P>
        <P>The fact that the issue is being addressed initially with the ILCU reflects the genesis of the proposal and the current ownership of SPS funds but I again stress that any outcome must be inclusive.  In the interim, consideration of new legislative initiatives which represent a significant departure from the existing regulatory framework, which is the case with the proposals set out in this Bill, should await the outcome and recommendations of the current review.  It does not make sense to seek to move two proposals at once.  Moreover, as Senators will probably be aware, significant progress has been made over the past year on coming to a consensus with the credit union movement on developing the legislative framework for credit unions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The initiatives taken in the important areas of investment guidelines, increased share and deposit levels and the review of longer term limits for credit unions have been taken after consultation and dialogue with all stakeholders.  This demonstrates the partnership approach has been the right method of resolving important issues for the credit union movement.  In that context, while the Minister will of course examine any recommendations arising from the joint review of the SPS which may require a policy or legislative response, we should not pre-empt the outcome of these discussions.  Furthermore, it is essential that any solution fully acknowledges the all-island dimension of the credit union movement because it is important to maintain the Thirty-two County basis on which the current SPS operates.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, while fully acknowledging Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding the interests of credit union savers, the Minister believes the current examination of ILCU&rsquo;s reform proposal should be concluded in advance of any consideration of further legislative initiatives in this area.  The Government does not support the Bill on that basis.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for introducing this Private Member&rsquo;s Bill for consideration by the House.  The Minister expects all stakeholders to play their part over the coming weeks in contributing to the delivery of the important public policy objective of ensuring the continuation of legal certainty regarding the protection of savers in credit unions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the credit union movement and thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for bringing forward this Bill.  I am in complete agreement with the Senator on the issue of savings protection but do not agree on the mechanisms he proposes.  I am thus in a quandary in that regard.  I believe everybody would support the principles behind the Senator&rsquo;s proposals because an enhanced savings protection scheme is clearly needed.  Senator Quinn and the Minister of State referred to the discussions which are taking place between the registrar and the ILCU.  These discussions seem to have dragged on for a long period of time, so if this Second Stage debate can provoke a conclusion in the shorter term, we will have achieved something.</P>
        <P>The credit union movement has been a strong pillar in the economic development of the country over the past 25 years.  Before the arrival of the Celtic tiger and at a time when other financial institutions were not offering credit, the credit union network provided loans to thousands of people.  The credit union movement deserves credit for the successful efforts it has made during its history.  Approximately &euro;12 billion is held currently in credit union savings accounts by more than 2 million members.  I confess that I do not have a credit union account because the movement has not had a strong history in my area.  However, I am familiar with the role of credit unions in rural Ireland.  We have discussed in this House and elsewhere the breakdown of rural communities over the years and the issue of bank closures in large rural towns.  Credit unions are now the only financial institutions present in many towns.  They should be supported and congratulated at every opportunity for the fact that they continue to provide a vital and viable service to the public.</P>
        <P>I have raised on a number of occasions in this House the high level of indebtedness in Ireland.  In the past two years, an additional &euro;118 billion in debts was accrued by the citizens of this country.  That is a startling amount of money.  I would be positively disposed to any legislation, such as this Bill, which would offer protection to credit union members.  I have a number of reservations, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the all-Ireland nature of the credit union movement, which we should promote at every turn.  We should ensure that whatever framework is put in place extends across the 32 counties because one of the feathers <Col N="748"/>in the cap of the Irish League of Credit Unions is its Thirty-two County basis.  I also concur with the Minister of State that it does not make sense to propose new legislation while the discussions are ongoing.  We should await the conclusion of the discussions and hope they will bear fruit sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>The Bill also proposes the establishment of a credit union savings protection agency.  Were such an organisation to come into being, the issue of its operation would require discussion at some length in this House.</P>
        <P>I express my wholehearted support for the principle of protecting people&rsquo;s savings in credit unions.  However, I am unsure whether the Bill as proposed is the correct mechanism to so do.  Members should wait for the conclusion of the discussions between the registrar and the representatives of the credit unions on the establishment of an agreed mechanism for savings protection.  That route should be taken if it can be achieved in the short term.</P>
        <P>I again commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on introducing this Bill before the House, thus facilitating the opportunity to have this debate.  However, Members probably should hold fire until the conclusion of the discussions between the registrar and the credit union representatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the discussion afforded by this Bill.  As I noted last Wednesday, I thoroughly approve of the introduction by Members, be they Government, Opposition or Independent, of legislation or Private Members&rsquo; Bills.  Such legislation can stimulate discussion and the deliberative process and can give a push towards a destination.  On that basis, I congratulate Senator O&rsquo;Toole on introducing this detailed Bill.</P>
        <P>All Members recognise the invaluable social role played by credit unions in Ireland and I welcome the expanded limits that have been agreed with the Government that improve the credit unions&rsquo; lending capacity.  The importance of credit unions, particularly in small or medium-sized towns, has been pointed out.  It is worth noting that their role was discussed in some detail by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, of which both Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I are members.  The joint committee had the opportunity to listen to representatives of the credit unions.</P>
        <P>It is a proud achievement that, to date, no member of a credit union has experienced loss of their shares or deposits and no credit union has become insolvent.  However, particularly given the current high propensity to borrow, this is not to say there are no future dangers that must be guarded against and it is questionable whether there is sufficient protection in this regard.  This is generally recognised, as is the need to improve the safety net provided by the savings protection <Col N="749"/>scheme, which is really a stabilisation fund rather than a guarantee of individual savings.</P>
        <P>However, the mechanism for so doing is open to question.  A detailed consultative process involving the credit unions and the Department of Finance is under way.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, the ongoing discussions are making progress in this regard.  Consequently, it is open to doubt whether, in a literal sense, a parallel initiative such as this is apropos, especially one that does not command the complete consensus of the credit union movement.  Although the Minister of State has outlined the reasons the Government side cannot support the Bill, this does not detract from the value of its introduction for discussion by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>Since there may not be a Committee Stage debate on this Bill, it might be worth making one of two points of detail on the Bill.  Section 5(2) proposes to give the regulator ultimate power to change the memorandum and articles of association of the new company.  However, there is no mention of any consultation process with credit unions or the wider movement.  Section 6 mentions expenses that could be taken out of each credit union&rsquo;s contribution by the company.  However, it could be argued that each member&rsquo;s contribution to the company should be ring-fenced and held as a liability due back to each credit union.</P>
        <P>Section 8 proposes to give the company the power to invest according to the rules set down by its board.  Arguably however, it should be subject to the same guidelines as laid down in the regulator&rsquo;s investment guidelines for credit unions.  Section 10 states that the new company should be exempt from capital gains tax.  However, as credit unions are subject to capital gains tax on gains made on the sale of investments, there may be some inconsistency in this regard.  Moreover, there is no mention of value added tax in respect of the new company.</P>
        <P>Section 12 deals with the appointment of directors.  Arguably, individual credit unions, the Irish League of Credit Unions and the wider movement should be entitled to nominate suitable candidates for the position of director in the new company.  In respect of section 12, I am surprised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s exclusion of members of local authorities.  Perhaps it is because as an Independent Member, he does not face the same electorate as those who are elected on the panels.  This is a sore point with most Members and was not covered in his speech.  I do not understand the rationale.  If someone is properly qualified and may be involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 19 states that all credit unions must abide by the new company&rsquo;s rules.  At the very least, such rules must be agreed by consensus with the credit unions before one begins to impose them.  Moreover, there may be difficulties in respect of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s views.  On yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, I was somewhat critical of the Competition Authority.  If its position is to be taken too rigorously, no one can combine or associate for any purpose whatever.  It seems to me that freedom of association and organisation constitutes a fundamental democratic right.  Consequently, Members have not thought through the relationship between the freedom of association and the needs of competition.  Most credit unions, whatever side of the fence they are on, consider the contribution of 2% of savings under section 19 to be a stiff imposition and no reference is made to whether interest will accrue on the deposit.  Section 21 provides substantial powers to the company to levy additional charges.</P>
        <P>The legislation is far from perfect, even in detail, and needs further discussion.  The issue boils down to process and everybody is agreed the issue needs to be addressed, but the question is how is it best addressed.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is a prime participant in the parallel social partnership process and he would perhaps be the first to acknowledge, if he thought about it, that results are best achieved by negotiation, agreement and consensus rather than by legislative imposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate.  The legislation provides the opportunity for a useful discussion on an issue that demands early resolution.  I join others in acknowledging the important and vibrant role of credit unions in our society over many decades.  However, their role has changed significantly in recent years.  When most credit unions were established, they largely dealt with small savers and they provided loans to those who may have found it difficult to secure loans from commercial financial institutions.  Over the years, the limits on borrowings increased dramatically and it is open to credit unions to lend substantial amounts and to take substantial deposits, which has fundamentally changed the nature of a number of them. <Col N="751"/> Nonetheless, the movement still maintains a non-profit ethos and a number of credit unisons are still run by voluntary labour.</P>
        <P>The consensus among Members is that there is a need for a savings protection scheme but it should be acknowledged, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has, that the Irish League of Credit Unions runs such a scheme.  However, it does not do all that the Senator is trying to achieve in the legislation.  The scheme essentially allows the ILCU to intervene to stabilise credit unions if there is a threat to their solvency, but it does not specifically guarantee the savings of shareholders, which is a deficiency.   The ILCU will say with confidence that it has discretion under the current scheme to guarantee savings and it did so in the Monaghan case, for example, to ensure there was no further call on the scheme.  Nevertheless, that is discretionary and I agree with others that the deposits must be guaranteed and a legal entitlement must be enforceable regarding the guarantee.</P>
        <P>It would be useful if the principles underpinning a new scheme were set out given.  Everybody agrees a new scheme should be introduced.  A compensation element, which is legally enforceable, must be included.  An issue arises immediately regarding whether that right should be underpinned by statute.  That does not necessarily need to happen but it must be underpinned in some fashion by the State.  I have an open mind on whether that should be by way of guarantee, which would involve the Central Bank, or by contract, and I would not have a problem in principle with underpinning this by statute.</P>
        <P>The money in any scheme or fund must be ring-fenced for the purpose of compensation and stabilisation.  The ILCU or other organisations cannot have access to moneys in a fund provided for the purpose.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the dispute a number of years ago when moneys that were thought to be available for stabilisation were used for other purposes and that caused rancour within the credit union movement.  Clearly there can be no repeat of that.  Any fund set aside for the purpose of stabilisation and compensation must be used exclusively for that purpose.  To avoid a suspicion or possibility of a conflict of interest, the fund must be administered separately from the ILCU.</P>
        <P>An analogy can be drawn between this and the solicitors&rsquo; mutual defence fund, of which I am a member.  It is a mutual fund which provides professional indemnity insurance for solicitors.  All its members are solicitors who are also members of the Law Society, but the fund is administered on another premises by different management and is quite separate from the society.  While the membership is similar, separate administrators, premises and responsibility are needed.  There must be no possibility of a conflict of interest.</P>
        <P>I very much agree with the principle that the scheme not only must be open to all credit unions <Col N="752"/>but also they must be mandated to be part of it.  It is conceivable that more than one scheme could be set up and, for example, the ILCU and CUDA could set up separate schemes.  That is not desirable and clearly it would be better if only one scheme applied and all credit unions were mandated to be members of it.</P>
        <P>The legislation brings up the issue of the general regulation of credit unions.  When the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority was established, there was much discussion about whether the credit union movement should be brought under its remit.  Many credit unions felt at the time that their ethos was substantially different from that of commercial banks and for-profit financial institutions and that IFSRA would be more focused on them.  Concern about this remains.  There is a feeling that IFSRA considers credit unions in the same light as banks and does not appreciate the difference in ethos.  Perhaps that needs to be bedded down.  Will the Minister of State comment on whether he is satisfied with the way in which regulation has evolved since IFSRA took responsibility for it a few years ago?</P>
        <P>We cannot ignore the fact that the Bill is a product of a split in the credit union movement as a result of a major dispute a number of years ago.  Nobody should adjudicate on the split but there is clearly merit in the case put forward by the CUDA and Senator O&rsquo;Toole, so I do not propose to oppose Second Stage.  However, I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that it makes no sense to travel parallel roads at the same time.  I hope Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposition of the Bill will provide the incentive needed to bring the ongoing talks to a successful conclusion.  The Minister of State has set out the basis on which the talks are progressing and no Member will have a difficulty with the principles he set out.  Those are largely replicated in the legislation.  I hope the debate will provide the incentive needed to reach a successful conclusion because we are all agreed that the ten-year lacuna that has existed since the 1997 Act, which mandated the establishment of such a scheme, is not acceptable.</P>

        <P>There is no doubt legitimate concerns have been articulated in the Bill, which is supported by the CUDA and Senator O&rsquo;Toole, such as the issue of protection, to which each speaker has adverted.  I listened carefully to what Senator McDowell said about whether there is a need for a statutory requirement in regard to protection.  I <Col N="753"/>tend to come down in favour of a statutory requirement as protection is vital.  Linked to that is knowledge and information, which all branches and members should have.  That brings us to transparency.  It is quite clear from the little amount I know and from the anecdotal evidence available to me that there is not always transparency in the operations of credit unions.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the phenomenally successful role the credit union movement has played, especially in the social life of the country, as a speaker opposite said.  I have been blindly loyal to a financial institution which gave me a student loan in 1967 and I confess, like Senator John Paul Phelan, that I never became a member of a credit union.  I admit to blind loyalty to that financial institution, which I will not name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the Senator is in Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I got a student loan for books. I believe I spent a little bit of it on them anyway.  Since then, I have continued to show loyalty to this institution.</P>
        <P>The credit union movement should be commended by all sides on the manner in which it took up where for-profit organisations, such as banks and other institutions, left off.  In that way, it reached out in a very inclusive, caring and supportive way to people in urban and rural Ireland.  It played a significant role in ensuring loan sharks did not have the market to themselves.  In the absence of credit unions, loan sharks would have had a field day in the bad old 1980s and early 1990s.  Thankfully, that was not the case because of the way in which credit unions very effectively filled that vacuum.</P>
        <P>There are serious issues, one of which is the fact the CUDA is not in the league.  That, in itself, is a very significant factor which must be taken into account.  Speakers talked about consensus building.  I agree with my colleague that it is very important.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is one of the great architects of partnership in education and of social partnership.  While I acknowledge what the Minister of State said about the wisdom of enabling and facilitating the speedy progression of the talks taking place between the regulator and the league, consensus can only be built if the significant views of the minority of branches are fully taken into account.  That is what real partnership is about.  While I fully support what the Minister of State said, I urge him to ensure the regulator and the other parties to those talks take full account of the views of the CUDA and branches North and South.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister of State&rsquo;s line at this point.  It is sensible, reasonable and logical that parallel talks do not take place.  However, we must ensure the talks, as they progress from here, are all-inclusive and that minority concerns as well as the welfare of the membership of credit unions are fully encompassed by those talks.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>While I warmly welcome this debate arising from the publication of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s Bill, which is a timely and worthwhile initiative, I lean on the side of the Minister of State&rsquo;s and Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s view that we grasp the opportunity of the discussion on this Bill to give a kick in the transom to the talks and expedite them.  With the development of new products and the extension of credit guidelines in credit unions, it is important these talks are brought to a speedy, effective and all-inclusive conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on taking the initiative and publishing this Bill.  Other speakers have probably spoken about the impact credit unions have had in Ireland.  I refer, in particular, to the North of Ireland and the role the credit union in Derry played in the foundation of the SDLP.  My uncle, Michael Canavan, was one of the founders of the credit union in Derry and of the SDLP.  Derry in the late 1950s was a very barren, sparse and lonely city with a visceral feeling of desolation.  The credit union gave the people confidence in that they could borrow money and were not isolated.  I have also stated at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service what the credit union movement has contributed in the South.  Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Quinn spoke about what it will contribute in the future.</P>
        <P>I did not know the Minister of State would not support the Bill.  However, we are here to take initiatives and to bring forward Bills.  Regardless of whether there is agreement, it is good to have debate.  Legislation should not be carved in stone and, as society and circumstances change, it should evolve.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole who makes a tremendous contribution as a Senator and representative of his organisation.  Where does he see his Bill in the context of the all-island nature of the credit union movement?  How would it affect members in the North?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in complimenting Senator O&rsquo;Toole on bringing forward this Bill.  In many ways, it is timely.  Its main purpose is to ensure we do not end up closing the door after the horse has bolted.  I was a founder member of the credit union in Cashel many years ago.  One must look back to the start of the credit union movement to realise the role it has played in the intervening years.  In the early years of the credit union movement, people found it especially difficult to deal with the banks.  I do not know if they have changed very much in the meantime but they were never really seen as institutions which would help those who were not particularly wealthy, so we needed the credit union movement.</P>
        <P>The credit union movement was very much built on voluntary effort.  Today, credit unions have staff and fine buildings, and rightly so, but in the early days, it was mostly voluntary effort <Col N="755"/>which brought credit union branches into existence and helped them to develop.  It is now a huge financial institution.  However, it is the small member who must be considered, acknowledged and protected.  I am glad nobody ever lost shares or deposits in a credit union.  This is a wonderful achievement.  It is not accidental.  It happened because the correct structures were in place.  Over the years, we saw those structures adapt.  I am aware the Registrar of Credit Unions was in touch with the Irish League of Credit Unions.  It put forward certain proposals on protecting savings and these will continue to be examined, which is as it should be.</P>
        <P>Having stated all that, much of this took place and we were not fully aware of it.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole did a great service to this House and the credit union movement by making us stop and consider where we are.  I support the view of the Minster of State.  At this stage, we must ensure all those with an interest in this, including credit unions, have an opportunity to bring forward their views and ideas and that we have a forum in which to do so.</P>
        <P>This matter should not have a divisive element.  There is nothing wrong with division when people hold different points of view and wish to put them forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Ultimately however, the credit union movement and individuals must be considered.  The only way this can be done is to ensure everybody has a voice in his or her own right.  We all received correspondence expressing different points of view.  A variation in views was visible in what we received from branches of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  There is nothing wrong with this either.  If a branch within what is considered the established approach to this problem has a view, it must also be given a voice and the opportunity to ensure it will be dealt with in a proper manner.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Bill is before the House for discussion.  It is evident that a great deal of work went into it.  The Bill may only have so many pages but it is quite clear somebody had an ear very close to the ground and took on board certain views.  It is easy to discuss an issue on the Order of Business.  It is especially good that we are able to deal with this in a focused way.  I know the Government&rsquo;s position on the Bill.  However, I still believe what is in the Bill will not be lost on the Minister of State, the Department or the Government because that is how it should be.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator O&rsquo;Toole on bringing this forward and providing us with an opportunity to express our views and allow others express their views through us.  We also received the up-to-date position from the Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="756"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and Senators for their contributions.  They were very helpful.  The debate progressed the issue substantially.  I welcome the point made by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I also heard differing views from various credit unions.  The one aspect which depressed me about the matter was that some people told me their views but asked me not to mention their names.  It bothered me because I sensed a type of oppression in terms of putting forward viewpoints.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, it is important to hear various views.  This was one reason I wanted to discuss the matter today.</P>
        <P>As Senator Mansergh correctly stated, my natural inclination is to negotiate my way through difficulties.  However, when matters sit around, as this has, encouragement is needed to move them on.  The timescale is important.  Senator Quinn made a point which I did not.  We only have one and a half major mutual societies in the country, namely the EBS and half another organisation which is about to change.  Much as I regret stating it, the EBS will not hold against becoming a plc.  Within a short period, credit unions will be the only mutual part of the financial services.</P>
        <P>I enjoyed the speech made by the Minister for State.  I thank him for agreeing with everything I stated and supporting me on the issues.  I could not find any point of difference.  The Progressive Democrats learned the game quickly.  The Minister of State agreed with me on everything and then opposed my Bill.  There is a logic there which escapes me.  We Independents are naive in these situations.  I notice the issues raised by the Minister of State.  He explained the reasons for not supporting the Bill.  They were not to do with the content of the Bill but the timescale.  He expects proposals to come forward and have something towards the end of March.  This is important and I will return to it.</P>
        <P>Senator McDowell raised the fact that we do not have a split and we should not do anything to encourage one.  Everything we do should be aimed at pulling people together in the long term.  I hope this is the case because, as Senator Phelan pointed out, this service is provided to all of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The question of statutory compulsion was raised by Senators McDowell, Mansergh and Fitzgerald from various points of view.  We must be clear that, if this is established either through the system being negotiated with the Minister of State or through my Bill, ultimately we cannot have a choice and credit unions must be part of it by ensuring and guaranteeing.  It does not give offence to the freedom of association provision in the Constitution.  It is a different matter.  It is protective in that if an entity is to be called a credit union it must be part of it.</P>
        <P>In the letter I quoted which was sent from the credit union advisory committee to the Minister of State, the first point made was that a fund must be separate from individual credit unions and credit union associations to lessen the risk of funds <Col N="757"/>being used for purposes not related to insolvency and financial default.  Many speakers stated this, and it is important.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator White on the need to create an all-Ireland dimension.  I also want to examine it in the context of a number of credit unions in the South and a significant number in the North not being affiliated.  This would provide a great opportunity to create an all-Ireland dimension and ensure it through shadow legislation, agreement or financial instruments.  It can be done and I was through it before.</P>
        <P>I cannot believe Senator Mansergh caught me out on section 12 and I concede completely on it.  I conducted that business over the phone and got a drafter to examine it.  He put in the traditional reference to TDs, Senators and local authorities.  I asked him to remove that reference.  He removed the reference to TDs and Senators but allowed in local politicians.  I apologise to my colleagues on the other side of the House.  It will be removed on Committee Stage and they will not see it again.</P>
        <P>All other issues raised by Senator Mansergh are dealt with.  Ring fencing, which was also raised by Senator McDowell, is part of the Bill.  I accept the power to amend legislation should be clearer and must be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Under the Bill, investment is with the approval of the regulatory authority and on the basis of what the regulator states, so this is not an issue.  Taxation is not dealt with but it would be unusual to do so.  Taxation is a legal instrument in itself and the Bill would be governed by the instruments of taxation and tax law.  I dealt with the other issues.</P>
        <P>Nobody mentioned the main issue, which is consumer protection.  We all implied it.  However, I wish to state that this is a consumer protection issue.  I was pushed on this because, in a recent case, experts gave evidence to the High Court that the current scheme was deficient.  This concerned me and I want legislation which will stand alone.  The point of most significance and influence was made by the Minister of State when he stated that he put a time limit on this matter and will know something by 30 March.  I did not know this when I drafted the Bill two months ago.  It is significant.  On that basis, I propose to withdraw the Bill and re-enter it at a later date if I do not see progress.  I want to use this to put pressure on people to do what is required.  At this time I would, with the leave of the House, propose that the legislation be withdrawn.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to take this matter relating to Dublin Port and Dublin Bay.  I may have tabled this matter previously asking for discussions in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Only last week, I visited Dublin Port as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport at the request of its management, following on from a presentation to our committee on 29 November.  To my amazement, Dublin Port is still insisting on and, more importantly, expecting that the Government will make a decision on granting a licence to fill in a further 52 acres of Dublin Bay, thereby increasing the overall area of Dublin Port.</P>
        <P>Any layman could visit Dublin Port, look at the figures shown to us on the growth in ro-ro and lo-lo operations at Dublin Port over the past ten years and consider how this is expected to grow continuously in the coming years.  A simple question cannot be answered, however.  With all the unitised trade coming into Dublin, is it really expected the extra traffic will be churned out to the M50, even when that road is upgraded?</P>
        <P>More importantly, the port is seeking 52 acres of infill because it wants deeper berthing facilities.  Deeper berthing ships will have Magnum containers, a large type of container which cannot fit through the tunnel.  On one side we have a constraint at the end of the port as the M50 and our national road network cannot take those trucks.  Looking at the increase in trade expected in this economy over the next number of years, I do not believe it is feasible for us to bring such trucks on to the M50 on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>There is an alternative based on European and worldwide best practice.  We should now take the decision to relocate the industrial port activity from Dublin Port.  If this is not done, it is likely a new port will be developed in any event at Bremore called Bremore Ireland Port, which will be made possible by Drogheda Port relocating to north County Dublin.  If that occurs, the market will dictate there will be another smaller port north of Dublin.  At the same time Dublin Port will increase its capacity.</P>
        <P>It would be better if a Department strategy was devised to deal with the issue.  When the committee left Dublin Port last week, the authorities <Col N="759"/>asked that we bring closure to the issue of whether they will get the 52 acres for infill in Dublin Bay.  As we know, the authorities have been asking for this for 30 years, with the matter being hopped back and forth from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Dublin City Council.  There is a question of whether planning permission or a foreshore licence is required first.</P>
        <P>The ports are now under the remit of the Department of Transport and it is time the Department developed a strategy to deal with our imports and exports.  There is a requirement that this be brought to a conclusion.  We may allow capacity to be continually increased, although the chief executive has stated that even if the increase were allowed, the port would again reach capacity in 20 years.  Is a 20-year horizon good planning, and what will be done at the end of that period in any event?</P>
        <P>For the sake of the life of Dublin city, there should be a decision taken that Dublin Port will not be allowed to fill in a further 52 acres.  Where does the Department stand on the issue?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht deis a thabhairt dom an cheist th&aacute;bhachtach seo faoi Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus an t&iacute;r go hioml&aacute;n a fhreagairt.</P>
        <P>Senator Morrissey will be aware that Dublin Port Company is a State-owned company established under the 1996 Harbours Act.  The Act provides that the company is required to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour.  As part of this mandate, the future development of Dublin Port is primarily a matter for the company and its board.</P>
        <P>Dublin Port is the country&rsquo;s premier port in terms of throughput and turnover and, as such, is of vital strategic importance to our trading economy.  We are victims of our own success as we would not be having a debate on providing additional capacity but for the policies implemented by this Government and the previous Government going back to 1997, with economic growth of almost 5% each year over all those years.  All of us are delighted to have this debate and have this difficulty rather than problem.  The port is important as it handles approximately half the State&rsquo;s seaborne trade, including 76% of the ro-ro trade and 59% of the lo-lo trade.</P>
        <P>When I was in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and before the Department of Transport took over the relevant responsibilities, I published the ports policy statement in January 2005.  That aimed to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs.  It recognised that one of the key challenges was the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, especially for unitised trade.  I <Col N="760"/>would be the first to recognise the importance of planning in advance because it takes some years of a lead-in to provide additional capacity and cater for the going trade and economic growth.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Last October, my Department published the broad conclusions of a study commissioned to determine whether national port capacity requirements for unitised trade could be met adequately by a combination of projects being planned and progressed by the ports sector.  As part of this study, submissions were received from the seven ports around the country with expansion plans, including the Dublin Port Company, which outlined proposals to increase capacity at some of its existing container terminals and to build new terminals as part of its intention to reclaim 21 hectares of foreshore.  This proposal would require planning permission and permission under the Foreshore Acts.  When I was a Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I authorised the necessary letter to the Dublin Port Company to allow it to prepare for planning.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of investment required by such a development, my Department would expect to receive a detailed business case, which would be necessary despite the fact that the ports have a statutory basis.  When investments are requested, the Department has the responsibility to know the details.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy identifies the strategic merit in relieving the pressures on Dublin Port, of which I am well aware, through targeted interventions in building up port capacity elsewhere.  The recent capacity study concluded that all the projects presented to us are generally consistent with the objectives of the strategy.  The projects are located in or close to the five main gateway towns and six of the seven are outside Dublin city.</P>
        <P>I understand that Dublin City Council has engaged consultants to carry out a wide-ranging economic, amenity-recreational and environmental study of Dublin Bay, including the port area, to identify a guiding framework for its future overall development.  Currently, the consultants are carrying out a stakeholder consultation, to which the Department of Transport is contributing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to draw the attention of the House and Senator Morrissey in particular to the recently published National Development Plan 2007-2013, which proposes a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy in Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the national spatial strategy and national economic policy.  It refers to the difficulties that could arise in the form of containers that are unable to pass through the tunnel, but it also recognises that the maximum height limit is 4.6 m and that there is a wash-out period for taller containers.</P><Col N="761"/>
        <P>These factors must be taken into consideration before a final decision can be taken.  The review will take full account of the findings of the study being carried out by the city council.  I am sure that Senator Morrissey and his colleagues on the Joint Committee on Transport will desire to make an input and that they will have an opportunity to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House.  I wish to emphasise what has occurred in respect of Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited.  For many years, west County Limerick was synonymous with poultry processing, but a short period has witnessed the ending of that industry.  Some 500 jobs have been lost by Kerry Foods and Castlemahon Foods, leading to hundreds of indirect job losses.</P>
        <P>Following the appointment of a liquidator in late 2006, Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited&rsquo;s 300 plus workers were made redundant because the plant could not be sold.  Having lost their jobs, they were confronted by the minimum two-week statutory payment.  In February 2005, Castlemahon Foods, which is owned by the O&rsquo;Kane group from Ballymena in County Antrim, made 150 workers redundant and put together a restructuring plan for the company.  The workers received a two-week statutory payment and three additional weeks&rsquo; payment from the O&rsquo;Kane group.  Therefore, one can understand the disappointment felt by the remaining workers when the company closed.  Despite many discussions, the O&rsquo;Kane group was unrelenting and made zero contributions to redundancy payments after the closure in 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In an attempt to pressure the group to make an additional payment, peaceful protests were organised outside Tesco&rsquo;s, one of the major companies to which Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited provided produce, but they were unsuccessful.  During talks at the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Foley, an astute person, had his hands constrained.  He spoke on behalf of unemployed workers while the O&rsquo;Kane group was protected by the liquidator.  As such, he was dependent on the group&rsquo;s goodwill, but none was forthcoming.</P>
        <P>In a recent reply made in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State said that he understood how the workers who received two weeks&rsquo; payments felt in light of those who received five weeks&rsquo; payments a year previously.  I understand that a group was due to meet him recently.  The workers&rsquo; union, the ATGWU, has been good to them throughout the process.  The group and Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly of the ATGWU made a proposal regarding the State&rsquo;s entitlement as a preferential creditor to a 40% refund of the redundancy payments upon the sale of the company&rsquo;s assets.  The group requested that <Col N="762"/>the State consider redistributing that 40% among the workforce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State may point to legislation, but not many Irish companies lose jobs through the appointment of a liquidator.  Recently, it was possible to move amending legislation on health insurance at short notice.  If the Minister of State is willing to do something on behalf of the workers, should it not be possible to amend legislation to accommodate the liquidation?  It would be a gesture of goodwill on behalf of the Government to the workers, many of whom have not found alternative jobs.  Despite statements regarding full employment in the country, west County Limerick has suffered a rash of job losses.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to determine to what degree he can assist the workers.  Their request to have the 40% refund redistributed is reasonable and valid and would not constitute a loss on the State&rsquo;s part.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to respond to Senator Finucane on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who is unable to attend.</P>
        <P>The redundancy payment scheme was established on 1 January 1968 and is governed by the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967, 1971, 1979 and 2003. In general, a redundant employee with at least two years&rsquo; service is entitled to receive two weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service plus one week&rsquo;s pay at the gross rate of pay up to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  Wages in excess of &euro;600 per week should not be included when calculating a statutory redundancy lump sum payment.</P>
        <P>It is up to the employer to pay the statutory payment in the first instance.  If the employer is unable to pay the statutory amount but gives the employee the necessary documentation to claim the statutory lump sum from the social insurance fund &mdash; form RP50 &mdash; then the employee can be paid directly by the Department from the fund on foot of form RP50.  When an employer pays the statutory redundancy lump sums to the employees, he or she is entitled to claim a rebate of 60% from the social insurance in respect of each redundant employee.  When the necessary checks are carried out on the claims and officials of the Department are satisfied that they are in order, then a payable order in respect of 60% of the statutory amounts paid to the employees is issued to the employer in settlement of his or her claim.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In cases when the statutory redundancy lump sums are paid directly by the Department to the employees, 40% of each lump sum paid is recoverable from the assets of the employer by the Department for the social insurance fund.  This statutory redundancy recoveries function is provided for in sections 42 and 43 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 as amended by section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971 and further <Col N="763"/>amended by section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979.  Section 42 of the 1967 Act, as amended by section 14 of the 1979 Act, gives the Minister preferential status in a winding up situation in recovering amounts paid from the social insurance fund.  Thus, under section 14 of the 1979 Act, a redundancy lump sum  &mdash; or part thereof &mdash; is made a priority debt under section 285 of the Companies Act 1963 in cases of winding up and a priority debt under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 in cases of a bankrupt or arranging debtor.</P>
        <P>Section 43 of the 1967 Act also makes general provision whereby all moneys due to the fund  &mdash; whether in a winding-up situation or not &mdash; are debts which can be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Section 14 (5) of the 1971 Act makes provision for companies in liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or administration or insolvent companies to get the benefit of 60% rebate in determining their outstanding debt to the fund in respect of statutory redundancy lump sum payments made by the Department to eligible employees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As can be seen from the foregoing, the Minister has no discretion with regard to the 40% due to the social insurance fund.  He has no legal powers to divert &mdash; from the social insurance fund to the employees concerned &mdash; moneys which may be recovered from Castlemahon Food Products.  As the Senator said, on 25 February 2005 Castlemahon Food Products notified the Department in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 that due to intense competition in the marketplace and escalating operating costs, 150 employees would be made redundant.  On 28 February 2005, the F&Aacute;S office in Limerick was notified by the Department of the forthcoming collective redundancies, so that appropriate action could be taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of those employees were not entitled to receive statutory redundancy.  However, rebate was paid to the company in respect of 87 employees.  In September 2006, the company went into liquidation.  At that time there were 310 employees remaining in the employment of the company, 266 of whom were entitled <Col N="764"/>to receive statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  To date, the Department has paid statutory redundancy lump sums directly to 260 of those eligible out of the social insurance fund.  These claims were received in the Department in various groups through its online computer system.  The payments were made between 14 November 2006, when the first group was paid, to 14 February 2007 when the last group was paid.  All the claims received online were paid well within the six week time span for making such payments.</P>
        <P>A further six employees are still working with the liquidator.  I understand these employees will be made redundant within the next two weeks.  When the final redundancies have taken place in Castlemahon Food Products, a letter of claim will be sent to the liquidator for 40% of the amount paid in statutory lump sums seeking acknowledgement of the debt to the social insurance fund and querying if and when payment will be made.  The liquidator&rsquo;s attention will be drawn to the sections of the Acts outlined above. The claim will rank as a priority debt and the moneys due to the fund must be treated as a preferential claim by the liquidator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of the legal background to this and the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967, 1971, 1979 and 2003.  The legal position on redundancy was adapted over the passage of time.  The Minister of State says he has no legal powers to divert from the social insurance fund.  I am aware of that, but I am asking that the situation be reviewed in relation to the Act itself, to see whether it could be amended in a liquidating situation.  </P>
        <P>The workers find themselves in a terrible situation, with the equivalent of only two weeks&rsquo; pay after 22 weeks service, while the employer walks away completely.  No one has responsibility.  I should like the legislation at least to be looked at, to see whether it could accommodate a situation where a liquidator has been appointed.</P>
