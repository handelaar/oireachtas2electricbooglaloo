    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 4 p.m.; No. 2, Water Services Bill 2003 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 4 p.m. and to conclude no later than 5 p.m.; No. 3, Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude no later than 5.45 p.m.; No. 4, the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 &mdash; all Stages to be taken at 6.15 p.m. and to conclude no later than 7.15 p.m, with each group having six minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage and Committee and Remaining Stages will be taken immediately on conclusion of Second Stage and conclude at 7.15 p.m.; No. 5, the Statute Law Revision Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages to be taken at 5.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 6.15 p.m.; and No. 5<i>a</i>, motion on the establishment of a petitions committee to allow individual community groups and organisations to petition the Seanad and to make a request to the Seanad to take a view or initiative or to amend legislation on matters of public interest or concern, will be taken without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That the general election will be held on 24 May is welcome on all sides of the House.  Whether the people choose in their wisdom to vote for change or for the <i>status quo</i>, those of us involved in politics have a responsibility to encourage them to vote and to participate in the campaign, respecting the fact that Irish citizens, both party members and independent candidates, are putting their names before the people.  We wish all of them every success and hope that we have a campaign worthy of our democracy.  We are the fourth oldest parliamentary democracy in Europe.  We are a young country but our democracy has flourished since inde<Col N="2154"/>pendence and we are responsible for that legacy so we must ensure the people get the campaign they deserve.</P>
        <P>Members on all sides will contest the general election to the D&aacute;il and the election to the Seanad.  There was a suggestion that some Members were disappointed on being elected to the Seanad on the last occasion.  From my perspective, that was not the case.  It is a privilege to serve in this House and to be part of democratic life here.  I want to ensure that the campaign and the candidates before the Irish people over the course of the next three and half weeks will be respected by all sides and all shades of opinion.  I wish everyone every success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to echo much of what Senator Brian Hayes has said.  I wish all colleagues standing for election in either the Seanad or the D&aacute;il the best of luck.  I do not subscribe to the view that if somebody fails to be elected to one House and stands for another, this in some way diminishes the House.  The Seanad has been extraordinarily enriched by the contributions of people who were defeated in standing for election to the other House.  All I ask is that Members coming into the Seanad make the contribution they can make. </P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of this particular Seanad, my greatest regret is that once again we have failed to achieve reform of the House as we set out to do.  I am potentially one of the greatest losers, since no primary teachers who graduated since 1995 can vote for me.  This is a matter of great personal interest, I can assure the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One would never notice. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I notice it.  Even if I were never to profit from reform of the House, it is something of a failure that we have not managed to do it.  I know the Leader set out to do it, as did the leader of Fine Gael, Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Labour Party, Senator Ryan and Senator Dardis, leader of the Progressive Democrats.  We all set out to get this done and it did not happen.  However, now is not the time for recriminations.</P>
        <P>Looking back on this Seanad, it will be seen to have been an influential period and a Seanad that has been increasingly relevant, with more legislation initiated perhaps than in any of its predecessors since the foundation of the State.  It is worth noting that particular Ministers have chosen to initiate legislation in this House.  The contributions by spokespersons on all sides have been very important and I want to recognise that.</P>
        <P>In terms of the relevance of the House, from the perspective outside Leinster House, this has been strengthened.  I concur with Senator Brian Hayes to the effect that the contribution of the Seanad is important.  I hope the five of us, who are putting our names forward again for the university benches will be back in the House to con<Col N="2155"/>tribute further.  I wish colleagues on all sides who are going forward for re-election, the best of luck.  I particularly want to extend thanks to certain people.  I do not believe Senator Dardis is going forward again, although perhaps he is.   He has made an extraordinary contribution to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;during his period in the Seanad and I am pleased to recognise that.  While it is important for us, as Independents, to assert our independence, that does not mean we are in opposition.  We vote on merit as we think right as issues are raised, and will continue to do so. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity we did not get around to discussing the ethics Bill, as it would have been a very appropriate debate this week.  However, the world has moved on. </P>
        <P>I have a technical question.  When the Leader read the Order of Business she said that all Stages of No. 4 were to be taken.  Then she said that the Minister was to be called ten minutes before the end of Second Stage.  However, if there is no time limit for Second Stage we cannot know when the Minister is due to be called.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to conclude no later than 7.15 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all Stages, as I understood the Leader to say. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Senator&rsquo;s point. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all right and it is only a technical question in any event. </P>
        <P>It is almost 30 years since I contested my first Seanad election, and I should have more sense by now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One enjoys it but also one realises that one can have an influence on events.  It is only those who ignore this House who do not notice the degree to which legislation changes.  They do not recognise the degree to which sensible Ministers of all parties &mdash; no party has a monopoly in this regard &mdash; are prepared to listen to an argument, change their minds and have their thinking influenced.  Ministers get a tougher time in Seanad &Eacute;ireann than any journalist could ever give them.  A journalist&rsquo;s interview will last ten minutes and a Minister will survive it easily.  If an issue arises in this Chamber, the Minister must sit here as long as Members wish, particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Leader and, if I may say without her jumping at me, her predecessor for the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>My lips are honeyed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed they are.  The Twenty-First and Twenty-Second Seanad have seen the Government introduce more legislation through them than before, for which the Government deserves to be complimented.  The Seanad responded to that and showed its capacity and efficiency in dealing with legislation, despite the very rare occasions on which we had a few rows on debates being curtailed.</P>
        <P>I wish all my colleagues well.  In spite of 30 years of experience, I hope to be returned to the Seanad but it is in the hands of the electorate of the National University of Ireland.  I hope if I do return, for the first time in 30 years I will be sitting on the other side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could come over now.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a social climber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking forward to the Senator joining us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for his very kind remarks.  I want to pick up on Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments on the importance and value of our democracy.  The recent supplement on the Houses in <i>The Irish Times</i> was very useful.  I compliment those associated with its production.  It articulated well the important work done in both Houses, which is often taken for granted.  There is much cynicism about our work, some of which is understandable, and poking fun, which is acceptable.</P>
        <P>There is an important duty on all Members to emphasise that democracy is a very fragile plant.  While we take it for granted, it requires work and constant vigilance.  The old phrase,&ldquo; All it takes for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing&rdquo; springs to mind.</P>
        <P>I join in paying thanks to the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the staff of the Houses, the Clerk&rsquo;s office and the press, particularly Jimmy Walsh.  I acknowledge the work done by the Leader in improving the House&rsquo;s image and ensuring it has worked efficiently.  In that context, I must link this with Eamonn McCormack, a real rock in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I also thank the Whips on both sides for the work they have done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reform issue, as raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, is an important one.  The report some of us produced should not just be left aside, as it is critically important.  While it might not all be acted upon, much of it should be.  Staying in aspic, <Col N="2157"/>in perpetuity, is a danger to democracy.  We must re-invent it as we go along.  I compliment the Leader on the motion concerning petitions, an important step.</P>
        <P>All that is left for me to say, is <i>Ave, Salve, Vale,</i> the title of George Moore&rsquo;s book &mdash; Hail and Farewell.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>One issue I have raised consistently on the Order of Business is pensions.  I regret the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has not published the Green Paper on pensions which was to be published around the middle of April.  It is a shame that at the end of our term we have not had the opportunity to debate it.  It will probably not be published before the general election, which is a pity.  I wonder why the Green Paper was not published when we were promised it by the middle of April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is only two weeks ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not now be published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator&rsquo;s party not going to settle all of that with contracts and so on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is another broken promise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only two weeks ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps when the Leader replies she will be able to tell me if the Minister will publish the Green Paper on pensions before the general election.</P>
        <P>I wish everybody standing for election to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad well.  I also wish those who are not contesting the elections well, including Senators Dardis and Bohan and perhaps one or two others who are retiring.  On my behalf and that of my group, I thank the members of staff, including the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant, Eamonn McCormack and everybody who has been so helpful to us during the past five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to the remarks of Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Toole.  It is very important that people go out to vote.  Too many people died to get us the vote for it to be cast aside lightly.  I hope we can approach something like the 80% turnout in France.  I spent most of my working life as a civil servant and over that time I have had great regard for politicians from all parties with whom I worked and all those who follow the honourable avocation of politics.  It is too easy to be cynical, as so many people are, about what they do but I have the utmost respect and regard for those who offer themselves to the public for election or non-election as the case may be.</P>
        <P>In my case I have had the great honour and privilege of serving in this House at the invitation and nomination of the Taoiseach.  I regard it as a great privilege to be allowed to serve in this way.  The Taoiseach actually went further in that he <Col N="2158"/>allowed me to be independent.  When he invited me to accept the nomination a second time I pointed out that I wanted to be independent and he said that he wanted an independent voice.  In a sense, that is the measure of the man and I wish to put on record my deep appreciation of that.</P>
        <P>I, too, wish my colleagues well.  I have enjoyed the collegiality and friendship of the Seanad.  Everybody has been very kind to me.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the staff of the Seanad and of Leinster House.  I wish all those going forward for election well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in offering my thanks and praise to the officers and staff of the House and the good words said about those retiring by various colleagues.  I wish to mention my colleague on these benches, Senator Henry, with whom I have not always agreed.  We have had our ups and downs but she added something special with her particular tone of voice, the reasonable way in which she made her case, the dogged way in which she brought reports on mental health and such issues to the fore and her special medical expertise.  I believe she will be replaced by another remarkable woman whose name I will not put on the record in case I am accused of prejudicing the electorate.  I hope to be re-elected and look forward to working with my colleagues if I am lucky enough to get back.</P>
        <P>It will be an interesting election.  The Taoiseach has already shown his mettle.  I will not use the three words Mr. Haughey used about him but I was struck by the couple of strokes which have emerged so far.  There has been an effective gagging of the Mahon tribunal which has been nicely corked up now.  I congratulate him on his forthcoming speech to the Parliament in the next island; that was a nice little electoral dig-out by Mr. Blair.  However, serious matters remain and I hope these will be addressed by the House in the next session.</P>
        <P>On 6 March 2007 and not for the first time, I referred to the troubled matter of abortion and I read a letter into the record of the House because it was the fifth anniversary of a letter written by a wonderful and dignified young woman whose pregnancy involved a foetus with severe chromosomal abnormalities incompatible with life.  She stated in her letter that she did not advocate social abortion and she was not a campaigner on this issue.  Her letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am angry that men I do not know and who do not know me ... have decided that my body is their demesne; that they will have the right to decide how my family will cope with this very real tragedy; that, regardless of the emotional and physical distress for us, I must do what they want; that their bigoted will rules my body.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We should have listened to that voice five years ago.  We have been reprimanded also by the <Col N="2159"/>Judiciary for not having the courage to act legislatively in this very difficult matter.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another matter because I have been contacted by somebody who raised it before.  I refer to the question of sudden cardiac death in young adults.  This is a great tragedy and it is estimated that 100 people under 35 years of age die every year in Ireland.  Action has been taken to address this condition and a screening centre is located in the Mater Hospital.  This is a genetic condition and the families of victims need to be screened in order to anticipate a possible difficulty.  This centre is entirely supported by voluntary contributions.  We should be pressing to have such centres established throughout the country to help prevent this tragedy of young death.  It is very often the case that young athletes are victims.  In the dying day of this Oireachtas I ask that the incoming Government will immediately remove the 21% VAT on defibrillators.  These should be available much more widely.  If they are funded by voluntary contributions it is obscene to levy tax on them.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the introduction of this petitions committee and I commend the Members of this House and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for its proposal and also the Leader of the House for putting it on the Order Paper.  It will make this House more democratically relevant.  I was a little concerned that perhaps it would clog up the business of the House but I have consulted with the <i>primus inter pares</i> of our group &mdash; the first among equals, not the leader &mdash; I remind Senator O&rsquo;Toole he is not getting away with that even on this last day.  He assures me that this will be an extended function of the Seanad and will take place outside.  Such committees exist in the European Parliament and in the Scottish Parliament.  It is a good idea which I would welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">From this side of the House I wish to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the unfailing courtesy, latitude and on occasion, necessary firmness he has shown to all Members of this House.  It is strange feeling to have a one-Chamber Oireachtas although this is very temporarily the case.</P>
        <P>I wish to endorse fully all the sentiments expressed by Senator Brian Hayes about the importance of exercising one&rsquo;s democratic rights.  He made the valid point that we are a young democracy.  In that context I wish to recite a couple of lines from Charles Kickham:</P>
        <P LI="1">The nations have fallen, but thou still art young.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Thy sun is but rising, while others have set,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">And &mdash; tho&rsquo; slavery&rsquo;s cloud o&rsquo;er the morning hath hung,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The full noon of freedom will beam round thee yet.</P><Col N="2160"/>
        <P FLI="0">Whatever Government is elected by the will of the people to run the affairs of the nation over the next five years will inherit an economy in rude good health.</P>
        <P>Debate will now take place on the hustings and not in this House.  Statistics show a GNP growth of 7.4% in 2006.  That is the highest it has been since the peak of the Celtic tiger years in 2000.  Industrial employment is up 2,800.  Unemployment stands at 4.2%.  Industrial earnings are up 5.3%.</P>

        <P>I again echo Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s remarks when I say what a privilege it has been to have served as a Member of this House and to have contributed to so many excellent debates.  I thank the Leader, the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant, all the support staff of the House and Mr. Eamonn McCormack.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the complimentary and well deserved remarks offered by previous speakers and also with the useful comments made by Senator Brian Hayes and others regarding the forthcoming election and the duty of all citizens.  We have all enjoyed serving as Members of what has been an extremely useful Seanad.  I hope those of us who are fortunate later in the year will enjoy being Members of the next Seanad.  I wish everyone in the House who is contesting either election well.</P>
        <P>In respect of the legislation passed recently regarding the appointment of additional judges to the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court &mdash; about which there has been a great deal of speculation outside the House, particularly in another part of this city &mdash; will the Leader indicate what appointments, if any, have been made?  If such appointments have not yet been made, how imminent are they?</P>
        <P>Before it is too late, I wish to ask the Leader about another matter.  Killarney House is falling into a frightful state of disrepair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Dinny McGee&rsquo;s Cottage?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, <Col N="2161"/>Deputy Roche, made a commitment in regard to Killarney House.  Sadly, the cost relating to repairing it is rising each day.  A report outlining the decay, rising damp, etc., by which the house is affected is in the public domain.  We have waited far too long for a decision in respect of this matter.  The sooner repairs are carried out, the less they will cost.  I ask the Leader, in the dying days of this Administration, to use her good offices to have the long-standing commitment relating to this matter fulfilled.  Useful and beneficial action could be taken, perhaps under a public private partnership involving the two local authorities, the trustees at Muckross House and the Department in respect of a worthwhile cultural tourism project</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Dinah&rsquo;s Cottage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is mistaken in her pronunciation.  It is Dinis Cottage to which she means to refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for later in the summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Cultural tourism is increasing at a rate that is three times faster than ordinary tourism.  Something worthwhile, beneficial and useful could be done in respect of Killarney House.  For example, an audio-visual installation relating to the park could be put in place along with a civic and large-scale reception area and a theatre for the performing arts.  I urge the Leader to ensure, in so far as is possible, that the commitment given in respect of Killarney House will be fulfilled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Leas-Chathaoirleach stated at the outset that there would be no matters on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Government Whip, I wish to thank a number of people.  I thank the Leader for the way she has conducted business and replied to the many difficult questions that were put to her.  The House enjoyed a very high standing during her term of office.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his work here.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, Senator Rory Kiely, who is not here today.  I thank Deirdre, Jody and the rest of the Seanad staff for their help and co-operation.  I thank Eamonn McCormack from the Leader&rsquo;s office and my own secretary, Sarah Kelly.  I have dealt with a number of Senators but I thank Senator Cummins, in particular, for his co-operation.  I welcome the assistance the Senator and the Fine Gael leader in this House, Senator Brian Hayes, have given the Government side of the House.  They helped me out in many ways when I was finding it difficult to get people to come to the House.  I wish well the Deputy Leader of the House, Senator Dardis, whom I have known for many years.  I was surprised to hear he is not <Col N="2162"/>standing again.  Perhaps he will change his mind in that regard.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy Whip on this side of the House, Senator Glynn, sincerely.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to consider how the seats in the Seanad will be filled when we are back here again.  We do not know who will be returned to comprise the next Seanad.  I was thinking this morning about road safety and the dangers on the road.  It is quite possible that by the time the Seanad sits again, the number of people who will have been killed on the roads will be more than enough to fill every seat in this Chamber.  That is a sad reflection on what is happening on the roads at present.</P>
        <P>As I was travelling to the House this morning, I noticed that election posters have been erected at a number of junctions.  It seems that candidates from all parties and none have chosen to advertise themselves in dangerous locations.  I hope the people in question will take on board my suggestion that they should remove from junctions posters which impede the vision of those who try to drive through such areas.  There is no need to put posters in those locations.  It is sad that people are creating accident black spots by behaving in such a manner.</P>
        <P>I hope I have not omitted to mention anyone who helped me or co-operated with me over the past five years.  I thank all such people sincerely.  I hope those who seek re-election to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad are successful over the next few months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>While elections are essential if democracy is to flourish, they can endanger the health of the economy.  I remind the electorate to judge carefully those politicians who act in a reckless manner at election time.  Senator Brian Hayes correctly stated earlier that our democracy has flourished for 80 years.  Our economy has not flourished for 80 years, however.  It has been seriously impaired at certain times.  Such problems have sometimes developed following election campaigns during which reckless promises were made.  The way of life we had before those elections was damaged because politicians promised things we could not afford or because they settled for less than we deserved.  I urge the electorate to be careful when voting.  People should take into account this country&rsquo;s economic success over the past 20 years.  They should ensure it is not damaged.</P>
        <P>Some Senators have spoken today as if this will be the last meeting of the current Seanad.  I do not believe that is the case.  The House will meet again in the event of any of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees being elected to the D&aacute;il, as I understand it, because new Senators will be appointed in such circumstances.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will wait until that date to thank those who have helped me over the past five years.  I bid farewell to those who may be in the House for their last time, as they are about to be elected to the other House.  Those who do not intend to contest the Seanad election will probably be present in the Chamber the next time the House meets.  The work of this House has benefitted from the input that has been made by its Members.  I wish those contesting the forthcoming election well.</P>
        <P>I would like to express my appreciation for the decision to take No. 5<i>a</i> today.  Senator Dardis mentioned that our democracy is evolving, as is the way we run the business of this House.  Such evolution has taken place, and this House is not the same place established in 1937.  It is subject to change, and we can guide that.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has referred to promises and efforts made by various Members to reform the Seanad.  I believe that it will happen in the near future, and I look forward to seeing a very healthy Seanad flourish over the coming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Quinn&rsquo;s sentiments in his message to the electorate, which he put better than I could.  He is a man of great business acumen, and if his call is heeded, we will ensure that this economy&rsquo;s success continues for many decades.</P>
        <P>I will also refer to Senator Norris&rsquo;s remarks that in some way the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address to the joint sitting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords might bring some political advantage at home.  I very much doubt that, since so many domestic issues will arise in the course of the campaign that they will provide the primary focus for the electorate.  However, if the Senator is right and there is an electoral gain, no one deserves that more than the Taoiseach.  During my ten years in these Houses, like many other Members, I have been very impressed by his absolute commitment to engaging with all sides in Northern Ireland to safeguard the peace process and ensure that the rapprochement between the two parts of the island was put on a firm footing.  In the lead-up to the Good Friday Agreement, a time of personal difficulty, he regarded those objectives so highly that he placed their attainment above the trauma of the death of his mother.</P>
        <P>All sides of the House, and everyone of goodwill, will applaud the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s recognition of that.  The good relations that now exist between the two islands are very much vested in the personalities of Deputy Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair.  If I have a regret, it is that the Oireachtas has not acted on recommendations contained in reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights regarding certain atrocities, particularly those involving collusion <Col N="2164"/>on the part of the British security forces.  I hope that when the incoming D&aacute;il and Seanad are in place, those recommendations will be acted on and pursued.  We owe that to the victims but also to ourselves and to our country&rsquo;s sovereignty.</P>
        <P>I concur with Members&rsquo; comments thanking the Cathaoirleach, his predecessor, the Leader, the Deputy Leader, the Whip and Deputy Whip, the Clerk of the Seanad and all their staff for the tremendous contribution that they have made to the success of this outgoing Seanad.  I wish all my colleagues a safe and successful election campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was very disturbing to learn today that several garda&iacute; have been subject to Internet death threats from some of the many gangland figures currently active.  The security of those men and women should be of paramount importance to us, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, must ensure that they who have rendered such service to the State and its institutions be accorded every necessary protection.</P>
        <P>I join my colleagues in wishing the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach well.  They have carried out their duties in an exemplary manner.  I would also like to thank the Leader, her staff, the officials, Deirdre Lane and Jody Blake, and their staff, for their co-operation over the last five years.  I thank Senator Moylan, the Government Whip, and his secretary.  It was always a pleasure doing business with them, and we were pleased to assist in any way possible.  I wish all those leaving us a happy retirement and those seeking election every success.</P>

	<P>Is mian liom aont&uacute; leis na cainteoir&iacute; eile agus a r&aacute; gur on&oacute;ir iontach &eacute; a bheith p&aacute;irteach sa Seanad.

        <P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas &oacute; chro&iacute; le gach uile dhuine, toisc go raibh an taith&iacute; phearsanta sin agam.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin leis an gCathaoirleach agus an Leas-Chathaoirleach, an Ceannaire, na cl&eacute;irigh, an fhoireann, agus gach &eacute;inne eile a chabhraigh linn anseo.  Go minic, bh&iacute;odar sa ch&uacute;lra, ach ag an am gc&eacute;anna, thugadar an-taca&iacute;ocht d&uacute;inn.</P>
        <P>I wish to paraphrase that great dictum of Charles J. Kickham that it was an honour to serve, not just for the honour of the little village, as he would have put it, but also for the honour of a great nation.  I think we all felt that in this House, that we were participating in a most auspicious way in momentous events.</P>
        <P>I felt a great surge of pride in the House when I realised what great tolerance and patience existed among my colleagues when I expressed views <Col N="2165"/>they did not hold.  I felt quite comfortable in doing that.  I felt I was participating in an exercise in democracy and that in some ways we were a legislative watershed where one could express one&rsquo;s views.  I do not just mean between the political parties but within our own parties as well.  At times I said things that were somewhat off the mainstream view but I always felt it was important to speak because, ultimately, it is the only way for democratic focus to work.</P>
        <P>There must be a great sense of pride that we saw so many momentous events taking place while we were in this House.  In our own way we were participating proactively in those developments as well.  We will have time for greater reflection later to see how we availed of the opportunities which came when those momentous events were being discussed.  Perhaps one of the prevailing memories for me of this session of the Seanad was that we saw a new order come into existence in Northern Ireland.  I know each Member will recall the number of starts and difficulties we had.</P>
        <P>We have had many opportunities for praising the people who participated in that regard.  The Taoiseach has already been mentioned.  We should remember everybody who played a role.  We should acknowledge within our own ranks Senators Mansergh and Maurice Hayes for their contributions.  Had I had a wish list for when we came to the conclusion of the Seanad, it would have been to have had what we now have.  I recall that when Dr. Paisley was successful in becoming the leader of the majority Unionist party in Northern Ireland, I expressed satisfaction that he did that as a democrat and that his leadership was the result of a democratic process.  That is the way we must approach it.</P>
        <P>I know how proud the nation will be &mdash; I do not just mean the nation on the territory of Ireland, but the Irish diaspora and all friends of Ireland &mdash; when a number of events take place, the 8 May perhaps being the most important one of all.  We have had an opportunity to express our views on that so often.  The fact the Taoiseach will meet Dr. Paisley on the Battle of the Boyne site is unique, but nothing is more historic than the fact the Taoiseach has been invited to address both Houses of Parliament in Britain.  This is so historic that not even the greatest optimist would have considered it possible a few years ago.  These are some of the memories I will bring with me from the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I was always pleased that even though we were successful as a nation, we never forgot other countries that were experiencing difficulty.  We always wanted to be part of the resolution they were seeking.  I remain hopeful that a resolution will be found to what happened in Iraq and to what is happening in the Middle East and other similar regions.  We are a global village and if we do not find a resolution to these difficulties, we too will suffer.</P><Col N="2166"/>

      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>When I offered to speak, I thought this was the last day on which the Seanad would meet.  As somebody in transition, it is appropriate that I inform the House I will not be seeking re-election to the Seanad.  I thank the Leader, Acting Leader, Chief Whip and Assistant Whip, the Leader of the Opposition and leaders of the other parties for a most interesting, stimulating and effective exchange of views during the past ten years.  I also thank the Clerk to the Seanad and her staff for the courtesy afforded to me and my colleagues at all times.</P>
        <P>I have found the past ten years a most enjoyable and, on occasion, challenging experience.  I served as spokesperson to the current Leader of the House when she was Minister for Public Enterprise and other portfolios, and I served under successive Ministers with responsibility for education.  Prior to my election to the D&aacute;il in 1981, I was a teacher.  I believe current debates on education are equally as challenging as when I served as deputy spokesperson on education during the 1980s.  Time evolves, complexities emerge and nothing is ever simple.</P>
        <P>My journey is an unknown one; it is transitionary.  I wish those Senators not seeking re-election to the Seanad every success in the challenges they have set forth for themselves.  I wish those who, like me, do not know where they are going, every success.  I wish all Members seeking re-election a safe journey.  That is most important.  I also wish them every success and look forward to having an opportunity to vote for them in the forthcoming Seanad election.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether I am on the right or wrong side of the House.  When a person is in transition, an odd mistake is usually overlooked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  I wish to add my voice to those who spoke before me in thanking the Leas-Chathaoirleach, whom I have known for many years, the Cathaoirleach and all those Senators who are retiring, including Senator Dardis.  I wish Senator Dardis, who is a great friend, the very best.  He has been an accomplished Deputy Leader of the Seanad.  I thank the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who has done an excellent job along with my colleague in the Whips&rsquo; office, Senator Moylan.</P>
        <P>I wish my colleagues on the other side of the House every success.  I wish Senator Henry, with whom I have had many conversations as Government spokesperson on health and children, the very best.  Given my background and Senator Henry&rsquo;s interest in the area of health, it is axiomatic that we would have regular contact in that regard.  I also wish the very best to Senator Bohan who is retiring having played a pivotal role in this <Col N="2167"/>House for 20 years.  I regret Senator Fitzgerald, a friend and colleague, will not seek re-election to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I wish the very best to those seeking election to the Upper or Lower House.  One of the highlights of my membership of this House has been during recent years in terms of the peace process.  It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to all the parties represented in this House in regard to the manner in which the national question was dealt with.  Members of the Opposition did not seek to make political gain out of their position as members of the Opposition.  The common denominator of getting it right in terms of getting peace in Northern Ireland was to the forefront at all times.  I agree with Senator Jim Walsh in regard to the Taoiseach addressing the Houses of Parliament on the other side of the water.  It reflects a true recognition of the statesmanship of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
        <P>In regard to the reform of the Seanad, I suppose I am a little old-fashioned in certain respects.  As somebody who was elected by elected members of county and city councils, I believe their role in electing 43 Members to this House should continue.  I am aware there is not unanimity on this in the House.  The role played by local authority members is often understated.  I compliment a number of Members of this House who decried the adverse remarks made in at least one national newspaper about the role of councillors.  They do not get half the recognition they deserve.</P>
        <P>I wish everybody the best.  I agree with Senator Maurice Cummins in regard to the plans of certain very unsavoury elements in society who are targeting members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a very worrying development and must be dealt with by an dorn iarainn, the iron fist.  I wish everybody well and thank the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy to me as a Member of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody seems to think this is the last day on which the Seanad will meet.  I believe we will be back for at least one day after the D&aacute;il general election and before the Seanad general election.  Lest we are not, I want to place on the record my belief that serving in this House is one of the greatest honours that can be bestowed on any Irish person.  To have served here for 20 years is a very great privilege.  I served with some amazing people.  I cannot remember them all but there were former Senators Mick Lanigan, Willie Ryan, Paddy McGowan, Charlie McDonald, Michael Howard, Jackie Daly, John Magner, Gordon Wilson, John Robb, Tras Honan, Brian Friel, Sean Fallon, Se&aacute;n Doherty and Des Hanafin.  They were an amazing bunch of people, if one looks at their contributions over the years.  Some of the current Senators, such as Senators Feargal Quinn and Shane Ross, are also amazing people.  It is a great privilege to be here.  We do not always agree, but there is not the same <Col N="2168"/>rancour there is in the Lower House.  We respect the opinions of others even though they may differ from our own.</P>
        <P>The next Seanad will be different in one respect in particular.  We will see for the first time at least three Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  I hope they will be welcomed as they walk the path of democracy rather than adopting other means as in the past.  They should be welcomed in the same way as we expect them to be welcomed to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
        <P>During the 20 years I have been here I have experienced nothing but courtesy, kindness and co-operation from all of the staff.  From the various Leaders and Whips of my party and the other party in Government I have also experienced nothing other than courtesy.  I reiterate that the greatest honour that can be bestowed on any person is to serve as a Member of the Upper House, Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not intended to speak as I hoped to take the opportunity to do so when the Seanad meets again.  In case we are not back together as a group, however, I take this opportunity to thank everyone for their co-operation with me as a Senator.  I love being a Senator and reflecting the views of the people in a democracy and of the councillors who put me here.  I am pleased to have helped in any way I could in the Seanad and if I clashed with anyone, it was only in the moment.  When the clash was over, we were back to being great friends again.  That is what I love about our Parliament.  There is no animosity or continuity of ill feeling, which is very important to me as an elected representative and a parliamentary colleague.  I have always behaved as a colleague.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to thank the Leader and her deputy, Senator Dardis, for his co-operation on the many occasions on which I had to work with him, especially at the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  It was a pleasure to work closely with the Senator when issues arose.  I thank Senator Brian Hayes who I knew in another chamber and wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
        <P>I wish everybody well in their endeavours to be re-elected.  All of us want to come back because we love what we do.  We would not be here unless we loved it.  We are natural politicians.  I wish the public at large would respect us for the work we do and the time we put into it.  Such respect is not reflected by the media which should praise us for the work we do rather than to adopt the current sinister approach to the portrayal of our lives.  All of us do a very good job as politicians which I wish to see continued in the next Seanad.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Ms Deirdre Lane and Ms Jody Blake for their co-operation over the years.  I hope I am back to work with them in the next Seanad.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment those Senators who are going for election and will hopefully be returned to the D&aacute;il.  Having served in the D&aacute;il and several Departments, I have come to the Oireachtas in many shades but found it a wonderful experience to be in the Seanad for the past five years.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who set a trend and placed a stamp of authority on the House from the day she came in.  Her vast knowledge of politics over many years added a great deal to the work of the Chamber.  I had the good fortune to bring a Private Members&rsquo; Bill &mdash; the Registration of Wills Bill 2005 &mdash; through the House which would not have been brought forward were it not for the support and encouragement of the Leader.  It is difficult on this side of the House to have a Private Members&rsquo; Bill passed on Government time, but that is what I achieved.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the House will sit after 14 June as a stamp duty Bill is likely to be brought before the House, presumably under a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration.  Hopefully we will be with the Progressive Democrats again as they have been very good partners with us over the last ten years.  Senator Dardis has been a very effective deputy leader of the House.  The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, has been exemplary and I am delighted he was named Senator of the year, which he deserved.  It takes a great deal of effort and work to attend at every sitting and have an issue to raise.  I acknowledge also the contributions of the leaders of the Labour and Independent groups who will be back here after the June election, joined by the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>The Chamber has received increased recognition through the work of all its Members over the last five years.  However, we have one tragic regret which is that Senator Kate Walsh has left us.  Her seat will never be filled again.  I did not get a chance to pay tribute to her when sympathies were expressed formally, but I note now that I never came across such a lady in politics.  She was a most wonderful person and contributed a great deal from her humanity to the House.  The Progressive Democrats were most fortunate that she became a member of their party.</P>
        <P>I wish all Members, whether seeking re-election or not, the very best.  I will not go through the list of those seeking re-election because it may change.  Members who do not intend to seek re-election may change their minds after the general election.</P>

	<P>This has been my first term as a Member of the Seanad.  To be elected to either House of the Oireachtas and to work for one&rsquo;s country is a tremendous honour.</P>
        <P>I thank Mr. Eamonn McCormack, Ms Deirdre Lane and Ms Jody Blake.  I also thank Captain Flaherty and his staff who give Members world class back-up, and the recording staff, who come into the Chamber discreetly and put our words, <Col N="2170"/>which are sometimes profound and sometimes more simple, into history.  I thank everyone who contributed to the work of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>We saw recently how French people living abroad may vote either by appointing a proxy or at French consulates throughout the world.  Hundreds of thousands of people born in Ireland were forced to leave home to seek employment.  I ask that they be allowed to vote in future elections.  France has a population of more than 60 million and ours is just over 4 million.  It must be possible for us to follow the exemplary example of France and organise a similar system of voting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall not list every Member who spoke because a common theme ran through all contributions.  All contributors remarked that the House has worked hard, and I thank those who expressed good wishes.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan was, as he usually is, correct to point out my omission.  Second Stage of No. 4 will conclude at 7 p.m.  Senator Terry inquired about the Green Paper on pensions.  It has been completed and is under consideration by the Cabinet.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in a reply to a parliamentary question last week, said he expected that the Green Paper which will address the issues raised, will be finalised by the end of April and published thereafter.  I acknowledge Senator Terry&rsquo;s consistent interest in this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan asked what judicial appointments, if any, have been made.  Legislation allowing for the appointment of additional judges was passed recently but it takes some time to process judicial appointments.  I note Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s interest in all matters legal.</P>
        <P>We have had a very interesting Order of Business and a broad range of contributions.  I will not refer to individual contributions but I thank everyone.  I came into the Seanad a bruised spirit and I leave it full of ebullience.  Nevertheless, I hope I shall not be back.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment to section 9(3)(<i>a</i>),<i></i>which provides for <Col N="2172"/>a substitute provision for section 7(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.   It relates to enhanced compensation where an employee takes a successful unfair dismissals case following the issuing of a Labour Court opinion that the dismissal was one of a number of dismissals, including in exceptional collective redundancy.  This amendment is necessary because it clarifies that the employer is responsible for payment of any enhanced compensation awarded under the amended section 7(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, as is the position under the present Act in regard to compensation awards.  The amendment is necessary also to provide that the concluding phrase of section 7(1) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 would apply also to the enhanced compensation provision in the amended section 7(1)(<i>c</i>) of that Act, in the same way as the phrase applies currently to compensation provisions under that Act.  This concluding phrase provides that where there is a reference to the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in the provision of redress for unfair dismissal, these references will be understood to be references to the new owner in a change of ownership case.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 4 does not change the sense but reflects exactly what was agreed in paragraph 18(3) in Towards 2016.  I introduced it in the D&aacute;il, having had discussions with ICTU on its concerns that it was better to reflect exactly what was decided.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 7 provides that for the avoidance of doubt, the flexibility of the provisions of section 6 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 to the type of dismissals situations described in the new section 5(2)(<i>a</i>)<i></i>of that Act is not affected by the provisions of this new section.  In other words, section 6 continues to apply to circumstances in which all the employees involved in a strike or industrial dispute are dismissed.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 provided that, generally, a dismissal shall be deemed to be unfair unless an employer can prove there were substantial grounds justifying it.  The section also outlines certain criteria on which dismissals may be adjudicated as either fair or <Col N="2173"/>unfair.  In addition, it describes certain dismissal circumstances that are automatically deemed to be unfair.  This is covered by amendment No. 7.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 8 clarifies that the specific criteria listed in paragraphs (i) to (iv) of the new section 5(2A) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, on which the fairness or otherwise of dismissals can be adjudicated, apply only to circumstances where all the employees involved in a strike or industrial dispute are dismissed.</P>

I have dealt with several Bills in this House over the past two and half years and really appreciate that Members have taken the time to consider the relevant issues.  I suspect I have accepted more amendments in the Seanad than any other Minister, certainly on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  I have been very pleased to take on board ideas in which Members invested some thought and consideration.  The legislation we have passed is all the better for the input of the Seanad.  I cannot offer to reciprocate Members&rsquo; help until I find out whether I will have a vote in the forthcoming Seanad election.  I certainly hope so.</P>
        <P>I wish Senator Dardis well if he is not contesting the election.  We worked closely together on a number of committees.  I have worked at committee level with all Members present on occasion.  People outside the Houses do not realise that when we get over the election issues and do mainstream political work on their behalf, there is much co-operation across party lines.  Most of us are sufficiently open-minded to accept that very good ideas come from Members with whom we do not consider ourselves aligned politically, thus benefiting legislation and policy.  I wish all the Members well and thank them for their co-operation. I thank my staff in the Department who have put considerable work into this very difficult Bill and several others.  I am pleased to have got this Bill through the House before the end of the term of the current Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.

        <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping of amendments which I understand Senators have received.

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call the Minister to speak on the subject matter of the first group of amendments which are technical or drafting in nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sincerely pleased to be here today to report on the amendments made to the Water Services Bill.  This legislation is important and historic in many ways not only because it is likely to be one of the last major Bills to go through the Oireachtas in its current mode but, more to the point, it deals with the law on water services over a long period and updates it.  </P>
        <P>Some considerable time has elapsed since the Bill was passed in this House in July 2004.  This lapse was necessitated by the unforeseen requirements to address complex and technical issues which came to light in the interim and on which I will elaborate later.</P>
        <P>The extended passage of time has, however, afforded me the opportunity to review the Bill in detail and to address issues raised by Members in both Houses during the course of the earlier debates.  Senators may recall that two key issues, in particular, raised during the previous debate in the House were concerns, first, that the Bill could facilitate privatisation and, second, a general unease with proposals about the making of water services strategic plans.  These originally were intended to be executive functions rather than functions reserved to elected members of the water services authority.  Both have now been dealt with in an unequivocal manner with new provisions inserted to ensure against privatisation of water services infrastructures, which is an important set of provisions, and provisions on strategic planning have been revised to give responsibility for the making of such plans to the elected members, in the first instance, such that they become functions reserved to councillors.</P>
        <P>Concerns, which were never well based, that the Bill might be a mechanism for the introduction through the back door of domestic charges have been also addressed with the insertion of a new section 105 to provide for another absolute prohibition on charging for domestic water services.  This is the second absolute prohibition in domestic law to provide for that.</P>
        <P>A new section 97 provides essential powers for local authorities to lay water pipes across land for the purpose of providing water services.  Three additional new sections were also added for technical purposes to update the cross-reference to the Water Supplies Act 1942, the Planning and Development Act 2000, and the Local Government Act 2001 to ensure synchronisation of the <Col N="2176"/>new Act and in the case of the 2001 Act to update cross-references generally to other legislation since its enactment.</P>
        <P>The amendments fall into nine broad groups which I will address.  If Senators have queries on amendments not specifically referred to, I will be glad to elaborate on them.</P>
        <P>Turning to the technical amendments, the first group, while a significant number of them have been made to the Bill, almost three quarters of them &mdash; more than 170 &mdash; are of a technical or drafting nature, for example, to correct syntax errors, to correct or update cross-references, to update definitions for greater clarity or to align wording generally with the current drafting practice.  Typical examples are amendments Nos. 6 and 8 which update the definition of agriculture and distribution system to provide greater clarity.  Amendment No. 7 inserts a new definition of aquaculture.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 improve the definition of the term &ldquo;source&rdquo;.  Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 48 are drafting in nature to update the collective citation of the Companies Act.  Amendment No. 34 removes the reference to the now spent drinking water directive 80/778/EC and inserts references to two additional directives in section 5 of the nitrates directive and the EU directive on measuring instruments.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 77 to 80, inclusive, and amendment No. 137 update sections 32 and 58 of the Bill to ensure the complete transposition of the EU drinking water directive.  These arose from internal discussions between officials of the Department and the European Commission to ensure compliance of the Irish legislative code with the directive.</P>
        <P>A large number of the amendments, commencing with amendment No. 35 to section 6, were technical drafting amendments to replace each usage in the Bill of the words &ldquo;guilty of an offence&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;commits an offence&rdquo; to reflect latest drafting practice.  A large group of 16 similar amendments, commencing with amendment No. 41 to section 9, change the existing format of the numbers affected from words to numerals in the text.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 141 brings greater clarity to section 60, removing a loophole from previous wording.  The duty of care that requires authorised water service providers to maintain waste water works in good order could have been undermined if the provider in question was not a properly licensed authority.  The current improved wording applies that duty instead to persons in charge of such waste water works.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 233 and 234 update the Long Title in the light of various additions inserted in the Bill and provide that one of its purposes is &ldquo;in the interests of the common good&rdquo;.  Such additional provision will provide the courts with a reference point for their interpretation of the Act.</P><Col N="2177"/>
        <P>I could continue with examples but I have indicated in my contribution the technical nature of many of the amendments.  Many of them came from Opposition suggestions and make significant improvements to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House, although I am sure he would prefer to be elsewhere.  As the Minister has stated, the vast majority of these amendments are technical or drafting in nature and have been approved in the other House, with many tabled by colleagues.  We fully support the amendments in the group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The second group of amendments deals with offences and penalties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This group deals with the changes to offences and penalty provisions.  Penalty provisions under the Bill have been updated to align them with the latest drafting practice and a number of new offences have been created.  I will outline the background and then deal with some of the offences in question.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 38 was inserted on the advice of the Attorney General to categorise the penalty provisions in the Bill in line with the latest drafting practice norms across environmental legislative codes.  In tandem with this, amendment No. 56 inserted a new provision replacing the existing section 28, an assignment of additional functions which provides for the general authority to seek enforcement by High Court injunction against any person who is in breach of the Act and who is causing a risk to human health or the environment.  The combination of the higher penalties and the recourse to court injunction is regarded by the Attorney General as a preferable enforcement regime to daily fines.  Members will agree that this is a significant improvement over simple daily fines which, by their nature, would be relatively small.</P>
        <P>Similar updating provisions were inserted into the Water Pollution Acts 1977 and 1990 and the water pollution-related provisions of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 by amendments to sections 107 and 108 of the Bill in amendments Nos. 226 and 227.  These will bring penalty provisions in the water pollution and water services areas fully into line and ensure their alignment with penalties in the broader environmental code, something Senators will appreciate.  Environmental crime must be dealt with severely.</P>
        <P>Turning to the offence provisions, amendment No. 64 inserted an additional provision into section 30(7), designating it an offence not to comply with a compliance notice issued by the Minister against a water service authority which is not in compliance with prescribed performance standards or which is not carrying out its duties in a satisfactory manner.  It is important that everybody abides by the law, including public authorities.  Failure by a group water scheme, for example, to comply with the requirement of a <Col N="2178"/>supervising water services authority, is designated an offence under the licensing provisions in Part 6.  I consider it appropriate that a similar failure of the water service authority to comply with a requirement of the supervisory authority, in this case, the Minister, should be similarly designated an offence.  In other words, if it is an offence for a group water scheme to behave in one way, it should equally be an offence if a local authority misbehaves in like manner.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 65 inserted a new subsection 30(10) to designate as an offence the failure of any person from whom the Minister seeks information or data, as per section 30(4)(<i>k</i>), to provide such information.  It is astonishing that as matters stand, the Minister has limited powers to direct or even to find information and this is intolerable.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 135 inserts additional subsections in section 56 relating to the conservation of water.  It gives the Minister regulation-making powers concerning recycling of water, including storm and rainwater, and provides for the introduction of hosepipe bans and other restrictions designed to conserve water supplies during periods of drought, such as restrictions on the use of water for swimming pools, car washes, etc.   A related regime of fixed penalty notices, or on-the-spot fines as they are commonly called, is introduced for those who breach such restrictions.  This will ensure the proper controls are applied during times of water scarcity.  At the moment, drought orders simply cannot be enforced, so we have an enforcement provision as well as an on-the-spot fine provision, which is prudent and sensible.  I recommend all the amendments to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am intrigued concerning amendment No. 135, although I am not in confrontational humour.  I am curious to know whether prior to the insertion of amendment No. 135 there was no clear power to prohibit all these things.  That is the only question I have.  One always assumed that in a time of water scarcity, local authorities started by appealing to the public but could then instruct.  One of the wonderful things about politics is that one learns something new all the time.  I am not the Labour Party spokesman on this issue, and the Minister, if he were in a confrontational mood, could say that shows, but I am glad of this amendment.</P>
        <P>I have a long-standing interest in issues relating to the provision of water.  The only argument I have with the Minister is the fact that there is always a scarcity of water and our philosophy in this regard must ultimately adjust to that.  I do not believe in charging for domestic water, but clean drinking water is a scarce resource.  To mention or not to mention Galway, that is the question.  However, clean water is a scarce resource and, therefore, there is an issue to be addressed concerning conservation.  I welcome the amendment and I confess to being astonished that we did not have it before.  I am not blaming the Minister, but I am surprised.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2179"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I reflect some of the Senator&rsquo;s surprise in this regard.  I had assumed there was a strong legislative base for controlling the abuse of water and I could not agree with him more.  Water is not something that is free.  It should be cherished and protected as a very important resource.  The Senator&rsquo;s reference to Galway is apposite and I do not mind it because it illustrates the lacunae that existed.  As Minister, I could not, for example, send water tankers into an estate in Galway, even though I believed it was the right thing to do.  I have offered three times.  The Senator is quite right.  Some surprising omissions have existed in the law over many years.  This is a very important Bill because it deals with a number of lacunae that exist and provides an appropriate legislative basis for the future.  I was certainly of the view that hosepipe bans and drought orders could be enforced.  They cannot and it is only until this Bill is passed that they can be introduced.  It is appropriate that the Bill is passed for this purpose alone.  I thank both Senators for their support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The third group of amendments relates to pipe installation and taking in charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Several amendments were designed to ensure that sufficient powers to undertake the essential function of installing or taking in charge of pipes and related water services infrastructure were made available under the Bill.  Amendment No. 207 to section 95 enables a water services authority to regularise the status of private water supply pipes or wastewater collection pipes where their ownership cannot be readily ascertained after reasonable inquiry and at its discretion to take them in charge.  The amendment will have particular application to the group water services scheme sector which has many instances of older schemes, established by trustees such as parish priests and other members of the local community, who have moved on or passed on.  For these, there is no record or evidence as to continuing ownership or control.  Such difficulties put these schemes in limbo.  The legislation will provide a means to overcoming this difficulty.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 209 inserted a new section 94 to enable a water services authority to obtain consent to lay cables, water pipelines and ancillary fixtures over private lands.  The new section updates 19th century Public Health Acts provisions and enables a water services authority to refer the matter to the Circuit Court for determination where consent is deemed to be withheld.  Any related compensation for landowners will be assessed in accordance with standard provisions under the Planning and Development Acts, thus ensuring uniformity in approach across the various legislative headings.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 98 inserts additional provisions into section 42 to enable a water services authority to install connecting pipes on behalf of <Col N="2180"/>premises-owners where access is required across neighbouring privately-owned land.  This is necessary to prevent delays in connecting water services and will ensure against exorbitant ransoms being charged for connection across neighbouring lands to gain access to a connection.  Such additional costs inevitably get passed on to consumers and artificially drive up development costs.</P>
        <P>Under amendment No. 91, section 41 is amended to provide that where a person claims an interest in or under a road, it will be a matter for that person to prove his or her interest as so claimed.  The value of any such interest will be claimed to be nil unless it can be shown to be otherwise by the person making the claim.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 108 provides for the extension of powers relating to the renewal and maintenance of a connection running under a road provided for in section 43(9) to the installation of a connection in the first place to obtaining the consent of the relevant road authorities.  Amendment No. 89 provides for public notification regarding works on the laying on or under a road.  Amendment No. 110 sets out the procedures for taking in charge of a connection by a water services authority.  Amendment No. 109 provides for the avoidance of doubt that a connection, once taken in charge by a water services authority, will become the sole responsibility of the authority.  Amendment No. 206 updates cross-reference to the new section 98.  Amendment No. 208 shortens and simplifies the wording of section 96.  Amendment No. 51 clarifies provisions for services of notices under section 19 where the name of a person to whom the notice is directed cannot be ascertained.</P>
        <P>These amendments will ensure an effective and balanced package of powers is available under the Bill to underpin the installation of water services infrastructure while protecting the rights of individual landowners affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The area of group water schemes requires clarity which this legislation provides.  I support these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support these long overdue amendments.  I have a holiday home in a very beautiful part of the country and there are many others around it.  It has been suggested that if someone ever excavated some of the fields in the vicinity, pipes &mdash; some going to livestock but many to holiday and other homes &mdash; might surface which were never approved by anybody.</P>
        <P>Water is inherently a scarce resource.  There is only a question of relative scarcity.  If the glorious weather in April is a prelude to a glorious summer of three or four months, the problems we now face will be significantly greater.</P>
        <P>I am glad we are doing this and hope it can be enforced and policed in a reasonably sensible and humane way because, as I keep saying, water is a scarce resource.  There is a sensible debate to be <Col N="2181"/>had which does not necessarily involve going down the British route of privatisation and brutal charging or retaining the <i>status quo</i> where vast quantities of expensively treated water is used to flush our toilets, for instance, when other types of water would do just as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the amendments outlined by the Minister.  Quality water is very important.  Often new connections are sought when there is a problem with an existing source.  Local authorities should be instructed to test the existing source, whether to a farm or a house, to ensure their supply cannot be contaminated.  There have been cases where a new source, when connected, has been polluted by an existing one.  That has caused serious problems for local authorities.  When a new supply is being connected, the existing one should be thoroughly checked.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to existing schemes.  Certain members of a scheme may not want it to be taken over.  If two thirds of the board agree, it can be taken in charge and properly looked after.  I have no doubt that those in the local authority are the best people to look after the source.  There are many group schemes, particularly in rural areas, which have worked well but there is a high risk.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan commented on the situation in Galway.  If one has a holiday home or a mobile home in Galway, one faces a risk with the water source.  I reckon that in many cases local authorities have know about problems with, or risks to, water and have stood back from them and not dealt with the people causing the problems.  A problem then blows up leaving it quite late to try to rectify it.  If people sought funding and took the initial steps to rectify the problems in time, many of them could be alleviated.  I welcome the Bill and the amendments the Minister outlined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that all debates were so well focused, for which I thank the Senators.  Senator Ryan had a specific query with regard to water services and pipes.  I agree with him on this matter.  As domestic pipes in urban areas were laid in the 19th century, local authorities do not have a clue as to their location.  Section 49 deals specifically with this point in that it provides that local authorities, in due course, must make a proper mapping of all pipes.  One of the critical issues to be addressed is that of water leaking from pipes, which also increases the risk of contamination of the supply.  The mapping of pipes is a <i>sine qua non</i>.  By way of illustration of the significance of that problem, when we were in Galway discussing taking water from Tuam into Galway, I was amazed to be informed by officials that up to 70% of the water going through the piping system in Tuam town was being lost through wastage.  We have provided &euro;240 million which has been set aside to deal with this problem of leakage.  Dublin City Council is doing an amaz<Col N="2182"/>ing job and ten contractors will re-pipe 240 km over the course of this summer and later this year.  I wish them well because it is necessary.</P>

        <P>On the issue of polluted water, which was referred to by my colleague, the local authority will have the power under section 59 to order closure of a polluted source until the problem is fixed.  This Bill is timely, coming as it does on top of the Galway issue.  It is a consistent response to all the problems that have presented themselves, and it is a Bill that has been much improved by the debate in both Houses.  I have incorporated a significant number of amendments from all sides of the House.  The wisdom and experience that exists in both Houses have been brought to bear on the Bill.  I am grateful for the Senators&rsquo; comments.</P>

	<P>Group 4 amendments deal with privatisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Ryan&rsquo;s aversion to the concept of privatising water.  If there was ever one innovation in public administration that was introduced in our nearest island and which we should never emulate, it is privatisation of water supplies because it has been a disaster.  I was happy, therefore, to accept amendment No. 55 on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il which inserted an additional provision in section 27 to provide that any function of the Minister or of a water services authority under the Bill may only be transferred to another party provided that democratic accountability for the function concerned is maintained.</P>
        <P>I also moved amendment No. 86 to provide that, notwithstanding the contracting out of particular water services to a third party under section 40, the contracting water services authority to whose benefit the service is being provided will still retain responsibility under this Act for ensuring it complies with our requirements.  The purpose of this amendment was to put beyond any doubt that the introduction of a DBO arrangement for the delivery of water services on behalf of a water services authority could enable the water service in question to be privatised, in other words, to prevent the DBO system becoming a way for local authorities to wash their hands of their responsibilities and move away from it.</P>
        <P>Those of us who served on local authorities have all had experience of what happened when waste management was privatised and how officials in some councils were very anxious to get rid of something.  Councillors did not knowingly consent to this happening, but it will not happen now.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 70 was inserted into section 31 on Report Stage to prohibit a local authority <Col N="2183"/>from entering into any agreement which would allow the transfer of the assets of a water services authority or infrastructure into private hands.  This further strengthens the Government&rsquo;s commitment to retaining the provision of water services in the local government sector and the Bill is now fully proofed against privatisation of water services.  Any proposal relating to privatisation would have to be provided for under further legislation and it is a concept to which the Government and I are vigorously opposed.  A bad mistake was made on our neighbouring island and we should never follow that route.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister regarding privatisation.  There should be no question of privatising water supplies.</P>
        <P>On the matter of leaks in the system, when I first became a member of a local authority in Waterford more than 25 years ago, the council encouraged many of the people who had previously worked on the water supply to return and provide assistance.  These individuals, who had retired from work, knew the exact locations of pipes, etc.  This was probably the greatest thing we ever did because Waterford city now has the best water supply in the country.  As a result of the expertise and experience of those to whom I refer, who provided advice to the council&rsquo;s officials and engineers, we were able to map the system properly and reduce obvious wastage.  I am glad that provisions relating to the public ownership of supplies are contained in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will probably test the indulgence of the Leas-Chathaoirleach but in light of the vigour of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to not privatising water supplies, I wish to urge the Minister to persuade those who represent it at bodies such as the IMF, the World Bank, etc., to encourage a move away from the crusade for privatising water services in developing countries.  In my view, such a development is as regressive in a poor country as it is in a rich country such as Ireland.  I hope there will be a consistency of public policy on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to inform the Senator that as recently as last year, I argued long and hard at a UN session about the criminal folly of the idea that some of the largest corporations in the world might provide water or waste water treatment services out of the goodness of their hearts to the people of the developing world.  I pointed out &mdash; a Kenyan minister who was present was extremely interested in what I had to say &mdash; that the best model I had ever seen of communities taking charge of this resource was that which relates to the Irish group water system.  This is an idea that we could and should export.  I stated at the conference to which I refer that in Ireland people have ownership of the resource <Col N="2184"/>and that relatively simple systems have been put in place.</P>
        <P>Countries such as Ireland that are making development contributions could contribute in this regard.  I agree with Senator Ryan that one thing is certain, namely, that if the mega-operators establish operations in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing nations, the water systems will work while they are present but six months after they leave their complex technologies behind they will begin to break down.  The people will be worse off as a result because not only will they not have water, they will also be burdened with debt.  I agree with the Senator that there should be a consistency in our approach to this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister and Senator Cummins regarding schemes, pipework and leaks.  The metering of all supplies on the part of local authorities is a welcome development.  Local authority officials will be in a position to check the amount of water being used, even if there is no charge in respect of supplies.  The more meters that are put in place, whether on farms or in private houses, the more the situation relating to abuse and leaks will improve.  The point has been made that some developers are getting away with murder by connecting 20 or 30 apartments or houses to a single meter that comes from the mains supply.  The apartments or houses in question are not being individually metered.  It is difficult for local authorities to find and penalise the developer abusing the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the amendments the Minister made in the D&aacute;il.  I would like to comment on a few aspects of this debate.  The Minister rightly stated that water should always be a public utility rather than being in private hands.  He correctly pointed out some of the excesses which have marked the behaviour of private companies in Great Britain.  I would like to make one or two small points which are relevant to this group of amendments and some of the other amendments.</P>
        <P>Senator Moylan spoke about metering.  Since I got married, I have paid for the water used on my farmyard and in my house.  It has been measured by a meter.  While I do not object to paying for water, I do not like doing it because I am aware that many people get water for free.  I understand why it should be metered.  A person who owns a cattle shed that requires a great deal of water is the same as a person running a business in any other industry and probably should be treated in the same way.  Such people should not engage in special pleading.</P>
        <P>As I said recently when responding to remarks made on the Order of Business about problems with the water supply in the west, I am concerned that senior local authority officials frequently see bodies of water such as lakes not only as sources of water but also as repositories for waste.  Those <Col N="2185"/>two approaches are basically inconsistent.  Like other Members of the House, I have a holiday home.  The water supply to my holiday home, which is near Oughterard and Lough Corrib, is perfect.  There is no difficulty with it because it does not come from Lough Corrib.  Something must be done about the public sewerage system in Oughterard because it is polluting Lough Corrib.  It was not designed to cater for the large number of houses it must deal with.</P>
        <P>The Minister rightly reminded the House that great work is being done to reduce the amount of water leaked from the Victorian system used in Dublin.  The system is losing approximately 30% of its water through leaks.  A great deal of work is being done.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the ability of the River Liffey to meet the demand for water in Dublin, which is increasing as more developments are sanctioned.  As someone who grew up near the river, I have noticed the decrease in its water level.  When I was a member of a local authority, a report on the greater Dublin water supply was produced by G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux.  The section of the report relating to conservation recommended that the pipes system be improved.</P>
        <P>We need to consider alternative sources of water.  I suggested at the time that the River Shannon be considered in that context.  The Leader of the House at the time was opposed to the possibility that anybody might touch Lough Ree, which is a huge impoundment.  Millions of gallons of water could be taken from Lough Ree every day without making much of a difference to the lake&rsquo;s water level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would improve our situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>If it did, it would improve the Shannon down in Banagher for Senator Moylan.  At the time, I was told by senior local authority officials that it would be impossible to take water from Lough Ree to Dublin.  I pointed out that a right of way existed along the route in the form of the Royal Canal.  I suggested that a pipe be laid along the canal and reminded the officials that it would not be necessary to buy land.  I was told that what I was proposing was technically impossible.  One of the alternative measures suggested in the report produced by G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux was the taking of water from Lough Ree.  It is impossible for the River Liffey to continue to provide the amount of water that it is being asked to supply to Dublin.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the issue of metering.  It is essential that we should know what amount of water is being used.  When I canvassed in one of the most affluent parts of west Dublin during a by-election campaign some years ago, I found it extraordinary that people with three cars, three bathrooms, a jacuzzi, a swimming pool and two dishwashers complained that they might have to pay for water.  Given that the amount of water used in some large houses is 50 times greater than <Col N="2186"/>the amount used in some cottages, it is clear that limits must be imposed in certain circumstances.  In future, it is possible that a local authority waiver scheme will be introduced in this regard.  Perhaps people should have to pay if they use an amount of water that is above the basic level to which everybody is entitled.  Such a system can be put in place only if we provide for a metering system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has jumped a little ahead.  The issue of metering will be dealt with in the fifth group of amendments.  As a basic service, water will continue to be supplied without charge in domestic settings.  Metering is an extremely good way to detect leaks.  A lovely story was told by the president of the Federation of Group Water Schemes about how, when meters were first introduced to a part of the country I will not name, water wastage was greatly reduced.  The simple fact of meters being installed led people to start turning off taps instead of leaving hosepipes running across yards.</P>
        <P>The really beneficial aspect of meters is that they allow one to locate water and leaks, which sometimes can be very difficult to tackle.  When the old men with the sounding pipes went, a great deal of wisdom was lost.  Yesterday I was driving across the country canvassing and came across an elderly man using a sound tap to identify a water leak.  Meters would allow us to dispense with such technology.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I might also mention the issue that Senator Dardis raised, namely, local authorities using water from lakes into which there have been discharges.  I shortly will be making regulations establishing a new authorisation regime covering discharges into waste-water works.  Senators will be aware that in advance of this legislation I granted certain additional powers to the EPA to monitor water sources.  The issue was mentioned in its last report, and we have already acted on it.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased the section on privatisation meets the requirements of all sides of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group five covers supervision and licensing &mdash; amendments Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, 71, 162, 187 and 224.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This group of amendments provides for enhanced supervisory arrangements regarding the provision of water services and the oversight of trade effluent discharges.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 57 to section 59 removes the immunity from proceedings to claim damages arising from the non-performance of a duty under the Act by the Minister, a water services authority or other prosecuted person.  There was some discussion of the matter in the House, and I accept that such a provision could have been considered anomalous and in conflict with existing legislation.  For example, it could have been interpreted as preventing an action to claim damages <Col N="2187"/>arising from the provision of a substandard public water supply because of a failure to carry out duties regarding the management of a treatment plant.  It is clear and obvious that if water is supplied by a local public water authority, that authority has a duty and responsibility to ensure it operates its treatment plants correctly.  Under this section, such authorities would not be immune from having to answer for their failings.  That is only right, and the change represents an improvement.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 58, 59 and 224 are linked and provide that the Minister&rsquo;s supervisory duties under section 30 must be carried out in accordance with the relevant EU directives affecting water services, as well as granting the EPA supervisory responsibility over local authority water supplies.  Such an approach has been already adopted in the interim drinking-water regulations that I made on 8 March pending enactment of the Bill.  I put those amendments through because I was worried the Bill itself might not be passed, depending on the date of the election.  I was most anxious that the EPA, in addition to having the power to measure and monitor, should be also able to prosecute.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the EPA using that power where local authorities have failed, since it is wrong and criminal to leave people at risk by not having a treatment plant or works that comes up to scratch.  Without any specific case in mind, it is a good precautionary measure.  People should know they will have to answer for their failures.  This change has been anticipated by the interim drinking-water regulations, to which the legislation gives permanent effect.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 71 qualifies the obligation imposed on water services authorities under section 31(13) to ensure water intended for human consumption meets prescribed standards by providing additionally that the necessary measures to ensure such compliance may involve action by a water services authority itself or another person on whom a relevant obligation is imposed under the Act.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 162 inserts an additional provision into section 63 regarding the licensing of trade effluent to enable a water services authority to revoke a trade effluent licence issued under that section where waste-water charges in respect of the treatment, recovery and disposal of that effluent have not been paid by a specified date.  To ensure the rights of the licence holder were duly protected, the application of the power is subject to the water services authority having obtained a court order in the first instance for the recovery of these charges before making such an order providing for the revocation of the licence.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 187 to section 79 extends the licensing requirements under Part 6 to include explicitly for the provision of water from tankers to avoid any enforcement difficulties arising where such provision is necessitated.  Members <Col N="2188"/>will be aware of my views on providing water from tankers to hard-pressed households from time to time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a point on the fifth group amendments.  I confess to not having read the amendments in detail but I have listened carefully to the debate.  Is it intended to do anything about individual sewage treatment facilities such as septic tanks and other devices?  The very least that should be done is that people would be required to get these tanks cleaned regularly.  It is my understanding that it is a rare enough event for a domestic septic tank to be cleaned.  That was fine when there was only one house and a large area to absorb it but if houses are being built in large numbers in rural areas, each with a septic tank, groundwater pollution will become a problem.  The simple solution is to require people to have these facilities cleaned regularly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Senator&rsquo;s attention to section 70 which introduces a specific requirement in the proposed legislation that places a duty of care on all persons, irrespective of the source, that could form a contamination.  This is a major step forward which addresses a lacuna that existed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group six relates to strategic plans and includes amendments Nos. 62 and 82 to 84, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 82, 83 and 84 provide for the substitution of new sections, respectively, for sections 36, 37 and 38 regarding the making of water services strategic plans by water service authorities.  Section 36 now provides that the making of a water services strategic plan will be a reserved function for the members in the first instance.  There was lengthy debate on this issue when the Bill first came to the House.  I concur with the views expressed by several Senators that it is in the best interests of local democracy that elected members should have such strategic powers.  As a result of this change we will have an interesting position whereby the elected representatives will make the development plan and the water services strategic plan as well.</P>
        <P>This touches on the point adverted to by Senator Ryan.  It is the proliferation of septic tanks that has caused difficulties in some areas of the country.  It is important that when local authorities draw up their development plans, they are conscious of the impact they could have on their water services strategic plans.  It is essential such plans would be linked seamlessly into broader national infrastructural and economic development planning and that they would be consistent with national budgetary requirements.</P>
        <P>If necessary, the Minister will have new powers to direct that a plan should be revised or replaced for stated reasons.  This is similar to arrangements <Col N="2189"/>that exist in planning law.  In addition, where a satisfactory plan is not made within the prescribed time limits, the function of making the plan will revert to the county or city manager but this will only arise when the elected representatives have failed in their duty to fulfil their responsibilities.  Such provisions are an essential back-up should the members of a local authority fail in their duties, but I would hope members never will.  A related drafting amendment, No. 62, provided for the deletion of section 30(4)(i) as section 30(7)(i) includes a similar provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important local authority members would be made aware of their responsibilities and the need to take a strategic view on how water should be managed and used.  One of the disappointing features of what has happened in the past is that under much of our legislation, local authorities have been exempt when it came to matters such as pollution, etc.  In other words, they always have a get-out clause which the ordinary citizen does not have.</P>
        <P>One often hears from members and management at council meetings sanctimonious speeches on the need to protect the environment but this is not backed up by what they are doing.  One cannot demand of the ordinary citizen that he or she apply a high standard when the local authority is not prepared to do the same.  These are important aspects.  Other aspects of the Bill, alluded to earlier, give more teeth to the local authorities to enable them fulfil their obligations with regard to waste water discharges and the quality of water provided.  Too much has happened in the past to allow them get off the hook.  The famous BATNEEC, &ldquo;best available technology not entailing excessive cost&rdquo;, was frequently used as a get-out-clause for not doing what was required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I hope these strategic plans include a requirement for continuous monitoring and for the publication of the results of such monitoring so people do not have to submit freedom of information requests to obtain it.  I heard a true story about Dublin County Council a few years ago in regard to a request for emissions data supplied to it by a successful pharmaceutical plant in the Dublin area which was denied on the basis that the information sought was commercially sensitive.  The same data was on public display at the entrance to the pharmaceutical plant and the company was furious that a row had erupted in respect of the release of information it wished to make public.  We must ensure this type of data is put into the public domain if we are to close the loop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister that we must conclude this Bill by 5 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the point made by Senator Ryan.  I have made provision elsewhere <Col N="2190"/>in the Bill that monitoring will not only take place but that the results of such monitoring must be published and placed on websites.  I believe this is the best way of making information available.  The Senator is correct that people should not have to use FOI to obtain such information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 7 deals with protection of infrastructure, including against illegal connection to services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This group of amendments strengthen the power of the water services authorities to facilitate connection of consumers to water services while also providing improved protection for water providers against unauthorised connections and underpinning the maintenance and protection of the integrity of the pipe network.  Amendment No. 204 fine-tuned the wording of section 92 to ensure it is capable of being applied in the manner originally intended.  The original wording assumed that the owner of the premises, to whom a notice is directed, is also the owner of the connecting pipes.  This may not always be the case.</P>
        <P>A group of related amendments, Nos. 123 to 127, inclusive, and Nos. 143, 145 and 148 to sections 55 and 61 in respect of water supply infrastructure and waste water infrastructure provide that a water services authority may attach conditions to any agreement for connection.  Such conditions could include the provision of larger capacity connecting pipes and so forth.  Amendments Nos. 219 and 221 provide additionally to section 103 for the designation as required of a sterilised corridor around a pipe to ensure that the structure&rsquo;s integrity is protected.  Amendment No. 103 to section 43(4) places responsibility for the maintenance or repair on owners of premises using the connection where ownership of the connection cannot be established.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Amendments Nos. 158 and 161 to section 63 enables effluent licensing to be extended to domestic water discharges if required.  An additional amendment which warrants mention is amendment No. 175 which applied the duty of care, of which I spoke earlier, under section 72 to maintain drains, manholes and septic tanks on the premises to the owners rather than the occupiers of the premises as had been originally provided.  Such additional provisions as have been outlined are essential to the orderly planning and management of the water service infrastructure.  I commend them to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 8 deals with metering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This group deals with metering, which has been already discussed.  The opportunity to make some changes have been availed of in amendments Nos. 180, 181, 184 and 186.  These amendments deal with the protections <Col N="2191"/>afforded by metering.  I commend them to the House.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 9 deals with water charges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This group of amendments insert into the Bill provisions on water charges.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 222 and 223 is to strengthen and consolidate in a single provision the existing legal provisions authorising the imposition of charges for water services, for ease of understanding and accessibility.  The existing legal code for water service charges is scattered piecemeal and this brings it together.  Government policy on water charges which provided only for charges for non-domestic charges and prohibits charging for water services provided for households for domestic use is not affected.  Neither is the new provision intended to be capable of enabling existing policy to be changed.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to make it clear that any proposal of any future Government to reintroduce domestic water charges would require additional legislation.  That is not a runner in so far as this Government is concerned.  Unlike existing legislation which simply authorises water service authorities to charge for water services, the proposed new code obliges water authorities to charge non-domestic users for all associated costs.</P>
        <P>Section 105(4) was further amended on Report Stage to again extend the waiver provisions in case of personal hardship and to provide also for a water charge.  Regulations under the new section 106 will enable the Minister to specify what costs could be included.  This set of amendments in effect doubly legislates against water charges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question and a statement.  Is there a definition in the legislation of &ldquo;domestic purposes&rdquo; or are we referring simply to water that comes through a tap inside a house?  There is an issue regarding waste of water which the Minister described.  I fully agree with the principle that domestic water should not be charged for.</P>
        <P>As an owner of a holiday home, I strongly believe that holiday home owners should pay for their water.  There is no reason why anybody who owns a second home should get free water from a local authority or a group scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The concept of domestic is based on the relevant sanitary services legislation.  A composite definition of &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; based on section 7(11) of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1962 and section 12 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Acts provides the relevant definition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Are schools exempt from charges?  That issue has been raised on a number <Col N="2192"/>of occasions.  Surely schools should not have to pay charges and should be classified as domestic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not so classified because a school is not covered in the definition of &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;.  While the statutory power to charge schools for water supply has existed here since 1878 as water rates and since 1962 as water charges, local authorities have not always used that power.  However, the policy adopted by Government in November 1999 has since then required full transparent cost recovery.  There has been an issue regarding cost recovery.  It is to be regretted that schools do not fall under the definition of &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; and never have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to a most heated and energetic debate at the INTO Annual Congress this year on that issue.  The Minister has met representatives of the educational communities at local level who have pointed out to him how inadequate are their grants to meet the demands on them in terms of different local authority charges.  I am not opposed to local authority charges in a general sense but it is quite unfair that they are used at school level.  In the event of schools having to pay charges to local authorities, could they not be allowed to recoup those charges from the State?  There should be no difficulty about that since it would not require a change in the law.  The State should recognise the difficulty for schools and give those running primary and post-primary schools around the country money to compensate for the additional charges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If we were to do that there would be no inducement for schools to do what they are doing, which is to introduce innovative conservation measures.  Conservation studies have been done.  In Galway community school a major study was commenced in 2004 which indicated that the benefits of introducing water conservation measures in schools is very significant.  The core issue is that we have been under pressure because we do not charge for domestic water in this country.  There is significant pressure on us to change that approach, but both Houses have agreed it should not happen.  We have legislated on the double against it occurring.  Water charges and the schools capitation grants could be discussed by another Department at another time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members of both Houses who engaged in a long and constructive debate on the legislation.  This <Col N="2193"/>very important legislation deals with some of the significant issues which have been raised.  For example, it puts privatisation beyond the law.  It deals with strategic planning for and conservation of water and places responsibility on all players in the water sector to ensure recent events are not repeated.  It is a timely Bill which will produce a modern body of law by consolidating a considerable volume of legislation originating in the 19th century.  I am grateful to both Houses and the joint committee for the extraordinarily constructive work which was carried out on this radical legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing before us this important legislation which it was essential to pass before the change of Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing the Bill to the House initially and for taking so many important amendments on board.  We must recognise the outstanding work which has been done to ensure quality water supplies by local authority caretakers in our counties.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan made a point earlier about the proliferation of septic tanks.  The onus must be on local authorities to provide enforcement officers in this area.  People who apply for planning permission must carry out percolation tests and observe planning requirements for PureFlow systems or similar.  However, what has been put in place is never checked, which is a failure which may come back to haunt us yet.  It would be money well spent to provide for enforcement officers to ensure this most important aspect of planning is observed.  We can fall out over the type and placing of windows in a rural house, but what is underground is crucial and should be checked after planning is granted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on bringing forward this important legislation.  I always like to leave the Minister with an idea when he visits the House.  It would be very helpful if Sustainable Energy Ireland were to make grants available for rainwater harvesting.  I have raised the matter with the Minister before.  It would be a simple policy to implement and I do not understand the reticence to pursue it.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Moylan&rsquo;s point about enforcement.  I recall that when we built our own house 35 years ago, which was before the introduction of self-contained, bio-cycle waste systems for one-off housing, the septic tank provider also installed a tertiary treatment plant.  By the time the material had been processed in the third tank, it was like clean water.  Senator Moylan makes the important point that while we require the installation of certain systems, we never check to see how well they are doing.</P><Col N="2194"/>
        <P>I have spoken to people from the fisheries boards who must often examine applications for planning permission and who must do tests regarding soakage.  One cannot argue with that.  Such measures might deal with the issues which often bother rural dwellers.  It is important to monitor the outcomes of decisions to see if they are working properly.  I commend the Minister and his officials on their work on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Water is a scarce resource and drinking water is especially scarce.  The central object of public policy should be to minimise the use of drinking water and ensure it is used only where it is needed.  When I was a small boy my mother used wash my hair in rainwater in south Kildare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

	<P>As one of those who, intermittently, raised the matter of what the D&aacute;il was doing with this Bill between 2003 and 2007, I accept that the D&aacute;il did some good work.  The Bill is better than when it passed this House four years ago.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first group consists of amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 16, 24 and 26.  These are technical amendments arising from changes made to the Child Care Act 1991 and the Children Act 2001 in the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 provides for a new section 1 in the Bill.  This sets out the Short Title of the Bill in subsection 1(2), the commencement provisions and a revised collective citation.  Amendment No. 2 deletes the original section 1, as required on foot of the other changes.  Amendment No. 3 inserts a new definition of the principal Act, for the purposes of Part 2 inserted in the Bill, to mean the Child Care Act 1991.  Amendment No. 16 inserts a new section defining the Act of 2001, for the purposes of Part 3 inserted in the Bill, to mean the Children Act 2001.  Amendment No. 24 deletes the original section 3 from the Bill which set out the Short Title, collective citations and commencement provisions now dealt with in the new section 1 inserted by amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 26 changes the Long Title to encompass the changes to the Child Care Act 1991 and the Children Act 2001 in the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  In short, all the amendments in this group are technical drafting amendments necessitated by the substance of the amendments we will discuss in the subsequent groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second group contains amendment No. 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The second group contains amendment No. 4 which was inserted in the D&aacute;il and is an amendment to the Child Care Act 1991.  The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to modify the<i> in camera </i>rule in child care proceedings, set out in section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991 is the section which creates the jurisdiction to take children into care and the<i> in camera</i> rule applies to the exercise of jurisdiction under that section.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow for the attendance at and reporting of child care proceedings in specified circumstances and by specified classes of persons.  Given the need to use an evidence-based approach to policy making and in the context of keeping the workings of the 1991 Act under review and the important role of the courts in the child care system, there is a need to open up these proceedings to scrutiny in a balanced way.</P>
        <P>Senators will recall section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which modified the<i> in camera</i> rule in family law proceedings.  There is a concern that when a rule provides for an absolute<i> in camera</i> ban on proceedings, bona fide research cannot take place into the operations of the <Col N="2196"/>courts in certain jurisdictions.  In 2004, the rule was modified in the context of family law proceedings by section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act.  The recent publication of the first report on foot of that was a detailed investigation into matrimonial proceedings compiled by Carol Coulter, the legal affairs correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, who was contracted to do this report which shed light on the exercise by the court of its jurisdiction in this area.  It would be very valuable to have a similar report on the operation of child care proceedings.</P>
        <P>Senators will recall that when I prepared and published the amendment to the Constitution Bill relating to children, one of the matters which was raised was the danger that children were being removed from their parents in an unwarranted and unjustified manner.  That concern was entirely groundless, but it throws into relief the importance of having proper focused research into the operation of the courts in this area.  What would be of great concern to me is the suggestion of inconsistencies in the approach of the courts in taking children into care.  For all these reasons I recommend this amendment.</P>
        <P>The precise details of the amendment are that persons falling into certain specified categories may attend proceedings and have access to relevant documents and prepare a report for publication of child care cases under the 1991 Act, subject to rules of court, the directions of the court hearing the case and the very important proviso that no information would be used which would enable a child who was the subject matter of the proceedings or any party to the proceedings to be identified.  The amendment provides that decisions of the court hearing proceedings may be published but subject to the same stipulations.</P>
        <P>The court has discretion, or if special circumstances apply in a particular case, to direct for stated reasons that the person may not attend and report on a particular case.  The specified categories include barristers, solicitors, those representing and authorised in writing by the Children Act advisory board which will be set up in another group of amendments before the House today following consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, and those specified in regulations made by the same Minister after consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We now come to the third group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The third group comprises amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment and amendment No. 6 amends section 43B to provide that an additional category of person may apply to the court to have an order under section 43A of the principal Act or any condition or restriction attaching to such an order varied or discharged.  This amendment relates to the Bill that was passed by Seanad <Col N="2197"/>&Eacute;ireann where we extended the concept of foster parents or foster carers applying for greater rights and more autonomy in respect of children who have been fostered by them for more than five years.  That requires a court application.</P>
        <P>Concern was expressed in Seanad &Eacute;ireann that all the persons who might have an interest in the welfare of the child might not have the necessary standing to be present in court.  I undertook to examine the matter and have done so.  The original section 43 provided that the HSE, foster parent or relative to whom the order was granted, or a parent or person acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, could apply.  I have extended the standing to include a person who, in the opinion of the court, has a bona fide interest in the child concerned.</P>
        <P>The amendments in group 4 are Nos. 7 to 15, inclusive, and they relate to and restate Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  At present, Part VII of the Act provides for the regulation of preschool child care but the regulation of child care for children of school age is outside the scope of the Act.  Consequently providers of such services cannot avail of the VAT exemption currently available to providers of preschool care.  I have therefore provided, in this group of amendments, for a regime of inspection for after-school child care services.  Once the regime is established in the legislation, the necessary service is exempt from VAT.</P>
        <P>The individual amendments set out the scheme of inspection.  Amendment No. 7 defines school-age services and amendment No. 8 gives the Minister power to make regulations in respect thereof.  Amendment No. 9 provides for the notification to the HSE of the provision of such a service and amendment No. 10 provides for an obligation to take reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of school-age children.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 11 provides for powers of inspection and amendment No. 12 affords power of entry, where required.  Amendment No. 13 provides that the HSE may provide school-age services and that regulations may be made by the Minister in respect of them.  Amendment No. 14 concerns offences.  Amendment No. 15 provides for exemptions from the requirements of sections 50 to 57 for a person caring for children of relatives or a sibling group of children and provides for an exemption for a person caring for not more than five children of different families &mdash; of whom not more than three may be preschool children, excluding the person&rsquo;s own children &mdash; in that person&rsquo;s house.</P>
        <P>Group five contains amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19, which relate to the Children Act 2001.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 provide for changes to section 76A(1)(<i>c</i>) and section 77(1), which relate to HSE-provided family welfare conferences that can take place in the context of youth justice court proceedings.  These sections provide that a court hearing criminal proceedings against a child &mdash; a person under 18 years &mdash; may, <Col N="2198"/>where it considers a welfare issue arises in respect of that child, direct the involvement of the HSE in convening a family welfare conference in respect of the child.  The purpose of these amendments is to provide that the use of family welfare conferences that arise in the context of juvenile justice cases is practicable.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18 deletes certain words from section 76A(1)(<i>c</i>) that relate to court-directed family welfare conferences under section 77.  The words proposed to be deleted are: &ldquo;pending the outcome of the conference, make an emergency care order or a supervision order under the Act of 1991 in respect of the child.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 19 amends section 77 and provides that where a court directs the HSE to hold a family welfare conference, the court must be satisfied that it is practicable for the executive to hold such a conference having regard to the age of the child and his or her family or other circumstances.</P>
        <P>The amendments clarify that it will be for the HSE to apply for orders under the Child Care Act 1991 in respect of the child where this is appropriate following the family welfare conference.  These amendments will allow for the early commencement of section 77 of the Children Act 2001, the last remaining section of the 2001 Act that requires commencement.</P>
        <P>Group 6 contains amendments Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive.  They change the name and functions of the Special Residential Services Board, which was established under Part 11 of the Children Act 2001.  Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 insert a new section providing that the name of the board be changed to the Children Acts Advisory Board and amendment No. 22 sets out its functions.</P>
        <P>As a result of the establishment of Youth Justice Service and the reorganisation of functions on the departmental side in the Office of the Minister for Children, there was a more precise allocation of responsibilities in regard to the residential care of children and the need for a specialised board to concentrate exclusively on that disappeared.  For that reason, it was felt it was worthwhile to build on the good work the board had done in co-ordinating residential care by allowing it become involved in co-ordinating work on the operation of both the Children Act 2001 and the Child Care Act 1991.</P>
        <P>Group 7 deals with amendments Nos. 23 and 25.  These are technical consequential amendments arising from the change of the name of the Special Residential Services Board to the Children Acts Advisory Board.  Senators can see that an extensive schedule of definitions and amendments is set out in amendment No. 25.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators <Col N="2199"/>for their attention this afternoon.  I note there were no contributions made and there was a broad welcome for these amendments in the other House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the enactment of this legislation.  It means the Children Act 2001 will have been concluded and implemented within the lifetime of the Government.  It required some amendments.  It required administrative changes such as the establishment of the Youth Justice Service.  I am glad that not alone has there been legal commencement of the extensive 2001 Act &mdash; since 1 March last most of the legal provisions in that Act have been commenced &mdash; but with the enactment of this legislation the final outstanding provisions will be commenced.</P>
        <P>The Government, by a decision a fortnight ago, has also allocated the necessary resources, in terms of the engagement of additional District Court judges and additional probation staff, to ensure the provisions of the Act are implemented.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their attention to this and for their attention and interest in children issues during the life of this Seanad.</P>

        <P>Regarding the subject matter of the amendments, group 1 covers amendments relating to the Land Drainage Acts and amendments of section 7.  We will deal with the subject matter of amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, 30 and 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for the detail already discussed in the debate on this Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, 30 and 31 relate to section 7.  Amendment No. 1 is a drafting amendment to improve the wording of section 7.  Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, 30 and 31 are also drafting amendments that concern changes to the numbering of two Drainage and Improvement of Land Supplemental Acts of 1867 which are set out in the table in section 7.  The purpose of these amendments is to take into account the fact that three separate Drainage Acts passed in 1867 currently have the same Short Title and the amendments are designed to ensure each will now be given a separate Short Title for the purposes of clarity by inserting &ldquo;No. 2&rdquo; and &ldquo;No. 3&rdquo; respectively into the second and third such Acts of 1867.</P>
        <P>The amendments in group two all affect minor changes in the citation, subject matter or Short Title of certain Acts in the Schedules to the Bill.  On changes to subject matter, these amendments ensure more appropriate subject matter entries and either align the subject matter with the Short Title, correct anomalies in the wording of the subject matter or otherwise improve the wording of those entries.</P><Col N="2201"/>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 44, 60 and 61 concern corrections to citations and amendments Nos. 132 and 133 correct the references to the Short Title of the Political Offices Pension Act 1869.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 6 to 10, 12 to 14, 17 to 18, 21, 22, 24 to 25, and 29 concern the insertion of Acts into Schedule 1, the list of Acts to be retained.  These Acts were recorded previously as being already appealed, as one or more of the leading texts, such as the Northern Ireland Chronological Tables, HMSO Chronological Tables or Cullinane&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Irish Statutes&rdquo; indicated that this was the case.  Following recent further analysis of the legislation, however, that purported to have repealed them, it has become apparent these Acts had not been fully repealed, in some instances because of a saver clause.  With each of these Acts, the residue has or may have some continuing effect and, therefore, should be retained pending further substantive law reform in the relevant areas of law.</P>
        <P>The amendments in group four delete Acts either from Schedule 1, the list of Acts to be retained, or from Schedule 2, the list of Acts to be repealed, on the basis that the Acts referred to are already fully repealed.  Amendments Nos. 50, 106 to 108, inclusive, and 120 and the second part of amendment No. 131 delete Acts which, on further examination, are considered to be wholly repealed on the grounds that prior to independence they were repealed as to all British territory, which included Ireland at the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 34 and the first part of amendment No. 131 update the Bill to take into account the recent commencement of repeals set out in the Children Act 2001, culminating in Statutory Instrument No. 164 of 2007 on 1 March 2007.  The upshot of those repeals is that the three Acts referred to are now fully repealed and can now be deleted from this Bill.  The remaining amendments in this group delete Acts which, on further examination of the repealing provisions, are considered to be fully repealed.</P>
        <P>The amendments in group five involve three main changes but all relate to the deletion of Acts from Schedule 2 and their insertion in Schedule 1.  The Wedding Rings Act 1855, which amends the Gold and Silverwares Act 1854 was previously listed in Schedule 2, the list of Acts to be repealed, and during the public consultation that took place, prior to the publication of the Bill.  Both of these Acts were listed as suitable for repeal.  However, representations were received in relation to the Gold and Silverwares Act 1854, which resulted in its transfer to Schedule 1, the list of Acts being  retained.  Given that the Wedding Rings Act amends the 1854 Act, which is being preserved, it is believed that this Act should similarly be preserved.  In the case of the Court of Probate (Ireland) Act 1861, further examination suggests that it might be relevant to the appointment of members of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests in Ireland.  Accordingly, it is proposed to retain the Act for <Col N="2202"/>the time being, to delete it from Schedule 2 and insert it in Schedule 1.</P>
        <P>The Poisons and Pharmacy Act 1908 is listed for repeal in the Pharmacy Act 2007, the relevant repealing provisions of which have not yet been commenced.  In order to facilitate its repeal and replacement in that legislation, it is proposed to retain the 1908 Act in this Bill by removing it from Schedule 2 and inserting it in Schedule 1.  The effect will be that the 1908 Act will not be repealed when this Bill is enacted but instead will be repealed when the relevant provisions of the Pharmacy Act 2007 are commenced.</P>
        <P>The amendments in group 6 insert a number of Acts into Schedule 2.  Each of the Acts referred to by these amendments were recorded previously in one or more of the leading texts such as the Northern Ireland Chronological Tables, the HMSO Chronological Tables or The Irish Statutes as either already repealed or not applicable to Ireland.  However, following recent further analysis of the Acts, that purported to have repealed the legislation referenced by these amendments, it has become apparent that these Acts apply to Ireland and have not been fully repealed.  Some part of each of these Acts, however minor or inoperative, remain in force.  In each case, however, the residue is suitable for appeal as it is obsolete.</P>
        <P>I particularly want to say something about the repeal of Poynings Act 1495, which is proposed by amendment No. 62.  Poynings Act provided that all pre-1495 English statute law applied in general to Ireland.  We are taking the opportunity in this Statute Law Revision Bill to finally repeal Poynings Act.  The repeal of Poynings Act will not mean the automatic repeal of any Act applied by that law that is part of the Irish Statute Book at present.  This is made clear in the savings clause of section 9(3) of the current Bill.</P>

	<P>I support these amendments.  We are certainly not going to do anything from preventing the Bill from going through and we fully support the amendments.  The Bill has been given a very interesting hearing in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have been circulated with a list of the Acts mentioned in both Houses of the Oireachtas at all Stages.  The first one on the list is the Fairs Act 1204.  I note that fairs in Donnybrook, Drogheda, Waterford and Limerick are referred to.  In Waterford they were held on the historic hill of Ballybrickin, where I am from.  I recall the fair days when I was going to school, which was not too long ago, and I fully support the amendments. </P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators<?oasys _jy ?>Cummins and Moylan for being here today, as well as the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  We are grateful for the support we received from this House during the many long debates on this legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins referred to the Fairs Act.  I, too, have fond memories of the fairs in places such as Mountbellew in east Galway.  He is right in saying those events now seem long distant when we talk about them to the younger generation. It indicates how far we have come as a society.  It has been an interesting exercise bringing this legislation through the House.  We have finally got rid of Poynings&rsquo; Law which we remember from our schooldays.</P>
        <P>I thank Members involved in this debate for their detailed and insightful contributions.  Debates of this nature are a timely reminder of the ongoing need to update our legislation.  The Bill aims to consolidate, reform, simplify and modernise our laws, making them user-friendly.  It is all part of a broader regulatory approach pursued by the Taoiseach in a determined way since the publication of the White Paper, Regulating Better, in January 2004.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Bill is the greatest single statute law revision measure undertaken in the State.  On enactment, it will repeal 3,226 statutes, far more than any other previous statute law revision measure.  That figure is more than the entire number of general public Acts that have been enacted since Independence in 1922.  Of the 1,364 Acts in Schedule 1 that will be retained by the Bill, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to repeal them and where necessary re-enact them in more modern form.  Some 10% of these Acts will be repealed on enactment of the land and conveyancing law reform Bill.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work of the team of officials and legal researchers in the Office of the Attorney General which engaged in detailed and considerable research to identify those statutes for retention and those for repeal.  That research involved the identification and assessment of over 60,000 Acts.  It was a complex task to identify those Acts that still apply to Ireland and to ascertain whether they are suitable for repeal.</P>

	<P>I compliment the Minister of State and his staff for their work on the Bill.  He took on many amendments during its passage to improve the legislation.  It is important to remove irrelevant legislation from the Statute Book.  In the early 1800s, for example, the closest building to the gable-end of a farmhouse was the pig-pen.  Markets were often located in town centres in the 1800s but many of the successful ones are now located outside towns.</P>
        <P>Great credit is due to the team of researchers for their work in updating our Statute Book.  It is one part of further updates that will be made to the Statute Book.  I wish the Minister of State well in the next several weeks and hope he will be back in the same seat.</P>

        <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 for the consideration of the House and to outline its main provisions.  I thank Members for agreeing to take all Stages of the Bill today.  This Bill is a very short one, with a total of nine sections, and Members will note that many of the provisions reflected in the Bill are primarily of a technical nature.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 is to confirm and secure an integrated statutory basis for the broad range of functions and responsibilities of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Essentially, this Bill aims to secure a more coherent statutory mandate for functions previously transferred to the Minister by way of statutory instrument-transfer of functions orders, along with new programmes introduced since the establishment of my Department in June 2002.</P>
        <P>This statutory mandate, if established, can provide a firmer basis from which any or all of these functions can operate, or transfer to such Departments as a future Government may determine.  In addition to this, a number of technical amendments to existing legislation are proposed in this Bill.  Key aspects and objectives of the Bill, including the technical amendments to existing legislation, are to confirm the powers, functions and responsibilities of the Minister; to provide for the inclusion, in the Third Schedule in the Freedom of Information Act 1997, of section 18 of the Western Development Commission Act 1998; to amend section 8(5) of the Western Development Commission Act 1998, raising to &euro;1 million the limit of financial or other material aid to enterprises or projects, which the WDC can provide without the consent of the Minister; to amend section 2(4) of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003 in respect of transport services for islands students and sections 3(1)(<i>b</i>) and 3(1)(<i>c</i>) of that Act in respect of clarifying the Minister&rsquo;s remit in respect of specified functions <Col N="2206"/>in respect of new aerodromes and ancillary facilities connected with the provision of air services between the islands and the mainland; and to repeal the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts 1949 to 2002.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of this is to confirm and to secure an integrated statutory basis for the broad range of functions and responsibilities coming within the remit of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Provisions in this regard are reflected in section 2 which sets out a range of functions that are, and are deemed always to have been functions of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Members will note that the range of functions outlined includes, community development; voluntary activity and philanthropy; rural development; co-ordination of the national drugs strategy; the Irish language, including the co-ordination of policy in this regard; the development of the Gaeltacht and the islands; and North-South co-operation within the ambit of these functions, including matters in relation to Ulster Scots heritage, culture and language.</P>
        <P>This provision is without prejudice to the generality of any other provision of this Act or of any other enactment conferring functions on the Minister.  In other words, the provision in this Bill does not affect any other existing statutory provisions in relation to the functions of the Minister.  In addition, the Bill provides for powers to develop, implement, maintain, expand or terminate any scheme that, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, supports or promotes the functions set out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that, while providing a coherent statutory basis for the functions, powers and responsibilities of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, section 2 does not seek to limit or assume in any way the powers, functions and responsibilities of other Ministers or State agencies or bodies.</P>
        <P>As Members will be aware, I have responsibility for the area of rural development and one of the bodies falling within the ambit of my Department is the Western Development Commission, otherwise known as the WDC.  This commission was established under the Western Development Commission Act 1998 to promote the economic and social development of the western region.  This Act requires that direct assistance provided by the commission shall be in the form of the purchase of shares in share capital and the provision of loans, but excluding grant aid.  The WDC is unique among State agencies in that it provides such venture capital by means of its own investment vehicle, the western investment fund.</P>
        <P>Section 8(5) of the WDC Act provides that, &ldquo;Financial or other material aid provided to enterprises or projects by the Commission shall be in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time, at such times as may be specified by the <Col N="2207"/>Minister, by the commission with the consent of the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the amount thereof, in the case of any particular enterprise or project, shall not exceed &pound;250,000 or &euro;317,434, without the consent in writing of the Minister&rdquo;.  This Bill provides in section 4 for the raising to &euro;1 million of the limit for financial or other material aid to enterprises or projects, which the WDC can provide without seeking the formal consent of the Minister.  The figure of &pound;250,000, which was provided for in the 1998 legislation, was set down at a time when fewer projects were being approved for funding by the WDC.  Given inflation and the increasing number of projects being funded by the WDC that now exceed the &pound;250,000 value, it is my view that the proposed new limit will provide for a more efficient and streamlined project approval process.</P>
        <P>It is time we got rid of all these odd figures relating to punt figures and changed to more friendly euro figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is absolutely right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides in section 3 for the inclusion in the Third Schedule in the Freedom of Information Act 1997 of section 18 of the Western Development Commission Act 1998.  The effect is that this provision, which relates to a prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, can no longer be cited as grounds for refusing access to records sought under the Freedom of Information Acts.</P>
        <P>I am also taking the opportunity in the Bill to make a number of technical amendments to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003</P>
        <P>The amendment of section 2 of the 2003 Act will enable my Department to pay subsidies in respect of travel by island students to second level schools on the mainland, which are outside the radius of 120 km of the terminus in respect of which provision is currently made.  This will enable my Department to address issues that have arisen in respect of students on Inishbofin.  My Department had been subsidising, as part of the Inishbofin subsidised ferry service, a bus service on Sunday and Friday afternoons between Cleggan Pier and St. Jarlath&rsquo;s College, Tuam, which is within the aforementioned 120 km radius of Cleggan.  In the past couple of years, however, St. Jarlath&rsquo;s has ceased taking first year boarders.  This means students from Inishbofin now attend Garbally College, Ballinasloe, instead. This has created a difficulty in that Garbally lies outside the 120 km radius of Cleggan, thus prohibiting payment of a subsidy in respect of the bus service to that location.  I should add that it would be only in exceptional circumstances such as this that my Department would be required to use the provision proposed in the Bill.  Any regulations made <Col N="2208"/>in respect of such cases would be following consultation with the Minister for Education and Science, and with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport.</P>
        <P>I am also providing for the amendment of section 3 of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003.  This will clarify the Minister&rsquo;s remit in respect of specified functions relating to both existing and new aerodromes and ancillary facilities connected with the provision of air services between the islands and the mainland.  My Department recently took legal advice on the use of the words &ldquo;any such&rdquo; in sections 3(1)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) in the 2003 Act and the advice was that this wording could be deemed to restrict the Minister to performing these functions solely in respect of existing aerodromes acquired in accordance with section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) of the 2003 Act.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the repeal of the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts 1949 to 2002, following the transfer of the State shareholding in the former commercial State body, Arramara Teoranta, to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta with effect from 16 October 2006.  That decision should have been made years ago because we have an industrial authority which holds the shares.  There should not have been a separate State authority for this small seaweed factory.  Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited was established in 1947 as a company limited by shares and changed its name to Arramara Teoranta by certificate in 1955.  The principal activity of the company is to produce seaweed meal for use in the alginate industry.  The State&rsquo;s involvement arose from the acquisition of shares in the company, as provided for in the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts, over a period from 1949 to 2002.</P>
        <P>In 2006, Government decided to transfer its shareholding in Arramara Teoranta, which is located in the Connemara Gaeltacht at Cill Chiar&aacute;in, to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the State body with responsibility for the overall economic development of the Gaeltacht.  It is within this context that the repeal of the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts 1949 to 2002 is proposed.</P>
        <P>It is my view that the transfer of Arramara Teoranta to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been positive for the body.  Arramara&rsquo;s seaweed business is a good fit with the focus of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta upon indigenous and natural resources in the Gaeltacht.  As a result of this action, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s now holds the entire shareholding of the company and its stewardship will offer scope for expansion of the existing business into more value added products.  In the longer term, this move will achieve optimum coherence in respect of State investment in industry in the Gaeltacht, in addition to greater flexibility in regard to the development and future of Arramara.</P>
        <P>In addition, therefore, to facilitating a number of amendments to existing legislation, the legislat<Col N="2209"/>ive proposals I am presenting here today will provide a firm and more coherent statutory basis for the wide-ranging functions and responsibilities currently assigned to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I thank all those with whom I have worked with in the past five years in respect of these functions.  In particular, I  thank Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas for their support and assistance over that period.</P>
        <P>Molaim an Bille don Seanad agus beidh m&eacute; l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta, ar nd&oacute;igh, tuilleadh eolais a shol&aacute;thar feadh mo chumais maidir le gn&eacute; ar bith de na for&aacute;lacha.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the Senators&rsquo; contributions to the debate on its provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As I understand it, the Bill is a technical measure designed to tidy up matters.  I support all of the objectives laid out in the explanatory memorandum and by the Minister.  Today is the penultimate day of this Seanad.  This Bill has been initiated in the Seanad.  It cannot go to the D&aacute;il because that House has been dissolved.  Therefore, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs could be accused of engaging in a cosmetic exercise.  Am I correct in my interpretation of these affairs?  If we pass the Bill, it will die, in effect, because the D&aacute;il has been dissolved.  The legislation will have to be reinstated in the next D&aacute;il or Seanad.  I do not suggest that we cannot consider the Bill, but we cannot send it on to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Minister has said about the necessity, as outlined in the Bill, for a statutory instrument to be introduced to transfer certain functions.  The nature of such a transfer may be laid out in the Bill.  It may be determined by the Minister or his successor in office as he or she deems fit.  The Bill relates to various powers and functions.</P>
        <P>I was particularly interested in what the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said about the Western Development Commission Act 1998.  He alluded to the possibility that greater use will be made of certain powers and functions at a future stage.  He spoke about what will flow from that.  He mentioned the provision of better air services between the islands and the mainland.  That is something to which we all subscribe.  We wish the Minister or his successor well in ensuring that such services are rolled out more effectively.</P>
        <P>I accept there is a need to secure an integrated statutory basis for certain ministerial functions.  The measures being taken in that regard are welcome.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the Bill does not affect any existing authority, functions or powers. It is basically an add-on and a tidy-up.  The Bill is acceptable for the reasons which have been outlined by the Minister.  I hope it will streamline things as it is intended to do.  We welcome the improvements which will be made to the project approval process.  I am glad that cer<Col N="2210"/>tain records will be freed up under freedom of information.</P>
        <P>When the Minister mentioned Inishbofin, I thought of my beloved Innisfallen, which is in the middle of Killarney&rsquo;s lake of learning.  A botanical survey of Innisfallen, which is a wonderful project, is under way.  We might learn something about the medicinal properties of the herbs which were used by the monks on that island in years gone by.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to solve the problems associated with the distances between Inishbofin, Cleggan Pier and Garbally College.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal to deal with a State policy I have always believed to be stupid.  We accept that Departments cannot own shares in commercial undertakings.  In this regard, the proposal to bring Arramara Teoranta under the aegis of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is sensible.  I agree with the Minister that it should have been done years ago.  The State needs to have fewer intermediaries when it deals with development bodies to pursue its objectives.  Otherwise it can be bedevilled by them.  In the past, some State bodies were prohibited by law from owning shares in what were their subsidiaries, in effect, creating all manner of complications.  Bearing in mind the circumstances with which the Civil Service and other bodies must deal, human nature is such that turf wars break out very easily.  One gets bogged down and can be held up for years.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the proposal.  I have examples of problems in this area with which I had to deal in previous careers.  Anything that can be done to deal with the issue more directly and to streamline procedures is to be welcomed.  This does not relate to the Bill, but I am sure the Minister will forgive my mentioning Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  We are in the dying days of this Administration and Oireachtas, and perhaps the Minister might do that for which the people of the area have been clamouring and revoke that accursed order.</P>

	<P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an Aire agus an cur s&iacute;os a thug s&eacute; d&uacute;inn ar an Bhille, a bh&iacute; thar a bheith soil&eacute;ir.  Tuigimid uilig go bhfuil riachtanas dl&iacute; leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  &Oacute; bheith ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Aire, is f&eacute;idir liom a r&aacute; nach bhfuil aon amhras ormsa.  Tr&iacute;d is tr&iacute;d, is rud bun&uacute;sach &eacute; seo &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teicni&uacute;la de.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach freisin, &aacute;fach, go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; &eacute;.</P>
        <P>In welcoming the Minister to the House, I thank him for the explanation of the Bill he has provided.  It is also quite evident that we must respond to the legal advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  Incidentally, it also underlines the very comprehensive nature of the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio.  Many of the headings provided are in themselves comprehensive &mdash; community development and voluntary activity; rural development; co-ordination of the national drugs strategy; the Irish language, including co-ordination of policy in that regard; and the develop<Col N="2211"/>ment of the Gaeltacht and the islands.  North-South co-operation within the ambit of those functions includes matters relating to Ulster-Scots heritage, culture and language.  In 2002 we were dealing essentially with statutory instruments, and it is clear from the comprehensive nature of the portfolio that it was important to provide an integrated statutory basis for all those areas.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the manner in which they have fulfilled that role, even in the absence of such a basis.  Let us take the islands as an example.  There was a time when we were very much afraid for them, and we often recall the exodus from the Blasket Islands.  It was extremely sad that it happened, and one saw an entire heritage sidelined.</P>
        <P>Under the Minister&rsquo;s tenure, one has seen new life coming in.  That is very important, first of all from the perspective of human rights, but also from that of the islands&rsquo; heritage and the contribution that they can make to tourism.  I am glad to see them receive special mention.  Whether we are dealing with students or householders, if we feel there is a need to ensure people there have the same rights as those on the mainland, it is important that they be safeguarded.</P>
        <P>I was also glad to hear Senator Coghlan speak on the Bill.  It is evident that there are no political footballs here, and the Senator put it very well when he said we would all welcome a Bill such as this.  It is much better to deal with it now than to encounter a legal trip-wire at a later stage.  There was near unanimity in this House on the Official Languages Act 2003 and on according working status to Irish in the EU.  We have had excellent debates in the House, spearheaded by the Minister.  Even if there were no other element to the portfolio, as was the case years ago, when one had Roinn na Gaeltachta, it would be all-embracing.  There is much good news, and that is why there is a welcome for any legislation that underpins and copperfastens what is already happening.  My spirits are raised when I see that, at long last, we are taking Irish seriously, and that every effort will be made to ensure the excellent goodwill in that regard is capitalised on.  I do not have any doubt that will happen in the future.</P>
        <P>It is logical to deal with community and rural development together.  I have always considered it the best possible value for money if people are prepared to do things for themselves but require some assistance from the State, whether it is a case of the county manager or the Department interacting with a community.  Under the Minister&rsquo;s guidance, these two areas have genuinely been energised.  People who have been involved, largely on a voluntary basis, feel they are getting recognition.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an Bhille, agus t&aacute; ceist curtha ag Senator Coghlan on what happens to the Bill next.  I am sure the Minister will respond to that.</P>
        <P>On an aside regarding Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, we have had some great discussions on this matter. <Col N="2212"/> No area has got more publicity from a tourism point of view than Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is has got from that debate, to such an extent that <i>The New York Times</i> rang me to discuss what was happening.  I have been told that over Easter, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is was packed to the rafters.  It is people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire, c&eacute; go gcaithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute;, cos&uacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Cochl&aacute;in, nach bhfuil a fhios agam go d&iacute;reach cad ina thaobh go bhfuil an Bille seo &aacute; chur tr&iacute;d an Seanad gan aon D&aacute;il a bheith ann chun rud ar bith a dh&eacute;anamh leis.</P>
        <P>Is bre&aacute; liom focail ar n&oacute;s &ldquo;integration&rdquo; agus &ldquo;coherence&rdquo; a fheiscint, mar t&aacute; siad ar bharr an liosta maidir le riarach&aacute;n poibl&iacute; a bheith eagraithe i gceart.  Is annamh a dh&eacute;antar &eacute; sin, agus is annamh a tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go bhfuil integration agus coherence ann.  Is minic go mb&iacute;onn deighilt&iacute; ann.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag cur aon lochta ar Aire faoi leith, ach go h&aacute;irithe ar an Aire at&aacute; sa Teach tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu, n&aacute; ar aon Rialtas faoi leith.  Ba &eacute; ceann de na deacrachta&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; le riarach&aacute;n poibl&iacute;, &aacute;fach, n&aacute; go mb&iacute;odh ruda&iacute; roinnte.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister is making an attempt to introduce some coherence in this area.  However, I question whether it is logical to group the functions listed, namely, community development, voluntary activity and philanthropy, rural development and co-ordination of the national drugs strategy, etc.  That said, we will take the Bill as it is.</P>
        <P>I am intrigued whether the Minister may have been acting without a proper legislative base up to now.  I do not suggest any personal impropriety but was it the case that somebody realised late on that issues arose in regard to the legislative basis for many of the Minister&rsquo;s functions?</P>
        <P>I love to see references to Arramara Teoranta and seaweed.  When I was a student chemical engineer, I always had visions of the country developing ways to optimise and maximise the revenue from seaweed and I pursued a few tentative research papers on this issue.  Seaweed is apparently a far more lucrative product now than it was 20 years ago, as many of the materials extracted from it are regarded as high demand.  I hope &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is seriously pursuing <Col N="2213"/>the maximisation of added value.  We do not want a small-scale version of the export of either ore or beef on the hoof if there is a possibility of developing the product further.  It is worth remembering we have the technical and other skills of a sophisticated pharmaceutical industry with a workforce that has skills and ways of looking at things that might have been unknown previously.  Perhaps &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta could contact the various academic centres involved in issues concerning extraction, processing, etc., with a view to ensuring opportunities are not being missed.</P>
        <P>I have a slightly changed view of bodies such as the Western Development Commission.  This country is so small that it should not matter whether one is in Clifden or Dublin.  I am a little concerned that pursuing issues such as that of the Western Development Commission, to whose objectives I subscribe passionately, is psychologically marginalising one part of the country.  For many in the United States, Galway would nearly be considered within commuting distance of Dublin.  Americans do not talk in terms of miles but in terms of hours and in this regard Galway is two and a half hours from Dublin, assuming the existence of a decent road.  This is commuting distance in many big countries and it is most assuredly not indicative of peripherality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, we are in danger of institutionalising a perception of distance in respect of a place that is no distance away at all.  We are therefore talking ourselves into issues that do not exist.  There should be no reason pertaining to geographical location alone why an investor should choose to invest in Dublin rather than in Galway, Cork, Sligo, Tralee or Letterkenny.  The US Chamber of Commerce, in its very thoughtful submission to the Government on the national development plan, said everywhere in the country should not be any more than two hours from an international airport, either by road or rail.  I do not object to the Bill at all.</P>
        <P>In terms of coherence, integration and good governance, the idea that four Ministers would be involved in a decision to provide a subsidised bus service between Cleggan and Ballinasloe is not good.  If we cannot give a member of the Cabinet discretion to make such a decision without having to consult, by law, the Minister for Education and Science, and having to obtain the permission of the Ministers for Finance and Transport, we are not proceeding in the most desirable way.  This is simply a matter of extending an existing bus service.  I will not start a row over this but it makes no sense for a member of the Government, with senior collective responsibility, to require the agreement of three others on something so trivial.  If the Minister makes a mess of the matter, let it be made in public such that we can deal with it.  For God&rsquo;s sake, let us get real.</P>

	<P>N&iacute;l m&eacute; chun dul isteach go mion i ngach rud at&aacute; r&aacute;ite.  The Senators probably would have guessed that, no more than themselves, although perhaps I am the exception here, it was not most convenient for me personally to come here today, but I felt an obligation to the Seanad.  This was published as a Seanad Bill.  When we published it and when it was ordered for today, it was done in the expectation that the D&aacute;il would be sitting this week as well and it was ordered for the D&aacute;il later this week.</P>
        <P>There is no incredible urgency.  There is nothing to our knowledge that we are doing that requires the legislation as such.  The genesis of the legislation is that a routine review was carried out to ensure that there was no doubt whatsoever of the powers of the Minister to carry out all the functions and it was decided, to leave no doubt, that this Bill is needed, but there is nothing of any urgent nature about it.  I understand that in the event that there is no change of functions the Bill will continue on its journey and be brought to the D&aacute;il in the next session.  It was ordered as a Seanad Bill and unless the Seanad cancelled today&rsquo;s proceedings, I had to attend.  I hope that people would understand that.  It was not that we were pressing.  On the other hand, I am more than happy to be here because the Seanad does continue once the D&aacute;il is dissolved and the Seanad had business to do.  There was business on the Seanad&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>

	<P>On the other issues raised, I thank the Senators for their support for the Bill.  Arramara Teoranta was a State body.  It amazes me why, when set up as a multipurpose development agency, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s &mdash; or Gaeltarra &Eacute;ireann before it &mdash; was not automatically given the shares and told to get on with the job.</P>
        <P>In Arramara Teoranta we had a 1950s industry being run in a 1950s style for processing seaweed in the most basic way and providing a basic meal.  The factory really reminds one of the 1950s, even given the money spent on it in the past two years.</P>
        <P>I am pleased with what the Senators had to say.  By transferring to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, which has a good record of developing industries given its entire involvement in marine and other areas, it would have the wherewithal within its structures to aggressively look at the possibilities of fully exploiting seaweed on the west coast.  As Senator Ryan stated, there are now unlimited possibilities due to the nature of the demand for specialist products, and particularly organic products.  I hope it would open a window.</P>
        <P>I used often cite one example.  There was a good saw mill, Cong Sawmills, near my home in the 1950s.  It belonged to the forestry authorities and then Coillte, which kept upgrading it to levels which were 20 years behind the times.  On the other hand, I was involved in setting up a small saw mill that was only a little embryonic project when we started it, with one small debarking machine.  Of course, at one stage it came to critical mass and we arranged with Connaght Gold and a private individual to take it over.  It now provides 200 jobs and Cong Sawmills is closed.  On the one hand, I was afraid that what happened Cong Sawmills would happen in the case of seaweed.  On the other hand, I saw the other possibility.  I still see that possibility and I believe &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is the correct vehicle.  I hope that the opportunity will be grasped.</P>
        <P>On the debate on the issue of An Daingean-Dingle, it is Dingle in English and An Daingean in Irish.  An Daingean is what the local people say.  That was the only reason that An Seabhac and his colleagues chose An Daingean &mdash; it is what the Gaeltacht people use.</P>
        <P>I am flexible on the issue.  I want to put three points on record.  First, I offered in October 2005 that if Kerry County Council asked me to revisit whether it be An Daingean and Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, I would ask the placenames commission to do so and I would favourably look on that request, as I did recently in the case of D&uacute;n versus D&uacute;n Bleisce.</P>
        <P>Second, on the issue of rescinding the order, any time this was offered I was given a firm thumbs down by both the people of Dingle and the county council.  They did not want the order rescinded because the effect would be that there would be only one official name, that is Dingle, <Col N="2216"/>and there would be no official Irish name.  Quite correctly, they refused that.  For that good reason, that was never asked.  I agree and support them in not asking, but the door was open.  I said that if they wanted to ask for that it would be churlish of me to refuse.</P>
        <P>Regarding the one request they made, I understand there is no legal basis to provide for it.  Therefore, the question is whether we should change the law but there are two snags or overriding factors to doing that.  The majority of the people of the Gaeltacht are proud of their Irish language placenames.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, as the elected body which represents the people of the Gaeltacht, twice endorsed by an overwhelming majority, including as late as last November, that provision of the languages Act.  A second point is that in regard to the order for 2,300 odd names, there was a complaint in respect of only one name.  One would be reluctant to introduce a Bill to amend the Act &mdash; one would have to engage in major public consultation prior to doing so &mdash; in such a way that one would change it for the 2,300 names in favour of the request in terms of one name.  That is the snag in that regard.</P>
        <P>I continue to work to resolve the problem.  I have worked with colleagues in that respect and will continue to do so.  The placename Dingle is still legally usable for every private and public purpose with the exception of the three exclusions that have been mentioned frequently.  I hope we can find a solution to the problem.  I have been actively working with colleagues in that regard and I will continue to do so.  The tourist issue continues to arise.  If there is a problem concerning tourists, further discussion should take place on that issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to point out an interesting fact.  When I was a child Inis O&iacute;rr was known as Inishere, Inis Me&aacute;in as Inishmann and so on.  It is interesting that all the ferry companies, which are commercial operators, now use the Irish language names, Inis M&oacute;r, Inis Me&aacute;in and Inis O&iacute;rr and some 250,000 tourists make it to the Aran Islands every year.  Therefore, there are reasons for deep reflection.  It takes calmness and reflection to resolve this issue and I will continue to work with the people of Kerry to try to resolve it.</P>

This addresses the concern raised by the Senator in respect of schemes and the Minister&rsquo;s function generally in a similar manner to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  Amendment No. 4 is being proposed on foot of the advice of Parliamentary Counsel and I propose that it be agreed as it deals with the issues raised by the Senator in amend<Col N="2218"/>ment No. 3.

I want to avail of the opportunity to thank the Minister for the courtesy and accessibility he has always extended to Members of this House.  I always had the feeling that he enjoyed very much the interaction with Members of the Seanad.  I want to take the opportunity, as well, to wish him well in his future career.  I wish all my colleagues likewise. </P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go maith le gach &eacute;inne at&aacute; p&aacute;irteach sa toghch&aacute;n.  T&aacute; sprioc difri&uacute;il agamsa f&eacute;in, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, agus at&aacute; ag an Aire, ach t&aacute;imid go l&eacute;ir sa ch&oacute;ras ch&eacute;anna.  M&aacute; bh&iacute;onn an seans aige, ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; f&eacute;achaint ar an mille&aacute;n.  M&aacute;s rud &eacute; go mbeidh duine &eacute;igin ina dhiaidh, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, chaithfidh s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; f&eacute;achaint conas a bhfuilimid ag cur Achtanna tr&iacute;d an Oireachtas, where as I said four Ministers are involved in the decision to provide a subsidised bus service between Cleggan and Ballinasloe.  It makes no sense and we allow matters of that nature to go through this House on a regular basis, which are incoherent and senseless.  I can be certain that probably no Minister will see that provision.  It will pass around four fairly junior civil servants in four different Departments.  It is a waste of paper and time and is bad public administration.  However, the Bill is a good idea and is welcome.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s optimism about our seaweed industry is justified &mdash; as the fulfilment of the dream of a young chemical engineer of 35 years ago if we were to develop a good downstream industry based on such a widespread natural resource.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish the record of the House to show the fact that my colleague, Senator Tuffy, persistently pressed me to give the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; time to this issue.  She felt very strongly about it and whatever her future career &mdash; I hope she is elected to the D&aacute;il &mdash; she will <Col N="2224"/>have made a significant mark on the way Seanad &Eacute;ireann does its business.  I want to put Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s name forward and give her the credit for something which means there is significant change in the way the House does its business.  Everybody did a good deal of work later but she deserves the credit for the time, effort and space she contributed in getting this on to the agenda in the first place.</P>
