	<P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain in detail the reasons for the refusal to grant naturalisation to a person, details supplied, in order that he can make an appeal as required by law.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain the action, if any, that has been taken on the report of the working group set up by her on haemochromatosis in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cummins of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when the promised new school building for Mount Sion secondary school, Waterford city will be given the go-ahead and when construction will commence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion concerning a Ministerial Order required to allow the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to prepare a draft planning scheme for the Poolbeg area of the docklands, referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government for consideration which has completed its deliberation &mdash; section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 provides for the preparation by the authority and the approval by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of planning schemes for parts of the Dublin docklands area &mdash; to be taken without debate; No. 2, <Col N="2018"/>motion re the establishment of a commission of investigation into issues of concern arising from the death of residents of the Leas Cross nursing home, to be taken immediately on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than one hour after it commences, with the contribution of each group not to exceed ten minutes; No. 3, motion re risk equalisation, to be taken at 12.20 p.m. and to conclude no later than 1.00 p.m., with the contribution of each group not to exceed six minutes; No. 4, motion re sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, to be taken with debate from 1.00 p.m. to 1.45 p.m., with the contribution of each group not to exceed seven minutes; No. 5, Criminal Justice Bill 2007 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 1.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 4.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time, with the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.    </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>A person with an intellectual disability receives the princely sum of &euro;184 per week in disability allowance.  It is now proposed under regulations that were never debated in either House that the Government will take &euro;90 per week from such people and that it will look for the full retrospective amount since these regulations came into being.  How is it that such a miserable, penny pinching, disgraceful decision was never debated in these Houses?  We are talking about people who must deal with very difficult decisions in their lives and who are now receiving threatening letters from the institutions they are in to get this money back.  It is the most shameful decision the Government has ever taken.</P>
        <P>I would be grateful to the Leader if she would speak directly to the Minister about this issue.  It is striking fear into many vulnerable people in the community and the issue was never debated in these Houses.  It is a disgrace and it should be changed, even at the last minute before these Houses are dissolved.</P>
        <P>Over the Easter recess, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, established the Irish Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence.  This initiative, which has been in the offing for some years, has been greatly welcomed.  However, the Rape Crisis Network, Women&rsquo;s Aid and many other women&rsquo;s organisations are legitimately pointing out that the remit of this agency relates specifically to domestic violence against women and does not deal with the issues of trafficking, pornography and other forms of exploitation against women.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader communicate with the Minister of State concerned to see if he could meet the various non-governmental organisations and find an agreement?  They have considerable experience in this area.  They have worked in the field for the past 30 or 40 years and have made great <Col N="2019"/>advances for women, especially in the area of domestic violence.  It is wrong that a major announcement such as this does not have the full <i>imprimatur</i> of the groups concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past ten to 15 years, I raised the importance of having a vetting process for people who would be in charge of children.  That was eventually conceded and agreed to by the Government.  However, I discovered something disturbing in recent weeks.  The vetting process for teachers is being done by the Teaching Council, which is the council that approves the qualifications of teachers and so on.  That system has been done in the North of Ireland for quite some time and it is welcome.  Unfortunately, while the members of the Teaching Council are happy to do this, they have no statutory basis or power to do it.  We will walk ourselves into a major problem with this.  Somebody may take action against somebody else and difficulties will arise.</P>
        <P>At the moment, the Teaching Council will obtain information from the Garda about a person who has faced charges and who has been found guilty of particular breaches of the law.  This can then be made available to boards of management or others who seek to employ a teacher.  That is all very well in theory and it is what we want.  Unfortunately, the council has no statutory authority to do this, which raises issues about data protection.  The council will now have information which will be protected mainly by data protection laws.  Garda&iacute; are also prepared to give all manner of information, including what is euphemistically described as soft evidence and information about people against whom charges were made but who were not convicted.</P>
        <P>The issue of child protection was raised this week in Wexford and it comes up in this House every few weeks.  The issue surrounding the Teaching Council needs a minor legislative change to get it right.  When the day arrives that it gets it wrong, we will all be asking whether anyone noticed this.  The Teaching Council is prepared to take on this role.  The structures are in place, but it needs the statutory power to do it.  I would like the Minister to explain it to us, but I realise it may be too late to ask her to come to the House.  However, the information should be brought to her attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, the other House finally passed the Water Services Bill 2003, which was initiated in this House four years ago.  Better than anything else, it illustrates the priority for the Government of the issue of water and water services.  It is easy to forget that a domestic water crisis is still in full spate in a large area around Galway city.  It is easy to ignore some of the extraordinary remarks made.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to talk so much about the issue of polluted water in Galway as about the <Col N="2020"/>response of statutory authorities.  Nobody from the management of the local authorities has ever condescended to be subject to any sort of serious media interview under circumstances where they did not have total control over it.  Instead, they issue remarks which would be funny if they were not so appalling.  For example, when asked why they cannot give free water to the people of Galway, they answer that some people might grab too much of it and sell it elsewhere.  If that is the level of imagination of those who are given the job to deal with the provision of good water supplies in Galway, then the people of Galway deserve better.  Those who are hiding behind their bureaucratic privileges ought to be made accountable.</P>
        <P>If there is a way to make county and city managers accountable, then we should have it.  They are powerful people in our society who do not seem to believe that they are accountable to anybody.  I would like the Leader to persuade the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, when he is before this House next week with the Water Services Bill 2003, to put some time aside to talk about water services and who is responsible for them.</P>
        <P>I have often asked for a debate on competitiveness and I still want to have one.  I have always said that I want the terms of that debate to be properly broad and not to focus in on one aspect.  When I read a report produced by our own researchers which stated that those countries with entrenched unionisation tend to have higher rates of unemployment, I began to wonder where science and ideology overlap.  Some of the most competitive countries in Europe have very high levels of unionisation, in particular Sweden, which is way ahead of this country in every competitiveness index.  When people who are meant to be objective researchers identify trade union membership as an obstacle to low unemployment, that is why I want us to have a broadly based debate on competitiveness.  We are in danger of turning myths into facts, which would be very bad for the future of decision making in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I discovered in recent days that teenagers sharing video and music files on the Internet may face prison sentences under what a European consumer group has referred to as ill thought out and potentially disastrous copyright laws that are currently being debated by the European Parliament.  The provision in question, which was introduced by a socialist MEP from Italy, is being backed by the European Commission.  This is a matter of grave concern.  The British Government has already advised its MEPs, of all parties and none, to vote against the measure, and the Dutch Parliament has also condemned the proposal.</P>
        <P>The senior legal adviser of the consumer group in question, BEUC, has said the provision will impact on persons uploading files to such popular sites as MySpace, Bebo and YouTube.  Members <Col N="2021"/>with teenage children will be familiar with these sites.  Under the draft law, users who download content from such sites for no personal gain may face criminal as distinct from civil prosecution.  Companies in the music industry, for example, regularly take action to protect their copyright laws through civil actions.  This proposed law goes even further.</P>
        <P>I understand the first draft of the provision was debated by the European Parliament yesterday.  It is being actively supported by the Commission.  What is the position of the Irish MEPs on this outrageous intrusion into the lives of teenagers?  It is another example of the EU&rsquo;s competence coming into question.  It would be better off addressing some of the more important issues facing the world rather than trying to lock up 14 and 15 year olds who download files not for personal gain but to share with their friends.  I refer to MEPs as well as the Commission, which seems to have become involved in an unholy alliance on this issue.  I emphasise the importance of establishing the Government&rsquo;s position on this issue and, more specifically, that of the MEPs of all parties.  Did they support this vote in the European Parliament yesterday?  I was unable to obtain any up-to-date information on how the vote went but it is almost certain that the draft law was supported by the majority of MEPs.</P>
        <P>This issue should be reconsidered.  It is especially pertinent given the problems we encounter in encouraging teenagers to connect and relate to the political space in which all of us operate.  This is mainly because of their view that the laws we enact have no impact on their lives.  If this law goes through, however, it will be binding on member states and will create a minimum legal sanction which can then be increased by member states up to the maximum.  None of us wants a situation where garda&iacute; are obliged to call to the doors of teenage children to arrest them for such activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made by the leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, on the establishment of an office for the prevention of domestic violence, under the auspices of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s view that the proposal seems to be too narrow in focus.  While the establishment of such an office is welcome, it is important that we consider the wider issues.  We are all aware that domestic violence occurs in the home.  There are other types of violence against women, however, including human trafficking and the use of pornography.  We have debated these issues many times in this House.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate at some future date to ensure this office adopts a broad focus?  Last week, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland launched its election manifesto, as it called it, on domestic violence.  This manifesto made reference to violence against ethnic min<Col N="2022"/>ority groups, including Travellers, the trafficking of women and the use of pornography.  It is a shame the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and other organisations have had to beg for funding in recent years.  We all want to see action in this regard.</P>
        <P>Above all else, the organisations in this area seek adequate funding.  They are the groups that work at the coalface, assisting those women who telephone their offices seeking help.  For the women whose calls are answered, what is usually sought is protection, which may necessitate moving out of the family home to a safe place.  Adequate funding is required to provide those services.  The new office must not take the narrow focus that has been evident to date.  I hope it will be a step in the right direction of adequate provision to meet the problems that exist in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Brian Hayes, I am aware of people with intellectual disabilities and psychiatric problems who are adversely affected by the charges to which he referred.  Persons living in sheltered accommodation who, because of the nursing home situation, were not charged for that period now find themselves with arrears of &euro;4,000.  These are not people of means and they tend to spend payments as soon as they are received.  Most of them are not in a position to meet the repayments and they should not be pursued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Scanlon and Brian Hayes.  I raised this issue some six weeks ago after it was brought to my attention by people in St. Raphael&rsquo;s.  I am glad Senator Brian Hayes raised it so trenchantly today.  It is one of the meanest and most discussing impositions on a vulnerable section of the community.</P>
        <P>At the time I raised it, the Leader gave an undertaking to bring it to the attention of the Minister.  Now that Members on all sides have reinforced its pertinence, I hope she will do so.  When I initially spoke on this issue, it was simply a question of imposing this extra charge.  The additional step to which Senator Brian Hayes refers &mdash; the sending of threatening letters demanding arrears &mdash; had not yet been taken.  This is entirely unacceptable.  I am sure the Leader, who is a caring person, will bring this to the attention of the Minister.</P>
        <P>I am afraid the Leader will be busy if she does everything I ask today.  Will she raise with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the release on bail by the United States Government of a most notorious criminal, Luis Posada Carriles?  This is a man who orchestrated and was the prime mover in the bombing of a civilian aircraft in the 1970s in which 73 people were killed.  He has acknowledged it openly.  He was also involved in the bombing of a Havana hotel in which an Italian citizen &mdash; an EU citizen &mdash; was killed, as well as <Col N="2023"/>numerous other crimes.  It seems he is being released to ensure he keeps his mouth shut about his connections with the CIA.  A strong protest should be made about this in view of our status as a state friendly to Cuba, with whom we exchange ambassadors.  Moreover, we are always listening to guff from the United States about the war on terrorism.  In this case, however, the authorities of that country are releasing terrorists in their own jurisdiction because it suits them to do so.</P>
        <P>This House has a good record of seeking to protect the vulnerable, including those with disabilities.  It is a horrible fact that the number of wheelchair-accessible taxis in this city, and possibly elsewhere in the State, is dropping steadily.  In Dublin, there has been a reduction of 75% in the number of these vehicles.  Drivers are handing back their plates because of the considerable additional expense in acquiring accessible taxis.  The taxi regulator has written to various Ministers but the letters have not been answered.  This puts in perspective our vaunted concern for people with disabilities.</P>

        <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission has upheld a ruling against the European Commission Representation in Ireland in respect of a series of advertisements that included a strong political message plugging the EU.  I am all in favour of the Union but it is useful that this complaint was upheld.  Otherwise, if that breach were allowed to continue in the context of a referendum on European matters, for example, it is possible that the office could use substantial funding to influence the context of the debate.  That would not be appropriate.  I congratulate the National Platform, Mr. Anthony Coughlan, and other individuals such as Patricia McKenna who went to battle on these issues.  They won this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Senator&rsquo;s list is not too wide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, a Chathaoirleach, this is the end.  It is an important point that it was left to individuals.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission took an action against Tr&oacute;caire at the beginning of Lent.  I congratulate the individuals and organisations that acted so successfully in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I too was very glad to see the unit to combat domestic violence established but I also share the concerns expressed by Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Terry about the lack of involvement of so many NGOs.  I was at the launch of the organisation and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Fahey, stated that the remit was not set in stone.  I am sure that if representations are made to him they will be taken into account.</P><Col N="2024"/>
        <P>Yesterday was the Malaria in Africa Day, I attended a meeting of some members of the Malaria consortium in London last week.  It was incredible to listen to the praise for Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, not just the financial but the moral support for the initiatives and for research both in Europe and Africa.  I would be glad if the Leader would pass on this good news to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>During the passage of the legislation on the Medical Council and the Pharmacy Council, I expressed anxiety about having the details of registers put on the Internet, as confidentiality is very hard to maintain.  Members may have seen, to the consternation of many people, that the details of medical students and young doctors appeared on the website of the British Department of Health.  These young people who had been assured of confidentiality when they applied for jobs had their names, addresses, qualifications, sexual orientation &mdash; what has that to do with employment? &mdash; religion, e-mails and everything else published on the website yesterday.  This was not corrected until yesterday evening.  The number of people who could have downloaded the information and used it to blackmail or to threaten the person to provide drugs in the future is unknown.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, took on board my concerns on this issue and assured me that only the names of those on the register would be on the Internet.  It is a very serious issue when the details of people who have access to drugs are published as it leaves it open to criminals or others to target them or their families.  I would be grateful if the Leader should stress to the Department of Health and Children that the councils must ensure that nothing like this could happen in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Back in the 1950s Dr. Noel Browne was given credit for eliminating tuberculosis as a major problem.  There were 7,000 cases a year of people getting tuberculosis and those of us who were around at the time remember &ldquo;Hospitals Requests&rdquo; where requests were played for those in the sanatoria.  I understood the disease had been practically eliminated until last week when I read an article by Dr. Charles Breeden of University Hospital Cork who states that we have not eliminated tuberculosis but that new strains exist that are resistant to modern drugs and that it is possible to do a great deal more to combat the disease than we are doing.  I am aware that babies are routinely immunised when they take up the BCG vaccination but according to Dr. Breeden, we have a long way to go   before we conquer this.  The recent outbreak of 14 cases of tuberculosis in Cork is indicative of the dangers of a pandemic.  We can take the necessary steps to address this problem.  We should not get into a panic but we must regard it as an urgent problem.  We must take action during the summer and not put it on the long finger.</P><Col N="2025"/>
        <P>I join with Senator Ryan in drawing attention to the issue of competitiveness in the business regulation forum report .  We must reduce the red tape to enable small businesses to become more competitive.  The danger is that we are hidebound by red tape and business regulations.  I was actively involved in the business regulation form which points out five steps that can be taken.  Let us ensure that this report is not ignored and that it gets the attention it deserves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the deduction of &euro;90 for domiciliary care of one type or another from the disability payment of &euro;184 and Senator Scanlon echoed his remarks.  I was at a carer&rsquo;s meeting on Monday night, where this was the dominant theme, as people had received letters demanding repayment.  This issue crept up on us unknown and we must take it up with the Government immediately.  I cannot understand it.  I fail to understand how one can send out a demand for the repayment of &euro;9,000 or &euro;11,000 and I fail to understand why a Government would send out such demands at any time, and especially now.  I will take up this.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes also raised the issue of the office for domestic violence and questioned why the NGOs such as the Rape Crisis Centre, and Women Aid should not be brought into the debate on what will happen in that office.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Fahey, has always proved to be very open.  I welcome the setting up of such an office and the Minister of State has assured us it will be broadly based and that he will listen to those who make an input to its remit.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised a very important matter of the vetting of ancillary staff dealing with children.  While the Teaching Council is willing to take on this role, it does not have the statutory authority to do so.  The first time an incident occurs will be the day the legislative basis for acting will be questioned.  The Act must be amended urgently.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan raised the matter of the water services Bill that was finally passed in the D&aacute;il.  I was alarmed to hear a female member of the Labour Party, the Finance spokesperson, say on television that a Bill would lie in the Seanad and not be debated.  Bills do not lie in the Seanad, but in the D&aacute;il.  I felt like saying that people in glasshouses should not throw stones.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Please do.  Senator Ryan raised also the issue of water services.  There must be a debate on the issue of water quality.  There is a daft notion that Dublin County Council will drain Lough Ree to source water for its area.</P>

	<P>I have had my say.  I was dying to say it and I  thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>It was mentioned that entrenched trade unionism is seen as a deterrent to competitiveness, but it could not be.  We are always boasting about our own economic success, much of which is based on union membership.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney raised the interesting matter of a proposed EU law whereby people who download Internet material will be subject to punitive fines.  If such a law was passed, however, we would not have Google, rate-your-teacher or rate-your-politician.  It is a point worth pursuing, nonetheless.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry hoped that the wider issue of domestic violence, and fora dealing with such issues, will come under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey&rsquo;s, new office.</P>
        <P>Senator Scanlon raised the subject of disabilities.  I hope he will also talk to the relevant Minister about it.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the release of a Cuban-born man, Luis Posada Carriles, who <Col N="2027"/>worked for the CIA.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, a commission of investigation may be established by the Government, based on a proposal by a Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to investigate any matter considered by the Government to be of significant public concern.  How the State and its institutions protect vulnerable people is, in my view, a significant issue.  It is evident a systematic review of the management, operation and supervision of Leas Cross is a matter which falls into this category.  As this House is aware, the Health Service Executive, HSE, commissioned Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill, consultant geriatrician, to carry out a review of deaths at Leas Cross nursing home between 2002 and 2005.  This review examined the case notes of those patients who died while resident in Leas Cross between 2002 and 2005 together with documentation from the home, the HSE, the coroner&rsquo;s office, the registrar of deaths and the Department of Health and Children.  The report was published in November 2006.</P>
        <P>The principal finding of the report was that the documentary evidence was consistent with the care in Leas Cross being deficient at many levels, and highly suggestive of inadequately trained staff, and furthermore no documentary evidence that the management of the nursing home and clinical leadership recognised the ensemble of care provision required to meet the needs of the residents.</P>
        <P>This review focused on the care of the patients in Leas Cross nursing home and was a paper-based investigation.  It highlighted the importance of promoting the highest standards of care for <Col N="2029"/>older people and of ensuring a robust and thorough system of inspections.  Action has been already taken to address the concerns raised by Professor O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s report.  These include the publication by me in January of draft standards for all long-term residential care facilities for older people which are now going through a consultation process led by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the Health Act 2007, recently passed by this House, which has put the social services inspectorate on an independent statutory footing and which contains provisions to underpin a more robust inspectorial system.</P>
        <P>What is required now is a review of the systems in place and the roles and responses of all the main parties involved in Leas Cross.  Having considered Professor O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s report the Government is of the view that a commission should be established to investigate this matter, which is clearly of public concern, under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  This has been decided taking into account the gravity of the issues outlined by the review and the public interest in the outcome of the review.</P>
        <P>The draft order is accompanied by a statement of reasons for establishing the commission, as required by the Commissions of Investigation Act, and a similar motion will be brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Under the provisions of the Act, the order establishing the commission must specify the matter that is to be investigated.  The draft order which is before the House describes this as matters relating to and arising from the review carried out by Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill in examining the deaths of residents at Leas Cross nursing home, the role and responses of such relevant parties as the commission may determine, including the Health Service Executive, and previously the relevant health boards, regarding the ownership, operation, management and supervision of the nursing home and the circumstances surrounding the transfer of patients from other facilities to the nursing home.</P>
        <P>I have already mentioned my recent publication of the draft national standards for residential care settings for older people which update the previous provisions set out in 1993 in the care and welfare regulations.  These standards, when finalised, will apply to all residential settings, public, private and voluntary, where older people are cared for and for which registration is required.  The draft standards are based on legislation, research findings and best practice.  The homes will be inspected against the standards, when finalised after the current consultation process, by the social services inspectorate which is a part of the HIQA.  It will be independent in exercising this function.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently carrying out inspections of private nursing homes and produced a report in 2006 on nursing home inspections and registrations.  There is now in place a national standardised approach to private nursing home <Col N="2030"/>inspections across the country.  This currently underpins the inspection process.  I allocated an additional &euro;6 million for the further development of the inspection process in 2007 and 2008 and the HSE has informed me that 113 inspections have been already carried out this year.  A total of 870 inspections of more than 400 private nursing homes were carried out in 2006.  Last year, we funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full-year cost of &euro;150 million and this year, we have gone a step further, with a full-year package of &euro;255 million.  In two years we have added more than &euro;400 million to services for older people.</P>
        <P>We know that remaining at home is the first choice for older people and Government policy is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not possible we support access to quality, long-term residential care.  In this regard it is important that older people have access to the best residential care possible.  This Government is committed to ensuring the safety of all our citizens but in particular the most vulnerable in society.  A high priority is to ensure the safety of older people who, through their hard work, have put us on the road to the prosperity we have enjoyed for the past number of years.  The older population has made an invaluable contribution to all aspects of Irish life.  We acknowledge this and we are fully committed to improving all aspects of the lives of older people, not only by focusing on health issues but also by giving consideration to quality of accommodation, security, welfare, and all other issues which affect them.</P>
        <P>This is why I am recommending the establishment of this Commission of Investigation.  We need to ensure the systems in place for those who are vulnerable and in need of residential care are of a high standard and that they receive quality care and treatment in suitable surroundings.  To do this we need to examine the system failures regarding Leas Cross.  The terms of reference I have approved will, I believe, result in a focused and timely investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and extend my sympathies to her and her party on the untimely death of Senator Kate Walsh.  We will miss her greatly and very moving speeches were made by many Senators in the House yesterday.  She was loved by all of us here and may she rest in peace.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of this commission of investigation as it will give some comfort to families who had parents who died in the care of that nursing home.  Many families still have questions in the wake of Professor O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s report that require more complete answers.  The families deserve these answers as do all of us.  We need to know what went on and why the systems in place failed so badly to care for the residents of that home.  We must welcome the fact that the <Col N="2031"/>deficiencies in the running of Leas Cross nursing home came into the public domain because it is obvious they existed for some time with many people consequently suffering.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said, we all want the best for older people and this is what they deserve.  Putting a loved one in a nursing home is the last thing a family wants to do but in some cases it is the only way to ensure a person receives the right care.  This is where the problem lies.  Families placed loved ones in Leas Cross nursing home with the best intentions but they did not receive the best of care.  I am glad we are now to examine the inspections system and to consider how nursing homes are run.  It has taken two years to set up this commission and to do so earlier would have been appropriate.  I appreciate, however, that Professor O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s report had to be completed first.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague in the other House, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, asked whether the scope of the commission of inquiry&rsquo;s investigations would extend to all patients of St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital in Portrane who were transferred to long-term care.  Given that the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference include the circumstances surrounding the transfer of patients from other facilities to the nursing homes, will it deal with the issue of patients from St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital who were transferred to nursing homes other than Leas Cross or will it focus specifically on the Leas Cross nursing home?</P>
        <P>As a result of changes in society many people are unable to care for older relatives in their homes, as was frequently the case ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  Whether it is because society requires that people work or people want to work or whether it is due to a lack of space in family homes, people do not have the wherewithal to look after elderly relatives.  The problem will worsen in future.  As the Minister and Senators will agree, it is essential, therefore, that nursing homes operate to the highest standards and perhaps we took this for granted in the past.  I hope the inspectorate will ensure the standards introduced recently are upheld.  Any owner or manager of a nursing home that does not meet the required standards must be dealt with severely.</P>
        <P>We cannot afford to have mistakes because those living in nursing homes are elderly and vulnerable and, in many cases, unable to voice concerns.  We place so much trust in those who care for the elderly that we must demand of them the highest standards and deal with them severely if they do not meet those standards.  I hope this does not become necessary and we ensure standards are met.  It is unfortunate that nursing homes must be subject to continuous checks.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of the commission of inquiry, as will the families and loved ones of those affected by the Leas Cross scandal, although another investigation will probably cause them further pain.  People are entitled to <Col N="2032"/>answers and matters such as these must be fully investigated.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for establishing the commission of inquiry.  I am not sure if she referred to a timeframe for the publication of its report.  I hope it will not take long because the matter must be concluded as quickly as possible for all the families involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my deepest sympathy to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on the death of Senator Kate Walsh.  As I indicated in the House yesterday, I knew Kate when she was elected to Kildare County Council many years ago.  She was a fine, jovial person who maintained high standards and acted most unselfishly in giving herself to those she represented.  May she rest in peace. </P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on establishing a commission of investigation into the management, operation and supervision of Leas Cross nursing home.  I agree with Senator Terry that this issue has been ongoing for some time.  As I stated during a debate in the House on MRSA in hospitals, the problems were operational and arose because people did not do their job.  They were either deaf, pretended not to hear or were blind in one eye and could not see in the other.  These types of practices must be rooted out of the health service.</P>
        <P>Elderly people, who built the State and put us where we are as a nation, are highly vulnerable.  It is terrible to think they would receive this type of treatment in the winter of their lives.  I use the word &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; sparingly because they were not treated to the standards one would expect in a modern nursing home.</P>
        <P>The Minister spelled out clearly and concisely what will be the procedures and I welcome the mechanism to close down substandard nursing homes.  When standards in a nursing home are found not to be up to scratch how long will it take to close down the home?</P>
        <P>I welcome measures for the elderly the Minister has introduced in recent years.  In 2006, the budget for the elderly was &euro;1.2 million and the figure will increase this year.  The budget for nursing home subvention has increased to &euro;160 million from a mere &euro;15 million in 1994, its first full year in operation.  The introduction of 3,000 home care packages is a further important initiative.  As anyone involved with the care of the elderly will agree, hospitalising people who are in the early stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease adds to their confusion.  It is reasonable to assume the number of home care packages, which will help to keep people in their home environment where they are more easily managed, will be further increased.</P>
        <P>The system in Leas Cross failed abysmally.  I fail to understand how people could continue to draw their wages while the events in the nursing home took place.  In addition, in certain cases it is not possible for a carer to continue providing care for a person in the home because his or her health will suffer if changes are not made.  If and <Col N="2033"/>when this happens, both ends of the house are on fire.</P>
        <P>Since my time in the nursing profession more than 30 years ago, I have raised the infrequency of visits to residents in long-stay nursing homes.  This has been a major bone of contention with me.  I drew the ire of certain entities when I announced in the House what I believed was happening but I was proved right.  For example, in one case a lady who went to visit her favourite aunt discovered that her relative had been dead for 16 years.  She had thought about her aunt a great deal without knowing she was dead.  Incidents such as this anger me.  Will the Minister consider introducing a mechanism to ensure the management of long-stay institutions contact immediate relatives or friends of residents to exhort them to visit their loved ones?</P>
        <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has stepped into the breach in the case of long-stay residents of psychiatric institutions.  Members of the society have taken residents under their wing, as it were, by visiting them regularly and bringing them little presents, which makes their lives a little easier and better.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister has introduced this measure, which is of tremendous importance.  I wish it had been done long ago as, if it had been, we might not be discussing what took place at Leas Cross.  Let the truth come out in its entirety.  Let those who have questions to answer, answer them.  There can be no hiding place for them.  I compliment the Minister on the establishment of this commission and compliment Mr. Derry O&rsquo;Donovan, SC, who will report to the Minister within 12 months of the commencement of its work.  Well done to all.  I wish the commission well.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s commitment to older people is well recognised.  From that point of view, I can do nothing but applaud what she is trying to achieve.  I am sure the establishment of the commission is worthwhile but I am concerned about what will happen to the recommendations of the commission.  We get report after report but very little action.  The major scandal with regard to Leas Cross was not just what happened at the nursing home but also the fact that, two years before RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme went to the home, a very critical report on Leas Cross was sent to what was then part of the health board but it was not acted on.  It is the lack of action on reports that is the real problem.</P>
        <P>In our consideration of nursing homes, we must recognise that running costs are enormous.  It is now estimated it costs well over &euro;1,000 per week to keep a long-term resident in a nursing home in an urban area.</P><Col N="2034"/>
        <P>On a final point, in recent days a coroner&rsquo;s case in Sligo highlighted the danger that exists in transferring people between one medical institution and another if it is not absolutely certain all medical and nursing records are sent with the patient.  I suggest the transfer of patients between St. Ita&rsquo;s and other nursing homes was not monitored to the extent it should have been.  We must hope this will happen in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There is little I can add to what has been said.  The words that attract me in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution are the references to an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; statutory body and the &ldquo;provisions to underpin a more robust&rdquo; inspection system.  There is no doubt we need a robust inspection system and, therefore, what the Minister is doing is correct and she is to be congratulated for it.</P>
        <P>There is an assumption that all old people want to stay at home.  I can think of two cases, one of which is that of an older person whose clear wish to stay at home is paramount.  In the other case, the person wishes to be looked after &mdash; I can think of very successful nursing homes which deal with such cases.  Let us not simply assume because of the problems that have been created that all nursing homes are at risk of providing poor service.  Many nursing homes provide a good, worthwhile service that is much appreciated.</P>
        <P>This issue relates to how well we, as a democracy, look after the most vulnerable in our community.  The most vulnerable are very often children and those who are not able but they are also those who are aged and unable to look after themselves.  In the old story, <i>Quo Vadis</i>, which was later made into a film, the character of the ancient Roman criticised the Christian for his beliefs by saying he did not think much of the way Christianity works.  He said that, in his ideal, the God who runs the world would have people come to a certain stage of life and then be lifted up to heaven, with all their friends around them to congratulate them on the job they had done in their lives, instead of getting old and eventually being regarded as somebody who is not able to participate in the way he or she was as a younger person.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The way we care for our aged is very important.  In some cases it is much better to be cared for at home whereas in others it is much better to be cared for in a nursing home.  If people are to be cared for in a home, we as a democracy must ensure that happens.  As Senator Glynn noted, the danger is that when people go into a nursing home, they are forgotten, left alone and not even thought of afterwards by some.</P>
        <P>The onus is on the State to deal with this issue.  The Minister has taken that onus on herself.  She has introduced this inspection system, which I believe is the right way to go.  We must make sure we review it rather than simply having inquiries, commissions and investigations.  Let us make sure <Col N="2035"/>we take action this time.  The Minister has taken the right steps, for which I congratulate her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always easy at times like this to have a go at the Government for whatever failings or omissions were identified, particularly those in the area of private nursing home care.  However, that is not what I should do in this regard.  There is a need to reflect on how negligence and neglect can begin and be allowed to continue in any area of health care, but particularly in the support and care for elderly people.</P>
        <P>It would be silly to point a finger at the Minister for Health and Children and claim it is her fault.  Many things are her fault but the regime under which private nursing homes were regulated is not one of them.  However, there is an underlying issue for which Government has responsibility and perhaps culpability, namely, the question of the apparent slowness, reluctance or unwillingness of families to complain about or demand what they believe are high standards, and the apparent uneasiness of families with regard to the consequences of complaining &mdash; I do not mean personal consequences.</P>
        <P>In my case, when my mother needed institutional care &mdash; she needs it still, thank God &mdash; the system worked extremely smoothly through no influence of mine or anybody connected with me.  However, I have observed the struggles, travails and trauma of many friends of mine, families I know and people I have met in my political life when the moment arrives and a much-loved parent clearly needs institutional care in some form of nursing home.  There is the trauma of the struggle, often unsuccessful, to get subvention and the struggle to pay for the nursing home but, above all, there is the trauma of the struggle to find a place.</P>
        <P>Having listened to people talk about the huge trauma of having to care for somebody who is bedridden and incontinent and the sense of life beginning to come back to something like normality because they have found a nursing home place, it is difficult to imagine such people being immediately vocal if they believe standards are not what they want them to be.  It is not that they do not love and care for their elderly relatives.  It is because they believe the choice is between what is unacceptable and what is an awful lot worse.</P>
        <P>What we must do is create a system of support, regulation and inspection which makes the transition possible, where it is clearly necessary.  The definition of when a person needs nursing care ought to be one that is capable of being shared by both the family and whoever makes that decision on behalf of the regulatory authorities, in order that we do not have a repetition of the extraordinary stories that arose in the past.  For example, although it does not relate to this issue, there is the famous case involving excise relief for cars which were designed for people who had lost <Col N="2036"/>the use of their hands, arms or legs but, because of the wording, the Revenue Commissioners decided it did not apply to people who had lost limbs in more than one of the categories.</P>
        <P>We must take a generous view based on common sense and this view must be inculcated in those who make decisions.  Regulatory assessment of what people need cannot be determined by budgetary considerations but by the objective facts.  Then it is the job of society to ensure that our old people are supported and sustained in quality care.  Families can then be assured their expectation of quality care is not something they must suppress.</P>
        <P>I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the investigation.  However, looking at the situation from the outside, it is clear that good, caring children had considerable reservations, but did not know there was somewhere to go with their complaints.  They could have taken their parents or elderly relatives from these premises, but there was no place else to put them.  As a person with a mother who is old and feeble, I cannot imagine a worse dilemma than to have a much loved relative in an institution where the standard of care is so poor that one must complain.  In such a case, one would inevitably be told that it was fine to take him or her away as there were ten or more people waiting for a place.  The real function of the State in this area is to end this dilemma.  I hope we achieve this as a result of the investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no cheap solution to the dilemma.  We must accept that as with primary education, maternity hospitals and other areas, the provision of hospital or institutionally-based care for people in the last years of their lives is part of what we must pay to be a civilised society.  This can no longer be regarded as an exception or an add-on.  Let us suppose, for example, we had a doubling of our birth rate.  Would we suddenly announce we could not afford the extra maternity facilities this demanded or would we say it is something for which we must pay?  I know we would say we must pay although I am not entirely sure I know what the current Minister would say as her views on public health care provision are far from clear.  She has, with some justification, been accused of a kind of subterfuge in the privatisation of these services.  Nevertheless, the majority of people in society would say the solution is better, namely, more extensive public provision when there is a need.</P>
        <P>It is as easy to look at the care of old people as at maternity care.  Why should old people be seen to be any more of a burden than a new baby?  The language used by commentators, economists in particular, is inimical to the view that an old person in his or her last years is as precious to society as a newborn baby.  There is an horrendous backward step for some economic commentators to suggest that a baby as a potentially productive unit in society must be nurtured, but an <Col N="2037"/>elderly person is a post-productive unit of society and is, therefore, a burden.</P>
        <P>I hope the investigation will identify a process which will lead us to a situation where care for older people in institutions becomes part of a smooth, seamless transition through life, where maternity care is the beginning, followed by proper school and health services and proper adult health screening.  There should be a smooth transition from phase to phase of life and no phase should be identified as a burden or become such a burden for caring relatives that it makes them afraid or discourages them from expecting the highest possible standards.</P>

	<P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed.  In particular, I wish to acknowledge what Senators Terry and Glynn said about the late Kate Walsh.  Wonderful tributes were paid to her yesterday and it is a pity she was not here to hear them.  She was a very special person.  Many people have portfolios, but her only portfolio was friendship.  She had friends everywhere and was a much loved and well respected person.  She had a great gr&aacute; for many people in this House and I never heard her say a bad word about anybody here.</P>
        <P>I visited her a lot during her illness, most recently last Sunday night.  However, little did I know she would be dead on Tuesday morning.  We were all shocked to hear it because it was not her cancer that killed her but something different.  The pity is she was not here to hear the tributes because she would have had a good laugh.  Right up to the end, she did not lose her sense of humour and had many funny stories to tell over the past few weeks in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.</P>
        <P>On the questions raised, following the passing of the order here and in the D&aacute;il today, the investigation will be established to be conducted by a sole member, Mr. Derry O&rsquo;Donovan SC, over a 12-month period, with provision for an interim report.  We estimate the inquiry will cost approximately &euro;2 million.  The matter of the transfer of patients from St. Ita&rsquo;s will be a matter for the chairman who will have the power to consider any issues relating to transfers of patients.</P>
        <P>I met some family members of former residents of Leas Cross and must say that after hearing their stories I would be very bitter if it had been one of my parents involved.  To take up a point made by Senator Ryan, it is a fact that many people, including those who are well informed, do not always realise that bed sores could be the result of neglect.  Sometimes they feel these are a natural consequence of old age.  Many relatives of patients feel guilty or think they should have noticed more.  The least we can do is to ensure we learn from the experience.  In particular, we must learn from the experience of how the authorities responded to the complaints made.  Much of Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s inquiry will investigate this area.  Hopefully, the authorities, those with an <Col N="2038"/>inspection function and those involved with complaints, will learn lessons from the experience in Leas Cross.</P>
        <P>As Senators know, up to now there has been an inspection process only for private nursing homes.  However, the Government has decided the new social services inspectorate process under HIQA will inspect all nursing homes in the public and private sector, which is appropriate.  Senator Glynn mentioned somebody going to visit an aunt who had been dead 16 years after the announcement of the repayment scheme.  Unfortunately, we hear such stories, but such people are in the minority.  I have heard a similar story on several occasions when visiting residences for older people.  Nurses have said to me they did not know some patients had relatives because they had never seen them.  This development is infuriating and annoying.  There is no legislation that can insist people must visit their relatives, but visiting the elderly is, I hope, one of the wider values in our society.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I share the view expressed by Deputy Ryan and do not just see young people as productive and older people as a drain on the State.  I was listening to a radio programme last Sunday when driving from Cork to Offaly and heard a comment made that we were investing moneys in properties overseas that should be going into the health system.  The implication was that the Government was investing in properties overseas.  This was one of the few occasions I was tempted to phone the programme and point out that it was citizens rather than the Government who were investing in overseas properties, but I did not do so.  I hate the value system that talks like this, particularly with regard to who is or is not productive.  Although I support enterprise in society and the reward of enterprise and initiative, I am equally strong about the importance of a value system in our society through which we can support each other and the importance of community.  I will not be provoked into giving my views on the public system except to say I believe access to State-funded services should be available to everybody on the basis of medical need and no other basis.  We are far from that ideal.  In all public hospitals a minimum of 20% of beds is ring-fenced for private patients and a consultant receives a private fee for any private patient who goes into the public hospital except through the accident and emergency department.  The same applies to the pathologists and radiologists if the person is in the accident and emergency department.  I have problems with that when taxpayers are funding the system.  We are trying to ensure that what the taxpayers fund is available only on the basis of medical need.  Who invests the money and how are minor issues, what matters is the standard of care.  I am strongly of the view that all consultants must be available to all patients not just a few.  That is the basis for some of our <Col N="2039"/>decisions but I refuse to be drawn into that debate.</P>
        <P>The current standards are the 1993 standards, which are deficient.  We have learnt a great deal since then.  The draft standards are available for discussion.  We held a good conference a couple of weeks ago to discuss them with many stakeholders, on foot of which they are being revised.  The Health Information and Equality Authority, which becomes effective after the introduction of the regulations on 11 May will be responsible for all these issues, particularly for enforcing them.</P>
        <P>I accept Senator Henry&rsquo;s point that we are great at inquiring and fact-finding but often do not draw the conclusions and change practice.  There is no point in holding this inquiry at the not inconsiderable cost of &euro;2 million unless we put into effect any conclusions reached.  Relative to a budget of &euro;15 billion the sum is not much but it could achieve much in other areas.  The standards will be phased in over three years, to deal with physical and environmental issues, rather than care.  This will take time and we must be reasonable and proportionate in our approach to this change.  I am delighted with the support for the establishment of the inquiry.  I wish it well and look forward to its conclusion and report within 12 months.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The changes contained in the scheme before the House primarily give effect in the risk equalisation scheme to the legislation enacted in February last amending the Health Insurance Acts in order to protect our system of community rating.</P>
        <P>In Ireland the policy of community rating means no health insurer can price people out of being able to afford their premiums as they get older and, therefore, more likely to need medical care.  This is a fair and equitable approach to take as it eliminates any possible discrimination on the basis of age and health status.  Risk equalisation is a necessary feature in a community rated market.</P>
        <P>Prior to the enactment of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2007, legislation had allowed new entrants to the market, such as VIVAS <Col N="2040"/>Health, to avail of a three-year exemption from the obligation to make risk equalisation payments.  The exemption was intended to give <i>bona fide</i> new entrants time to establish themselves and to build up market share.  It was clearly the intention of the Oireachtas when the measure was enacted that this exemption should be confined to new entrants coming into the market seeking to build up market share from zero by normal business practices.  The risk equalisation scheme reflected this exemption for new market entrants.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s view was that the exemption had to be removed to protect the operation of the community rated market.  This removal means related changes have to be made to the risk equalisation scheme.  Most of these changes, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, are of a technical nature to reflect the changes in the legislation.  As returns are made on a six-monthly basis, covering January to June and July to December each year, it is necessary to make the changes before the next returns are to be compiled and returned to the Health Insurance Authority before the end of July.</P>
        <P>I will briefly outline some of the main changes.  Having regard to the removal of the exemption, the receipt of the reports on the market and their views on the exemption, the Health Insurance Authority&rsquo;s report having proposed extending the phasing at the end of the three-year exemption over a further three years, and the need to ensure proportionality in the scheme, the payments that arise are being reduced to 80% of the current level.  The Government is satisfied the reduction is appropriate.</P>
        <P>The zero sum adjustment, a technical mathematical balancing of moneys within the scheme is also being amended.  While it was a minor feature in recent criticisms of the scheme, the opportunity is being taken to amend the formula in order that payments by any contributors will be clearly based on their own claims costs.</P>
        <P>The amendments in article 11(3) and related changes to the formula and data to be submitted are designed to ensure reported claims data remain consistent in circumstances where an undertaking is running down its business.  Some other minor technical amendments are addressed in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
        <P>A primary intention of the amended scheme is to balance the twin objectives of promoting competition in the health insurance market while at the same time protecting the integrity of community rating, both of which are to the benefit of the consumer.  The Government is satisfied the changes being made to the scheme are in the best interests of consumers and the development of the market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  It is not the first time she has been present to discuss the complicated matter of risk equalisation and the broader health insurance market.</P><Col N="2041"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>With regard to the Government&rsquo;s proposals on risk equalisation and health insurance and its performance over the past four or five years, it has achieved the unique and perhaps unwelcome distinction of upsetting Bupa, to such an extent that it has left the market, the Quinn group, to such an extent that it has the Government before the courts, the VHI, which is crying foul, and the EU Commission, which seems far from satisfied with our health insurance market.  There are challenges to be met, but they will not be met by this Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that it is necessary to have this matter dealt with before the next official deadline at the end of July.  Presumably, the new Government would have had time to reflect on the matter, and this course of action is rushed at the last minute.  In February we passed legislation removing the three year exemption.  That was last minute legislation.  Now, this Oireachtas is at its end game and we are debating this measure in a vacuum.  We need more time and explanation before we can be satisfied with what is being done.</P>
        <P>It is necessary to ensure the continuation of community rating but that can be addressed in various ways.  At one time the Minister and her Government colleagues claimed the present system of risk equalisation was sacrosanct and, not long ago, it was argued in both Houses that there could be no tampering with it.  However, the Minister is today recommending a 20% reduction in the level of risk equalisation, which indicates that the Government&rsquo;s attitude previously was not as perfect as it thought.</P>
        <P>I appreciate this is a complicated matter.  Our aim must be to ensure competition and the retention of community rating.  It is difficult to anticipate how the VHI will respond to this legislation.  There were many expressions of concern by VHI personnel about the risk equalisation mechanism.  The VHI was demanding the payment of the risk equalisation moneys, but those funds will now be 20% lower.  The VHI is almost a monopoly and, therefore, the Minister and the Department should closely examine its operations, competitiveness and efficiency.  It would not be unremarkable to find that a company of its size and in such a dominant position is not working as efficiently as it should.  Obviously, the next Government will have to reflect carefully on the future of the VHI.  In her radio interview this morning the Minister spoke about, although did not advocate, the possibility of mutualisation or some degree of privatisation.  These possibilities must be examined but our concern must be to ensure the customer has choice.</P>
        <P>We are hugely indebted to the Quinn group for taking on the Bupa mantle.  It has brought a degree of certainty to the market and, hopefully, the success of the Quinn group in the broader insurance market will be replicated in the health <Col N="2042"/>insurance market and there will continue to be choice.  However, there must be further reflection on the issue of community rating.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that as the D&aacute;il and Seanad reach their dissolution dates, we are putting through legislation which, although it must be passed within the next month or two, is being dealt with too hastily.  We have much experience of hastily drafted and passed legislation coming back to haunt us.  That is my concern about the measure before us.  It is not just late but also rushed and it could cause difficulties in the future.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing that we have not had more time to debate the recommendations of the various reports commissioned by the Minister.  Reports were produced by the Health Insurance Authority, the Competition Authority and the Barrington group and all had different recommendations.  Many questions still must be addressed and I am concerned that rushing through this measure could end up damaging the health insurance market and the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s action is necessary.  It is important the playing pitch is levelled in private health insurance.  Community rating is particularly important because it ensures no health insurer can price a person out of the market.  Risk equalisation is a necessary feature of the community rated market.  The VHI has approximately 1.5 million members; I am one of them.  The reason for the risk equalisation reduction to 80% is the abolition of the three year exemption.  It levels the playing pitch and will ensure consumers will not have to pay exorbitant premia.</P>
        <P>The VHI has used up a great deal of its reserves and these must now be rebuilt.  This can be done in two ways, either through an injection of capital by the State or by part privatisation.  The organisation is 50 years old and given that people are generally creatures of habit and do not like change, they would prefer the VHI to continue as it is in the insurance market.  I regret the decision of Bupa to withdraw from the market but that was its decision.</P>
        <P>It is easy to say this measure could have been deferred but it is never too late to do the right thing.  The Minister is doing the right thing in this case and I support the measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I have little to add.  This legislation is necessary and the Minister should proceed with it, if only to provide some degree of certainty to people as they prepare their accounts for the half year.  Nevertheless, I hope the Minister will regard it as a holding operation.  It should not deter us from considering a more fundamental review of the sector, particularly the role of the VHI.  Obviously, at my age I am supportive of risk equalisation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2043"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say the Senator is a good risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is necessary that operators in the sector reflect the broad range of risks both in the demography and epidemiology of the society.  There might be other ways of doing that.</P>
        <P>We should welcome the entry of Mr. Sean Quinn to the sector, not only for taking over Bupa at a difficult time for many people but also because his background in insurance indicates he is capable of injecting new life and ideas into the market.  While competition is necessary in this sector, a body such as the VHI is essentially anti-competitive.  The competition should be extended to the providers and the various insuring organisations can use their muscle and leverage to ensure a better deal.</P>
        <P>It is not a great idea to give transfers to people without being assured of their efficiency and effectiveness in using the money.  Over the years a comfortable relationship has grown up between the VHI and the hospitals and consultants, whereby the VHI sees itself as a conduit for supplying money to them.  The organisation could do an enormous amount for efficiency within the health sector by driving down prices for procedures such as scans, tests, treatments and so forth.  That should be borne in mind when the Minister is examining this issue.  This proposal, however, is sufficient for the day and I support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister.  She is a doughty fighter.  She took on a very difficult job.  I am not sure it was not a kamikaze mission but she did it honourably.  Although I will support these measures, I do so <i>faute de mieux</i>.</P>
        <P>This is a disgusting debate and I am a little shocked that not one contributor so far has mentioned the patients.  We have heard about the market, entering the field and the functioning of hospitals but we have not heard a word about the patients.  That is what interests me.  In a three page, double spaced speech the Minister mentioned the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; eight times, &ldquo;competition&rdquo; and all that sort of rubbish.</P>
        <P>I am glad Senator Ryan raised the question of competition.  I have been hammering on about that for the past year and I am getting increasingly sick of competition being made a little tin god and the automatic assumption that it delivers for the consumer.  It is clear that it does not always deliver.  It is clear from what happened with the groceries order.</P>
        <P>I ran the Hirschfeld Community Centre.  I was the only person who put my own money into it but then a couple of fly-by-nights opened up.  They have now become extremely wealthy people but they did not serve the community very well.  They put us to the pin of our collar and then buggered off whenever it suited them, not having paid their tax bills, and we were left in a situation <Col N="2044"/>where we did not have the resources to put into the community that we otherwise would have had.  I start, therefore, from a patient focused point of view and I am not impressed by the market.  It is essential that every citizen of this State have access to health care and it is an obscenity that they do not.  That is the result of the Minister&rsquo;s market and the sooner we stop this nonsense, the better.</P>
        <P>I realise the Minister has a very busy life but perhaps she saw one or two of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programmes, one of which concerned a woman in County Kilkenny who did not join the VHI, partly because of principle and partly for penury reasons.  She believed in a State system.  She got a cancer test but the results were delayed.  It took six months to get the results, by which time the cancer was untreatable.  That woman was effectively sentenced to death by the market that all Members praise.  That is revolting.  Why should a citizen be sentenced to death because of poverty?  The State already has some responsibility for the poverty in which these people live but to deny them treatment is wrong, and it goes on and on.</P>
        <P>Another programme concerned a very decent, hard working doctor who ran a clinic in Naas, County Kildare.  He had the same story to tell.  A patient of his had died because she was in the public service, not in the VHI.  I would like the VHI to come in fully under Government and become a real national institution strongly supported by the State.  Health care should be nationalised.  I am not in favour of the market.  It is disgusting that people talk about markets when we are talking about people&rsquo;s health and the right to life.  We should ensure we provide adequate health care for every citizen of this State and we are not doing it.  We should fully invest in the VHI.  There will be flabbiness, as Senator Hayes mentioned, but that is the case in the private system as well.  A fully capitalised, funded and supported health service for all that delivers to the people is what I want.</P>
        <P>I support this measure because it provides risk equalisation.  The Minister was courageous in fighting this battle, and more power to her, but she is fighting it in the wrong context.  The market may be all right for groceries, sweets and so on, although I am not sure that is the case, or for betting and gambling, but people&rsquo;s health is the fundamental concern.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget the way BUPA behaved.  It scarpered but the Minister dealt with that well.  She pointed out that in similar circumstances in Australia &mdash; I heard it on the radio &mdash; it managed to make a profit but it was not big enough.  That is the problem.  It is too greedy.  I want a proper national health service that delivers for all our citizens.</P>
        <P>I support the motion <i>faute de mieux</i>.  I hope the Minister and I are both re-elected and that we can go hammer and tongs on this issue because it <Col N="2045"/>is ideological.  The Minister is a voter and I might alienate her in my constituency but I do not give a damn because I feel strongly on this issue.  I hope we will have an opportunity to have it out again and again.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If I were, I would only be following in Senator Ryan&rsquo;s footsteps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be a good deal less colourful.  I agree with the core of what Senator Norris said.  I am at a loss to understand how a blinkered economic commentariat in this country and other countries can talk about competition as an inherently good thing in the provision of health care.  I have written to newspapers and I have said it in the House on many occasions that if market efficiencies make for good health care, why has the United States the most expensive health care system in the world by a factor of nearly<?oasys _jy ?>70%?  Between 15% and 17% of US gross domestic product is spent on health care.  We spend 7% or 8% &mdash; the Minister can correct me on that.  Even on a gross national product basis, the US spends nearly twice as much.  The outcome of that is a lower life expectancy than most of western Europe and a spectacularly higher incidence of infant mortality than the rest of the comparatively wealthy world.  That is a fact.  I am a pragmatist.  What works is what matters to me and I have no patience with ideology of left or right on these issues.  The US health care system, the most market-based in the world, does not work.</P>
        <P>The liberal market model of a competitive market is based on a number of assumptions, one of which is that the withdrawal of one participant from the market will not affect the market.  The flurry of activity we had in the past six months makes it clear that the withdrawal of a participant from the market has a profound effect on the market.  The two basic platforms are, first, the assumption that there is something like a market and, second, that it is an acceptable model to describe the way to deliver health care.  Both of them are at variance with the facts, not with my ideology.  The fundamental problem is the belief concerning market discipline, whatever that means.</P>
        <P>People talk about efficiency in health care, for instance.  It is a fact that 50% of all health care expenditure in the United States is spent on people in the last six months of their lives.  If we want to be brutally efficient, let them die six months earlier and half the budget will be saved.  Effectively, that is what many of the health maintenance organisations, HMOs, are doing in the United States because a bureaucrat, not a doctor, decides what treatment is appropriate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Are we moving in that direction?  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today a commentary from the <Col N="2046"/>Barrington report which mentioned dividing up our health care system into three: the public system, community-rated health insurance and luxury health insurance, which is not community-rated.  I do not know what efficiency that might create other than to reassure the super rich that they will have a health service all to themselves which they can pay for at whatever exorbitant rates they are charged, and it will not be competitive.</P>
        <P>The idea that the market is an appropriate way to allocate resources in health care efficiently, and that must be defined properly, is at variance with the facts.  The European health care systems have their limitations but they deliver better quality health care for ordinary citizens than the alternative model, which is the US model of privatised health care based on private or no insurance and an appallingly inadequate public health service.  That is the evidence, so what are we doing here?</P>
        <P>I am numerate and can handle numbers and figures.  However, this is as confusing a statutory instrument as I have ever read.  The explanatory memorandum, like many before, says the same thing in a separate language.  Assuming the Minister is telling us what is in it, it amounts to an attempt to restore some kind of community rating.  Underlying it is the belief that a health service would be better if it were based on a competitive market model.  One cannot have such a model in a publicly owned health service or at least where the dominant force is publicly owned.  The underlying belief is that we must privatise the health service to make it efficient.  That is a very dangerous route to go, which is what worries me about this measure and why I am unhappy about it.  It is a bad idea and pushing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas in two sessions, each lasting 40 minutes, is the wrong way to deal with something that is very complicated and quite serious.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with my two colleagues who have just spoken.  I agree with the Minister because I do not believe it is about competition in the provision of health care.  Rather, it is about competition in the cost of provided health care, which is the essential difference.</P>
        <P>I have dealt and fought with the VHI over the years where I believed it put charges on my cost which should not have arisen.  Therefore, it is not about the health service.  It is about the cost charged to ordinary people for availing of support in the health service.  I know I cannot go any further than that.  Can I take my two minutes now?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what has been said.  First, I agree that everybody should have access to health care on the basis of medical need.  Everybody in Ireland has universal coverage, which was not the case when the VHI was established 50 years ago.  Everybody in Ireland is entitled to universal coverage in our hospital system.</P>
        <P>The problem is that our public hospitals are a hive of private activity.  Approximately 20% of the beds are ring-fenced for private patients.  Consultants, with the exception of accident and emergency consultants, get a fee for everybody who goes into hospital, regardless what bed patients occupy.  It is an extraordinary system.  Even pathologists and radiologists who treat accident and emergency cases get a private fee from the insurers for reading the tests.</P>

	<P>The Minister forgot to mention that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To be fair, psychiatrists in the private system are not the high earners.  I am talking about acute services, excluding psychiatry, although private psychiatric hospitals exist, such St. Patrick&rsquo;s, which is a completely private institution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a hive of private activity in the public hospital system.  Much of my approach recently has been to try to separate that and ensure every patient gets access to those facilities on the basis of medical need.  If there is private provision of health care and money to be invested in health care, I want to encourage it, provided everybody can have access to high-quality treatment.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford accused me of tampering.  In the court case and other reviews, it has always been suggested that the form, rather than the principle, of risk equalisation should be constantly reviewed.  A few months ago, we got rid of the three-year holiday where companies came into the market and paid nothing for three years. <Col N="2048"/> We never envisaged that a corporate structure could be used to take over an existing entity and avail of that three-year exemption.  That loophole was closed.  By virtue of closing it, we must bring in an order to facilitate any risk equalisation from that company.  That order was necessary.  We are going with the figure of 80% recommended by the Barrington report.  There is also an EU dimension that felt that getting rid of the three-year exemption may have been a bit harsh and that we needed to be more proportionate.</P>
        <P>This represents a loss of &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million to the VHI per year.  To put it into perspective, the VHI earns more than &euro;1 billion in premium income.  The loss is less than 1% of what it earns.  The Senator&rsquo;s party opposed the emergency legislation.  If this had not come in, the VHI would have lost 15 times more than it will lose through this particular measure.  It would have lost &euro;150 million.  There are other issues.</P>
        <P>This is not a wide debate on everything.  The Government has decided that by the end of 2008, the VHI must be authorised by the regulator.  This means it must meet the solvency requirements of its competitors and that the derogation goes.  The landscape will be changed completely.  I hate to use words such as &ldquo;market&rdquo; after hearing Senator Norris, but the reality is that we want to see a number of companies providing good products.  One does not get innovation where there is a single supplier in any market.  Competition is not perfect but it is much better than if none exists, as we see in many other markets.  One gets more innovation and more price-sensitive products.  The VHI has a 75% share of this market.  If we were to go back to a situation where the VHI had a 100% share of the market, it would not be satisfactory and nobody would favour it.</P>
        <P>For many reasons, we must continue to review the level of the risk equalisation.  The VHI argues that we do not risk equalise enough.  There are a number of recommendations about lifetime cover, lifetime community rating and encouraging young people by giving them incentives to join early so that one has a pool of young people and, therefore, one makes insurance more affordable.  That has been put out for discussion.  Owing to the fact that we have open enrolment in Ireland, anyone with an insurance company, no matter how sick he or she is, can switch to another company without any penalty or loss of time.  This is not understood and is among the changes that will be introduced on foot of the Barrington report, which is pro-members and pro-subscribers to private health insurance, which is a good thing.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="2049"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister staying for the two minutes.  Mothers of newborn babies leaving hospitals in Dublin get what is called a bounty pack, which, among other things, contains a box of nappies and a few yoghurt cartons.  What I am proposing today is in the context of the document which I believe the Health Service Executive recently sent to every house in Ireland.  This bounty pack is done by private tender and is administered through the voluntary maternity hospitals in Dublin.  It is not paid for by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE should now also produce an educational pack which would, essentially, contain an information booklet and a sample toy.  The booklet would get new parents interested and help them understand that the educational process begins on day one.  It would contain simple and easy things, such as stressing how to communicate with the baby or the importance of eye contact, smiles, talking, singing and introducing babies to the five senses &mdash; seeing and listening to things, speaking, taste, smell and touch.  It would stress basic things and why they should be done.  It is very simple, crucial and effective advice.  It would keep stressing the fact that children are educated from day one and that a quiet room is usually not the best place for a baby.  We want places with distractions to which they will respond and react and which they will grow with and understand.  This is all positive.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>That kind of pack, which allows parents to understand in simple terms how their children are being brought along at very low cost, would also help identify difficulties and the need for intervention.  I could speak for half an hour but wish to respect my limit of two minutes.  As the Minister is sitting here by coincidence, I wish to say that the HSE might consider doing something.  The executive has dealt very nicely with the issue of education in the document it has sent to households, but it might produce something for mothers of newborn babies.  This is not my idea.  I plundered it from a woman who wrote to me suggesting that this might be a very good idea.  I thought it was a simple, effective and worthwhile measure that could be done at little or no cost.  I will leave it with the Minister to ponder over lunch.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad Eireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P el="0" Just="Left">The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State <Col N="2050"/>(Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June next.  In previous years, this kind of resolution was usually moved in June.  However, to avoid any uncertainty surrounding sittings of either the D&aacute;il or this House between now and 30 June, the decision was made to bring forward the consideration of this issue.  A similar approach occurred in 2002 and it is fully in accordance with the law.</P>
        <P>The 1998 Act was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bomb of August 1998, which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others.  That callous atrocity occurred a few months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and was clearly designed to derail the peace process.  Thankfully, that end was not achieved.  We are now moving inexorably towards an historic new beginning with the re-institution of devolved administration in Northern Ireland.  There is an ongoing criminal action against a person in Northern Ireland for those murders which arose from the Omagh bombing.  A civil action is also being pursued by the families of the victims against a number of persons.  The re-trial of another person in connection with the bombing is also pending in this jurisdiction.  Moreover, the investigation into the bombing remains open on both sides of the Border, and there continues to be excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the PSNI in this regard.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that certain sections of the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas.  The purpose of this recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to determine if current circumstances justify the continuance in force of those provisions.  Accordingly, by virtue of resolutions passed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on 14 and 15 June 2006, respectively, the relevant sections of the 1998 Act will cease to operate on and from 30 June next unless a further resolution is passed by each House, authorising those sections to continue to operate for a further period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
        <P>Part of the process surrounding the Seanad&rsquo;s consideration of the renewal of sections of the Act requires the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on their operation before the House prior to the resolution being moved.  The Minister laid such a report before this House on 17 April.  The conclusion of that report is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act should remain in force for a further 12 months.  In the first instance, this is the firm view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which considers the Act to be vital in the continuing fight against terrorism.  Secondly, the harsh reality is that, notwithstanding very positive developments in respect of the Provisional IRA, the dissident republican threat remains real and ever present.</P><Col N="2051"/>
        <P Just="Left">As evidence of this unfortunate conclusion, I refer Senators to the 15th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, published yesterday, which focuses on the period from December 2006 to February 2007.  In that report, the Continuity IRA is found to have been responsible for a pipe bomb which failed to explode next to Lurgan PSNI station in December 2006.  The Continuity IRA also attempted to acquire weapons and undertook terrorist training.  It was engaged in smuggling, fuel laundering and robbery. Furthermore, the report states that the Continuity IRA was responsible for two murders.  These will be more fully reported in the IMC&rsquo;s next report, as they fall outside the scope of the current report.  The IMC&rsquo;s overall assessment of the Continuity IRA is that it remains active but, for political reasons coming up to the elections last month in Northern Ireland, it was possibly less active than it might have been.</P>
        <P>&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, a relatively new splinter group of the Continuity IRA, has recently become dangerously active.  In particular, it claimed responsibility for three pipe bomb attacks against PSNI premises and homes of PSNI officers, of which one functioned but only to a limited extent.  Moreover, it is reported that persons associated with &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann were discovered in possession of bomb making and other terrorist equipment in February 2007.</P>
        <P>The IMC states that the Real IRA was responsible for a failed mortar attack on Craigavon PSNI station in December 2006.  The organisation has continued to engage in serious crime, including smuggling, fuel laundering and robbery, and it has also continued to recruit and attempt to procure weapons.  Although the Real IRA was less active recently, the IMC assesses that this was purely a tactical decision, so as not to weaken the position of the anti-policing republican candidates in the run-up to the recent Northern Ireland elections.</P>
        <P>The pattern of dissident republicans lending their bomb-making expertise to organised criminal gangs is now well established and has become something of a cottage industry for some individuals.  One of the most recent examples of this was in County Clare earlier this month, when a viable device was found under the car of a targeted individual.  This is a deeply disturbing development and one which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is actively seeking to counter.</P>
        <P>In addition to domestic terrorist groups, the international terrorist threat continues unabated.  The most recent example of this in Europe was the planned liquid explosive attacks on civil aviation targets between Britain and the US, which were thankfully foiled in August 2006.  The consequences of those foiled attacks have been felt around the world through much more rigorous and extensive security arrangements at air<Col N="2052"/>ports, including Irish airports.  Although the extent of the terrorist threat within the European Union varies greatly from one member state to another, it would be naive to imagine that Ireland is completely immune from these new forms of terrorism.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences against the State Acts, including the 1998 Act, against international terrorist groups and individuals.  Other countries have enacted even more stringent legislation in response to the international terrorist threat.  In Britain, for instance, 28-day detention is now permitted.  In that context, the provisions of the 1988 Act can be seen as a very measured response.  However, I would caution against any complacency in our response to the threat from terrorism.</P>
        <P>I will not rehearse all the statistics provided by the Garda authorities showing the extent of the use made of the various provisions of the 1998 Act, as this information is already fully set out in the report laid before the House last week.  However, in the reporting period in question, that is, from 1 June 2006, to 7 April 2007, the total number of persons arrested under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, as amended, was 692.  Of these, 247 were arrested using the provisions of the Offences against the State Act 1939, as amended by the 1998 Act, or had the provisions of the 1998 Act invoked against them.  In the same reporting period, 21 convictions were secured in the courts, with a further 102 persons awaiting trial.  These facts speak for themselves in terms of the continued need for the 1998 Act.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate fact remains that dissident republican groups remain active, ruthless and determined to strike if given the opportunity.  They remain resolutely opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and to the peace and devolution of powers it has brought.  They remain determined to destroy that agreement and I suggest they remain prepared and willing to kill indiscriminately to this end.  As long as they continue to exist, there must be robust counter measures available to the State.  The Oireachtas, and the people of this State, would rightly question the Government&rsquo;s commitment to defeating these organisations if we did not ensure adequate legislative provisions to meet that threat.</P>
        <P>It is worth remembering, not as rhetoric but as a reflection of reality, that a terrorist organisation needs to get lucky only once to cause significant loss of life.  It is essential, therefore, to have the means to prevent such acts.  For such powers to work, they must work preventively.  Otherwise, we risk handing the initiative to those organisations.  We cannot do so.  The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is one element of the State&rsquo;s ongoing defence against the terror<Col N="2053"/>ist threat.  I urge this House not to countenance weakening any of the tools the State has at its disposal in the fight against terrorism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael supports this resolution to extend the provisions of the 1998 Act.  This is not an academic exercise.  A total of 247 persons were arrested under these provisions during the period under review.  Alarmingly, we see more and more clear evidence of links between dissident republicans and gangland crime and of dissident republicans co-operating with crime lords.  Unfortunately, the legacy of paramilitarism is alive and well, and it must be countered.</P>
        <P>As part of this effort, we must ensure the availability to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the necessary powers to deal with those involved.  It is not a question of isolated incidents; some 247 people were arrested last year under the provisions of this legislation.  New crime figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office included one truly alarming figure.  The number of offences for the discharge of firearms has increased by 41% compared with the first quarter of last year, an indication of the increasing incidence of offenders resorting to firearms.  This offers clear proof that former paramilitaries are now making available their expertise and peddling their wares to gang overlords in our society.</P>
        <P>We must confront this issue with every possible legitimate means.  In the wake of the Omagh bombing, it was considered that certain measures were necessary to confront the dissident republican threat.  That is why the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was brought into force by the Oireachtas.  Fine Gael supported the enactment of that measure and supports its continuation.</P>
        <P>In some ways, the threat facing the people of this State is now even greater.  There is clear evidence that the country is awash with firearms, and we have had a failed amnesty.  There is evidence of increasing use of firearms in a growing number of crimes.  We also have clear evidence that those who have acquired experience and expertise in this area in the past are now either directly involved in gangland criminal activity or are making their knowledge available to those so involved.  This can be seen from the pipe bomb incidents the Minister of State mentioned.  We must confront these people, and one way of so doing is to continue the operation of this Act.</P>
        <P>It will not happen, however, while the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continually denied resources in terms of manpower and equipment.  Instead of an additional 2,000 garda&iacute;, only 1,178 have been appointed in the five years the Government has been in power.  There is also a problem with equipment, on which promises were made and not kept.  Garda&iacute;, in confronting armed criminals, are still operating walkie-talkies that are 20 years old.  We have no option but to continue these pro<Col N="2054"/>visions as one part of the legal armoury available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enabling it to arrest people involved in these heinous crimes.</P>
        <P>The State has a duty to defend the rights of citizens.  If citizens&rsquo; lives are threatened by groups that contemptuously consider themselves to be outside the jurisdiction of the State, the power to protect such people must be given by the State, and the Legislature, to the officeholders of the Government, the Garda and the courts.  For as long as there are groups and individuals bent on usurping the democratic institutions of this jurisdiction, the State must have at its disposal the means to protect itself and its citizens.  I fully support the continuation of these provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  At the time this legislation was introduced, we all hoped its provisions might be made redundant in time.  However, the Minister of State has made a strong argument for their retention.  It is worth pointing out that many of these provisions, which were introduced following the Omagh bombing, will be transposed into the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 which we will debate shortly.</P>
        <P>Although the provisions are sensible, I am of the view that some of them should be in place only as long as is necessary.  I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard and I have read the report showing the use that was made of the legislation, particularly in the period from June 2006 to April of this year.  I was surprised at the number of times certain provisions of the Act were used by the Garda and the courts.</P>
        <P>While a threat remains, it has undoubtedly diminished significantly.  Tremendous progress has been made in the peace process which hopefully obviates the perceived need, as the perpetrators would see it, for any such terrorist activity.  All of us who are republicans appeal to those people to cease their activities.  Many who were involved in such activities in the past have slowly come to the view that the best way of achieving long-term stability and the unification of the people of this island is through the democratic and peaceful process.  As progress continues, one hopes that others who have not yet come to that conclusion will do so without delay.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Act relate to such issues as the following: the right to silence; inferences that may be drawn from an accused&rsquo;s exercising of that right or from a failure to mention certain facts; notification of witnesses; directing of an unlawful organisation; possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences; withholding of information; and so on.  These are commonsense arrangements.  If a person seeks to rely upon witnesses, for example, it makes sense that he or she must notify an intent to do so in advance.  The Act provides for a period of detention of up to 72 hours, but I understand a period of seven days is provided for in the Criminal <Col N="2055"/>Justice Bill.  Some of the measures in the Act have, therefore, been overtaken by the need for more stringent regulations.</P>
        <P>It is desirable that these provisions should be incorporated into mainstream legislation, whether in the criminal justice area or otherwise, rather than specifically targeting a particular category of offenders.  The legislation has been used primarily against republicans.  We must be mindful, however, that since the introduction of this legislation, international terrorism has become a major threat to the civilised world.  Many unfortunate incidents have highlighted that.  We know some of those involved in this activity are living in this country.  It strikes me as a little odd that the provisions of this legislation have never been used against that category of person.  I hope it is focused not just on the republican side but that the international aspects of terrorism are considered.</P>
        <P>Legislation is only one element of the armoury for tackling this area.  It is not a replacement for good Garda management.  Effective management is a challenge facing all layers of the public service.  That is not to take from the many fine people in senior positions, but in general management is not uniform.  It is like a patchwork quilt.  The legislation is not a substitute for good policing practices or effective gathering of intelligence.  That we have had no major incidents gives credence to the belief that the Garda is operating effectively.  The preservation of evidence in files and the sensible exercise of judicial discretion are important factors of an effective system in countering criminality in general.</P>
        <P>I was shocked also at the poor performance of the Garda over 20 years in preserving vital and crucial evidence, which would be elementary, and in maintaining files in a manner to allow cases to be prosecuted.  I hope the failures of the past have been put right, but I am not convinced.  I hope the recently established inspectorate will examine all these regularly and systematically to ensure the failures are not repeated.  I would like to see a holistic approach to the implementation of the legislation.  We look forward to the day when such legislation will no longer be necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nine years ago I opposed this legislation when it came before the House.  I will not give the Minister of State or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform an opportunity to take a cheap shot at the Labour Party in the period leading up to an election by calling a vote.  I will put on record my scepticism about this type of legislation.</P>
        <P>Terrorism is dreadful but looking back over the past century, in every decade nasty governments killed more people than any group of terrorists.  Governments are maintaining that record.  That is not a justification but is a fact that informs this <Col N="2056"/>debate.  Dealing with the threat of politically driven violence against civilians, which is my definition of terrorism, requires appropriate legal powers and a well trained and equipped police force.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the reports from the new Garda inspectorate, which are very pro-garda&iacute;, identify a list of things which we would associate with the complaints of the Garda Representative Association but which have turned out to be factually based, such as inadequate and out-of-date equipment, incomplete training and the upgrading of technical and other equipment at a pace incredibly unrelated to reality.  We now know this is a fact.  It is important that some sort of commitment is made to ensure the Garda does not spend an inordinate amount of time and energy seeking equipment we take for granted.  I recall when it emerged that the Garda fraud squad did not have a fax machine because it had been in existence for only five years.  What the Garda needs and is entitled to is cutting edge equipment and skills, and when new forensic systems or skills become available, we should ensure they are available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na immediately and not after a process of evaluation, questioning and checking.  Once it works in one country, we should use it.</P>
        <P>We must ensure powers are used as intended.  The disturbing report from the Data Protection Commissioner, about which we cannot get a detailed response from the T&aacute;naiste, despite the best efforts of Deputy Howlin, states that phone messages of innocent citizens are being intercepted by the Garda, which in his view is out of proportion to any perceived threat.  We now learn that Army intelligence is doing the same.  Apart from the fact that parallel agencies are doing the same job when one agency could deal with external threats and the other with internal ones and be more effectively deployed, this gives rise to many issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am always suspicious that when terrorists perpetrate an appalling act, we get another raft of legislation.  That is the cheapest way to respond.  It does not cost much to amend the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act but it would cost a great deal more to give the Garda the secure, powerful radio and computer systems, secure and powerful forensic back-up, high-quality, up-to-date modern training and a continuing process of professional renewal. The idea that the Garda could deal with the threats of 2007 with the training of 25 years ago is nonsense.  That would not work in my profession.</P>
        <P>I do not welcome this resolution.  I tolerate it but I believe it is a smokescreen for the more difficult, demanding and expensive parts of the struggle against national and international terrorism, those parts being resources and training for those who have the job of defending us.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2057"/>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for their contributions.  In an ideal world we would not need this resolution but as long as there are groups and individuals who are bent on usurping the democratic  institutions of this jurisdiction, the State must have the means at its disposal to protect itself.  We know from bitter experience that these organisations have few qualms, if any, in the methods they use to further their aims.  It is their willingness to bomb and kill and the contempt they show for the democratically elected Government that maintains the need for this Act.  The people of this island, North and South, have already shown through their endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement their rejection of violence as a feature of political struggle.  Until the various offshoots of the republican movement who remain committed to violence give up the gun, the State will be required to continue to take various measures to ensure the safety of the public.</P>
        <P>In my earlier statement I mentioned the threat posed by international terrorism.  It is no exaggeration to state that the environment in which the State seeks to protect itself from terrorism has undergone drastic transformations with the rise of certain forms of international terrorism.  Ireland, in common with its EU partners, continues to have a duty to contribute proactively to international security in the interests of public safety, domestically and internationally.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences Against State Acts against international terrorist groups and individuals.</P>
        <P>Although I do not wish to be in any way alarmist, it would be naive of anyone to think that Ireland does not need to have at its disposal the instruments necessary to fight international terrorism.  Notwithstanding significant and welcome progress in Northern Ireland, the fact remains that this will not impact in the slightest in the short term on those groups which have never acknowledged the legitimacy of the democratically expressed wishes of the people of Ireland, North and South.</P>
        <P>As is evidenced in the report laid before this House, the provisions of the 1998 Act remain actively in use and are yielding results.  Equally, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is clearly adopting a balanced and reasoned approach to the powers at its disposal.  As the Garda authorities themselves state, the 1998 Act is regularly used and is proving to be a vital piece of legislation in the continuing fight against terrorism.</P>
        <P>I join with colleagues in this House in looking forward to a time when the Act is no longer needed.  Unfortunately, that day has clearly not yet arrived.  In the meantime, the State must use <Col N="2058"/>all legitimate means to respond to the dissident paramilitary threat.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify a few issues that were raised in the debate.  The total number of garda&iacute;, including recruits, now adds up to more than 14,000.  The Government is committed to increasing that number to 16,000.  With regard to crime figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to present the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 to this House.  Senators will be aware that this Bill represents the Government&rsquo;s legislative response to gangland crime.  Its basic aim is that the law enforcement agencies, be they the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Director of Public Prosecutions, should have the means to tackle more effectively the great scourge of gangland crime.  I believe the Bill will satisfy that aim.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, the Bill has completed all Stages in the other House where we had very successful and productive debates.  Members will, no doubt, also be aware of the level of comment and debate the Bill has attracted from sources outside the Oireachtas since its publication.  I know the T&aacute;naiste was impressed by many of the points made both in the other House and by interested parties outside.  As a result, he was pleased to bring forward several amendments of his own and he was also pleased to accept several amendments proposed by the Opposition.  The Bill I present today is, therefore, more refined and targeted legislation.  It is a better Bill because, as a Government, we listened to those who made their points rationally and with a genuine concern to see effective anti-gangland measures.  The T&aacute;naiste has always acknowledged that the Bill contains tough measures.  He <Col N="2060"/>has also stated that the measures are both necessary and proportionate to the threat we face from organised gangland crime.  The amendments I have spoken of ensure, more than ever, that we are proportionate in our response to gangland crime.  The amendments have ensured the Bill is more targeted and focused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although it has been amended, the Bill retains all its essential elements regarding, for example, mandatory sentences for repeat offenders and post-release supervision arrangements.  It will be clear, however, that as a result of a thorough review of several of these issues, which took full account of genuine concerns expressed inside and outside the Oireachtas, the T&aacute;naiste has been able to amend these provisions to ensure they address and target much more precisely those who it was always intended should be the target of the legislation, namely, serious gangland criminals.  It will do so without undue or excessive interference with the rights or freedoms of other persons.</P>
        <P>Legislation such as this is clearly important.  I stress that the Government is not relying solely or mainly on legislative changes in tackling the problem of gangland crime.  As a Government, we recognise the need for more and improved resources to help the Garda, in particular, as it seeks to build intelligence and undertake difficult surveillance and investigations.  While we are fully committed to the idea that good police work is essential to a successful outcome, we recognise that good police work requires resources and manpower.</P>
        <P>The Government has, over the past decade, built up the Garda in an unprecedented way.  In December last, it responded rapidly and in a substantive manner to an upsurge in gangland crime, by agreeing a major package of anti-crime measures which included a further increase of 1,000 in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring the total to 15,000 over the next three years; sanction for 300 additional civilian administrative support posts for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to release garda&iacute; for frontline duties; recruitment for the seven senior civilian posts recommended in recent reports by Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, head of the Garda inspectorate, and Senator Maurice Hayes of this House; an increase in the retirement age for garda&iacute;, sergeants and inspectors from 57 years to 60 years; a proportionate increase in the targeted strength of the Garda reserve from 900 to 1,500; increased staffing for the forensic science laboratory, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service; and no limit on funds available for the witness protection programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before I outline the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions, the T&aacute;naiste would like me to pay tribute to the valuable input from the Balance in the Criminal Law review group.  When he established the review group under the chairmanship of Dr. Gerard <Col N="2061"/>Hogan, SC, the T&aacute;naiste asked it to examine many of the broader issues in relation to the criminal law.  The group prepared an interim report on the right to silence at the beginning of February and its recommendations are reflected in Part 4 of the Bill.  It has since published its final report, a wide-ranging document which will form the basis for a comprehensive debate on the state of the criminal law.  While some of its recommendations have been taken on board in the Bill, particularly regarding the right to silence, I have no doubt many of its remaining recommendations will find their way into future legislation.</P>
        <P>I will now give the House an outline of the Bill&rsquo;s main elements.  In the time available I may not be able to mention every issue but I will deal with all the significant areas.  The Bill has 60 sections in nine Parts, with two Schedules.  Part 1 deals with standard items such as commencement and interpretation.  Part 2, which includes sections 5 to 23, inclusive, updates the law on bail.  I will concentrate on sections 6, 7, 11 to 13, inclusive, and 19.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that the applicant for bail may be required to provide a statement on his or her assets and income as well as details of any criminal convictions and previous bail applications.  Section 7 provides that a chief superintendent may give his or her opinion that the applicant, if given bail, is likely to commit a serious offence and that the application should therefore be refused.  Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, provide that a person granted bail may be subject to electronic monitoring if the bail is conditional on the person being or not being in certain places at certain specified times.  Section 19 provides the prosecution with a right of appeal against the grant of bail or in respect of any conditions attaching to bail, where it is granted.  Such a right is not currently available to the prosecution.  This section also allows the High Court to transfer bail applications to the Circuit Court in cases where the case is triable by the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>The changes being introduced by Part 2 will ensure the prosecution authorities are in a position to mount a more effective challenge to bail applications where there is a likelihood of the applicant committing serious offences if given bail.</P>
        <P>Part 3, which covers sections 24 to 27, inclusive, deals with sentencing.  Before I outline the nature of the proposed provisions I remind the House of some general remarks made by the T&aacute;naiste on sentencing at Second Stage in the Other House.  He made the point then that there must be consistency in sentencing.  When it comes to the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions applicable to, for example, section 15A on drug trafficking offences, the will of the Oireachtas, which is also the will of the people, is that a conviction should lead to a ten-year sentence with seven and a half years being served, taking <Col N="2062"/>account of remission for good conduct.  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated, this provision is neither disproportionate nor arbitrary but a conservative measure that reflects the values of society.  It was established for the guidance of the Judiciary and to deter people in the drugs trade who may be tempted to resume their criminal activities after serving short sentences.</P>
        <P>Most people agree that the evidence available to us suggests a lack of consistency in sentencing, especially for drugs and firearm offences.  This circumstance leads to calls for legislation.  The T&aacute;naiste was clear when he stated that the people expect coherent, rational and consistent sentencing in the courts.  He was also clear in stating his own preference, namely, the development of an effective sentencing jurisprudence by the courts.  He added that, collectively and individually, the independence of the Judiciary is enhanced rather than damaged by collective measures taken by the Judiciary to ensure consistency, rationality and coherence in sentencing.  The T&aacute;naiste gave his personal assurance that he would give every backing through resources and legislation to achieve that end.</P>
        <P>Schedule 2 is central to Part 3.  The offences in Schedule 2 are among the most serious known to the criminal law and include all the offences typically associated with gangland crime, including drug trafficking and firearms offences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 25 provides that a person who commits any one of the scheduled offences and has been given a sentence of five years' imprisonment or more and who within seven years commits another one of the scheduled offences will be subject to a penalty of imprisonment equal to at least three quarters of the maximum laid down by law for the second offence in question.  Where the second offence carries a potential maximum of life imprisonment, a sentence of at least ten years must be imposed.  This section will not apply where it would be disproportionate to do so.  This is intended to ensure the section is applied only in the way it is intended, namely, to serious gangland cases.  Equally, it ensures the section is not applied to other persons who may technically come within this section but are not linked to gangland activity.  The aim and focus is on gangland offenders.</P>
        <P>Section 26 provides the court with two post-release options in the case of persons convicted of a scheduled offence.  It may impose a monitoring order, whereby the Garda may track an offender&rsquo;s movements and, as a result, build intelligence and establish that the person has not returned to criminal activity.  The court may additionally or alternatively impose a protection of persons order, which can ensure that victims and other persons are not molested or harassed by the offender.  In both cases the orders may last for up to seven years.  These provisions on sentencing are innovative and reflect the need to find <Col N="2063"/>new ways to meet the challenge we face from organised crime.</P>
        <P>Part 4, which covers sections 28 to 32, inclusive, deals with the right to silence.  I will deal with sections 28 to 30, inclusive, together.  Section 28 inserts a new version of section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  Section 29 inserts a new version of section 19 of the 1984 Act, while section 30 inserts a new section 19A into the 1984 Act.  The provisions in sections 18, 19 and 19A, by virtue of coming under the 1984 Act, are applicable to all arrestable offences.  Sections 18 and 19 will deal with inferences that may be drawn from a failure or refusal to account for certain marks or stains or from being present at a certain place at a particular time.  Section 19A will deal with a failure to mention while being questioned something that is later relied on by the accused in his or her defence.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will highlight certain important features of the new proposals.  Under the current provision in sections 18 and 19, inferences may be drawn only if it is the arresting garda who asks the arrested person to account for, in the case of section 18, objects or marks or, in the case of section 19, his or her presence in a particular place, and the person refuses or fails to do so.  This has proven to be a significant restriction on the operation of these sections.  Under the revised version now being proposed for sections 18 and 19 and the new section 19A, any garda questioning the suspect may ask him or her to account for the objects, marks or, as the case may be, his or her presence in a particular place.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P Just="Left">The court may draw inferences in situations where it is determining whether the person is guilty or where it is considering an application for dismissal of the charge in the course of a trial on the basis that there is no case to answer.  It is proposed that the court may draw an inference only where the circumstances in question clearly call for an explanation.  An inference may be drawn only where it is or is capable of being treated as corroboration for any other evidence on the matter.  A person may not, however, be convicted solely or mainly on an inference.  The court may take account of the point in time when the accused first gave an account in about the objects or marks or presence at the place.  The court must not draw inferences unless it is satisfied the accused had been given a caution in clear terms and had access to a solicitor before failing or refusing to answer the question put to him or her by the investigating garda.  An electronic recording of the interview must be available before an inference is drawn, unless the accused had refused to have the questioning recorded.</P>
        <P>Since the new section 19A, with sections 18 and 19, has general application to all arrestable offences, it is no longer necessary to have more specific provisions.  As a result, section 7 of the <Col N="2064"/>Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and section 5 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 are being repealed.  This is being effected by section 3 and Schedule 1 of the Bill.  Section 7 of the 1996 Act and section 5 of the 1998 Act covered the same ground as the new section 19A, but to a more limited extent than is now proposed.</P>
        <P>Section 31 amends and updates section 2 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  Section 2 is more specific than section 5 of the 1998 Act in that it relates to inferences that may apply in cases relating to membership of an illegal organisation.  It would, therefore, be appropriate to repeal it but it is being amended to include, in particular, the safeguards now generally available under sections 18, 19 and 19A of the 1984 Act in the case of arrestable offences.  Section 32 provides a new basis for the making of statutory regulations in regard to the content and the administration of cautions.</P>
        <P>This completes a full revision of the law in this area and goes further in some respects than had been recommended by the review group, for example, in ensuring a right to consult a solicitor before deciding whether to answer a question.  The T&aacute;naiste is satisfied the new situation improves considerably on the existing situation.  It is a balanced set of proposals that allows for reasonable and commonsense inferences to be drawn but that nevertheless also provides strong and enforceable safeguards.  Account was taken, when formulating these proposals, of developments in other jurisdictions, for example, England and Wales, where the law was changed in 1994, and in Northern Ireland, where the law was changed in 1988.  Their laws go further than what is now proposed here, for example, by allowing inferences to be drawn from an accused person&rsquo;s failure to take the witness stand at the trial.  Account was also taken of the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.  As a result of this comprehensive revision, our law will be fully up to date and well balanced.</P>
        <P>Part 5, section 33, deals with the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, in particular section 27 of that Act which deals with the question of mandatory minimum sentences.  Section 27 has already been amended in 1999 and 2006.  The section is now being presented in a consolidated way, taking account of those previous amendments and adding a new subparagraph (<i>a</i>) to subsection (3C).  The new paragraph (<i>a</i>) is a so-called construction clause that sets out in the clearest terms the intentions of these Houses in regard to mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking offences.  It will be perfectly clear that the mandatory minimum term of ten years must apply in all but the most extreme and exceptional cases.</P><Col N="2065"/>
        <P>I have already set out the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s general position on sentencing.  Section 27 of the 1977 Act, as it is now set out, represents a clear statement of when the ten-year mandatory minimum is to apply.  We are giving clear expression to the will of the Oireachtas and, for the present, nothing more need be said on the matter.</P>
        <P>Part 6, sections 34 to 40, deals with firearms, in particular with the circumstances where the mandatory minimum term of either ten or five years&rsquo; imprisonment is to apply.  Each section repeats the so-called construction clause to which I referred in the case of drug trafficking.  The new clause puts beyond doubt the intentions of these Houses in regard to this issue, if anyone could ever have been in any doubt about the matter.</P>
        <P>Part 7, sections 41 to 43, deals with amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Section 41 inserts a new Chapter 3A into the 2005 Act providing for the establishment and functions of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na executive management board.  The board will consist of executive members &mdash; the Garda Commissioner as chairperson, the deputy Garda commissioners and a member of the civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a grade equivalent to that of a deputy Garda commissioner &mdash; and three non-executive members.  The three non-executive members, who will have appropriate management experience, will be appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister.  They will serve in an advisory capacity.</P>
        <P>The board will keep under review the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions, as well as the arrangements and strategies in place to support and enhance the performance of those functions.  It will keep under review the arrangements and strategies in place to support and improve the performance of the organisation and the corporate governance arrangements and structures within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The board will produce reports every six months on the performance of its functions to the Minister and they will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 42 of the Bill provides for the replacement of section 42 of the 2005 Act.  Section 42 enables the Minister to order special inquiries to be carried out into Garda activities in certain circumstances.  The T&aacute;naiste has come to the conclusion that the provision should be strengthened and extended.  Therefore, inquiries under the current section 42, which are limited to the administration, practice or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will be broadened to include operations of the force and the conduct of its members.  The person appointed by the Minister to undertake the inquiry may interview not just members of the Garda but also any other person who has information or control over a document or thing of interest to the inquiry.  That person will also be empowered to apply to the High Court for an order of compliance, backed up, if necessary, by <Col N="2066"/>the possibility of an order for contempt being made by the court where there is a failure to co-operate with the inquiry.</P>
        <P>Section 43 provides for a number of amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Some of these amendments arise from suggestions made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The remainder are mainly technical in nature and involve minor changes to clarify certain matters which have come to light since the passing of the 2005 Act.</P>
        <P>Part 8, section 44, amends the Sea Fisheries Acts 2003 to 2006.  The amendments are necessary to strengthen controls in regard to the detection and enforcement of illegal fishing activity, particularly in regard to the powers of sea fisheries officers acting under a search warrant, as well as changes relating to penalties under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I understand the necessity for these amendments was highlighted by a recent case where sea fisheries protection officers were denied access to a premises.  Their legal right to enter was subsequently vindicated by the High Court.  The amendments are included in this Bill at the request of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and with the approval of the Government.</P>
        <P>Part 9, sections 45 to 60, covers several important issues.  Section 45 amends the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 in regard to the terms of office of the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Appeal Board, respectively.  It is necessary to provide that those members cease to hold office upon the repeal of the 1986 Act, when the relevant provisions of the 2005 Act are commenced.</P>
        <P>Section 46 deals with the possession of articles or cash for use in the commission of certain serious offences that are listed.  For this purpose, it substitutes a new version of section 183 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  It also provides for a new section 183A of the 2006 Act.  An offence is committed where a person has possession of the article or the cash in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that they have it for purposes of committing one of the listed offences.  It is a defence for the person to show that he or she did not possess it for the commission of an offence.  The penalty on conviction under either section 183 or 183A is up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment.</P>
        <P>This section again underlines the fact that the Bill aims to tackle gangland crime at all levels, including the support systems that are so essential for the main players.  These provisions will be very useful in tackling those who assist and facilitate the major gang bosses.</P>
        <P>Section 48 provides for a new section 6A of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  It will permit the use of reasonable force in the taking of samples &mdash; <Col N="2067"/>finger or palm prints or photographs &mdash; under section 6.  The person must first be cautioned and the use of reasonable force must be authorised by a superintendent and supervised by an inspector.  It must also be video recorded.  Unfortunately, a provision such as this is necessary but I hope Senators will agree this section contains strong and verifiable safeguards.</P>
        <P>Section 49 replaces section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  Section 8 deals with the destruction of fingerprint samples and similar records, generally after 12 months where no prosecution is taken or within 21 days where a prosecution ends in an acquittal or dismissal.  In other words, only samples or records relating to convicted persons may be retained.  There is a growing consensus that such a limited approach is no longer justified.  The new section 8, therefore, is based on the principle that all samples and records are to be retained indefinitely but that, in the interests of justice, some provision needs to be made for removal and destruction of samples in individual cases.  The new section 8 provides a mechanism for the removal, etc. of samples in these limited circumstances.  This change will enable the Garda to develop a more comprehensive databank of information which can be searched for intelligence purposes.  This is essential for modern police work.  Similar proposals are contained in the legislation being drafted on the establishment of a DNA databank.</P>
        <P>Sections 50, 51 and 53 introduce new detention arrangements for persons arrested in connection with murder where firearms or explosives were used, capital murder, false imprisonment where firearms were used or possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.  These offences are ones linked to gangland activity and the extended detention time is necessary to locate and interview witnesses and suspects as well as providing adequate time for the forensic examination of crime scenes.</P>
        <P>In the cases coming under these new arrangements, persons may be detained for up to seven days. This is already the case under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.  Detention under that Act is under judicial authorisation and supervision after the first 48 hours and it will be the same under this new provision.  The new power is limited to the serious cases I have mentioned. It is limited to this set of offences because the use of such an arrangement can be justified only in cases that present the level of threat that comes with gangland crime.</P>
        <P>Section 52 ensures certain sections of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 apply to persons arrested and detained under the new powers.  The relevant sections provide, for example, for access to a doctor, if required, access to a solicitor and also provide that a person must be released once the detention is no longer required or justified.</P><Col N="2068"/>
        <P Just="Left">Section 56 restricts access to tapes of Garda interviews.  In future, only accused persons can have access, and then only with permission of the court.  This deals with an abuse which is widespread, whereby anyone whose interview was taped may have access.  Tapes are then used to prove, so to speak, that the arrested person did not reveal details of accomplices, etc.  Section 57 provides that it will no longer be necessary to commit to writing statements that are recorded electronically.  This will save on Garda time and reflects the increased use of electronic equipment in investigations.</P>
        <P>Section 58 clarifies the position of non-Garda Criminal Assets Bureau officers who attend at interviews with suspects.  Section 59 clarifies that the changes introduced by section 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 do not affect the right of the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring appeals against unduly lenient sentences.  It also clarifies that the Supreme Court is not restricted in its review to consideration of only the point referred to it from a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Section 60 clarifies the operation of section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in so far as that section&rsquo;s provisions on suspended sentences are to apply, especially in instances where there are consecutive sentences following a partially suspended sentence.  This is an important technical point.</P>
        <P>I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.  As we have seen, it is major legislation with many important and far-reaching provisions.  Although diverse in its range of issues, it has a unity in so far as each Part, other than Part 8, has its own part to play in the fight against organised crime.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on this important Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael welcomes this Bill and supports what it purports to do.  However, I am not convinced it will achieve all the Minister has promised it will.  I am concerned about the Bill from a number of perspectives, not least the fact it may end up doing the opposite to what it intends.  I am concerned also that the Bill as worded is not robust or watertight.  A lack of prudence in this area could lead to challenges against the Bill&rsquo;s provisions at a later stage.  I am concerned, too, that serious criminals will walk free on foot of loopholes that may be created by the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, we will not have the necessary time to consider and debate the minutiae of the Bill and many gaps will not be exposed until a case such as the A case emerges.  Notwithstanding the amendments made by the Minister and my Opposition colleagues during debate in the D&aacute;il, I am concerned the Bill will not be properly analysed.  Down the line, it is victims who will ultimately pay for this lack of adequate analysis.</P><Col N="2069"/>
        <P>I have no objection to what the Minister has promised the Bill will do, nor have I any objection to making life more difficult for criminals, especially those involved in gangland crime.  Neither Fine Gael nor I object to the strengthening of our criminal justice system to equip it for the new brand of criminal who is altogether more sophisticated, slyer and willing to subvert the course of justice at every opportunity.  However, I have a problem with the fact that in practical terms, the Bill will do none of these things.  I have a difficulty with promises made disingenuously, cynically and insincerely by a Minister who has repeatedly failed to deliver or to make good on the raft of commitments and pledges he has made &mdash; anything to boost his ailing party&rsquo;s poll figures.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty also with the treatment of this serious and important legislation.  Each section will be allocated only a minute for debate in this House.  This demonstrates how seriously the Minister treats the House.  I find it objectionable that the House will not have the opportunity to amend the Bill.  I understand we now have the opportunity to debate it on Second Stage and that we will go through the motions of debating it on Committee and Report Stages.  Let us be honest however.  There is no way the T&aacute;naiste will accept any amendments from us.  The debate is a complete waste of time and a cynical exercise in the subversion of democracy.</P>
        <P>I have tabled many amendments and they deserve debate and genuine consideration.  Many colleagues have tabled amendments also and they should be considered as valuable contributions.  However, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not tabled a single amendment because he knows that if he accepts Seanad amendments, the Bill must go back to the D&aacute;il, which will mess up the Government schedule for calling a general election for which the country is sick and tired of waiting.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I am wrong and the T&aacute;naiste will come in tomorrow with the genuine and sincere intention to weigh up the contributions of the Members of the Upper House.  Perhaps he will accept amendments that merit inclusion in the Bill and concede the Bill is not perfect and leaves room for improvement.  We will see soon enough.  If he fails to accept a single amendment, it is a clear indication that he has no respect for this House or the legislative process which has served the country well for more than 70 years.</P>
        <P>This is especially galling given the Minister&rsquo;s track record in passing sub-standard laws.  We do not have to go back more than a year to find examples of criminal legislation the Minister has managed to foul up.  Within the past 12 months the Oireachtas has been convened not so much to debate as to rubber-stamp Bills produced in a panic by a Minister desperately feeling in the dark for something to anchor his political career.  I want to know why he cannot learn from his mis<Col N="2070"/>takes and give proper time and consideration to the laws that will affect every citizen, some deeply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill proposes, for example, to increase the detention periods for questioning by the Garda.  Regardless of the fact that this might be unconstitutional, will the Minister of State explain who demanded this change?  Did the Garda request it?  Is it seriously suggesting that it will get more convictions if it can question suspects for longer?  These measures already exist for certain prescribed offences and the Garda does not even use the time extensions allocated to it.  What could a garda possibly learn in a week that he does not learn in five days?  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to these questions.  Where is it proposed to keep the suspects for up to seven days?  Garda stations are not equipped to hold people for seven days and meet their needs.  The Garda is worried about these provisions and the added responsibilities they place on its members.</P>
        <P>Many eminent and expert lawyers have expressed their concerns about this Bill and the lack of proper debate and consultation.  The Law Society did not bother making a submission because it knew it would be treated with contempt, as is this House.  There should be a moratorium on new legislative proposals until the Law Reform Commission has held a  comprehensive review of all criminal justice legislation.  We are victims of excessive legislation, plenty of law but very little order.</P>

        <P>Deputy McDowell has the worst legacy of any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the history of the State.  He has talked a good game &mdash; he is well able to talk &mdash; but has fallen badly on implementation.  Is this Bill really concerned with a significant restructuring of the criminal justice system?  Is it genuinely motivated by a desire to deal with expanding problems in the areas of bail, sentencing, and the right to silence?  Is it a sincere attempt by a Minister leaving office to right the wrongs of the past five years or is it a purely political stunt designed to take policies from the Opposition for the coming general election campaign?</P><Col N="2071"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted to see so many Fine Gael ideas at the centre of this Bill.  The Progressive Democrats need every decent policy they can lay their hands on for this election but does the Minister of State think that this posturing can fool the public for one minute?  Does he suppose that the people will not realise the T&aacute;naiste has been Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the past five years but has been seized only in the dying weeks of this half decade with a desire to do something about the problems that Fine Gael, Labour and other Opposition parties have been shouting about for the past few years?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State says that the Bill is being rushed through because its provisions are so urgent.  They have been urgent for the past five years and nothing was done about them.  They have been needed since the first gangland assassination, headline crime figures started to creep upwards, people started to feel unsafe in their homes and detection rates began to plummet.  They have been essential since this Government took office but it has only put on a spurt when the election is all but upon us.</P>
        <P>There are other urgent matters absent from this Bill.  The Minister of State said that the witness protection programme is so urgent that there should be no limit on funds available yet there is very little here to deal with witness protection or several other urgent areas.</P>
        <P>In respect of what is included, I am particularly pleased to see the provision in section 11 to provide for tagging of certain persons released on bail.  Fine Gael raised this issue recently when it formed part of our leader&rsquo;s speech at the party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis.</P>

	<P>At the time the T&aacute;naiste rubbished the idea, saying it was laughable and unworkable and that Fine Gael was in cloud cuckoo land for even daring to make such a proposal.  Now the T&aacute;naiste has undergone a Pauline conversion.  He has not only come around to our way of thinking but has made Fine Gael policy one of the cornerstones of his last Criminal Justice Bill.  Imitation is said to be the sincerest <Col N="2072"/>form of flattery.  This is an important issue and I am delighted to see it included in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Only last month our leader highlighted the extent of this problem when he revealed that over 650 suspected serious criminals were out on bail at the end of 2006.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s statistics show that after ten years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government the violent criminal has never had it so good.  I am pleased to see that something is finally being done about that and I am proud that the Government is adopting so many Fine Gael policies even at this late stage.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste promised us the Criminal Law (Defence of Life and Property) Bill which was introduced in the aftermath of the Fine Gael Bill on home defence.  The Government voted down the criminal law home defence Bill in 2006.  Last month the Oireachtas passed the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2007, another Bill rushed through when it was brought to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attention that the original Act repealed an important law on child protection.  The amended Act implemented a Fine Gael policy from 2004 outlawing Internet grooming of children for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  It is amazing that it took three years to act on this issue, particularly when the T&aacute;naiste transcribed the Fine Gael proposals verbatim into his Bill last month.</P>
        <P>These are only some examples of the T&aacute;naiste following our lead.  Last year Fine Gael proposed a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Courts (Register of Sentences) Bill 2006, which was voted down by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats without any valid reason.  It would have provided for a comprehensive register of sentences for the purposes of comparison and <?oasys _dc28- ?>transparency.  It would have allowed us to consider the consistency of sentences and to examine this important area of our justice system scientifically.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 24 deals with minimum sentences for repeat offenders.  There appears to be a lacuna here.  Without going into the details, it is worth asking what precisely has prompted this measure and why  judicial discretion is removed entirely from sentencing.  Given there is no sentencing register or database in this jurisdiction upon which a proper analysis of the levels of effectiveness of sentencing penalties can be based, how can it be effective?  The failure of the Government to accept the Fine Gael Bill on the register of sentences is as serious an impediment to a rational approach to the adjustment of maximum sentences by the Oireachtas as it is to the assessment by the Court of Criminal Appeal as to the appropriateness of a sentence imposed in any case.  In the absence of such a system, debate about sentencing seems destined to be confined to tabloid-style expressions of outrage at sentences and inappropriate and unjustifiable ministerial attacks on the courts in general.</P>

He told us it will strengthen our system and make life more difficult for criminals, and I hope it does.  However, I am not convinced and several parts of the Bill will have the opposite effect.  Without time to consider and amend it, we will have several problems in years to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with Senator Maurice Hayes.  I will stick to the content of the legislation because it is an extremely important Bill and I do not wish to be seduced into discussing peripheral issues for electoral purposes.  It is a pity that has happened because we have a good record in this House of fairly and honestly evaluating legislation which comes before us.  That has been recognised by many on all sides of the House who have paid tribute to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the open manner in which he has brought forward various reforming pieces of legislation, not just relating to the criminal justice system but on prisons, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a range of other areas.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have done.  However, I will not do so in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is easy in the heat and pressure of an electoral battle to allow ourselves to slip into self-delusion, but that is a pity.</P>
        <P>In general I subscribe to what is in the Bill.  We have debated aspects of it in this House and it is a Bill which rebalances the system.  In that regard we must be conscious of the need for safeguards to ensure we avoid miscarriages of justice.</P>
        <P>Legislation is only one component of the fight against crime.  The effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also important and it is good to see its strength increased so that it is now heading for 15,000 members.  I am critical of the fact that we set up a pilot scheme for the Garda Reserve as I felt it unnecessary but it was accepted by the Minister on the recommendation of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A couple of meetings a year and a pilot scheme for 12 months will not tell us anything and, therefore, I would like to see it rolled out.  I would also like the committees rolled out to become an effective arm of the whole operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P><Col N="2074"/>
        <P>I welcome the setting of non-monetary conditions for bail and it is sensible for a judge to be provided with a statement of previous convictions and bail applications as part of his or her consideration of an application.  I also welcome the provisions for electronic monitoring and the fact that the prosecution can appeal bail where there is a risk of new and serious offences.  Much stricter criteria should apply to who is and is not granted bail.  Too many serious crimes have been committed by serious criminals while on bail who feel they can do so with impunity because of the system of concurrent, as distinct from consecutive, sentencing.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to sentencing, as did the Minister, Deputy McDowell, in the debate in the D&aacute;il.  I have argued previously for two particular bodies and I am disappointed one of them has not been set up, namely the body to deal with judicial conduct.  There have been high-profile instances during the lifetime of this Parliament, as there were in the previous one, where a caution or some other disciplinary action would have been more appropriate than forcing a judge to resign, because the offence in question did not register highly on the Richter scale.  In another case, one who committed a serious offence in the eyes of the public got away with it simply because of inadequate mechanisms, despite the efforts and commitment of dedicated people in this House.</P>
        <P>A judicial commission should be established to deal with such cases, made up of members of the Judiciary, experts in that area and Members of the Oireachtas, to adjudicate in a fair and impartial way on cases brought to its attention.  It would do nothing to take away from the independence of the Judiciary.  The Judiciary occupies a privileged and important place in our society but that does not mean it is above the law.  In a republic everybody is subject to the law and such a committee should be established, notwithstanding opposition from the Judiciary itself.</P>
        <P>I take on board the point made by the Minister, which has been made for the past five years in debates such as this, that there is a need for consistency in sentencing.  We have recently seen high-profile cases where the sentences seem inadequate, such as one in which a person had made recompense for an offence only to be given the maximum sentence in any event.  To most observers that appeared unfair and seemed to arise from the judge&rsquo;s displeasure at the manner in which the accused had presented himself.  Such bias should not enter into the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>There needs to be a formal body, in this case exclusively made up of the Judiciary, in which decisions of judges can be examined by their peers and from which sentencing guidelines may emerge.  Some of the sentencing we hear about is not good enough.  Notwithstanding the fact that, <Col N="2075"/>in most cases, judges hear cases conscientiously and come to informed decisions, there are sufficient minority instances where that does not happen.</P>
        <P>The provisions for mandatory minimum sentences in the case of second offences are reasonable.  I strongly subscribe to the whole approach to sentencing in the Bill.  I have said previously that where remission of sentences is given it should be only suspended.  If people are freed they should have to serve their time in the event of a subsequent offence.  The Minister takes a different approach by providing that if serious offences occur within seven years of an earlier offence the perpetrator must serve a minimum of three quarters of the maximum sentence, and that is welcome.  However, where a remission is made, it should be treated as a suspension of the sentence, and it should not be just for good conduct in the prison, which is often due to self interest, but also for subsequent good conduct.</P>
        <P>The right to silence is a strong principle and the provision in this regard has been opposed by lawyers and others, who have argued strongly against it.  I believe it is worthwhile.  Everybody has heard of the accused focusing on a point in the wall and refusing to answer questions.  There are safeguards in the Bill whereby a caution must be given, the accused will have access to a solicitor and a video recording will be made unless the accused objects.  I believe accused persons should be in a position to object only when they consider their personal safety to be an issue, in other words, where they believe the evidence they give might expose them to some form of counter action by those they might incriminate.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a person may not be convicted solely or mainly on the basis of an inference; corroborative evidence will be required.  That is an effective safeguard.  Section 19(<i>a</i>) deals with a failure on the part of the accused to mention while being questioned certain facts which he or she might later rely on in the defence.  That might be a dangerous provision and must be monitored closely.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There must be a major international evaluation of the drugs problem.  We are losing the fight against drugs and people who are otherwise law-abiding are being drawn into crime as a result.  Overall, I agree with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions regarding a data bank.  However, there is a risk for innocent people.  We saw in Donegal what can happen when members of the Garda do not themselves follow proper standards.  We need to provide proper safeguards.  Where a garda or somebody involved in the administration of justice wilfully causes an innocent person to be convicted of an offence, that garda or person should be exposed to the imposition of a similar type of sentence if convicted of doing that.  There must be safeguards to ensure the provision operates effectively.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Walsh for sharing time with me.  There is a sense that we are engaged in shadow boxing.  It is a pity there is not more time to discuss this Bill in the Seanad.  The Bill was greatly improved in its passage through the D&aacute;il and I am pleased the Minister amended a number of his first suggestions.  A similar improvement could have been achieved in this House because the Bill deals with hugely important issues that require close consideration.</P>
        <P>I will mention two or three of them.  I am reasonably relaxed about what is being done with the right to silence.  That system has been operating in Northern Ireland and the provisions in the Bill are similar.  The roof has not fallen in on the criminal justice system in the North.  What is important is the form of the cautions given to people and the words in which they are framed and, second, the direction the judge gives to the jury as to what inferences might be drawn.</P>
        <P>The extended period of interrogation is justified in some cases, particularly when international crime is involved.  However, I have a concern and it relates not just to the Garda but to most police forces.  If one gives them an exocet, they will use it, even when a peashooter would do.  It must be clear that this provision relates to a limited number of extremely serious issues, and that not everybody who is suspected of something can be locked up for a week at a time.  It should be also subject to judicial review at regular intervals.  The European courts would require that.</P>
        <P>I have considerable concerns about mandatory sentencing.  It takes the judgment out of judging.  There is a strong case for consistency and the Minister spoke about providing a jurisprudential basis for it.  Senator Walsh&rsquo;s suggestion of peer group review is attractive and is practised in medicine and in other areas.  People have a right to feel the will of the people is expressed, but only to an extent.  One does not want trials turned into lynch trials or witch hunts.  It is a job for the judges, through judges&rsquo; conferences and the like, to ensure there is a degree of consistency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have long had a concern about mandatory sentences.  It removes the decision from the judge and gives it to the person who frames the charge.  A Bill was introduced by William Craig in the old Northern Ireland Parliament in the late 1960s dealing with public order.  Members will forgive me if I mix up the technical terms but in the Bill a distinction was made between affray and riot.  The mandatory sentence for affray was two years, while the mandatory sentence for riot was five years.  Unsurprisingly, all the guys on the Shankill Road were engaged in affray while all the guys on the Falls Road were engaged in riot, so that had to be removed.  This is a real danger and the judges are right to be concerned about it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was kind enough to refer to a recommendation which I and a group had made for certain civilian appoint<Col N="2077"/>ments, which was accepted by the Government.  We made that recommendation last November but the appointments have not yet been advertised.  As far I know, they will not be in office before the end of the year.  These are extremely important.  Perhaps the Minister will do some progress chasing in that regard.  There is no point putting additional resources into huge organisations such as the Garda, the health service or the like until the structures are correct.</P>
        <P>I am pleased with the reference to the non-executive members of the Garda executive board.  I wonder from where that idea came.  It is important his element is included.  These people will not be involved in Garda operational matters but will provide the type of governance one gets in a large business environment.  They will provide experience in long-term strategic planning, management, performance management and so forth.  I welcome that aspect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I could have said a great deal more about the Bill and I regret not having had the time to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I deplore this legislation and the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has not seen fit to show his face in the House.  I am not surprised; perhaps he is ashamed.  This is a dreadful day for the Oireachtas.  It is a complete abrogation of democratic responsibility.  The Seanad is being treated with contempt.  Our principal responsibility is to review and refine legislation and put down amendments but it is obvious no amendments will be accepted.  Once again, the Government is undermining the democratic function of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  That is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>This is rushed legislation and its aim is unclear.  It was stated it is intended to address the problem of gangland violence but it will not do that.  There are ways to approach it but this is not one of them.</P>
        <P>An analogy is drawn with similar measures introduced in Britain but that has been done in the context of very intensive debate and with proper safeguards, which are absent from this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as originally put before the other House a few weeks ago, drew a chorus of criticism from the entire legal profession.  Today in  <i>The Irish Times</i> there is a letter signed by a column of practising barristers which draws attention to the dangers implicit in this measure, for example, detention of people in police stations in the light of the Morris tribunal.  That is what our experience has been, yet there is no clear reference to that or belief that the matters exposed by the Morris tribunal have been properly addressed in the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also an article by Brendan Grehan, SC.  He makes the point that barristers rarely bellyache about the introduction of new legislation because it means more jobs for them and <Col N="2078"/>more loot in their pockets but, unusually on this occasion, a very large number of barristers have objected.  He mentions the fact that some improvements were made to the Bill in the D&aacute;il but none will be made in this House.  That is a shame.  He also points out, as I have already indicated, that the English model is not being completely followed.  He states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Curtailing the right to silence has been defended by the Minister by reference to similar changes introduced to the law in England in recent times.  However, in his proposals he has failed to introduce the strong protections of the right to legal advice which have been incorporated into the English measure.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He goes on to state, what I believe, that the justification of it being an emergency response to the gangland slayings, which we all deplore, raises other questions.  If it is an emergency response, why is there not provision in the legislation for a review by the Oireachtas?  Why does this emergency legislation last for one year and then to be reviewed by the Oireachtas?  That is very unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>I would like to turn to some other questions of principle.  Under the Constitution judges are appointed to administer justice.  They are not supposed to be a rubber stamp but this Bill will have that effect, at least to a certain extent, for example when they are asked to extend detention by a period of five days.  This is done on the opinion of somebody.  An opinion is given evidential status.  That is very worrying.  There are also situations where, for example, the opinion of a garda cannot be properly tested.  It becomes evidence, therefore, without being properly tested.</P>
        <P>I turn to two briefing documents by which I have been impressed.  The first one is from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which expressed considerable concern about the way the Bill is supposed to attack gangland crime and points out that a series of eminent barristers, including nine senior counsel and the law society as a group have called for the adoption of the Bill to be postponed until it can be fully debated.  In other words, it is calling for the Bill to be postponed.  I join that call.  In the dying days of this Parliament and in the run-up to an election, this complicated material is being rushed through without any proper scope for full examination.</P>
        <P>I can point again to the situation that arose with regard to the statutory rape case.  Legislation was rushed through the Houses.  The Minister said he did not want to rush it through but the Joe Duffy programme essentially forced him to do it, and he regretted it.  He had cause to regret it subsequently.</P>
        <P>I will vote against this Bill because it is bad legislation.  It does not address the principle.  The only way to do that is to examine the drugs problem.  There is only one way to resolve that and it <Col N="2079"/>is not with the so-called war on drugs.  It is to legalise, monitor and quality control drugs.  I recognise this is a very serious problem and it must be done internationally.  That is the only way.  I can guarantee this Minister, the other Ministers in that Department and everybody else that we will be back here in a year&rsquo;s time and the situation will not have improved one iota but people&rsquo;s civil rights will have been eroded in a serious way.</P>
        <P>Crime prevention orders are rather like the anti-social behaviour orders.  They have the same effect, that is, people can be found guilty of an offence and jailed for conduct which is itself not a criminal matter.  That is very worrying.  Again, we are copying the United Kingdom in that regard but this whole area has been extensively debated in both Houses of Parliament, unlike the situation here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the seven days' Garda custody, the ICCL&rsquo;s position is that it be withdrawn pending further debate.  It quotes the Council of Europe&rsquo;s committee on the prevention of torture which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">... seven days in police custody without a charge is a long period of time.  ... prolonged periods of detention of criminal suspects on police premises can lead to high-risk situations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We had the Dean Lyons case, the whole episode of the Morris tribunal and so on and, as a result, it is recommending that this also be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Another point that worries me is the cavalier attitude of the Minister towards the status of commissions, review groups and reports.  He quotes, for example, the balance in the criminal law review group and an interim report on the right to silence but the head of that group, who I believe is a member of his party, and a very distinguished lawyer, Gerry Hogan, has made it clear that it is an interim report and its conclusions are not definitive.  Again, the Minister is rushing ahead even of his own colleagues.  That is very worrying, particularly coming from a man who has a fine legal brain and is a senior politician.</P>
        <P>I have many concerns that are shared by the ICCL.  They are also shared by the Irish Human Rights Commission, chaired by a former leader of the Opposition in this House.  In the background to this document, in rather coy terms, it expresses its concerns.  It states, &ldquo;The IHRC considers the limited time-frame within which the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 is being brought forward to be unfortunate&rdquo;.  That is very diplomatic language but it is clear it is very dissatisfied.  There is a certain ring to the word &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;.  It further states, &ldquo;Desire to change the law should be balanced by the need to discuss, analyse and reflect on provisions which involve a significant restriction of long established rights&rdquo;.  That is what we are doing &mdash; the right to silence.  It also <Col N="2080"/>indicates that it is having great difficulty in responding, due to the shortage of time, and that the bail law in particular should be reviewed with considerable care.</P>
        <P>The right to silence is one of the fundamental aspects of our law.  The IHRC indicates that, under sections 26, 27 and 28 of the Bill, circumstances in which inferences may be drawn must clearly call for an explanation from the accused.  Grehan said in his article that this is a fundamental safeguard but it should be strengthened in the Bill.  The IHRC&rsquo;s belief and mine is that inferences should be drawn only where the accused failed to give an account or mention a fact which he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances at the time when he or she was being questioned.</P>
        <P>It stresses a point made in the article I quoted from <i>The Irish Times</i> that although there is a parallel here with an English situation, and human rights have been eroded under Mr. Blair in Britain for some time, nevertheless, they at least provide for the availability of strong pre-trial legal advice which is not done here.  The Human Rights Commission also believes that the presence of a legal adviser should be provided throughout the interrogation.</P>
        <P>There is also the matter of the seven days&rsquo; detention.  In 1984, when a similar Bill was introduced extending the powers of detention to 12 hours there was practically a riot in both Houses.  It is now proposed to be at seven days and this is apparently being meekly accepted.  That is a very serious curtailment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Let us remember that people are innocent until proven guilty.  There should be a sliding scale in many of these areas of legislation.  None of these draconian provisions should come into operation unless, for example, certain criteria are met, such as a previous conviction.  However, this could all come into operation in respect of somebody who has simply been accused of a crime.  Again, I point to the McBrearty case.  This case and the Morris tribunal are our track record, yet these provisions will give evidential standing to the opinion of a senior police officer.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Tagging might have certain attractions, for example, in the case of a serious child molester.  I understand that very well.  However, it relates to people on bail who have not been convicted of anything.  This is a group of people who are considered to be innocent until proven guilty.  In this situation, it is appropriate that this should only come into operation if the person has already been convicted of a crime.  The basic concern here is, or should be, people who have a record of committing crime while on bail.</P>
        <P>I am not sure that tagging somebody electronically when he or she has never been convicted of a crime and is presumed innocent is constitutional.  I am also unsure that it is in accordance with the provisions for the right to <Col N="2081"/>privacy and bodily integrity in the European Convention on Human Rights because a chip must be inserted.  We should think about that.  I wonder if anybody in this House has been thinking about it because things are very quiescent around here.  This is somebody who is innocent and will have a quasi-surgical procedure performed upon him or her before he or she is convicted of anything.  I wonder where we are going with all this.</P>
        <P>I will return to the right to silence and examine what the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, has to say about it.  The commission makes it clear that the right to silence is one of the fundamental elements of our justice system.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In 1935, Lord Slankey in the House of Lords described the presumption of innocence or the burden on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused as a golden thread that runs through the web of English criminal law (and thus the common law).  The Irish courts have given them constitutional status by stating they are essential components of the right to a trial &ldquo;in due course of law&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The European Court of Human Rights has stated that under Article 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, &ldquo;the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself, are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6&rdquo;.  There is much to be worried about.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I have not gone into all the technical details because there has not been time to do so.  There has not been time to study the Bill properly and to make the kinds of interventions I would like to make.  There is enough here to indicate the very serious concerns people have.</P>
        <P>I am not on the side of criminals.  I am on the side of victims and see nothing here for them.  I simply see a desperate election shot by a Minister who is concerned about the fate of the Government.</P>
        <P>I wish to make one final point because this is already in operation.  I am raising a matter on the Adjournment about which I am very angry.  It concerns a perfectly decent young man from a north African country whose brother lives here.  Both the young man and his brother are architects.  Their family is here and he has been accepted as a refugee.  He applied for naturalisation, was denied it and told he could appeal it if he gave the grounds for the denial.  He was refused the grounds for denial.  This is Kafka.  This is the world of Joseph Stalin and the Gulag.  It is crazy stuff.  Yet this is what is contained in this Bill.</P>
        <P>In a recent article the former Attorney General, John Rogers, states:</P><Col N="2082"/>
        <P LI="1">Reliance on opinion evidence in such an application gives rise to the question of how garda&iacute; have arrived at such opinion, and inevitably this will lead to an answer wherein garda&iacute; will say they are relying on intelligence in respect of a source for which they must claim privilege.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell you&rdquo;.  One is not given the right to defend one&rsquo;s good name.  That is crucial.  The article goes on to state, &ldquo;so the judge will be left to rely on an opinion, the validity of which the judge cannot test or examine in any meaningful way&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a disgrace although it may do some good things.  The way in which it has been rail-roaded through this Parliament is also a disgrace.  I will call for a vote on it and will vote against it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of legislation which I believe will strengthen the hand of the Garda and all those involved in implementing and upholding the laws of the land.  I hope it will also bring about a situation where the modern-day gangland boss will no longer get away with a derisory or inadequate sentence, as has been the case in the past.  </P>
        <P>Without doubt, we have seen an unacceptable level of gangland murders, particularly in the city.  I understand that in 2006 there were something like 26 gangland murders.  Some would say that some of these murders are gangsters shooting gangsters and many people would not shed too many crocodile tears.  However, murder is murder and is something that one cannot allow to continue in a civilised society.  For that reason, I support the Minister and the Bill and believe it will strengthen the hand of the Garda and the DPP.</P>
        <P>The Bill also sends a clear message to anyone who wants to hear it that we, as a society, are no longer prepared to stand aside and allow these people to wreck communities.  Something must be done.  I know some are saying that the introduction of this legislation is tough, to which I reply &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;  In my opinion, it is necessary.  I know some of the brains in the Law Library have been exercised about this, but I believe we need to do something to bring about a situation where people think about what might come down upon them from the law before they act.</P>
        <P>One cannot have a situation where an individual can walk into a house and gun down his intended target and a poor innocent victim on the way out knowing there is a strong chance that he will not get caught and if he does get caught, he will get a derisory sentence.  This is something that, hopefully, this Bill, when enacted, will put an end to.</P>
        <P>In some respects, we find ourselves in this situation because, in some instances, the Judiciary <Col N="2083"/>has failed to carry out its work.  Individuals who commit a crime should receive a sentence commensurate with the crime.  This does not happen in every case.  We have seen many examples of that.  It appears that, in some instances, judges trip over themselves so as not to impinge on the criminal rather than give fair play to the poor victim.</P>
        <P>There can be no justification for allowing individuals who have been responsible for numerous deaths through the trafficking of drugs in this city to walk away with a suspended or very light sentence, as has been the case.  Individuals who have committed rapes have walked free from court, which is outrageous.  We can only imagine the hurt and anger that must well up inside any poor woman who has been raped and the devastation that causes her.  Her dignity and integrity must be in tatters as a result of that.  None of us can even think about what it must do to a woman to witness an individual walk away from court as a result of this.</P>
        <P>In one instance, this happened because the judge had his hands slapped by a higher court in respect of a previous conviction and he was not prepared to suffer the embarrassment of that happening again.  This is no way to run a judicial system.  We read in a newspaper this morning that the numbers of reported rapes in the first quarter of the year have fallen.  The Minister has shown his concern about this, as has the Rape Crisis Centre.  It would be wonderful if the figures had fallen for the right reasons, but we suspect they have fallen for the wrong reasons.  Sexual assaults are not being reported because people feel that in doing so, they will not get due recognition.  They are afraid of the aggressive cross-examination that is promised and, for that reason, they will not do it.  We find that the number of such reports has decreased in the first quarter to 199 compared with 393 in the first quarter of last year.  That is serious and we must do something about it.  When we compare that with sentencing someone to a year in prison and a &euro;75,000 fine for fraud, we must ask where is the consistency in sentencing.  There are mitigating circumstances in some cases, but the ordinary person must wonder about sentencing when he sees this kind of thing.</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister of State outlined an agreed package which came into place last December and which I believe will have a positive effect.  It promises to increase Garda numbers by another 1,000 to bring them to 15,000.  It promises to sanction 300 additional civilian administrative posts as well as seven senior administrative posts.  Coupled with the Garda Reserve Force, that will play a vital part in bringing about a better society.  I welcome the strong commitment to the witness protection programme, as the Minister of State said unlimited funds were available.</P><Col N="2084"/>
        <P>We should be measured in our comments when talking about this because we should not give the impression that crime is out of control.  That is not the case.  With the increase of 600,000 in population, the crime figures are down from 28.5 per 1,000 to 24.5 per 1,000.  It was stated in this morning&rsquo;s newspaper that there has been a big decrease in recorded crime in almost all major categories.  There was an overall fall in serious crime by 5.6% for the first quarter and an annual drop of 2.2%.  Homicides were down by 28%.  Thefts, which account for more than half of all headline crime, were down 5.6% for the first quarter and burglaries were down 17%.  Both were down 1.5% and 12.6%, respectively, for the year.  This tells us that crime totals have fallen consecutively in the last three quarters and we should be pleased about that, although nobody denies we still have a serious situation.  It is good to see the figures going in the right direction.</P>
        <P>It is also important that garda&iacute; are suitably equipped and resourced.  They also need to be well managed and run.  That has received attention in recent times and it is welcome.  However, I also believe that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a job to do in regaining the confidence of the public.  In my opinion, the force does not have anything like the respect it had 25 years ago.  Members of the force must ask themselves why that is the case.  If I were to ask any individual aged between 16 and 40 what he or she thought of the Garda, I think I would get a negative response in many instances.  It may be unjustified, but that is the response I would get.  I have spoken to many youngsters and some see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as opportunistic.</P>
        <P>Anti-social behaviour infuriates the public more than anything else.  People sitting in their homes hear about murders and they are shocked, but anti-social behaviour is the crime that most affects individuals in their communities.  Many of us have gone to meetings in our constituencies and have listened to elderly people and parents of young children who are frightened of leaving their homes because gangs congregate outside.  They cannot even go to the shop for a bottle of milk because of the fear factor.  It is an area that does not receive enough attention.  Many people will not report anti-social behaviour because they feel that garda&iacute; will not come out until the following morning as they are busy doing other things.  However, it is an area which exercises the fear within communities.  That is almost more important than chasing down crime because it affects all the population.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State for introducing this Bill in the House.  It has gone through the other House and I wish it well in this House.  All the elements of the Bill will assist in the fight against crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak about the issue of the seven-day detention, which was raised by Deputy <Col N="2085"/>Howlin on Report Stage of this Bill in the D&aacute;il.  As the time allowed had elapsed, he did not get a chance to elaborate on it.  The Irish Human Rights Commission raised the issue in its submission on the Bill and made it one of the four key areas causing concern for human rights.  The commission claims that it raises the possibility that Ireland might be in violation of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The commission stated that it is a most serious curtailment of a person&rsquo;s right to personal liberty which requires real justification.  To make the Bill compliant with human rights, the commission suggested there was a need for a mechanism to be established so that when extensions for a period of detention are being sought, the grounds upon which a request is based can be properly explored before adjudication is made by the judge.  Has the Minister dealt with that issue?  Will there be any attempt to ensure there is a mechanism such as that which I have outlined?</P>
        <P>There are many concerns about the length of the period of detention.  Deputy Howlin wanted to table an amendment allowing for a 48-hour period of detention, but that was not possible at the time.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties maintain that the existing seven-day detention power in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 is rarely used.  The council quoted from the Council of Europe&rsquo;s committee on the prevention of torture regarding that provision, which stated that prolonged periods of detention of criminal suspects on police premises can lead to high-risk situations.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I never thought in my political career that I would have to stand up and defend the Judiciary.  My political view of the world has been about trying to look from the position of the underdog at their noble lords.  They are not quite noble lords but sometimes they act like they were.  However, our judges have done wonderful things over the years.  One of them has been a vigorous defence of the rights of the individual.  They have done this in the teeth of different Governments that have attempted to chip away at those rights.</P>
        <P>Two things trouble me about this Bill.  The first is its contents and the second is the certainty that most of it will make very little difference.  We have been through this before.  Anybody who has been a Member of the Oireachtas for some years has encountered a succession of such minor chippings away at issues, each of which, we are told, will deal with the problem at hand.  All that happens, however, is that the problem redefines itself and we must confront it once again.</P>
        <P>For example, I have been hearing about the problem of offences committed on bail since I entered this House 25 years ago.  A succession of attempts has been made to deal with the issue. <Col N="2086"/> The fundamental problem, however, is that a person released on bail has not been convicted of the offence with which he or she is charged.  I am confident that if a situation is created where a significant proportion of persons who would formerly have been released on bail are instead to be locked up, our courts will find there is a breach of their constitutional rights.</P>
        <P>The reality is that persons released on bail have perhaps committed no offence.  Even if they have committed offences previously, they have already been punished for those crimes.  The idea that there should be restrictions on the movement of accused persons via electronic tagging because of crimes they committed previously will ultimately come under scrutiny by the courts.  The Government cannot be certain of the outcome of that scrutiny.  I accept that the Attorney General has advised that this measure is within the terms of the Constitution.  However, Attorneys General have in the past been wrong as often as right in respect of controversial constitutional questions.  I sometimes regret the decisions of the court, although I am sure they are magnificently, gloriously and sometimes even eccentrically independent.</P>
        <P>I wonder what the Supreme Court will make of some of the provisions in this Bill, particularly that relating to seven-day detentions.  The Supreme Court has laid down many tests in respect of lawful and unlawful detention and it has, for instance, deliberately inserted into the procedure for the detention of individuals provisions that are not available in the United Kingdom.  People who are detained for questioning in that jurisdiction do not have the right to access a solicitor, make a telephone call or let their family know where they are.  Accused persons in that country can be <i>incommunicado</i> for seven days.  That cannot happen here, not because of legislative provisions but because the Supreme Court ruled that detention is not lawful where those types of basic rights are not upheld.</P>
        <P>As Senator Tuffy said, if we are to detain people for seven days, we will run into all types of complications.  I am convinced this issue will surface in the courts because there is an unfortunate tendency for emergency legislation designed to deal with specific cases to become the general rule for the way garda&iacute; operate.  I have seen the Offences against the State Act used against picketers who caused some disturbance outside a Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  The individual arrested under that legislation in this case was eventually paid damages by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because there was not a scrap of evidence that she was a member of an illegal organisation.</P>
        <P>The more powers that are provided, the greater the temptation to misuse those powers.  Notwithstanding what the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, said earlier, I am uneasy about the way in which retained electronic communications data <Col N="2087"/>are being accessed.  I listened carefully to what the Data Commissioner had to say on this issue.  It is the Government&rsquo;s obligation to respond to what he said rather than hiding behind the terms of reference of the judge who monitors all of this and who is not allowed to proceed as required.  I have similar concerns in regard to Army intelligence, as I said before.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that the records, which include fingerprints, of people against whom no charges are made will be retained.  In such cases, the procedure will be that the Data Commissioner will have to be petitioned and he or she will decide whether the records should be released, after which the matter may be taken to the courts.  Why, in a civilised society, should there be retention of the record of somebody who is arrested on suspicion but is not subsequently charged?</P>
        <P>We are moving into a vague area in which people can be deemed to be half guilty or half convicted.  It may suit propagandists of a silly type of law and order agenda to argue for such a system.  A favourite argument of such proponents is that everybody is too much concerned about the accused and not sufficiently concerned about the victim.  Such language effectively makes the judgment that the accused is convicted.  The reality, however, is that an accused person is innocent.  There are only two categories &mdash; innocent or guilty.  Our law does not accommodate a halfway house between innocence and guilt.</P>
        <P>That is why there is so much concern for the accused.  I have been involved in the campaign for victims&rsquo; rights for 20 years.  There is an extraordinary hypocrisy on the part of State agencies and Governments of various hues which forever talk about the rights of victims provided it does not cost any money and which deliberately and consistently underfund voluntary organisations that try to help victims.  It is just as well that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal was abolished.  This peculiar State agency, the purpose of which was to compensate the victims of crime, hid behind a doorway, only allowing people to communicate with it through an intercom device at the door.  Moreover, it would not allow forms explaining how claims could be made to be distributed in Garda stations, post offices and so on.</P>
        <P>Nobody seems willing to address the issues that most concern victims of crime.  Interest is aroused from time to time when the tabloids call for actions that are only a step away from vengeance.  We must be careful as a society that vengeance, or any form of retribution, does not become part of our criminal justice code.  We must learn the way of looking at issues that was epitomised by a late and great Member of this House, Gordon Wilson.  This is the capacity to realise that the only way one can move on from horrific crime is by moving on from seeking eternal retribution. <Col N="2088"/> We must be careful not to become involved in a rhetoric of vengeance.</P>
        <P>I am extremely uneasy about the lack of debate on the profound change proposed in this Bill, which is to allow accused persons to be detained for seven days.  I reiterate my view that we will have to rely on the courts to adjudicate on this and other provisions, such as that which attempts to force judges to impose sentences they believe are wrong, and that they will probably find against them.  There is judicial freedom to make decisions in these areas, either by making interpretations of the Constitution or by asserting the absolute right of the Judiciary to be independent of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State but not this Bill.  Society has changed significantly in the last 15 years.  When I entered this House, the Internet and other new technologies were unheard of and opportunity for foreign travel was limited.  If gangland crime existed 15 years ago, it never attained anything like the prominence it currently enjoys.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like all decent people, I am appalled at the phenomenon of gangland crimes that has swept across the nation in the last ten years.  Not only is the speed with which it has gathered force shocking but also its intensity.  The perpetrators of these crime seem a law unto themselves and have no hesitation in dispensing their rough justice to anybody who crosses them, including innocent bystanders.  All decent people want this phenomenon to end or at least to be brought under some degree of control.  I, too, want it urgently.  However, there is a world of difference between doing something about a problem and doing anything about it.  It is with regret that I say that it looks as if the framers of this Bill have failed to appreciate this vital difference and make the distinction between doing something and doing anything.  Anything simply will not do by way of a response to this pressing national problem.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>There are 64 pages in this Bill and almost every one of them is stuffed with provisions of one kind or another.  Some of the proposed measures are unquestionably a good idea and are not contentious.  I have no problem agreeing with others but they need to be discussed carefully and their implications fully teased out.  Some measures are so wide-ranging that they should be enacted after a process that goes a great deal further than mere discussion.  These measures should be enacted only on the basis of a broad consensus among those who operate the criminal justice system daily.</P>
        <P>The sheer length of the Bill is in itself sufficiently good reason to avoid rushing it through the Legislature without full and proper debate.  There is another pressing reason for not rushing it.  It is a criminal justice Bill which seeks to regulate some of the most important interac<Col N="2089"/>tions between the State and its citizens.  There is an extra duty on the Legislature to take particular care with the scrutiny of a criminal justice Bill.</P>
        <P>The corpus of criminal justice law has been built up over many generations.  It represents a type of social contract between the State and its citizens.  With the passage of time and as circumstances change, it often becomes necessary to adjust the fine detail of that contract, as we are attempting to do here today.  We should always do so very carefully and only embark on change when we are certain that it is change for the better.  How can we be certain it is?  Fortunately, we have many more sources of wisdom than those found within the walls of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The daily operation of our criminal justice system involves a vast number of professionals in different fields, all of whom have experiences to share and who deserve to have their input carefully considered in any change we make.  Was that reservoir of expertise availed of in this instance?  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Not only was it not availed of, the legislation has been doggedly pursued in the face of an unprecedented opposition from these experts in the criminal law system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senators Norris and Ryan stated, they are appalled, as I am, at the indecent haste with which this Bill has been steam-rollered through the system.  We are fond of saying that rushed legislation is bad legislation and we have abundant evidence to back up that proposition.  Sometimes, however, rushed legislation is made necessary by circumstances and we have to take the risk of getting it wrong.  We have had incidents of that in the past year.  However there is no possible reason for the haste with which the Bill has been dealt with.  The problem it seeks to address is urgent and so is the need to get the correct response.  It has been said that the reason for the haste is an electoral one.  The Minister, his party and the Government of which they are a part may feel better equipped in facing into a general election if they can point to an Act such as this one and state it is already on the Statute Book.  I hope that is not the motivation, not least because I doubt if such a cynical approach to the electorate would work,.  The public is well capable of seeing through an attempt to pass off a Band-Aid as a cure.</P>
        <P>It has also been said &mdash; again I hope this is not so &mdash; that this Bill is a personal crusade by the Minister, whom I admire greatly, because he feels that another Minister might not feel so strongly about it and therefore he is determined to see it into law before he leaves office, voluntarily or not, as the case may be.  Whatever the reason, we are faced this Thursday afternoon with a Bill that is being rushed through the House.  It should not be rushed through because it needs long and careful consideration and deep discussion.</P><Col N="2090"/>
        <P>A criminal justice Bill should only be enacted on the basis of a consensus in the criminal justice system on the proposed changes being made.  I believe that no attempt has been made to reach such a consensus.  I cannot conclude other than that the Government&rsquo;s persistence in pursuing this Bill in the dying moments of its mandate is nothing short of an abuse of power.  The Government has the power to see this Bill into law.  That will not alter the fact that it should not do so if it had the proper respect for our democratic system and the institutions of the State.  I urge that we give this Bill the attention it deserves.  I was glad to see that our colleague, Senator Maurice Hayes, tabled amendments.  If the Bill is to.be passed, I am glad we will have discussed amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I am especially grateful for the thoughtful and insightful nature of many of the remarks.  The comments made and issues raised have been carefully noted by the officials and they will be brought to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste.  As was mentioned at the outset of this debate, this Bill is very wide in its scope but it can be best understood when considered in the context out of which it has emerged and the objective it seeks to address, namely, the unacceptable activities of organised gangland crime.</P>
        <P>In so far as the Government is concerned, the threat posed by these activities needs to be tackled at several levels.  Legislation is certainly important in so far as it will overcome legal impediments that may exist and will generally ensure the law is updated to match the changing nature of crime.  Good police work is also clearly essential.  Good police work requires not only skill and dedication but also resources and manpower.  It also requires patience and long-term commitment to the task.  It will have been clear from my colleague&rsquo;s opening remarks that this Government has invested heavily in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will continue to do so, not only by means of general increases in staff, equipment and other resources but also through special programmes such as Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Garda on the success of last weekend&rsquo;s operation in Cork when a very significant weapons seizure took place.  I know I speak for the whole House when I say that was a most welcome and significant achievement.  I will not comment further on that case other than to say it surely removes any doubt there might be about the ruthless and frightening nature of gangland crime.</P>
        <P>Legislation and Garda resources are but two elements in the fight against gangland crime.  I remind people that we can all play a role, not <Col N="2091"/>only by co-operating with the authorities but also in our own lifestyle choices.  Many people, often our best and brightest, but perhaps without realising it, make it possible for gangland activity to persist and expand.  People who engage in what they see as occasional or recreational drug use or who are prepared to buy goods without asking or caring where they came from contribute significantly to the gangland threat.  Those people make gangland activity profitable and worthwhile.  They allow it to spread and gain hold throughout the country and in all strata of society.  It is not enough that we condemn gangland activity.  We must also ensure we do not contribute in any way to its continued existence.  People should have no doubt in their minds about the major role they can play in defeating organised gangland crime.  They also should reflect for a moment on the situation that could exist several years from now if we fail to mobilise to face this threat.</P>
        <P>The Bill will enable law enforcement agencies to confront much more effectively the threat posed by criminal gangs.  As a result, the prospects of successful investigations and prosecutions are enhanced by extended detention periods, new arrangements for taking and retaining samples, new clarity about the law on the drawing of inferences from a suspect&rsquo;s silence, new powers to deal with possession of cash or articles intended for the commission of an offence, new arrangements for taking statements by electronic means, and restrictions on access to tapes of interviews.  It will also be possible to mount more effective challenges to bail applications.  In addition, there are several useful technical improvements to the operation of the bail laws that will address concerns about non-collection of forfeited bail moneys and other operational matters.</P>
        <P>The courts will have more powers to deal with repeat gangland offenders, including post-release supervision arrangements.  It is important to note that two types of order are being proposed.  One order will protect victims and other vulnerable persons by limiting or prohibiting access or contact.  The other order will enable garda&iacute; to monitor the offender, establish whether he or she is likely to re-offend, and build up intelligence on gang movements and membership.  Further clarity is provided on the circumstances where the minimum mandatory sentences for drug trafficking and firearms offences are to apply.  I remind the House that all powers and changes in the Bill are in addition to the successful legislation already in <Col N="2092"/>operation to deal with the proceeds of crime and the confiscation of illegally acquired assets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Concerns were expressed that the measures we are enacting could impact unfavourably on the personal rights and freedoms of people who have nothing to do with gangland crime.  Much of the concern may have arisen because the target group &mdash; namely, gangland criminals &mdash; is difficult to define in legal terms and therefore there is a fear that measures directed at that group may impact unfavourably on others.  I agree that &ldquo;gangland crime&rdquo; is a difficult thing to define, given the obscure world in which it operates and the unstructured nature of the gangs.  Nevertheless, we can all recognise gangland crime when we see it and we have no difficulty in distinguishing between it and other crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is right to be vigilant about any such unintended effects.  The T&aacute;naiste has paid serious attention to the views expressed by a range of bodies and individuals.  As a result, he has amended the Bill not only to ensure it was more clearly focused on achieving its target, but also to ensure the scope for unintended impacts was reduced in so far as possible.  This was done, for example, by reviewing the scope of Schedule 2, the addition of a subsection to section 25 that gives the court discretion in the application of mandatory sentence provisions for repeat offenders and raising the threshold in that section which triggers the imposition of the mandatory sentence provision for repeat offenders.  In addition, an amendment makes clear that the expression of an opinion by a chief superintendent in bail cases does not interfere with the ultimate discretion of the court in deciding whether or not to grant bail.  As a result of those and other changes, the Bill is more tightly structured, with a clearer focus on its main target &mdash; the gangland criminal.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There are occasions when we are all rightly concerned for the health of our democracy when we see the excesses of organised crime.  However, the debate on this Bill both within and outside the Oireachtas demonstrates a lively interest in constitutional and legal affairs.  It also demonstrates a clear conviction that what happens in this and the Upper House does matter.  We can take heart from such a strong belief in the role and relevance of the Oireachtas regarding our rights and freedoms.  I am also reassured by the strength of civil society and by its sense of public duty, which all amounts to a healthy democratic balance.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and assure them that their comments have been well noted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious matter and I am glad that the Minister of State who heard my opinions on the Criminal Justice Bill is here because I made the point that this is all of a piece with the situation wherein a citizen of this country, presumed innocent, can be brought before a court and, effectively, jailed for seven days on the word of a garda who is immune from cross-examination and does not have to reveal his or her reasons.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am involved in a case concerning a young man who is here in the House.  I wish the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, were here so I could point out that this is the person of whom he has such an extraordinary and irrational fear.  The man is a friend of mine and my partner, Tevfik.  My attention was brought to the fact that a difficulty had ensued when he applied for naturalisation.  If the Minister&rsquo;s response is not completely favourable, I propose to pursue this matter through the courts because an extraordinarily dangerous precedent has been set.</P><Col N="2094"/>
        <P>The young man in question is a respectable professional from Algeria in north Africa.  He is an architect by profession and his brother, his brother&rsquo;s wife and her family live here.  Having been accepted as an asylum seeker, he has been legitimately in the country as a refugee for a considerable number of years.  After the statutory period of years elapsed, he applied for naturalisation and a decision was made by an assistant principal in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to refuse the application.  In the documentation sent to him he was informed he could appeal the decision and when considering making a re-application he should &ldquo;give due regard to the reasons for refusal given in the attached submission&rdquo;.  The document was signed by Joan Brown from the citizenship section.  In other words, he could appeal the decision but ought to include the reasons for the refusal.  Naturally, he requested details of the reasons for the refusal but, astonishingly, his request was refused.  He pursued the matter under the Freedom of Information Act and was again refused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wonder what country we are living in.  This is Kafkaesque.  If a person who is a resident of the country is such a danger, why was it considered appropriate that he be given refugee status?  I have pursued the cavalier refusal to grant his application as much as I could and was more or less warned off the case.  It was indicated to me that I did not want to know but I do want to know, as does the gentleman in question.  I have asked him at every stage of this process whether there is any matter, including of a criminal nature, in his background of which he is ashamed or if he has any links to so-called Islamic terrorist groups.  He has assured me again and again that this is not the case.  His only crime that I can determine is that he is from a Muslim background.  He has told me he wants to know of what he is accused in order that he can defend his good name and reputation.  I wonder what has been put into the <Col N="2095"/>system and what is the reason for the refusal of the citizenship application.</P>
        <P>This case is reminiscent of a series of other cases dating back to the Dreyfus case and constitutes a clear breach of natural justice.  I assume there has been a mistake but it is not one for which the gentleman in question should pay.  If the Minister can produce a scrap of evidence, I demand he place it before the House.  My informant, the person in question, has indicated to me that he is happy to answer any questions.  Let us get to the bottom of this case and ascertain what black mark there is against him.  Let us see if he can explain it because I believe he can.  If he cannot do so, that is a different matter.</P>
        <P>I believe a serious, fundamental matter of human rights is once again being broached today.  I seriously distrust the professionalism of those engaged in the relevant section of the Department.  I receive complaint after complaint about it and it is simply not good enough.  I await with interest the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I shall, with my informant&rsquo;s consent and encouragement, take this matter further if it is not satisfactorily resolved today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his or her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows.</P>
        <P>In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour.  Applications must be processed in a manner which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure citizenship is not undervalued and is given only to persons who are <Col N="2096"/>suitably qualified.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  It should be noted that approximately one third of all applications for naturalisation received are not completed correctly, necessitating the forms and accompanying documentation being returned to the applicant with an explanation of the problem involved.  Valid applications are examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and inquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.</P>
        <P>Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, more than 1,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to have insufficient residency in the State for the purposes of naturalisation.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to re-apply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of his or her ability to support himself or herself in the State.  Inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time, inquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ascertain if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once all inquiries have been completed, the file is referred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a decision.  These procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and the T&aacute;naiste is satisfied they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  The Senator will appreciate that these processes can, by their nature, take quite some time to complete.</P>
        <P>The person referred to in the Senator&rsquo;s question arrived in the State on 27 July 2001.  On 30 July 2001 he applied for asylum.  His application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 12 April 2002.  On appeal, this decision was set aside by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the person in question was declared a refugee under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on 19 February 2003.  On 28 October 2004, he made an application for the granting of a certificate of naturalisation.  This application was considered under the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 and 1986 and the Minister decided on 8 March 2006 not to grant naturalisation.  A copy of the submission prepared by officials in the Department at the time was forwarded to the applicant for his information.</P><Col N="2097"/>
        <P>In reaching his decision the Minister exercised the absolute discretion as provided by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts.  While the said Acts do not provide for a formal process of appeal of his decision to refuse naturalisation, the Minister is obliged to make the reasons for his decision available to the applicant under the provisions of section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  The Minister understands the applicant submitted a request under the Act for records held by his Department in this matter and a decision on that request was communicated to him on 15 May 2006.  If, following an examination of the copy of his or her case file, an applicant considers the Minister&rsquo;s decision has been based on incorrect or incomplete information, it is open to him or her to seek a review of that decision.</P>
        <P>The applicant was also informed that he may re-apply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time and the Minister understands a second application was lodged in the citizenship section of his Department on 23 March 2006.  That section is processing applications made in the latter half of 2004.  Applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed fairest to all applicants and the individual in question might therefore expect to receive a decision in his case in the latter half of next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, the last paragraph of which was helpful.  The antepenultimate paragraph of the reply states, &ldquo;A copy of the submission prepared by officials of the Department at the time was forwarded to the applicant for his information.&rdquo;  I have just confirmed with the person involved, who is present in the Visitor&rsquo;s Gallery, that it was not forwarded to him.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has not addressed the subject of the matter, which was the need for the Minister to provide the information, which he has not done.  There has been some back-tracking.  The Minister of State said, &ldquo;If ... an applicant considers the Minister&rsquo;s decision has been based on incorrect or incomplete information, it is open to him or her to seek a review of that decision.&rdquo;  We are seeking such a review.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should take back to the persons responsible in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it is not good enough in a 21st century European democracy to behave in this Kafkaesque way.  The gentleman in the Visitor&rsquo;s Gallery demands to know who put a black mark against him and what is that black mark.  I want the officials in the Department to know I will pursue this matter to the bitter end.  Woe for them if they have behaved wrongly because, if I cannot get an answer in the Oireachtas, I will make sure in the courts of this land that I get an answer in justice and decency for all the people in this country.</P>

      <sTitle>Hereditary Disorders.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Haemochromatosis is an hereditary and potentially life-threatening disorder which affects a considerable number of Irish people.  While it can be asymptomatic for years, it has the potential in the absence of detection and treatment to cause death at a relatively early age.  The condition is the most commonly inherited autosomal recessive disorder in the white population, with a prevalence of 0.2% to 0.5% in those of northern European origin, particularly Nordic or Celtic people, in whom it occurs with a prevalence of one in 200 of the population.</P>
        <P>The condition causes the excessive absorption of dietary iron and a progressive increase in total body iron stores.  The accumulation of iron takes place in the liver, the pancreas, the heart and the anterior pituitary gland, causing life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiac failure and arrhythmia, and cancer of the liver.  Other manifestations include skin pigmentation, destructive arthritis and hypogonadism.  Many people in Ireland find out they have hereditary haemochromatosis when they are diagnosed with another condition, for example, diabetes.</P>
        <P>The risk of mortality increases rapidly in men over 45 years of age and women over 55 who suffer from this condition and who are not given treatment.  The Minister for Health and Children set up a working group in March 2006 to examine the condition.  This group, chaired by the former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, took a great deal of effort and reported rapidly, in June 2006.  It was asked to establish the extent of haemochromatosis in this country, examine the possibilities of screening, consider the need for screening and its implications, and so on.  The group concluded that, as one in every ten people here has a single mutated gene and one in every few hundred has two, screening to identify asymptomatic persons in whom iron indices are elevated by hereditary haemochromatosis should be recommended as a potentially cost-effective strategy for preventing hereditary haemochromatosis and associated morbidity and mortality.</P>
        <P>A blood test is all that is required.  If the transfer and saturation is greater than 45% most cases will be diagnosed.  This has been shown to be effective in nearly 98% of cases in a country such as Australia.  In chapter 3 of its report, the group recommends that funding should be made available immediately to screen 10,000 subjects in order to consider the issue in detail.  A public awareness campaign of the condition should be also instituted and it was suggested the Irish Haemochromatosis Association could play a lead a role in this.  It is also very important that the Irish College of General Practitioners should be involved in this education process.</P>
        <P>People frequently visit their doctors suffering from lethargy or self-prescribe iron for them<Col N="2099"/>selves.  As the Minister of State will know, lethargy is one of the symptoms of haemochromatosis but it is sometimes suspected the person has anaemia and iron is prescribed or is taken by the person, making his or her condition worse.  Also, some people take iron-fortified food, not realising that this will have a deleterious effect on their health.  It would be beneficial if the public were told about this as the disease would become better known.  It was suggested that doses of iron over 60 mg should be made available by prescription only.</P>
        <P>There are further recommendations regarding the prevention of discrimination against hereditary haemochromatosis sufferers by life insurance companies, where people have treatment and are then considered unsuitable for life insurance.  If they are making an effort to address this life-threatening condition, they should not be discriminated against.  It is suggested that the same should apply to health insurance policies.  It was also suggested that the Voluntary Health Insurance board should be asked to review its policy whereby members who are diagnosed must wait for five years for cover for venesection, which is the treatment that is needed.  Venesection is expensive.  Rather than having either the VHI or the patient paying for this, the group also recommended it should be paid for by the State and carried out by general practitioners, which would mean hospital attendance would be avoided by these patients.</P>
        <P>Only one recommendation has been brought forward and it is the only one which did not require action by the Department of Health and Children.  One of the recommendations asked the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to review its policy regarding refusing to take blood from the venesection procedures that haemochromatosis sufferers must undertake.  It has decided to have a pilot scheme in its Stillorgan centre to take blood from these people rather than having it wasted.  As far as I can discover, that is the only recommendation that has been progressed.</P>
        <P>When we debated today&rsquo;s motion on the commission to investigate the Leas Cross nursing home affair, I said it was fine setting up a commission but all I expected was another report on which nothing would happen.  I have seen repeatedly in this House that reports are produced and we seem to think we have done something.  Nothing happens unless we do something about the recommendations.  We either dismiss them or we decide whether they are to be acted on.  It is unfortunate that a committee that worked so rapidly and produced this excellent report has had its report sidelined in a similar way to all the other reports I have seen coming into this House in the past 15 years.  I doubt if even 2% of them have been acted on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Early last year, the Minister established a working group to examine the nature and extent of haemochromatosis and to provide advice on the actions necessary to address the problems caused by the condition.  The group, which was chaired by Mr. Maurice Manning, reported with 20 recommendations in June last year.  Since then, progress has been made in a number of areas.</P>
        <P>A key issue highlighted in the report was that blood from persons with haemochromatosis was not being used by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS.  The IBTS has re-examined its policy on this issue and has decided to establish a pilot venesection programme for haemochromatosis patients in one of its clinics.  Subject to the usual screening protocols, blood from these patients will be used by the IBTS.  A clinician has been appointed to one of the IBTS clinics to oversee the pilot programme.</P>
        <P>Department of Health and Children officials contacted the Irish Insurance Federation with regard to problems some people had encountered regarding insurance once they were diagnosed with the condition.  The federation has agreed to investigate any complaint about life or health insurance cover linked to diagnosis with haemochromatosis.  Department officials met representatives of the population health directorate of the Health Service Executive last year to progress the relevant recommendations in the report, especially those relating to health promotion and awareness.  Work continues in this regard and another meeting will take place in the coming weeks between senior management of the HSE and Department of Health and Children.  The provision of appropriate venesection services will be a key issue for examination by this group.</P>
        <P>The report was also sent to the Irish College of General Practitioners to ensure that general practitioners had up-to-date information on the matter.  The Irish Haemochromatosis Association has also been in contact with the college.  For its part, that association continues to increase awareness among both clinicians and patients of the issues related to the condition.  On behalf of the Minister, I pay tribute to the association which has held a range of seminars throughout the country and has also updated a patient information booklet on the subject, which has been circulated to its 900 members.  The Minister is confident that over the coming months, further progress will be made on implementing the recommendations in the working group&rsquo;s report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again, most of the action has been taken by bodies outside the House and the Department.  I suggest it would be a good idea to work on getting the pilot scheme to the point where 10,000 people are screened.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice founded the Christian Brothers and set up his first school in Waterford at Mount Sion.  Although I am a De La Salle man, I am deeply proud of the Christian Brothers&rsquo; beginnings and traditions and of Mount Sion and the host of luminaries it has produced in the academic, political and sporting fields in County Waterford and the country.</P>
        <P>The board of management, the principal, the teachers and the parents of children attending Mount Sion secondary school were told more than five years ago that they would get a new school and that this school was at pre-tender stage.  The then Minister, Deputy Woods, when opening the Abbey community school in Ferrybank in Waterford, announced that moneys had been allocated for four other new schools in Waterford city and county, including Mount Sion secondary school.  However, Mount Sion is the only one of the four not to have received the green light to proceed with its new school.  With all due respect to Department officials, those connected with Mount Sion have been fobbed off with promises from them and politicians as to when their school will commence.  It is questionable whether they will even get the go ahead at this stage.</P>
        <P>In a meeting with a high-ranking Department official in January 2005, representatives from Mount Sion were assured they would get the go ahead for the new school.  At another meeting in January 2006, they were assured the new school was &ldquo;a priority issue&rdquo; and had the highest rating.  The school&rsquo;s representatives sought a meeting with the Department again in 2007, but no meeting has been granted as yet.  They were told they would have a technical visit from an official by March 2007, but that has not taken place to date.</P>
        <P>There are serious health and safety deficiencies in the current school which require urgent attention.  The school authorities need to know whether they will get their new school and when they will get the go ahead to start building.  The site is available and everything is in place.  All they need is a green light from the Department.  The school has no PE hall, no modern facilities and will die unless permission is granted to proceed immediately.  It may be suggested that falling numbers are the reason for the delay, but what else can be expected if a school cannot provide the modern day requirements for which the school&rsquo;s excellent staff are crying out?</P>
        <P>It would be a shame to see this school founded by Edmund Ignatius Rice fade out of existence because of false promises and a lack of urgency by the Department of Education and Science and its political masters.  The people of Waterford and people throughout the world who support the Christian Brothers will not stand for this treatment of a fine school which has contributed so <Col N="2102"/>much to the nation.  I earnestly hope an announcement allowing the commencement of the new school will be made without further delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the strategy of the Department of Education and Science for capital investment in education projects and the current position with regard to capital funding for Mount Sion secondary school, Waterford.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>The Government has dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme from just over &euro;90 million when it came into office to &euro;540 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>This year, more than &euro;300 million will be invested in large-scale building projects, concentrated mainly on the provision of school accommodation in rapidly developing areas.  This level of funding will facilitate construction work on more than 150 large-scale projects which will deliver more than 15,000 additional permanent places in new schools and the extension and modernisation of facilities in existing schools for more than 45,000 pupils.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the schools building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.  The balance will be used to fund the other elements of the schools building programme such as the summer works scheme, the small schools scheme, the permanent accommodation scheme, etc.  In total more than 1,500 school building projects will be delivered in 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to Mount Sion secondary school, the Department is in receipt of an application for major capital funding from the management authority of that school.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale works and has been assigned a band 2 rating.  The Department recognises the historic significance of the school in the provision of education by the Christian Brothers in the country and accepts that the <Col N="2103"/>building is not in a good condition.  In this regard, a technical inspection recommended that consideration be given to the construction of a new school on the site rather than refurbishment of the existing school.  However, the site is very difficult and a significant amount of abnormal costs would arise in its development.  Progress on the proposed works was, however, put on hold due to the declining enrolments at the school.  The Department is concerned about this and particularly the school&rsquo;s ability to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>The possibility of an amalgamation with the second Christian Brothers school in Waterford, which also has declining numbers, has been mooted.  The Department awaits clarification from the trustees of their position on this proposal.  When this is known it will consider how to proceed, taking into account the long-term post <Col N="2104"/>primary school accommodation requirements for Waterford City.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Cummins for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, his response included several red herrings regarding other schools.  Mount Sion wants to know if and when it will get its new school.  The Government is obviously not going to answer that question although the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced the money for it more than five years ago.  It is a disgrace that a school set up by Brother Ignatius Rice is treated in such a manner and that it receives false promises which are crippling the fabric of the secondary school in Mount Sion.  It is unfortunate it is being fobbed off again today. </P>
