	<P>I have received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy that, on the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the exact position regarding cancer care services in the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate a willingness to explore with the Ministers for Arts, Sports and Tourism and Health and Children and their officials the way recent research underlining the links between music and the development of the left hemisphere of the brain, which supports reasoning, can be brought into early education opportunities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Alan Kelly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to clarify the level of progress, if any, that has been made in the proposed decentralisation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its staff from its Amiens Street and Baggot Street offices in Dublin to Mallow, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 16.

	<P>I agree to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>In the past few weeks, a number of Senators have asked the Minister for Education and Science to address the concerns they have expressed about education.  The report published today by the ESRI on young people dropping out of school merits discussion in this House because it is extraordinary that so many young people, and young men in particular, are dropping out of school.  Between 1980 and 1988, the number of students completing the leaving certificate increased significantly from 60% to 82%.  That was a superb improvement which we all assumed would continue but no progress has been made over the past ten years.  Some 23% of young men and 14% of young women do not sit the leaving certificate examination, with implications for those concerned.  Many of these young people come from disadvantaged backgrounds and, while a variety of programmes are in place, they are clearly not reaching their families.  This House should analyse why this has gone so wrong despite the prosperity of the past ten years.  Once again, the issue of public services arises.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the electoral register.   Several Senators have called for a debate on the Boundary Commission.  Yesterday, the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government heard from the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Taoiseach announced in the D&aacute;il that local <Col N="1223"/>boundaries would be reviewed before the next local elections.  It appears the register continues to contain huge inaccuracies and it would be welcomed by Senators across the House if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government addressed these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter of the GPA and GAA has been raised on a number of occasions in the past two weeks.  I have hesitated to become involved in the matter and should declare an interest, in that I am part of the negotiating team dealing with the GPA on behalf of the GAA.  The GAA and the GPA reached an agreement, of which I was part, and signed off on it more than one year ago.  That agreement was brought to the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism prior to the election but it was not acceptable to his Department.  We went back to the drawing board with the GPA and Dessie Farrell, myself and a few others hammered out another agreement which was signed off on.  There is complete agreement on both sides and once again the agreement was brought to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  To some extent, it was not acceptable to the Department.</P>
        <P>There is no disagreement between the GPA and the GAA.  They are in full agreement that this should be administered by the Sports Council.  The Sports Council is a creature of Government and, therefore, it depends on Government to make it work.  Any difficulties are minor.  This merely needs political will and a decision at a high level to make it work.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is supportive of the idea but somebody needs to call the shots which is all that is required at this stage.  That is the official position.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom filleadh ar &aacute;bhar ar a labhair m&eacute; go minic anuraidh, s&eacute; sin ceist Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  I understand the Government has agreed with Deputy Healy-Rae that the wishes of the people of the town be granted and the name be changed back to Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is or a choice of either of those.  That was determined by a plebiscite with 97% in support.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should take this on board and make the decision required.  There must be a period of time between the Minister issuing a regulation to change a name back to what it should be and the time it comes into operation.  Will the Leader raise that matter on my behalf?</P>
        <P>This trouble with Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Gort and other places would not have arisen if the Local Government Act 2001, which was initiated in this House and allowed people to make a decision by plebiscite on the name of their area, was commenced.  The Deputy Leader might raise with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the importance of commencing the Local Government Act 2002, which was passed four years ago <Col N="1224"/>and gives local authority to local people in the naming of the places in which they live.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald made a very strong point about school drop-out rates.  I support her call for a debate with the Minister for Education and Science or perhaps, more appropriately, with the Minister of State with responsibility for children who will be in the House later today on a separate matter.  Allied to that, I refer to another startling report in today&rsquo;s newspapers from the Psychological Society of Ireland which is holding a forum this week.  It conducted a survey and discovered that significant numbers of secondary school students in certain areas of Dublin were being recruited into gangs and, not only that, had regular access to guns and other firearms.  Admittedly, the study is a relatively small sample but it should cause us great concern.</P>
        <P>It follows on the heel of similar material we saw last week in regard to Limerick.  It points to the need for this House to hold a debate and for Government and relevant Ministers to take action to address early intervention in communities and neighbourhoods, which is vitally important.  We all support the garda&iacute; and additional resources for them in tackling crime and violent crime.  However, it has become fashionable to forget about the fact that many of these serious problems are due directly to long term chronic poverty and welfare dependency in communities where young children have no other route out of poverty than to very often take part in violent crime and become involved in drug abuse and the sale of drugs.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House to debate these vitally important issues which very often escape our attention when talking about particular incidents of crime?</P>
        <P>I noted the Taoiseach returned to the subject of salary increases yesterday.  I thought he must have been emboldened by the spirited and enthusiastic defence of the salary increases by Senator O&rsquo;Toole in the House last week because he compared himself to other European leaders and referred to the castles, yachts and everything else he believes they have.  Does that mean the Government will finally abandon its refusal to understand that relative poverty is the proper indicator of poverty in this country?  Until now it has refused to accept that as a key indicator.  It seems the Taoiseach accepts relative poverty is the way to address these issues.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise an issue which links into the one raised earlier about early school leavers.  In the region from which I come females have left school early to go into the tex<Col N="1225"/>tile industry while young men have left to go into construction.  The impact the success of the economy is having on our generation might be a topic worth discussing.  Young people leave school early to get money and immediate gratification from what it can buy.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspaper referred to a report from Barnardos about the concern among parents about the amount of time they spend with their children given the juggling they must do.  We all know the more time parents have to bond and interact with their children, the happier the children will be.  It seems parents determine their success by the number of televisions, DVDs, etc., their young children have.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the impact the successful economy is having on the next generation?  That debate could be broad and include the difficulty of bullying, drug abuse and the abuse of alcohol about which we frequently talk but which we have not yet addressed in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in expressing concern about the fact the number of leaving certificate completions has not significantly changed in the past couple of years.  However, the same report points out that a greater number of students are availing of other courses such as FETAC and post leaving certificate courses.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, was in the House a few weeks ago speaking about post leaving certificate courses and he said he would look into the fact some regions seem to have different caps compared to others.  Meath has one student place per 1,000 of population compared to a national average of four student places per 1,000 of population.  Will the Leader ask the Minister of State if he has had any further thoughts about increasing the number of places on PLC courses for people in counties like Meath?</P>
        <P>I also raise the subject of driver test pass rates and the comparison between private and public test centres.  A report in this morning&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times </i>states that of the 40,000 tests carried out this year, the pass rate in private test centres was 62% compared to just 52% in the Road Safety Authority test centres.  That difference may not seem large but when one examines the figures and looks at them at local level, one sees that some of the differences give cause for concern.  For example, the pass rate at the private test centre in Kells is almost seven out of ten applicants whereas just ten miles away in Navan, the pass rate is five out of ten at the public test centre.  In effect, a person has a 40% higher chance of passing if he or she goes ten miles up the road to Kells.  I have driven in those parts and there are great drivers on the roads.  I have no doubt about their competence.  However, will the Leader impress upon the Minister that in his zeal to ensure he reduces the driver test waiting times, he does not let standards slip?  We must ensure standards are the same across the board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure I speak for all in expressing concern about the increase in the price of a barrel of oil up to $94, which is beyond our control.  The Exchequer will gain quite considerably through VAT and excise duty on the cost of diesel, which is approximately &euro;1.14 per litre, and petrol, which is approximately &euro;1.18 per litre.  The prices are quite consistent throughout the country, except for the famous filling station along the quays.  I do not believe we will get an opportunity to meet the Minister for Finance in this forum before the budget.  We will meet him at the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party.  We are making detailed budgetary submissions to the Minister and the rest of the Cabinet.  We are availing of the opportunity we have in that respect.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to ensure that the tax windfall that is about to accrue to the Revenue Commissioners will be ring-fenced to assist people on carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that it also be used to pay the free fuel allowance &mdash; an increased allowance, if possible &mdash; to elderly people 52 weeks of the year.  That would give us a satisfactory return on the additional taxes which have been collected from all taxpayers, including hauliers, on behalf of the Exchequer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in calling for action to be taken in respect of Dingle &mdash; Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  Far too much time has passed since the people of the town voted <Col N="1227"/>overwhelmingly in a plebiscite in favour of a name change.  The legitimacy of the result of the plebiscite is well accepted.  I was pleased to hear Senator O&rsquo;Toole say that the Government has reached agreement with Deputy Healy-Rae, presumably as part of the coalition package.  As we all know, redress has been badly needed in this respect for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want a discussion on the name of Dingle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but I want to add my voice to that of Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who called on the Leader to ask the Minister to ensure the order is signed and the necessary regulation is made.  It has already been pointed out that there has to be a lead-in period.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a discussion on the boundary revisions recently recommended by the Constituency Commission.  Can the Leader tell us when the Government intends to give legislative effect to those recommendations?  When will a Bill be introduced to facilitate a debate on the matter in the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Bh&iacute; ionadh orm nuair a chuala m&eacute; go raibh baile Gaeltachta ag iarraidh a ainm a aistri&uacute; go dt&iacute; an leagan B&eacute;arla.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s request for a debate on the report on early school leaving, which has been a matter of concern in County Wexford for some time.  Some children leave the education system when they finish primary school, without going on to secondary school.  It perpetuates the disadvantage which is often a feature of their backgrounds.  Education needs to be a central part of any attempt to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.  I echo Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments in that regard.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, rather than the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to come to the House to debate the role sport can play in bringing the people of this island closer together.  We have learned in recent weeks that the Brazilian football team is to come to Croke Park next February, which is interesting.  If we could field an all-Ireland team to take on the Brazilians, just as we did in the 1970s, it would be a tremendous achievement.  I refer to what was called the &ldquo;Shamrock Rovers XI&rdquo; team that was formed on foot of an initiative led by Derek Dougan of Northern Ireland and others.  The great changes we have seen on this island in recent years have resulted from the pioneering work of the Taoiseach, certain politicians in the North and others.  If an all-Ireland football team could be fielded in Croke Park next year, it would be a step in the right direction.  Not only would it have great symbolism, it would also be a fitting tribute to a man who espoused the idea of an all-Ireland team &mdash; the late George Best, who was probably <Col N="1228"/>the greatest sportsman ever produced by this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In reiterating the calls made by Senators yesterday for a debate on the health service, I would like to emphasise one aspect of it.  Somebody must have been listening to what was said yesterday when a number of Senators, including myself, raised the question of hospital hygiene.  It is worrying that, according to the report published yesterday, a large number of people die from hospital-acquired infections.  When I was watching television last night, I discovered that despite the proliferation of managers and systems in the health service, we do not have precise figures for the level of mortality that results from hospital-acquired infections.  It is astonishing that the health service authorities have admitted that we do not know how many people actually die.  We learned in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that our hospitals are not just dirty &mdash; they are actually filthy.  Just seven of this country&rsquo;s 51 public hospitals are rated as &ldquo;good&rdquo;, the vast majority &mdash; 35 &mdash; are &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and nine are &ldquo;poor&rdquo;, which means they are really dirty and dangerous.  Is anybody surprised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want a debate on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It is very important that a debate be arranged to allow us to look at this situation.  The point I made yesterday &mdash; that it is not acceptable that it can take a long time for spillages of human waste to be cleaned when contract cleaners are in hospitals for a limited number of hours &mdash; was emphasised again today on the radio.  I direct the attention of the Members of the House to a passionate letter written by Dr. Patrick Plunkett, which is published in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>.  All Senators should read it.</P>
        <P>The Seanad debate on dirt in hospitals could be widened to reflect the fact that we are a filthy people.  I really do not know of any other society that is so dirty.  When I said in this House a couple of years ago that people routinely urinate and defecate in the streets of Dublin, I was laughed at and wisecracks were made by Senators on all sides of the House.  Respectable people can often be seen putting their feet up on the seats of public transport.  God knows what they have been walking in.  If a nurse sits on such a seat, for example in a train, he or she might bring whatever was left on it into a hospital.  Are we surprised?  It is time for us to recognise and deal with the idea of Irish filth.  Perhaps I will make a suggestion off the top of my head &mdash; why not do a Chairman Mao on all these managers?  Just as he sent professional people to work in the fields to give them a taste of physical labour, why should we not make hospital managers do a bit of cleaning?</P>

	<P>Can I ask about the Defamation Bill 2006?  When I raised this matter a week or two ago, the Leader agreed with me that it was not a good idea to reintroduce it on Committee Stage as 35 Senators &mdash; a majority of the Members of the House &mdash; had not had an opportunity to discuss it on Second Stage.  He said my proposal was sensible.  I see that sense has not yet broken out on the Order Paper &mdash; the Bill is still listed there for Committee Stage.  We know that the Minister has decided to drop the Privacy Bill 2006, which was supposed to partner the Defamation Bill 2006.  As a consequence of some significant developments in this regard &mdash; I refer to a series of libel cases resulting from some damaging reporting in the newspapers &mdash; we have some new information that should be taken into account.  Will the Leader provide for a sensible discussion on the Defamation Bill 2006, instead of taking a short cut by reintroducing it on Committee Stage?</P>

        <P>We should have more confidence in our ability, on an all-island basis, to attract world-class international events to these shores.  We need to consider what the rally will do for tourism in the north-west.  All the hotels will be packed during <Col N="1230"/>the low season and the entire entertainment industry in the region will benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is timely that Senator Walsh and other Members should debate the merits of sport in bringing this entire island together.  I refer to the role it can play in attracting world-class international events to Ireland, such as the World Rally Championship which starts in Belfast tomorrow and continues in the north-west region throughout the weekend.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has announced that a referendum will be held on the new EU treaty in the first half of next year.  The House is due to have a debate on this treaty but I wish to draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to two issues.  In the context of the opt-out on policing and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, indicated, and this is indicated in the declaration as well, that Ireland is fully committed to this area of co-operation.  However, research shows a host of decisions at European level have not been transposed into Irish law and there is inordinate delay in other cases in transposing those measures, for instance, orders freezing property and evidence combatting corruption in the private sector.  Ireland has implemented the European arrest warrant but the latest European Commission report states that we have not fully implemented that framework decision in accordance with the requirements of EU law.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Director of Public Prosecutions, James Hamilton, recently said that the European arrest warrant was fundamental to improving justice in Europe.  He also disagreed with the Government on its decision to opt out of this area.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be asked to clarify this matter for the House and explain what is meant by &ldquo;fully committed&rdquo;.  He should clarify the reason Ireland has failed in some instances to implement these measures.</P>
        <P>We have learned the lesson from the referendum on the Nice treaty that domestic issues play a significant role in the decisions of voters on EU treaty referenda.  I note that the Taoiseach is held up to ridicule in the newspapers today, in particular with regard to the salary increases and his unbelievable evidence to the Mahon tribunal.  The electorate will feel they were fooled in the general election campaign on such matters as the economy, health and other matters.  This House should reflect on whether this referendum will be passed, given the current Taoiseach.  I ask the Leader to reflect on this question as it is an issue which the House could deal with during the debate on the EU treaty.  The referendum will fail if the current Taoiseach is still in power next year.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Norris in his call for a debate on hygiene standards in hospitals.  We did not need to wait until this morning to know that some hospitals are in a deplorable state because this has been known for a long time and they seem to be getting worse rather than better.  This is an independent audit and it has given another result alongside the national audit.  Another Member regarded Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments as flippant but I do not agree.  One in five employees of the Health Service Executive works in administration.  I do not think cleaning is rocket science.  One of those employees could take on the job of supervising the cleaning.  I hope that when the Minister for Health and Children comes to the House next week the debate will be widened to include issues such as this.</P>
        <P>Every day in town I encounter nurses who are out in the street in their uniforms.  They are in shops, supermarkets and restaurants.  They are clearly identifiable as nurses or health care workers because they are wearing either a nursing or other health care professional uniform.  Hygiene is a two-way matter.  There is an onus on members of the public who visit hospitals to take care but there is also an onus on those who work in hospitals not to wear their uniforms in the street and carry back bugs and germs to the vulnerable ill people in hospital.</P>

	<P>I ask for a debate on public transport and alternatives to the use of private cars.  This is timely on a day when thousands of commuters are stranded without bus services.  I am sure we all hope the matter will be resolved at the Labour Court.  However, it begs the question of broader issues about Government support for public transport and for forms of transport other than the private car.</P>
        <P>Last week Senator Ross called for the restoration of Leinster House lawn and that Members would lead by example.  I fully support his call but I take issue with him when he says that most of us drive.  Some of us cycle in every day and we see at first hand the lack of support for cyclists from both the Government and Dublin City Council.  There is a very poor network of cycling lanes and cyclists face extreme danger every day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The fact that the Government has not seen fit to support cycling as an alternative form of transport to private cars is hugely problematic but there is also a lack of support for public transport which is evident in a report last week that inte<Col N="1232"/>grated ticketing for bus, rail, DART and Luas services across Dublin will now not be introduced until 2010, which is appalling.  It was nearly ten years ago when the prospect of integrated ticketing was first raised.  The then Minister, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, said it would definitely be introduced by 2002, the Railway Procurement Agency promised it by 2005 and now we are told it will not be introduced until 2010.  Is it really that difficult to develop an integrated ticket system for all public transport services across Dublin?  We need to debate this issue.</P>

        <P>I join with Senator Fitzgerald in asking for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the education system.  As a school teacher I am acutely aware of the significant funding that has been allocated but this funding is not going in the right direction.  Class sizes have not been altered and the integration programmes have not worked.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, many students are being left behind.</P>
        <P>In light of Senator Alex White&rsquo;s remarks, I ask for a debate on poverty, given that in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers the Taoiseach is claiming he is living in poverty.  This would be an opportune time to have a debate on poverty.</P>

	<P>I have been kept up to date in recent years by a man who suffered from tuberculosis and whose parents contracted tuberculosis in their 70s.  He is very concerned at the rising figures amounting to an increase of 21% in the incidence of tuberculosis.  I refer to a report from a physician in the Mater Hospital who also notes a similar increase and the danger of a pandemic.  We have taken our eye off the ball with regard to tuberculosis.  I ask that the debate with the Minister for Health and Children be broadened to include this subject.  The concern is that this disease may be coming from abroad and that we have no controls to identify the cause of this frightening rise in the incidence of tuberculosis.</P><Col N="1233"/>
        <P>Last night I was in the new pier D in Dublin Airport and I wish to congratulate those who built this so successfully.  I was reminded of the country&rsquo;s immigration services and the fact that the Schengen Agreement affords us the opportunity to join the other 26 member states but which will expect us to be responsible for the control of terrorism and infectious diseases.  These matters should be at the top of the agenda because we have a responsibility in this regard.</P>

Ireland plays a valuable role as a neutral and independent state and it would be timely to have a debate on this issue.</P>

A serious incident recently occurred in Athlone, which has still not been solved.  If CCTV had been in place, it would have been solved by now.  Planning permission was granted for a CCTV system in the town in 1998.  The Leader&rsquo;s party colleague from Westmeath raised this issue in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago after I raised the issue.  The Leader has more of the ear of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform than the Deputy and I ask him to have a word in his ear to expedite the permission.</P>

	<P>Given the current pressure on manufacturing and the significant job losses throughout the State, indigenous industry needs to be developed.  I refer to the community enterprise sector, which concerns community involvement in the facilitation of enterprise, providing industrial units, local employment and flexible working arrangements.  Unfortunately, Government policy in this area is not coherent, as it falls between several stools.  Enterprise Ireland provides funding and support on a competitive basis for buildings while the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides staff support.  There is significant potential in this area as a breeding ground or incubation area for indigenous industry and to facilitate the numerous entrepreneurs in the country.  I call on the Leader to invite to the House the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline a strategy to develop this sector.</P>

	<P>I join Senator MacSharry in welcoming Rally Ireland and the WRC to Sligo.  This event, which will be held over the next few days, will be fantastic.  It will bring a signifi<Col N="1234"/>cant number of visitors to one of the weaker tourism areas in the State, according to the regional breakdown of tourism statistics.  However, this event provides an opportunity to analyse the value of international sporting events brought into the State.  While this rally is welcome, I would question the bang we get for our buck in bringing in other events.  The Ryder Cup was a one off and it was a fantastic event but a number of other events were expensive to hold.  Within a defined budget, their value must be examined in the context of other activities that could have been undertaken to promote tourism, particularly in the weaker parts of the country.  I question the budget set aside for such events, particularly the Seve Trophy recently.  This issue needs to be examined, particularly if money can be reinvested in regional marketing and-or business tourism attractions, given business tourism attracts high yield income.</P>
        <P>While I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the GAA-GPA dispute, there is not much between both organisations.  I will not comment on the negotiations behind the scenes but the crux of the dispute is twofold.  The first issue is the mechanism for payment but I understand agreement has been reached on the Irish Sports Council in this regard while the second issue concerns the amount involved.  The previous Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism suggested a figure but I am not aware that it was honoured following the election.</P>

        <P>Senators Coghlan and Fitzgerald inquired about the electoral register for the local government elections and the redrawing of boundaries.  This is under way and it will conclude in April or May 2008 in good time for the elections in 2009.  I have a great deal of experience in this area and the only way to put together a register properly is to use the postman.  Doctors, priests and garda&iacute; used to know everything about everyone in their respective communities but the postman is the only one who knows when new people move into an area and their addresses.  During the previous D&aacute;il, I requested that the postman would be given the opportunity on a once-off basis to correct the register.  That did not happen but the House should consider that suggestion.  I know from experience in my own area where I sit down with most of the local postmen to do the register.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to Senator O&rsquo;Toole for his information on the up-to-date position regarding the dispute between the GAA and the GPA and I am heartened by his comments.  We all know where the heart of the Taoiseach lies on sport.  He has been outstanding in what he has done for sport.  The dream of every young person, no matter how underprivileged, is to have success and it is fantastic if a team event is involved.  Sport taught me how to be a good loser because, at the end of the day, as Jesse Owens said, it is not the winning that matters, it is the participation, although he said that when he had four gold medals in his pocket.  We cannot encourage young people enough to participate in sports and we cannot do enough for sport generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like Senators MacSharry, Walsh, Kelly and Keaveney, I welcome the World Rally Championship to the north west.  It is a godsend to the people engaged in the tourism industry in the area to have this revenue coming in November.  We cannot invest enough in tourism because we have so much to offer.  Perhaps 50% of the budget might be wasted but which 50% was wasted by the industry for so long?  At the end of the day, we have a beautiful country and lovely people.  Challenges lie ahead but we should accentuate the positives and correct the minuses.  I fully support everything said in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Coghlan referred to the issue of the naming of Dingle or Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  I will pass on their views to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney called for a debate on the impact of the success of our economy over the past ten years.  This is a worthy request.  I will invite the Taoiseach to be present in the House for that debate given that he has presided over our success over the past ten years.  He is possibly the most successful Taoiseach the country has ever had.</P>

        <P>Senator Hannigan raised the matter of driving tests and the success of the instructors in the Kells area.  I note he is taking a keen interest in Kells.  That must be due to the extra 3,000 votes that <Col N="1236"/>Thomas Byrne expects to acquire in that area.

Lest that it might be construed otherwise in the public domain, I wish to point out that there are wonderful people working in the health services.  Most of them have given their lives to their work and the next generation continue to follow in their footsteps.</P>
        <P>The results of yesterday&rsquo;s review were disappointing.  We were all surprised by the findings.  If this is the darkest day and the lowest level of the quality of the service, then it can only improve.  I am sure everyone involved will meet the challenge and in the long term patients will benefit from all the activities carried out in recent weeks, the details of which were published.  I compliment and commend all those working in the health services who are doing their best.  They face an enormous challenge.  The health service being centre stage and receiving major publicity can only be for the better.</P><Col N="1237"/>

        <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on the incidence of tuberculosis.  Members will recall that it was the plague of our country in the 1950s and 1960s.  This disease wiped out families and not only one or two members of a household.  Five members of the family of one of my nearest neighbours died from the plague of TB.  I have no difficulty in time being provided for such a debate.  However, given that we are in the run-up to Christmas, perhaps time could be made available for it during the Independents&rsquo; Private Members&rsquo; time.  Senator Quinn might have a chat with his colleagues to see what progress can be made on that.  I would like such a debate to take place before Christmas if at all possible.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Quinn in the congratulations he extended to everyone concerned in bringing about the opening of pier D at Dublin Airport.  It is a state-of-the-art facility and it will benefit 27,000 to 30,000 passengers per day.  It shows what can be done when the demand for a service exists.</P>

    <Title>Road Safety: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who cannot be in the House.  He intended to deliver this speech which I am making on his behalf.</P>
        <P>This debate gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to update the House on recent developments in road safety policy.  In 2006 we saw the second lowest number of road deaths in 40 years.  That is a sign that matters are improving.  Many of us would agree that matters could improve at an even greater pace.  However, the figures are moving in the right direction.  The collective goal of all those involved in the promotion and delivery of road safety policies is to ensure the improvements that have occurred are sustained and built on.  Every death on our roads is a tragedy too many.</P>
        <P>Significant initiatives in the past two years include the extension of penalty points and fixed charge systems, stronger legislation, mandatory roadside alcohol testing, with which I strongly agree, greater levels of enforcement and, in September 2006, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority.  There is a need for even more fundamental change, which must take place in the minds and attitudes of those who sit behind the wheels of motor vehicles and take journeys each day.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 was launched last month.  It sets out the direction on road safety for the next five years and is the outcome of detailed research and consultation with stakeholders by the Road Safety Authority.  The purpose of the strategy is to reduce death and <Col N="1243"/>injuries on roads to bring us into line with best practice countries.  It will consolidate the reductions in deaths in 2006.  During the life of the strategy the aim is that a minimum of 410 lives will be saved and Ireland will move closer to becoming one of the best practice countries in the EU.  The strategy outlines 126 separate actions and is focused on delivery and outcomes with built-in targets and accountability.  That is the best way forward &mdash; to set targets and quantify them in terms of achievement with specific time horizons.  As anybody in business knows, that is the way to reach targets &mdash; assigning responsibility to individuals for their achievement.  The measures contained in the strategy are based on international best practice and have the endorsement and commitment of all of the stakeholders involved.</P>
        <P>The RSA carried out a comprehensive public consultation process and the new strategy has the support of the public.  It addresses and puts in place actions to deliver many of the items people have called for in recent years and which have a proven road safety dividend in other best practice countries.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will work with the RSA to ensure each of the actions outlined in the strategy are delivered in full.  An annual progress review will be undertaken by the RSA which will oversee the implementation of the strategy and report to the Minister on progress.  It is an ambitious initiative and it behoves everyone to support in full its implementation.</P>
        <P>There has been a 20% drop in deaths on roads since the launch of the Government&rsquo;s first road safety strategy in 1998.  This has been achieved despite a 52% increase in the number of vehicles on our roads.  The reductions experienced in recent years have been continued in 2007.  So far this year, 285 road deaths have taken place which is a reduction of 33 compared with the same date last year.  Welcome as that is, we face an especially hazardous period in the weeks and month ahead, so let us all work to keep the numbers down.</P>
        <P>The core objective of the third road safety strategy is to build on what has been achieved through a range of measures in education, engineering and enforcement.  The strategy recognises the need to evaluate policies to establish whether they are working.  The primary actions set out include proposals to reduce road deaths to no greater than 60 fatalities per million of the population by the end of 2012, with demonstrable downward reductions in each year of the strategy.  This equates to an average of 21 road deaths per month or 252 per annum, a chilling statistic.  The average number of road deaths per month so far this year is 28.  It seeks to reduce injuries by 25% and develop a reliable database for serious injuries based on data from the health care system and insurance industry by the fourth quarter of 2008. <Col N="1244"/> It is extraordinary that these data are not available at present.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to implement a safety camera network to provide in the region of 6,000 hours of enforcement per month to increase conformity with speed limits.  The best way to ensure people comply with the law is to ensure that when they break the law they will be caught.</P>
        <P>Another target is to increase adult front seat belt wearing rates from 86% to 95% or better and to increase the adult rate in the rear seat from 63% to 85% or better by 2012.  The strategy identifies the need to legislate for and introduce a reduction in the legal blood alcohol level for drivers and the Government has accepted that recommendation.  The precise level to which the blood alcohol level will be lowered will follow consideration of the outcome of research being carried out by the RSA into the incidence of drink driving.  The target date for completion of this measure in the strategy is the second quarter of 2009.  This allows for the enactment of the necessary legislation and the adaptation of the enforcement technologies.  However, the Minister for Transport will be doing his best to ensure that as soon as the advice of the RSA on the proposed level is received in the coming months, the target date for the reduction of the blood alcohol level will be improved upon, if possible.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed to review legislation on the issues of roadside breath testing at the scene of a collision and drug driving, and to consider appropriate enforcement options.  This is something that is vital.  Groups representing victims of road tragedies have sought these measures for some time and it is a welcome development.  On the issue of testing at the scene of collisions, the Government has made a commitment that, with the assistance of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, we will determine how existing legislation can be changed to bring about the compulsory testing of drivers at collision scenes while having necessary regard to overriding medical circumstances.  From personal experience I am aware that frequently in road accidents there is a reluctance among members of the Garda attending to look for tests because they are concerned this might interfere with medical procedures.  Again, it is very welcome that this would be changed.</P>
        <P>On the engineering side, the National Roads Authority will invest &euro;1.25 billion each year of the strategy on major inter-urban projects and will develop a new network of motorways and dual carriageways, from Dublin to Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford by 2010.  There are conflicting views, sometimes, on the upgrading of roads but the reality is that high quality roads are the safest.  There has always been a two-fold objective behind the roads programme: the improvement of economic infrastructure and the building of safer roads.  There is now an abundance of statistical evidence that collision rates on our greatly improved stretches of road are sig<Col N="1245"/>nificantly lower than on those parts of the network where improvements are planned.</P>
        <P>In relation to education, the Road Safety Authority will implement programmes in preschool, primary, post-primary and third levels in the community by the end of 2008.  This again is a very welcome initiative.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to research, develop and publish a national pedestrian safety strategy, a national motorcycling safety strategy and a national safety strategy for cyclists by the first quarter of 2009.  The implementation of these further measures should assist in maintaining the downward trend in road deaths which we have seen in recent times.</P>
        <P>The new learner permit was introduced on 30 October for all first-time licence applicants as well as those renewing their provisional licences after that date.  This is a key building stone in the introduction of a graduated licensing system for Ireland.  The Minister is aware that many people in Ireland depend on their cars and acknowledges that the backlog of driving tests has meant that many of those who would like the opportunity to become fully licensed have not been able to take a driving test.  There is widescale recognition on all sides within the Houses of the Oireachtas that this is an area that has caused difficulties.</P>
        <P>For that reason and to enable them to apply for a driving test or make alternative arrangements, the Minister has deferred until 30 June 2008 the introduction of the requirement for second provisional licence holders to be accompanied by a qualified driver.  This move was made in response to two clear messages from the public.  In the first place, there was strong support for the proposed reforms to improve road safety.  There was also a strong desire for a reasonable lead-in time to enable people to prepare for and take their test or to make alternative arrangements.</P>
        <P>The amended arrangements that were announced on 28 October are as follows.  From 30 October 2007, the provisional licence is being replaced by a learner permit to emphasise the fact that the holder is learning to drive.  From 30 October 2007, a new applicant learner permit holder must be accompanied by a driver who must hold a full licence for at least two years.  With effect also from 30 October 2007, new applicant learner permit holders cannot apply for a driving test for six months.  Existing provisional licences will continue in force until their expiry date, after which holders will be issued with learner permits.  From 30 June 2008, a holder of a second provisional licence or learner permit for a car must be accompanied at all times.  He or she may, however, drive unaccompanied in the period up to 30 June 2008.  The existing rule that first, third and subsequent holders of provisional licences must be accompanied by a person holding a full driving licence, for which no minimum period is necessary, continues in force after 30 June 2008.  From 30 June 2008, all provisional <Col N="1246"/>licence holders or learner permit holders must be accompanied by a driver who has held a full licence for at least two years.  A person whose provisional licence has now lapsed but who held a provisional licence at any time in the five-year period prior to 30 October 2007 can renew his or her licence by obtaining a learner permit before the five-year limit expires.</P>
        <P>From 1 December 2007, a learner motorcyclist must wear a learner &ldquo;L&rdquo; plate on a yellow fluorescent tabard.  All of these measures form the initial phase of the introduction in this country of a graduated licence.  Graduated licences have saved lives in those countries where they have been introduced.  It is right and proper that we also introduce a system of graduated licensing to afford maximum protection to all our road users, not least those who are learning to drive.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport now encourages all provisional licence holders who have not already prepared and applied for a driving test to do so.  He has recently had extensive consultations with the Road Safety Authority about its capacity to deliver tests.  Both the Minister and the authority have confirmed that all 122,000 applicants currently on the waiting list will be tested by early March 2008.  This will have eliminated the current backlog, as promised.  A further commitment is that, by the end of June 2008, all applicants for a driving test will be able to get a test within ten weeks.  These are very challenging targets but it is appropriate that they be set.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority is working to have all driving instructors registered by 31 December 2008.  This means instructors giving instruction after that date will have to have passed a three-stage examination covering knowledge, driving skills and ability to give tuition.  It will come as a surprise to many that this does not happen already.  Applications are being processed at present from driving instructors who wish to become approved.  The Road Safety Authority has a dedicated team of specially trained staff to undertake this work and has the capacity to deal with the volume of applications from driving instructors over the coming 14 months.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, the introduction of the new measures has placed our attitudes to driving and safety under the spotlight.  While it was proper, in response to public concerns, to defer the implementation of the accompaniment rule for second provisional licence holders, there is little doubt that a change in the law was needed.  It is very interesting that this point was made by media since the measures were introduced, particularly in the more insightful articles.  The strong public support for the measures following their announcement is indicative of a change in public attitudes to road safety matters.  We all accept that road safety cannot be taken for granted.</P>
        <P>The political criticism following the announcement of the new measures was very disappointing considering that a concerted and determined effort to resolve the problem of having over <Col N="1247"/>400,000 provisional licence-learner permit holders on our roads was long overdue.  It has long been a matter of political comment and there is little doubt that when the political controversy has passed the introduction of the graduated driver licensing regime will have a very positive impact on road deaths, as more learner drivers become more competent on our roads.</P>
        <P>Many of us in public life who have had family members, friends or colleagues killed or injured on the roads look forward to a day when we have the best safety record possible.  Ultimately, we need the co-operation of everyone, including motorists and pedestrians, young and old, to take responsibility for their actions.  It is clear that the solution lies in the hands of everybody who drives.  The Government and public agencies are prepared to assist but it is ultimately a matter for ourselves to take charge and exercise our responsibilities.   The Government is confident that over the coming months and years, as the measures in the road safety strategy are rolled out, we will all benefit from the tangible improvements in safety on our roads.  I look forward to hearing the Senators&rsquo; comments and hope they are constructive because this is a matter that goes way beyond partisan politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, to the House.  It is regrettable the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, could not be here to put across these points, given the undoubted importance of road safety.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State highlighted the work that still remains to be done in respect of this important issue.  He encouraged us to make our best effort not to be partisan and shrill in what we say but, none the less, the gravity of this issue is such that we all have responsibility to acknowledge what is not going well and where there are clear shortcomings, just as we acknowledge what is going well.  The Minister of State said:</P>
        <P LI="1">A further commitment is that, by the end of June 2008, all applicants for a driving test will be able to get a test within ten weeks ....  The Road Safety Authority is working to have all driving instructors registered by 31 December 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This means there will be immense pressure on the Road Safety Authority and its associated bodies to meet the deadline in June 2008.  The vast majority of testers will not be registered by the authority by the deadline, nor will they have done the test or completed the training programme created for them by the Government and the authority.  I read an article recently that stated only two driving instructors in the country are registered and have completed the programme to improve driving standards on our roads and increase driver safety.  This illustrates clearly the failure of our system.  I can understand why <Col N="1248"/>responsibility will be placed on the driver to do a test but the people administering that test will not have sat and passed the examination they are expected to do in order to teach drivers to drive more safely.</P>
        <P>On the deferral of the new requirement for second provisional licence holders to be accompanied by a qualified driver until 30 June 2008, the Minister of State stated,  &ldquo;This move was made in response to two clear messages from the public.  In the first place, there is strong support for the proposed reforms to improve road safety&rdquo;.  There was such a strong reaction to the Minister&rsquo;s announcement some weeks ago because the public and the Government, when it was pointed out to it, realised the scheme would not work and that it would criminalise people who were waiting for a test but who could not get one.  It would have meant that drivers&rsquo; ability to drive around their communities would be removed.</P>
        <P>A common failing of the Government is that it attempts to draw attention to the resources being made available and the money being spent.  This in spite of the fact that when we try we are unable to discover a clear, integrated strategy to ensure money is well spent and that the recipients, be they patients, students or those awaiting driving tests, are getting the service they need.  I will not accept an argument that places responsibility in this regard on the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority or any other such body; it is a question of political responsibility because of the seriousness of the matter.  This responsibility is not being met at present.</P>
        <P>On the statistics quoted on improvements in road safety, while I will be clear in acknowledging the shortcomings that exist, I will also acknowledge the progress that is taking place.  My awareness of the developments in this area has never been higher.  I, as a very new Member, am privileged to be able to walk from my home to the Oireachtas, and travelling to my workplace prior to becoming a Member involved only a very short journey by car.  While standing for election to the Seanad, my awareness of my political mortality was never higher.  Likewise, my awareness of my physical mortality was never higher because I suddenly found myself travelling frequently throughout the country.  Fortunate as I was to be supported by friends who accompanied me, I found myself on numerous occasions on the road at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. or even 1 a.m. trying to get home, feeling exhausted, and wondering whether I was going to make it.  It brought home to me how frequent this experience is for so many people and how it is a way of life for them.  That comes across in the statistics on road safety and fatalities.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the clear progress that has been made on this issue by the Road Safety Authority and the Government.  There has been a decline in the number of fatalities.  In the early 1990s the number stood at around 40 to 50 per month.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that today, <Col N="1249"/>the figure stands at around 30 per month.  This was also mentioned in the recent statement by the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>Alongside this, a number of other points must be made.  The first is that the rate of decline we are experiencing in Ireland is now one of the lowest across the EU.  According to the European road safety committee, the rate of decline we have had in the number of fatalities on our roads is around 10% since 2000.  The figure in France and Portugal is 42% and in Luxembourg it is<?oasys _jy ?>48%.  While the improvements are to be welcomed, they are a fraction of what other countries are achieving.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Worryingly, the performance in recent months in terms of the number of accidents taking place has begun to buck the trend of decrease and begun to increase.  Tragically, in August and September of this year, the number of fatalities increased by 35%, compared to August and September of last year.  The number of individual tragedies to which we are referring does not bear thinking about.  We should not let this debate go by without pausing to offer our condolences to the families involved.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority report refers to the number of people involved in these fatalities but this only illustrates how far we must go.  The report said that one in three deaths are still caused by excessive speed, alcohol and not wearing a seatbelt or any other form of restraint within the car, while one in five deaths are caused by fatigue.  The fact that road users continue to behave in this way, despite the money that has been spent and increased awareness, shows how we are failing and how far we must go.</P>
        <P>I have carefully read through the new strategy on road safety produced by the Road Safety Authority.  While I acknowledge the quality of thought and intent in it, there are failures.  Elected representatives too frequently avoid commenting on and criticising the work of august bodies like the authority but it is important to point out that the strategy lacked an acknowledgement of, or detail about, what is not working.  This was illustrated by a section in it that detailed &ldquo;the current critical success factors&rdquo; in Ireland, where nine different points were outlined.  However, nowhere in the report did it describe the factors that are leading to the fatalities we wish to stop, acknowledge the shortcomings we have compared to other EU countries or point out failures at Government and policy level in dealing with this issue.  This contrasts with the tone and clarity of the report issued yesterday by the Health Information and Quality Authority on hospital hygiene and HIQA&rsquo;s courage in pointing out what is not working.  We must discuss why a section in the strategy pointed out success factors but did not point out what is not working.</P>

	<P>This must be tackled in coming years.  </P>
        <P>In respect of driving tests, it was already acknowledged earlier in the House that SGS Ireland, the company named by the Taoiseach as being crucial in delivering the tests we need to meet the target set for June 2008, has extremely uneven success rates across the country.  It has an average success rate of 62% compared with the Road Safety Authority testers&rsquo; success rate of 52%.  This goes back to a point I made earlier.  We have set a new target of June 2008 but do not have the infrastructure in place to ensure it will be met.  Critical voices are now being raised about one of the bodies being called on to make that happen and questions are being asked as to why its success rate is so high compared to that of the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport has issued a statement that by the end of June 2008 all applicants for a driving test will be able to get a test on demand, that is, within ten weeks.  Not only will Members from this side of the House hold the Government accountable in respect of making this happen, the people using our roads, the families suffering as a result of road fatalities and the drivers waiting for tests will be even more demanding in this regard.</P>

	<P>We all welcome the opportunity today to have a debate on road safety.  As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport during the last D&aacute;il, I had the privilege of working with a number of groups and organisations and making various contributions in respect of what could be done in this area.  Last year was probably the best year for road safety in a long time, with a serious reduction in the <Col N="1251"/>number of deaths.  However, much more can be done.    </P>
        <P>One does not need to single out any particular group in this regard.  Across the board, every citizen who uses our roads, be they motorists, pedestrians or cyclists, has an obligation with regard to road safety.  On many occasions these obligations are disregarded by some people.  The chances they take and their actions can lead to the deaths of others or total disablement.  We have all seen cases where negligence has been a major contributor in many accidents.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We must not look solely at drivers, although perhaps I should first deal with them.  Across the board we accept that the behaviour of certain drivers leaves much to be desired, such as the driver who turns out from a side road without looking or one who drives at 150 mph on a motorway, twice the legal limit.  On a motorway one has a better chance of avoiding trouble than on a country road because of the quality of the road.  The Minister of State referred to this in his contribution.  It is safer to drive at 100 mph on a motorway than 40 mph on second class or third class roads in rural Ireland, which are deathtraps at current speed limits.  On some of these roads the limit is 80 km/h when 50 km/h would be more appropriate.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have the power to impose speed limits on county, rural and regional roads.  There is an obligation on them to fulfil this commitment by deciding what roads should have reduced speed limits.  Local authorities should do a survey of every road under local authority management in order to decide the speed limits for those roads.  Regional roads, with a speed limit of 80 km/h, are on a par with national secondary roads but would be quite safe with a limit of 100 km/h.  There is an obligation on local authorities to address this.</P>
        <P>We must consider various types of drivers in this debate.  There is a backlog of learner drivers who hold provisional licences, with which we must deal.  This will be a major problem, particularly for those in rural Ireland.  Many of them are capable of getting to and from their nearest town without accidents or mistakes.  Those in their 50s or 60s would be shellshocked if they had to sit a theory test even though they have been driving free of accidents for up to 30 years.  We must provide support to these people, such as proper tuition by driving instructors or some other system to ease the difficulties older people have in passing the test.  Some have learning difficulties, which must be accepted and for which provision must be made.</P>
        <P>There is a group of people with a high accident rate, those in the first two years of holding a full licence.  We are not running down this group.  There are, however, people who feel they could participate in the world rally championship in Sligo this weekend as soon as they walk out of the test centre with a licence.  We need a learner <Col N="1252"/>permit and a post test permit to keep such people under control.  It has been suggested that those who have passed the test less than two years prior to committing an offence such as speeding or dangerous or careless driving would receive higher penalties.  This would be a means of deterring young people who pass the test from abusing the licence.  The drivers licence is a right to use the road, not the right to abuse it or others on the road.</P>
        <P>Another prevalent category is non-national drivers.  I am not critical of people who work here and make a tremendous contribution to our country.  Some of their driving, however, is questionable, to put it mildly.  The sad part is that statistics show that the incidence of serious accidents is far higher for non-nationals than for those who hold Irish licences.  This must be pursued.  This category of people also bring cars into Ireland that do not conform to standards of the NCT.  In conjunction with the Department of Transport the Road Safety Authority should insist that a vehicle in this State for more than one month must be put through the NCT.  This must be considered for road safety and for the general safety of those who use our roads.  I ask the Minister of State to relay to the Minister for Transport and to the Road Safety Authority that this must be tackled quickly.  Along with scrappage incentives the NCT did a tremendous job in removing bangers from the road and we should consider another scrappage scheme for older and less efficient cars that are responsible for CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions to be removed before the end of life of the vehicle.</P>
        <P>Ireland has had tremendous success with regard to reducing road deaths.  Some 120,000 extra vehicles, either new or imported, go on the roads every year.  This means an extra 120,000 drivers on our roads.  Despite this we have managed to reduce the accident and serious injury rate.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be complimented on its diligence in dealing with road safety.  The cameras may be a good idea but Garda presence is a better incentive.  A camera will have been installed for no more than one day before one can go on the Internet and find out its location.  There is one camera on the N4, at the Lucan Spa Hotel, and those caught speeding by it should be asked where they have been for the past ten years.  Very few people are caught on that stretch of road because they know where the camera is located.  There must be another mechanism, such as Garda presence or unmarked cars, because fixed point cameras are as relevant as an ashtray on a motorbike.  They will serve no purpose if one can find out their locations on the Internet.  In the UK, satellites can tell where every camera is located and the same will apply here.</P>
        <P>Garda presence would be more effective because bad driving is as serious a problem as speeding and the culprits are not always learner or incompetent drivers.  In many cases the bad driving is done by those who believe they are so competent they can push everyone else to the <Col N="1253"/>side of the road.  The only way to deal with this is with unmarked Garda cars.  Garda&iacute; using unmarked cars will not take long to take people in and award them penalty points.  When people pass four penalty points on their licences, they begin to think.</P>
        <P>The final group to which I wish to refer is pedestrians.  It is terrible that pedestrians using the roads in the winter do not wear any form of reflective gear.  I appeal to these people to wear reflective jackets or armbands when they are walking on the roads at night.  Senator Donohoe indicated the number of miles he drives on average each year.  If he lived in a rural area, he might drive between 40,000 and 50,000 miles per year.  People who live in rural areas definitely see a different aspect of this matter than their counterparts in urban areas.</P>
        <P>I would have liked to discuss permits and the issue of road safety in general.  What is emerging from this debate is that the situation is clearly improving.  It is also emerging that we must begin to educate people about this matter while they are at school, put in place a permit system and teach individuals that when they go on the road they must respect, not abuse, the rules that apply.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his contribution, particularly as it related to the strategy.  There is no doubt in people&rsquo;s minds that there are three principal elements that lead to road deaths.  If action is taken in respect of speed, alcohol and seat belts, the number of deaths will be greatly reduced.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has responsibility for European Affairs.  I recently met Commissioner Verheugen, who is responsible for European integration.  I offered to make a deal with him, the terms of which were that people in Britain and Ireland would switch to using two-pin plugs if the rest of Europe would agree to drive on the left-hand side of the road.  This gave rise to a discussion and someone accompanying the Commissioner stated that they were in Sweden in 1968 when the switch from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right was made.  The change was made at 5 a.m. on a particular day and a speed limit of 30 km/h was introduced for the following month.  Not one death occurred during the month in question because the speed limit was enforced and people focused on respecting it.  Perhaps we should switch from the left to the right and <i>vice versa</i> each month and thereby reduce the number of road deaths dramatically.</P>
        <P>If we want to spot a trend in the level of road deaths, we must step back from concentrating on monthly figures and examine them over a much <Col N="1254"/>longer period.  Even when things are getting better, there will still be a month when the figures are horrific.  This can easily lead us to the false conclusion that things are getting worse rather than better.  The Minister of State provided us with some interesting figures.  In my opinion, we should examine a full year&rsquo;s figures before drawing any conclusions about trends.  I am a believer in what is called the moving annual total.  Under this, one examines the figures for the most recent 12 months.  Each month one adds the latest month&rsquo;s figure and deducts the corresponding figure for the previous year.  This produces an annual figure that is updated each month.  As a result, it is always up to date.</P>
        <P>If we consider the current situation from this perspective, the news is, as the Minister of State indicated, fairly good.  In the 12 months to the end of October, there were just 330 deaths on our roads.  Awful as that figure is, it is a definite and a worthwhile improvement on the figures for recent years.  If the remaining two months of this year just kept pace with the level of last year &mdash; in other words, if there were no further improvement between now and the end of the year &mdash; our total for 2007 would be the lowest for almost 50 years.  We would, therefore, have returned to levels not seen in this country since the end of the 1950s when Ireland was a very different place.  Clearly, we are doing something right.  It is vital that we recognise what this is and that we build on it in order that we do not let the advantage slip away.</P>
        <P>The change in the past 12 months has been a simple one.  The introduction of random breath testing has brought about a change in behaviour because people are beginning to realise they have a much greater chance of being caught if they drink and drive.  The same pattern emerged in 2003 with the introduction of penalty points.  For a brief few months, people believed there was a large likelihood of being caught and they changed their behaviour accordingly.  They changed back again, just as smartly, when they realised that, even despite penalty points, they still had a large chance of getting away with it because the drink driving laws were not being effectively or rigorously enforced.  Random breath testing has made a far greater impression on members of the public and, to date, they remain convinced that the game has shifted against them. That is why it is crucial that the standard of enforcement should be fully maintained and even improved on because if people again start to feel they can get away with it, they will adjust their behaviour accordingly.</P>
        <P>The new road safety strategy is crammed full of ideas to improve road safety.  There is, paradoxically, a danger in this because it might lead to our efforts being diffused over too many areas, particularly when it is clear that only two actions really count, namely, the extent to which we enforce the law and the extent to which we educate people to respect it.  Without effective action in respect of these two elements, all the rest will <Col N="1255"/>be a waste of time.  For example, a great deal of useless effort is expended on the issue of the number of unqualified learner drivers on our roads.  We discuss these people as if we were talking about staffing our hospitals with doctors straight off the dole queue.  The fact is that the overwhelming majority of these individuals are perfectly good drivers.  They will not become any better when they possess a piece of paper which states they passed the official test.  All the huffing and puffing about this issue will not result in our roads being made measurably safer.</P>
        <P>The issue relating to unqualified drivers is a red herring.  The last thing we want at this stage are red herrings of any kind.  Road safety is, at the core, a very simple matter.  We do our case no good at all by complicating it unnecessarily.  We must educate people to use the roads more responsibly.  In the meantime, we must ensure they respect the law by convincing them they will incur dire consequences if they flout it.</P>
        <P>I would like a public attitude that refuses to accept road deaths, even at the levels envisaged in the road safety strategy, to develop.  At present, we have an average of just over 28 road deaths every month.  If we reduced the figure to 20 per month, we would be among the best in Europe.  However, when we reach that level &mdash; I hope we do so long before the expiry date of the new road strategy &mdash; we must not stop.  A total of 240 deaths per year from road accidents is far too high to be ever acceptable.  We must persevere until the number of deaths is reduced to an absolute minimum.  The latter should be measured in dozens per year rather than in hundreds.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, by whom we have just been joined.</P>
        <P>I welcome the new road safety strategy.  However, we must change people&rsquo;s mindsets.  Some years ago in France, the then Prime Minister, Mr. Sarkozy, stated that he would make a difference by reducing the number of road deaths.  He focused the attention of the country on this matter and this led to a dramatic reduction.  His achievement was to establish a change of attitude or mindset among the people of France.  We must also change people&rsquo;s mindsets and I am of the view that we have an opportunity of being successful in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis referred to speed cameras.  I am a great believer in technology and speed cameras.  A thoroughly modern system involves the use of hundreds or thousands of speed cameras.  Everyone would know the location of these cameras.  Under this type of system, one&rsquo;s licence plate is identified once and then again approximately 5 km or 10 km further on.  People on the ground are not needed to operate these cameras.  One can be informed that one left Balbriggan at a certain time and reached Swords at a time which meant <Col N="1256"/>that one must have broken the speed limit on the way.  It would, therefore, be no use to people to slow down on reaching camera sites and then speed up in between them.  I understand that approximately 1,800 speed cameras are needed throughout the country.  If we put them in place, it will encourage people to change their behaviour.  That is the answer.</P>
        <P>The two matters on which we must focus are education and enforcement.  If we take action in respect of them, we will overcome this challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing time and I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>It is clear that a large preponderance of accidents involve many young people with alcohol taken driving on country roads in the early hours of the morning at weekends.  If one applies a grid test, one will discover that it covers a significant number of these five or six elements.  We must, therefore, examine these elements and address them.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that travelling at speed is, of itself, dangerous.  One need only consider Germany, where there are either no real speed limits or very high speed limits on the autobahns.  It has not lead to any greater danger.  It is a question of bad driving and bad manners on the part of road users and bad management of the roads on the part of us.</P>
        <P>I am all in favour of equality.  I note that women, who used to be much better and more courteous drivers than men, have achieved equality and are now just as ignorant and subject to road rage.  I do not state this is specifically directed at male drivers.  It now covers everybody.</P>
        <P>Some people are prepared to cause a possibly fatal road accident rather than allow somebody legitimately to change lanes.  I come across this frequently.  If one attempts to pass somebody out on a motorway or a suburban street, the reaction from a man or a woman is to put the foot down and do his or her damnedest to prevent one from doing so.  This may well place one in a situation where one must try to reduce speed and get back in behind this driver or face the possibility of going straight into oncoming traffic.  It is a question of manners.  We also seem to have a great deal of road rage, particularly in the city of Dublin.</P>
        <P>Travel at speed is not of itself a danger.  What is dangerous is having completely inconsistent and chaotic speed limits and the ordinary driver has no incentive to respect them.  I have stated this on numerous occasions during previous debates.  It was eventually taken up by the previous Minister who quoted me.  We can all give examples of this.  The example I usually give is going from the excellent three lane highway in Tallaght where the limit is 60 km/h to a winding country road where the speed limit increases to 100 km/h.  It is insane.  Why would anybody respect this?  I cer<Col N="1257"/>tainly do not.  One will probably find a camera or a couple of garda&iacute; there to catch one out.</P>
        <P>Legislation should be introduced to take the setting of speed limits out of the hands of local authorities and place it at national level.  The answer I am always given is that these are different jurisdictions.  If we are serious let us have consistency.  It is the same with road humps.  Who designs these things?  One would not notice some of them and if one goes over others at 10 mph one is likely to break one&rsquo;s axle.  I crossed one on the North Quays at 15 mph and I am lucky to have a car left.  Will the Minister of State and his officials make note of this and see whether we can introduce uniformity?  Where the speed limit is 30 km/h it should be a requirement of those putting in road humps that motorists can travel across them at that speed.  Otherwise it is dangerous and motorists do not respect them.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is aware of a number of tragic cases such as that of a young woman on her way to Shannon Airport to take a plane to the United States who was killed because of the negligence of the local authority, which used a completely inappropriate road surface treatment and did not place any warnings.  The same situation was involved in the school bus tragedy in Trim.  Local authorities do not live up to their responsibilities.</P>
        <P>Often, I walk down O&rsquo;Connell Street as I am afraid to cycle because I have been knocked off my bicycle.  We should also consider how motorcycle couriers dangerously weave in and out of the traffic on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  On occasions, when walking home with my partner, he pointed out the paving system on O&rsquo;Connell Street which is extremely dangerous.  He stated repeatedly to me that an accident would occur and somebody would be killed.  To create a piazza effect the distinction between the pavement and the road has been blurred.  A couple of days ago a lorry mounted the pavement and a young man was seriously injured.</P>
        <P>Drivers have responsibility and this issue is not only about speed.  We have a syndrome involving young people, drink, the early hours of the morning, country roads, too many people in a car and old bangers.  As legislators we also have a responsibility as do those at local authority level.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the matters of consistency of speed limits so they will be respected and observed and I urge him to create uniformity and safety in road humps which in some cases are no use and in others are virtually a death-trap.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I echo the points made on road safety by other speakers.  The statistics for 2006 give us real cause to be concerned.  A total of 366 people were killed on Irish roads and, unfortunately, in the first ten months of this year 279 people were killed in road-related accidents.</P><Col N="1258"/>
        <P>Other statistics are equally depressing.  More than 166,000 people were caught speeding on the road so far this year.  Of those killed on the roads, four out of ten were between 17 and 25 years of age.  More than 15,000 drunk drivers were caught on Irish roads in the first ten months of the year and this is despite increased awareness and programmes on the dangers of drink-driving.  A total of 26,347 motorists were caught using their mobile phones while driving and 4,173 seat-belt detections were recorded.</P>
        <P>This shows the dreadful number of road related fatalities in this country are not inevitable.  They have clear causes to do with alcohol consumption, speeding, lack of training and carelessness.  There may also be a sense that road safety requirements are not properly enforced.  We have a lackadaisical culture in Ireland which we need to change and introduce more of a zero-tolerance approach to these practices.  Unless we do so, the statistics will remain high.  We know, as we approach the Christmas holidays and bank holidays, that at the end of those periods we will have an unacceptably high level of road deaths.  Yet, we do not seem to be able to seriously reduce those statistics.</P>
        <P>The OECD produced a report in 2006 which examined the behaviour of young drivers in 30 countries.  It was interesting to note Ireland is not on its own in terms of some of the trends evident on the roads.  In crash and traffic fatality statistics, 16 to 24 year olds were greatly over-represented and crashes were the biggest killer of 15 to 24 year olds in all countries studied.  Mortality rates for young men were consistently higher than those for young women.  This suggests we must particularly focus at younger men those road safety programmes aimed at younger people as it seems they have a greater tendency to speed.</P>
        <P>The study also found the younger people are when they start driving on their own and without restrictions the more likely they are to have fatal accidents, particularly prior to turning 18.  Age is a key factor.  The report found that people receiving more training prior to starting to drive, particularly with a focus on safety issues such as speed, alcohol, seat belts and drugs, results in fewer fatalities.  One of the most effective counter-measures suggested by the report was the introduction of a requirement for more accompanied practice before a person obtained his or her driving licence.</P>
        <P>The question of driver testing standards will be a critical issue now that we have introduced a requirement for all second provisional licence holders either to be accompanied or to have a full drivers licence by next June.  We know of the concern when these measures were introduced and in view of this a time extension was granted to allow people to regularise their situations.  It will mean that the 122,000 drivers on second provisional licences will try to complete their driving tests and obtain their full licences by next June, which will put considerable pressure on the testing facilities.  Some of the tests are already being <Col N="1259"/>carried out by private companies over which concerns have been expressed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General investigated driver testing and his report in June found significant regional variations.  For example Buncrana had a very high level of passes with 65% whereas the figure for Carlow was as low as 42%.  We need to understand the reasons for such significant variation in the result.  Given the volumes of tests to be carried out by next June concerns have been expressed that standards should not suffer.  There should be rigorous assessment and monitoring of the standards applied to ensure consistency across the country and that people are ending up with the kinds of skills they need and not being passed because of pressure of numbers.</P>
        <P>The Green Party approves of all the new road safety measures the Government has recently announced.  In addition to these measures we would like to see more full-time road safety officers, especially in secondary schools to provide training in road safety to young people.  We would also encourage the inclusion of driving lessons as part of the school curriculum, particularly for transition year students.  If many young men received in-depth road safety training at that stage before they began driving, it would result in better driving once they got on the road.</P>
        <P>We also support the requirement for young drivers to be accompanied when driving, which the Minister intends enforcing from next June.  We would like to see more enforcement of the wearing of seat belts.  The statistics I mentioned earlier suggest that not everybody is wearing them.  Providing greater resources for the traffic corps would result in people being more careful about meeting the requirement to wear seat belts when driving.  We need more consistent standards in testing throughout the country.  We need compulsory testing for motorcyclists who are often involved in unfortunate road accidents.  With proper training many of these accidents could be avoided.</P>
        <P>The Green Party strongly favours lower alcohol limits for drivers.  We fully support reducing the permitted levels from 80 mg per 100 ml to 50 mg per 100 ml.  I would favour the requirement for drivers to be alcohol free.  Even having one or two drinks alters a driver&rsquo;s reaction times.  Given that we want to improve significantly the culture of road safety, that would send out a very clear message to people.  We need to encourage people not to combine drinking and driving.  While that might sound somewhat severe to some people, unfortunately it is very hard to agree a limit at which it is safe for people to drink and drive.  Young people with one or two drinks taken can often find it difficult to stop at a certain stage.  In general we would be better not to mix drinking and driving at all.</P>
        <P>The Green Party would support roadside drug testing.  We are aware that there are many people who while they may not have drink on them when <Col N="1260"/>driving might be under the influence of other substances.  As part of the testing carried out by the traffic corps, we should also consider roadside drug testing.  It is a particularly green issue that we also take the road safety requirements of pedestrians and cyclists into consideration.  To that end as part of the road safety initiative the Green Party in Government will press for safe routes to school to become a feature of every town and village.  The safety of our schoolchildren making their way to and from school is paramount.  Local authorities need to take a lead role in ensuring these safe routes to school are effective and properly implemented.</P>
        <P>The Green Party would like to ensure an effective high-quality system of cycle lanes throughout the country and especially in urban areas so that cyclists do not take their lives into their hands when they decide to become greener and more environmentally responsible by cycling.  Unfortunately at the moment, given the levels of traffic on our roads and particularly in urban areas, many cyclists are taking a significant risk when they decide to cycle rather than drive.  We should work with local authorities which should be encouraged to ensure a consistent and acceptable set of cycleways in cities, towns and villages.  The unfortunate practice of cars parking in cycle lanes and therefore obstructing them needs to be properly policed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The Labour Party has already welcomed the publication of the new Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 and I as the party spokesperson on transport in this House want to emphasise that support further.  However, we believe it needs to be backed up with strong enforcement measures if it is to be effective and successful.  Critically, that enforcement must be highly visible to the wider community.</P>
        <P>I commend Mr. Gay Byrne, the chairman, and Mr. Noel Brett, the chief executive and all the team at the Road Safety Authority on preparing a new road safety strategy.  It is a much better and more focused strategy document than its predecessor, Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006, with a greater focus on results than on operational activities which was a feature of the previous one.  There are 126 valuable proposals in this report, including a new target for cutting road deaths to no greater than 60 fatalities per million by the end of 2012 and to reduce serious injuries by<?oasys _jy ?>25%.  This is to be welcomed and, if attained, will be a wonderful achievement.  The stated primary aim of the strategy is to save lives and prevent serious injuries by reducing the number and severity of collisions.  While I welcome this aim, I <Col N="1261"/>note that the target for serious injuries in the 2004-06 strategy was abandoned and there are still major issues to be resolved involving the collection of road traffic injuries data.</P>
        <P>The report indicates that the first phase of the new graduated driver licensing scheme will begin when learner permits will replace the existing provisional licence system.  To drive unaccompanied on a learner permit will now be an offence, as will driving without L plates.  Nobody could disagree with changing a policy which requires learner drivers to be accompanied by a qualified driver until they complete a test but, having failed a driving test, there being no such requirement.  However most people disagree with the shambolic way the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, attempted to introduce the change.  However, enough has been said on that and the U-turn or three-point turn has been completed.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing the Minister has again refused to make a decision on whether to reduce the blood alcohol limit to 50 mg.  Instead of stating clearly whether they wish to maintain the present 80 mg of alcohol limit, the Minister and the Taoiseach have again kicked this issue into touch.  Another consultative process is under way with legislation, if necessary, only to be brought forward in the second quarter of 2009.</P>
        <P>The central question regarding the new strategy is how effective the enforcement measures will be.  The document states that the target level of 1,200 Garda traffic corps personnel will not be reached until the end of 2008 at the earliest.  It is pointless to roll out a series of new measures if they are not backed by the relevant Garda and judicial resources and I call on the Government to accelerate the process immediately.  Just last month Garda figures indicated that as many as 50% of motorists fail to pay fines accrued for driving offences.  What message does this send out?</P>
        <P>Road safety must be one of the Government&rsquo;s highest priorities.  However, the last road safety strategy ran from 2004 to 2006 and we have had nearly a whole year with no safety strategy in place.  The 2004-06 road safety strategy contained a number of measures and targets that were never implemented, including provisions on road death targets, reform of the provisional driving license system, mutual recognition of penalty points with Northern Ireland and measures to tackle people driving under the influence of illegal drugs.  Many of these measures are rightly included in the new strategy.  A question arises, however, regarding how the targets laid down for speeding in the new strategy will be measured.  The targets in this area refer to increased compliance, but how is this to be measured?  There are also concerns about possible cuts in expenditure for the RSA and other safety agencies in the forthcoming budget.  If the Minister is serious about the strategy, he must ensure this does not happen.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Broughan, suggested that the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on <Col N="1262"/>Transport should publicly invigilate progress on the road safety strategy on a half-yearly basis to ensure its full implementation rather than leave it to gather dust on a Minister&rsquo;s shelf.  In Gay Byrne&rsquo;s introduction to the strategy, he stated that the RSA will report on implementation of this policy and the progress made against its targets and gave his assurance that the agency will do all that is humanly possible to deliver the strategy in full.  I do not doubt Mr. Byrne&rsquo;s determination but success will be dependent on various agencies and I hope he is not let down by the Government.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Ryan for sharing his time with me.  I want to focus my contribution on the issue of safety outside schools and, in particular, parking provisions, quarrying and construction traffic, driving standards, inadequate signage, road conditions and walking buses.  I assure Senator de B&uacute;rca that the latter is not only of interest to the Green Party; it is also high on my party&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
        <P>Many parents across Ireland have to drive their children to school on a daily basis.  One of the biggest problems they face is finding somewhere to park.  According to a survey I conducted last year of schools in my area, the lack of parking spaces present major problems.  At Donore national school, for example, parents have to walk 150 metres with young children because there are no spaces directly beside the school.  A new phenomenon has resulted whereby irresponsible parents pull up outside schools and let their children jump out of the cars to cross in front of traffic.  They do this because they know garda&iacute; are not enforcing the law when it comes to road safety outside schools.  In addition, many schools were built 50 or 100 years ago, when car ownership was much lower and people used to walk to school, so there was no demand for parking spaces.  Many of us walked to school but the new reality is that people drive to school and they need parking spaces.  It is not fair to expect school boards of management to purchase land for parking from the local land owner because the issue is a national one.  I would like the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to co-operate in developing a strategy for retrofitting parking spaces outside schools.</P>
        <P>In many rural locations, such as Bellewstown in my area, the quarry and construction traffic which trundles past schools on a daily basis, often at high speeds, causes concern among parents.  When planning permission is granted for quarries and new estates, the routes used for traffic access should be clearly stated in the conditions.</P>
        <P>Since the advent of private testing, we have seen a difference in passing rates.  The most recent report in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> indicates that of the 40,000 tests carried out this year, the pass rate for private test centres was 62% compared to 52% among Road Safety Authority <Col N="1263"/>centres.  It is important that standards are applied and rates do not vary.  I would like the Minister for Transport to investigate why differences exist in pass rates.</P>
        <P>One of the biggest problems outside rural schools is road signs which are overgrown or have fallen down because they were not properly maintained.  Many are located on secondary roads.  Last week, the Department of Transport announced its intention to reduce expenditure on secondary roads by 13%.  That has a potential impact on road safety because of the condition of road surfaces and signage.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the funding for secondary roads.</P>
        <P>Walking buses, whereby parents walk their children to school, reduces the amount of car traffic on the roads.  A walking bus was established in Laytown, County Meath.  They cost little to establish beyond the purchase of high visibility jackets but, rather than having them rely on donations, the Government should introduce a nationwide funding programme as a way of getting children out of cars and encouraging safety awareness.  More can be done and it is important the Government prioritises this aspect of road safety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed at having to speak about road safety.  County Donegal has had more than its fair share of young lives lost.  It is cold comfort to bereaved families for me to say that we do not want people under the age of 25, who have not yet had a chance to start their lives, to be cut down so prematurely.  I welcome, therefore, the concept of the strategy and hope it achieves the intended results.  Whether we are driving, walking or cycling, we all have a role to play in protecting ourselves, our passengers and fellow road users.  The road is a shared space.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The road safety strategy was developed with input from partners such as road engineers and garda&iacute;.  One of my problems with that arises from the recent decision to reduce the speed limit on county roads from 60 to 50 mph on the basis that local authorities could revert to the 60 mph limit.  Having served on a county council, I am aware that the last thing public representatives in County Donegal or elsewhere would want is responsibility for increasing a 50 mph speed limit to 60 mph.  It would not be relevant that an accident was caused by someone driving at 162 mph because the public representative would be blamed for increasing the speed limit.  It would have been more sensible to maintain the speed limits at 60 mph while allowing local authorities to decrease them on dangerous roads.  I asked three different Ministers to reverse their policies in this regard but was told each time that the policy was devised in partnership with road engineers, garda&iacute; and safety experts.</P>
        <P>Road safety has to begin with setting realistic speed limits which are enforced.  In many places, <Col N="1264"/>so-called good national secondary roads are not good.  In Donegal many of the county roads are better than the national secondary roads and yet one is expected to drive at 80 km/h.  Inishowen has experienced many road deaths and some people would criticise me for asking that the speed limit be more than 80 km/h.  However, people see the quality of the roads and yet they are being asked to drive at 80 km/h all over the Inishowen peninsula bar a little bit of it.  If the road is safe, the speed limit should be appropriate to it.  I do not believe an accident occurs because someone is driving five or ten km/h over the speed limit.  In many cases, people are driving at almost double the speed limit.  There is no doubt there is a number of different reasons for accidents.</P>
        <P>In<i> The Irish Times</i> last week, Killian Doyle wrote an article entitled, &ldquo;From the Human Race to Boy Racer&rdquo;.  He had a cut at Donegal and the phenomenon of the boy racer.  He wrote: &ldquo;Donegal&rsquo;s roads have more doughnut marks on them than Homer Simpson&rsquo;s desk, and these mental midgets go by the well-known moniker of &rdquo;boy racers&ldquo;.&rdquo;  We have a problem with people who seem to like the sound of their exhausts.  I believe legislation is on the way from Europe which will tighten that up but we must implement it.</P>
        <P>When I spoke to the Department about noisy exhausts, I was told it was a matter for the garda&iacute; but when I spoke to them, they said they could not implement the rule because they could not measure the decibels.  The legislation requires that one must bring the car one believes is not using the appropriate exhaust to the nearest NCT centre.  Many people in Inishowen live more than 50 miles away from the local NCT centre but the difficulty is that the legislation states these cars can only be moved eight miles.  Someone is ignoring a basic flaw in terms of what we expect the garda&iacute; to do and what they are empowered to do.  That needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>In that article, Killian Doyle attacked the garda&iacute; on the fact they are to clamp down on boy racers.  It is fair to ask what were they doing up to now if they are only to clamp down on them now.  Was there a<i> laissez-faire </i>attitude to them?  I do not believe there was but the speed limits should be imposed.  The traffic corps, which we got because I and others fought the case for it, should focus on the people who cause the greatest difficulty.  It should not be a case of shooting fish in a barrel whereby people driving at 35 km/h in a 30 km/h zone are more likely to be caught than those driving at 120 km/h in a 60 km/h zone.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; and the schools have done a lot of work and have brought some of those identified as being at risk of becoming dangers to themselves on the roads on a number of excursions.  They took the young students to pounds where cars and other vehicles involved in accidents were taken, to the courts where they saw how people were dealt with after car accidents and to hospitals where they saw what people looked like <Col N="1265"/>after being involved in such accidents.  There has been some very good interaction in which the garda&iacute; have been involved.  I would like the reduction in the number of accidents continue, although one is always terrified to acknowledge recent improvements because once one does, someone one knows is involved in an accident.</P>
        <P>The noisy exhaust issue must be addressed.  Many of these young people are terrorising towns.  A couple of years ago, there were photographs in the newspapers of garda&iacute; being chased around towns in my area by boy racers.  That must stop.  There must be some reason these young people enjoy this.  How come they are back on the street even though their cars have been impounded and their licences revoked?  I would like someone to give me the statistics on people before the courts.  In the towns and villages of Donegal, which I do not believe are that different from anywhere else, practically everybody could give one a list of the registration numbers of cars which are causing problems.  The Government should deal with this issue as a matter of priority.  If these people are back on the road the next day with a new car, there is something wrong with the system.  We must investigate what is wrong with a system which enables that to happen.</P>
        <P>Targeting speed checks is important.  The view of the garda&iacute; is that if one breaks the law, that is the end of the matter.  However, if someone is caught driving slightly above the speed limit and he or she is passed by someone exceeding it to a staggering degree who is getting away with it, it is very hard to bring people on board in terms of the new strategies.</P>
        <P>Traffic islands are very important in the context of road safety.  They are mostly unlit and if they are lit, they will be unlit the next time one goes past.  A simple solution is to put cat&rsquo;s eyes or a reflective band around the base of the traffic island so it does not matter whether the light is working.  The idea of painting them yellow and black is fine during the day but it does not matter at night because the paint is not florescent.  The most dangerous thing one comes across driving at night is one of these unlit traffic islands.  This problem could be easily remedied.</P>
        <P>I walked into the House today and I nearly got run over by a cyclist even though there was a cycle lane.  The cyclist decided to cycle on the footpath instead.  Bicycles should be lit in this age of modern technology.  In the past, push bicycles had a light.  Perhaps this issue needs to be addressed at a European level.  There is no reason a bicycle should not be lit.  Going home one evening I counted 23 bicycles.  There was no light of any description on 13 of them and they could not be seen.  Ten bicycles had some form of lighting.</P>
        <P>I will not get the chance to consider the question of whether single car accidents are suicides or accidents.  The rural transport issue must be addressed.  People living in locations like mine must have cars because rural transport is not <Col N="1266"/>available.  There has been considerable investment in good roads.  However, better roads mean faster roads.  Roads must have the right speed limits which must be enforced.  Motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and passengers have a role to play in road safety.  If we work together, we can reduce the risk of having the history we have had in Donegal.  I extend my sympathy to the families who have experienced tragedy.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge the efforts of the Road Safety Authority and all State agencies trying their best to reduce the number of deaths as a result of traffic accidents.  We would all agree that one death is one too many.  We set a target in regard to the number of road traffic deaths but were any measurements done on serious road traffic injuries?  Many accidents do not result in deaths but in serious road traffic injuries.  Is there any measurement of the number of such injuries?  They result in debts for the families affected and the State in taking care of them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is fine to call for enforcement but one in four people who receive penalty points do not get them on their licences because they hold out-of-State licences.  If we are serious about enforcement, this is sending out completely the wrong message.  Something has to be done about this problem.  I understand that AA Ireland made proposals to the Department some months ago about the introduction of parallel licensing arrangements to cover those who hold out-of-State licences.  If the Department is serious about sending out the right message in respect of enforcement, it should adopt the AA Ireland proposals.  They would ensure that penalty points have an effect when they are issued.  They are not having the required effect at present.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about mandatory breath testing.  We all agree it is irresponsible in the extreme not to test for alcohol at the scene of an accident.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s U-turn on mandatory breath testing.  I understand he is working with the Office of the Attorney General to establish how the current legislation can be amended to provide for roadside testing, which Fine Gael has been advocating for many years.  We welcome the Minister&rsquo;s engagement at this juncture.  In light of the widespread use of what are termed &ldquo;recreational drugs&rdquo;, we believe the Minister should also consider drug testing.  It is imperative that we provide funds for research and development in this area in order that we can facilitate on-the-spot drug testing in the future.</P><Col N="1267"/>
        <P>I concur with Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s comments about road safety near schools.  Fine Gael believes that school transport services should be the subject of proper auditing systems and obligatory risk assessments.  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to take on board that point.  We need to reflect on how pedestrians, cyclists and people travelling in cars and buses arrive at and depart our schools.  Significant problems are associated with car parking in the vicinity of schools.  If proper risk assessments are to be conducted, possibly led by local authorities in conjunction with boards of management and the garda&iacute;, they need to be properly resourced.  As we all know, local authorities do not receive enough funding to fulfil their mandates as things stand.  They should receive more resources to work on school safety.</P>
        <P>I have spoken previously about the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s policy in respect of rest areas and service stations on our national roads.  When the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, instructed the authority to provide such facilities, it started to examine its policy in this regard as it pertains to new motorways and dual carriageways.  I propose that it should consider extending this programme to national roads, such as the N25 Rosslare-Cork route in the south east.  The drivers of heavy goods vehicles have no option other than to pull up on hard shoulders on the outskirts of towns and cities, thereby causing traffic hazards, if they are to meet their obligations under EU law to take rest periods.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to implement a proper policy on rest areas to serve our national roads means that drivers have to park on the hard shoulders of roads leading into towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Government should continue to invest in non-national roads in rural areas.  Some Senators have already commented on the number of accidents on such roads.  I am concerned about the message that is being sent out in the context of the current budgetary outlook.  It is proposed to decrease by 39% the level of funding given to local authorities for non-national roads.  Is it right that the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport have agreed on such a reduction?  We will debate this issue again during tomorrow&rsquo;s debate on the Local Government (Roads Functions) Bill 2007.  If we are genuinely interested in road safety, it is paradoxical to cut the funds being given to local authorities, which are doing the best they can with the limited funds available to them.</P>
        <P>We all know road accidents happen for many reasons.  Among the factors which contribute to such accidents are the human factors which have been discussed throughout this debate, such as driver inexperience, speed, drink driving, driver fatigue and irresponsibility.  We should also focus on issues like the poor standard of the roads, <Col N="1268"/>particularly in rural Ireland.  There are problems with road surfaces, alignments, junctions and signs.  Somebody spoke earlier about the alignment of cats&rsquo; eyes on the side of the road.  All of these issues need to be addressed, but that will not happen if funding is reduced.  I ask the Minister for Transport to deal with these difficulties.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House for this important debate on road safety, which was requested by Senators from all sides of the House.  I congratulate the Road Safety Authority on its new strategy.  It is obviously critical that we put in place a very broad strategy that commands the support of the wider public, including drivers of all ages.  We know from the statistics which have been published that young drivers, in particular, are vulnerable on our roads.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business this morning, a number of Senators welcomed the arrival in Ireland this weekend of the world rally championship.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the decision of the Road Safety Authority to invest money in Rally Ireland by becoming one of its partners.  Could that decision be interpreted as contributing to the glorification of speed?  I appreciate that the authority is trying to connect with young drivers by supporting a popular professional sport that appeals to them.  I accept that rallying, which requires a combination of great driving skills and speed, has a great following in Ireland.  I wonder if the authority&rsquo;s decision to fund Rally Ireland on a formal basis will be seen as an endorsement of the enthusiasm of young male drivers, in particular, for speed and modified cars.  I am concerned that the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s important message, which relates to responsibility while driving, may be lost.</P>
        <P>Has research been done into the effectiveness of the current television advertisements which form part of the overall road safety campaign?  The advertisements in question are terrifying for most of us.  What impact do they have on young male drivers?  How many of those drivers even see the advertisements?  Has research uncovered the most effective way of transmitting the message about safe driving?  Can the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority confirm whether the substantial spend on this campaign has been backed by scientific evidence?  It would be interesting to establish whether it has.  Perhaps such research could also clarify the wisdom of the authority&rsquo;s sponsorship of a rallying event.</P>
        <P>We have to do a great deal of work on education if we are to reduce the shocking level of road deaths.  I am sure all Senators will agree that horror stories about the effects of speeding have a limited effect on those who do not have the skills needed to drive safely.  It is clear that the recent announcements about provisional licences and driver testing were botched.  I am concerned <Col N="1269"/>about whether the waiting lists for driving tests will be cleared by the deadline set by the Minister.  If they are not cleared, what will the Minister do?</P>
        <P>The resistance to reducing the legal blood alcohol concentration levels for drivers is based on the argument that rural communities would suffer.  It is time to address this issue.  We should develop and support rural communities by putting in place proper transport networks in rural areas.  We should not use concerns about rural communities as an excuse for not reducing the blood alcohol level at which people can drive legally, because we know very well such a reduction would save lives.  Members of the House have a particular responsibility to deal with this issue in a manner that will save lives.  If we are ambivalent about drink driving, we will cause further loss of life.  The time has come to grasp this nettle and to deal with the issues faced by people in rural communities.  We should not use spurious arguments as an excuse for not taking the sort of action that is necessary.  After all, what could be more conducive to developing community spirit than encouraging people, communities and families to support the concept of the designated driver?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House.  Having listened to the debate over the last hour, it seems many of the points I had intended to make have been already made.  We are here to talk about how we can reduce the number of road deaths.  That is the fundamental reason for the reform and updating of road traffic legislation.  The idea that one road death is one too many has been echoed throughout this debate.  I often reflect on the consequences of each road death for the family, extended family and community of the person in question.  I would like to get that message across, but how can that be done?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public welcomes the legislation in respect of those holding second provisional licences.  If such drivers do not pass the test, then so be it; they should be able to pass the test at the second attempt.  I am delighted the Minister has given a lead-in period to allow all those on second provisional licences to prepare for the test in the next six months.</P>
        <P>We must question the reasons so many young people are involved in road accidents.  We should examine the causes rather than the symptoms of the problem and these point to a larger societal issue.  Something is radically wrong when young people are having accidents between 2 and 4 in the middle of the night.  This points to a lack of responsibility in society at large.</P>
        <P>While legislation is very important, it is not enough.  We had legislation which did not work and accidents were not prevented.  I question whether people are aware of the legislation or whether they are interested in it.  An awareness campaign is required.  Other speakers referred to <Col N="1270"/>the television advertisements which in my view are very frightening.  I cannot look at them, in particular the advertisement showing the young girl sitting on the wall with her boyfriend.  Such advertisements are necessary even though I cannot watch them.</P>
        <P>Young people need the support of their parents and their communities.  There is a role for educationalists.  Young people of 16 and 17 should be prepared at second level and taught how to be responsible when on the roads.  Most young people will aspire to driving a car by 18 or 19 years of age.  Parents must take responsibility and should know the rules of the road.  I suggest joined-up thinking between the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Education and Science and the local authorities to produce an educational module which would teach young people to be responsible for people other than themselves.</P>
        <P>Society will have to change.  The Celtic tiger is roaring and we have more money than we need but we do not have a quality of life.  There is a macho attitude of owning a car, having money and being free to drink and take drugs and no legislation will change such an attitude except by the introduction of colossal penalties.  There needs to be a change of attitude within families and within communities to get the message across to young people.</P>
        <P>When I drive I take responsibility for other road users such as those coming around the corner.  I have travelled the roads of Ireland over the past six months and I have had near accidents high up and low down on secondary roads.  I have seen people driving while using a mobile phone or talking to a passenger or attending to a child with one hand and the other hand on the steering wheel.  No legislation will put this attitude right.  Public representatives have a duty to speak to community and residents associations and at public meetings.  We must ask the public to help us because we can introduce or reform legislation but we need their help.  Community spirit and co-operation is required to change attitudes.  Otherwise we will see a continuation of people breaking the rules by not wearing seat belts and by drink and drug driving.</P>

Mar a d&uacute;irt Seanad&oacute;ir eile, duine amh&aacute;in a mara&iacute;odh ar na beala&iacute; m&oacute;ra, sin duine de bharra&iacute;ocht.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reiterate the call made by my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Cathal Boylan MLA, who has demanded an all-Ireland conference on road safety.  This <Col N="1271"/>week in the Assembly, Sinn F&eacute;in submitted a motion on road safety calling for an all-Ireland summit to tackle the crisis on our roads and for the integration of the Road Safety Council and the Road Safety Authority to deal with issues of road safety on an all-Ireland basis.  The Border, which was imposed against the will of the majority of people on this island, continues to cost lives and impinges on the well-being of the people.  The very existence of two road safety authorities on a small island does not make sense.  While hundreds of people are killed annually on our roads, there is a particular concentration of road accidents in the Border areas.  The death rate from road accidents is one third higher in the Border region than anywhere else in the island.  Partition is a major impediment to improving Irish road safety because of the two entirely separate systems.  There are two different systems of speed limits, different road signs and different standards for drivers.</P>
        <P>It is in the interests of everybody on the island that we work together on an all-Ireland approach to save lives.  The Good Friday Agreement strand two provisions have defined transport as a significant area of co-operation and this must include road safety.  The Sinn F&eacute;in all-Ireland road safety policy document spells out clear proposals, including all-Ireland ministerial and departmental co-operation in the area of transport, including road safety and an all-Ireland road safety strategy to harmonise speed limits into kilometres per hour, as is required under EU law, the harmonisation of road signs and other road safety measures.  It also proposes a single road safety authority for the entire island, an all-Ireland licensing system, including a common driving test and a common penalty points system.  Although I acknowledge the growing North-South co-operation, more must be done.  Lives are at stake and all-Ireland co-operation would improve road safety and reduce fatalities.</P>
        <P>I welcome most of the recommendations in the recent publication by the Road Safety Authority and while I hope, like all other Members, they will lead to a reduction in fatalities and injuries on our road, I question the Government&rsquo;s reluctance to deal with the issue of the blood-alcohol limit.  A positive step could be taken that would have an immediate effect if it was followed up by enforcement.  The template is in place in other European countries where a zero blood alcohol limit applies and I am disappointed action will not be taken on this issue until the second quarter of 2009.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s sentiments on public awareness campaigns.  At a recent public information meeting in Donegal attended by Mr. Gay Byrne the message was never drink and drive and one drink is too many but the message sent by the Government by not reducing the blood alcohol limit to zero is one can drink and drive up to a certain level.  That confusion needs <Col N="1272"/>to be addressed for once and for all and a blood alcohol limit of zero needs to be introduced.  This needs to be followed up by making proper provision for rural transport for those who need it.</P>
        <P>I am also disappointed that the issue of drug driving has not been tackled.  As Ireland has been a pioneer in other areas such as smoking legislation, it should also be a pioneer on drug driving.  When we debate the issue of drugs in society, we know people are taking illegal substances on a daily basis.  Do we believe they walk home from the pubs, clubs and parties they attend where they take these substances or do we believe they get behind the wheel of a car under the influence of drugs?  This is allowed to continue by not introducing the necessary legislation and measures together with appropriate enforcement to provide drug testing on the side of the road.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago the Government introduced legislation that permitted local authorities to reduce speed limits on roads and, in particular, outside primary and secondary schools.  If the speed limit was 100 km/h, it could be reduced to 50 km/h.  Although the legislation is in place, local authorities to not have the funding to implement the changes.  It would cost between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million to apply the reduction in County Donegal but that money has not been forthcoming from the Government.  While aspirations and strategies are important, they need to be supported by Exchequer resources, particularly for local authorities when they are asked to implement such measures.</P>
        <P>Funding for non-national roads is also a concern.  We all know the blackspots in our communities where accidents and fatalities occur on an ongoing basis.  While a scheme is in place to address accident blackspots, it is not sufficient.  The funding for the scheme is released in dribs and drabs and local authorities can only take action on a number of them annually.  If the Government is serious about reducing road accidents and fatalities, it needs to provide funding to local authorities and their engineers who know where the blackspots are located.</P>
        <P>There is a reason one third more accidents occur in the Border region.  The Minister of State, who is from Donegal, will be aware of the difficulties relating to road safety and action is needed.  Co-operation must be enhanced on a North-South basis and the necessary funding must be provided to address these issues.  Senator Keaveney and others referred to young people doing donuts on the road and the need for the Garda to tackle them so that they do not terrorise communities.  Young people are not solely responsible for our poor road safety record or bad driving.</P>
        <P>I refer to a project in Gweedore, west Donegal.  As a result of a young person losing his life on the road, his friends came together and decided to take action.  They set up a stock car rally club and developed a rally track.  They raised tens of thousands of euro and developed the track.  It is <Col N="1273"/>fully insured and fully compliant with safety regulations and it has the support of the local Garda.  More important, if the young people who participate in the stock car racing identify another member abusing the rules of the road, they are immediately excluded from the club.  The Minister of State was present at a meeting with the local superintendent who applauded the young people.  The Government should support initiatives such as this promoted by young people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I fully support the ambitious programmes laid out by the Road Safety Authority and the determined and direct fashion in which it is going about its mission.  Enforcement of road safety legislation has always been an issue.  Speed is the greatest killer and while I welcome initiatives in recent years such as the penalty points system and the traffic corps, which have made a contribution, I am concerned that enforcement of speed limits and penalty points is focused on revenue generation rather than on saving lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Members referred to shooting fish in a barrel.  I can recall many checkpoints on our dual carriageways and motorways.  Senator Ellis mentioned the famous camera on the N4 but if one is caught on that camera, one should be brought in for a psychological assessment because everybody knows where it is positioned.  The N4 is a quality road with many long straights which would allow for the landing of a jumbo jet while cars travelled on it and it is not a blackspot.  Many deaths have occurred on the Sligo-Donegal road, including in recent weeks, because of the quality of the road.  However, a police presence would discourage drivers from taking risks on a road that is not capable of taking cars driving within the speed limit, much less those driving in excess of it.</P>
        <P>Garda enforcement should focus on blackspots rather than on good roads where drivers can be  caught travelling at 105 km/h or 110 km/h in a 100 km/h zone.  While they are breaking the law and deserve to be punished, in the context of preserving lives and dealing with accidents, it would be more appropriate to enforce speed limits on national primary and secondary roads of a lesser quality between 12 midnight and 8 a.m.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge young people are not solely in danger but a disproportionate number of young men are involved in accidents and die.  I am a relatively young person and I was no angel driving when I was younger.  I am not proud of some of the risks I took.  I was in a number of car accidents and was possibly lucky not to be killed.  We must focus on the demographic age range most at risk and at the times of day when accidents are more likely to occur.  I live on a main road in Sligo and I could point out to a garda every night the cars involved.  They have been adjusted so that they are lower to the ground and they have wider <Col N="1274"/>tyres and louder exhausts, even though exhausts that exceed a specified decibel level are outlawed.  There are other aspects of enforcement and if they were focused on, they would be effective.  I am not launching an all-out attack on young people but they are the ones who, it appears, are most at risk and we must wake up to that fact.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiative regarding drivers with provisional licences in that the law will be enforced to the point where they will have to take their test.  I am delighted the implementation of that initiative was extended as it makes better sense.  There is no shame in admitting when a good suggestion was made to move forward matters that the timeframe was not right.  I welcome the fact that we pushed forward the implementation of that initiative.  We must ensure the resources are made available to allow us meet the reviewed deadline.</P>
        <P>On roads, for example, improvements must be made to the N16, N15, parts of the N17 and the final parts of the N4.  Those roads are in the north west where I come from.  Those improvements must be made, and under Transport 21 I believe they will be.  I would like, however, that to happen a little more quickly than the timeframe proposed under Transport 21 and I know the Minister of State will take on board those suggestions.</P>
        <P>I suggested previously the installation of speed governors on cars.  I realise that would be a draconian move but it should be examined.  A speed governor with an upper speed of 50 mph should be mandatory on cars driven by motorists up to the age of 25.  We could offer other incentives to appease people who might be annoyed about that initiative in terms of cheaper insurance or car tax or exemptions in that regard.  That could be examined.</P>
        <P>In regard to secondary schools, Professor Ray Fuller of the school of psychology in Trinity College stated yesterday that in terms of training he would propose some element of driver training in the secondary school curriculum.  That is something that would be worthwhile and I ask the Minister of State to take on board that suggestion.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business this morning I mentioned an important event taking place in the north west and in Belfast over the next five days, namely, the world rally championship, known as Rally Ireland.  I was disappointed to hear Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s contribution in that respect.  I almost always agree with her well-thought out and positive contributions, but she questioned the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s involvement in Rally Ireland.  It is for initiatives such as this that we should salute the Road Safety Authority in the context of its involvement in Rally Ireland because people want to speed.  As mentioned by Senator Doherty, I commend the people in north west Donegal who set up the stock car racing club, an excellent initiative.  Rather than sticking its head in the sand, the Road Safety Authority realises that young people get a buzz from driving fast <Col N="1275"/>and like to be involved in racing sports and the like.  The authority acknowledges that and it became involved in the world rally championship.</P>
        <P>Those who travel to the north west this weekend will see billboards with the notice &ldquo;Keep the race in its place&rdquo; displayed.  It is that initiative in which the Road Safety Authority has been involved and it is an excellent one.  The message &ldquo;Keep the race in its place&rdquo; is pioneering in the context of the many other rounds of the world rally championship worldwide and Formula One.</P>
        <P>As the event takes place throughout Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Belfast over the coming weekend, I appeal to the 150,000 spectators who will enjoy the activities to follow the instructions of the Garda and the marshals to ensure they, too, can keep the race in its place and be safe while monitoring the event.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to say that I was delighted over the past five years to be associated with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, on the political side in ensuring the Irish bid to host the world rally championship was successful.  We beat many other countries.  King Abdullah fronted the Jordan bid for it.  We also beat Australia and South Africa.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, knows, we did not need King Abdullah because we had the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Government backing us.</P>

	<P>It has broadened the Senator&rsquo;s horizons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the issue of road safety.  Several discussions on it have taken place in the six years I have been a Member of this House and I wonder whether the words we utter here have much impact.  I commend the work of those in the Road Safety Authority and the garda&iacute; who police the roads to try to reduce the awful number of accidents, deaths and injuries that occur on our roads daily.</P>
        <P>We are discussing this issue in the immediate aftermath of the cock-up by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, with his proposed reform of the licensing system.  I am sure many Members would have received many communications from their constituents on the proposed changes the Minister intended to introduce to crack down on people driving on a second provisional licence.  It is not the case that people do not agree with the proposal but there are still significantly long waiting lists for driving tests throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister backtracked and decided to allow a lead-in time for the changes to <Col N="1276"/>come into effect.  I live in a rural area and many people from rural areas who have to be in work at 8 a.m. have no possibility of being accompanied by a qualified driver.  They only way they can get to work is by driving because a public transport service does not exist in most parts of rural Ireland.  The initial proposal by the Minister with such a short lead-in time was exposed for the faults it clearly had.</P>
        <P>Significant changes need to be made in the driving test system.  The backlog of people waiting for driving tests needs to be addressed and I hope significant reductions will occur in the waiting times for driving tests in the next few months.</P>
        <P>I have raised the format of the driving test on a number of occasions in the House.  I do not know when the last significant changes were made to it but it strikes me that many tasks in the driving test are irrelevant to the dangers motorists face on the roads.  The most dangerous task a motorist will do is to overtake another vehicle, but that task is not part of the driving test.  Despite this, part of the driving test involves reversing around the kerb of a junction which, as far I know, is illegal.  Parts of the driving test are outdated.  It does not include the most dangerous aspects of driving.  If we are serious about reform of the licensing system, we should fundamentally reform the nature of the test.</P>
        <P>I have also spoken in the past of the need to examine the provision of facilities and places for people to learn how to drive.  If one lives in a rural area, as I do, one can learn to drive on country roads on which there is little traffic.  However, if one lives in a town or other urban area, the first time one sits behind the wheel of a car, one will drive on the public road and even though one is accompanied by an experienced qualified driver, driving on such a busy road is hardly suitable.  Local authorities and Government agencies have large landbanks and I have asked before for the provision of facilities where people can get their first few lessons to ensure they do not have to drive straight out on the highway given the danger that presents.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers mentioned the difficulties regarding the speed limits that apply on some roads.  The speed limits on some roads are ridiculous.  I can travel to Dublin on the N7 or the N11.  I travelled on the N11 yesterday.  It is a fabulous new road for most of the way but a 60 km/h speed limit applies to a significant stretch of it around the Glen of the Downs and Kilmacanogue and yet an 80 km/h speed limit applies to a twisty and windy stretch of the road closer to Wexford that has only two lanes, one in each direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A proposal was presented a number of years ago that a concerted effort would be made by local authorities to streamline the speed limits in operation but that does not seem to have worked.  I agree with Senator MacSharry that we seem to police most heavily our best roads.  I note that the Garda always appears to police a new section of road built between Enniscorthy and New Ross, <Col N="1277"/>which is a fine stretch of road.  However, I never seen the Garda policing a poor stretch of road between Clonroche and New Ross.  I do not understand the reasoning behind those decisions.  If motorists want to avoid detection, they can drive at whatever speed they like on the twistiest, windiest and narrowest stretches of national road but they must stick to the speed limit on the best stretches of national road.  That does not make sense.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system introduced four years ago has been successful.  I supported it then and I support it now, although I have been given a couple of penalty points.  I learned my lesson when I got them and they have disappeared from my licence by now, I suppose.</P>
        <P>At the time the then Senator Brian Hayes made the valuable point, which has not been acted upon, that at certain peak times, especially bank holiday weekends which tend to be black spots, the possibility of doubling penalty points should be examined.  It is done in many other countries, as I know having spent some time in Australia where it is done on bank holiday weekends when more accidents tend to occur.  Similarly, in Ireland most accidents occur at such times.  We should look at the possibility of doubling penalty points so that instead of getting two for speeding, the offender will get four and so on.  That has not yet been done.  Perhaps it is being looked at, and it should be.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator Pearse Doherty about a zero blood alcohol limit as I do not believe it would work.  If one goes to Mass on a Sunday and takes altar wine, one might find oneself over the limit.  It is not practicable.  To be perfectly honest, I do not see the need to reduce the alcohol limit from 80 mg per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg.  Senator MacSharry is right in saying that what is needed is enforcement.  We have enough laws, whether they concern justice, transport or road safety.  We just need to implement them and there is not enough of that.  I do not see that there is a significant need in rural areas in particular, where there is no public transport system, to reduce the blood alcohol level.  I do not believe it would serve a purpose.  If we were to implement what we have, that would be better rather than trying to reduce the current levels.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers have touched on drug driving.  Something needs to done in that regard and testing should be introduced.</P>
        <P>My last point concerns young people.  I still regard myself as a young person.  There is a danger in all this discussion that we will demonise every young fellow who has a car.  I am delighted to see any able young person providing himself or herself with a car and spending some money on doing it up.  They could be spending their money on much worse.  Young people are not the cause of the majority of road deaths.  There is a significant problem but we should try to work them with rather than demonising them.  Initiatives such as those that took place in Donegal <Col N="1278"/>should be welcomed and encouraged throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher.  He and I have often discussed safety at sea rather than safety on the roads.  In any event, this debate is very welcome and I am pleased to contribute to it.</P>
        <P>I echo the point made by the previous speaker about young people.  As a parent I believe the majority of young people are very responsible and tuned in.  They know it can sometimes be difficult to get insurance, even with a full licence.  In the event, they value and treasure it much more than I did when I was a teenager, for example.  They tend to be very responsible and it is unfair to tar everybody with the same brush.  My experience indicates too that the younger generation of drivers tends to be better trained.</P>
        <P>As a Seanad Member who probably has the furthest distance to travel to this House &mdash; up to six hours&rsquo; driving &mdash; I experience a good deal of ignorance and bad manners on the road from people of my age or older.  They do not indicate, overtake on double white lines or continuous single white lines and in general display bad manners which contribute overall to accidents.  We should not lose sight of the statistics outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, to the effect that last year, despite all the media exposure, we had the lowest number of road deaths in this country in 40 years.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to credit that we had a worse record in the 1960s with one third of the traffic.  Coming from a rural area in particular, I am conscious that we have, perhaps, one of the worst systems of public transport imaginable.  When I was a child there used to be a train going to Bantry, but it no longer operates.  People have to drive to work.  I know we have made many improvements, but usage of cars among the public is probably one of the highest relative statistics in Europe, and that should be acknowledged.  We have reams of legislation on the Statute Book and enforcement is probably the key.  More of this needs to happen.</P>
        <P>We hear much about drink driving and certainly this is a serious contributor to road accidents, although not the only cause.  There is a question too of speed, inexperience and human error.  As a Member of the Oireachtas I have become increasingly concerned that in the past five to seven years drugs have been a contributor in some of the major collisions.  It will not show up in a blood alcohol test whether someone has had cannabis, cocaine or a more dangerous drug.  We should be attuned to ensuring that people involved in road traffic accidents are tested for drugs as well as drink.  If that were done I am confident the statistics would show that drugs contribute to accidents and serious carnage on our roads much more than we realise.</P><Col N="1279"/>
        <P>As someone who travels a good deal by car, unfortunately, what bugs me are the easy options being taken by the Garda as regards speed traps.  A recent example I came across was in Castletownbere where garda&iacute; set up checkpoints on the old 30 mph, now 50 km/h, road exiting from the town.  There are two or three kilometres of straight wide road and very little traffic.  I was a victim of a speed check myself in that situation, put my hands up and just accepted my responsibility.  Fortunately I have only two penalty points.  The garda said that she had caught 33 people that day in that situation.  There was no accident and a fine straight stretch of road.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; should instead<b> </b>be watching for situations like the one I encountered recently on a pretty bad road with a continuous white line.  A person of unknown nationality or sex whistled past me certainly doing 80 mph.  One could see the shudder and shake of the vehicle as it passed.</P>
        <P>Instead of the Garda saying it had 500 speed traps in place last weekend which caught 8,000 people who got penalty points, it should focus its energies elsewhere.  Such statistics do not enhance or help as regards road traffic accidents.  Catching somebody doing 36 mph where there is a 30 mph limit constitutes a soft target.  While it merits brownie points for the garda concerned it contributes very little to the strategy of reducing road deaths.</P>
        <P>Speed is certainly an issue and there is sufficient legislation covering this as well.  One of the key reasons I wanted to contribute to this debate was because of something I raised in the House three weeks ago when I called for a debate on the safety of pedestrians.  I am conscious as I leave west Cork at 6 a.m. for Dublin during these short days of the numbers of pedestrians killed each year on the roads.  When the figures are added they are quite significant.  I am concerned in particular for the elderly and schoolchildren.  It should be compulsory for old age pensioners to wear armbands.  It would not cost an arm and a leg  to distribute them to the elderly and schoolchildren so that they are reflected in the dark.  I have had occasions where I have come around a corner on a bad foggy morning only to see a dark elderly figure emerge suddenly.  One blesses oneself on having passed them without incident.  One need not have drink taken to be involved in such accidents.</P>
        <P>Someone mentioned earlier that the method of testing is far from appropriate and I agree.  The tests being done today are the same as I did 30 years ago.  As a young man I had to go to England and had to do a test there because my Irish licence was not acceptable.  I also sat a driving test in the United States.  The current test in Ireland, which is conducted primarily in an urban area without driving on the main roads, overtaking other vehicles or accelerating to 50 mph or 55 mph, should be changed because we do not all drive in urban environments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The Senators have four minutes each.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what was said by most of the Senators in that we must save lives where possible.  I welcome the initiatives of the Road Safety Authority and other bodies and also the reduction in the loss of life over recent years, but much more can be done.  I and other members of the Joint Committee on Transport visited Australia during the last plenary session and saw the very advanced up-to-date systems in that country.  It seems we must go to Australia for everything because we are now considering its health service model as well.  We should be able to take the initiative ourselves.</P>
        <P>At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, I spoke to Mr. Barry of the National Roads Authority on the recently opened Charlestown bypass.  I was hoping the development would involve a two-plus-one carriageway and Mr. Barry stated there would be ample opportunity for motorists to pass others on the stretch of road in question which is nearly 18 km in length.  However, if one travels on the road one will note there is a continuous white line on almost all of it.  I cannot understand why either of the lanes of a two-lane carriageway could not be a little wider or why greater use could not be made of the hard shoulder, nor can I understand why it could not be converted into a two-plus-one carriageway.  If there is even a small amount of traffic on the Charlestown bypass, one cannot pass other motorists.</P>
        <P>I agree with the use of fixed cameras.  Senator Ellis drew attention to the fixed camera at the Lucan Spa Hotel.  Everybody knows it is there and slows down but Senator Quinn stated that if there were another further down the carriageway, the authorities would know whether motorists were breaking the speed limit because they would know the time it takes to travel between the two.  We must consider this and I would welcome the placing of many more fixed cameras on the roads by the Government or Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>Local authorities can do more to prevent speeding on bad sections of county roads but they need funding to put the appropriate notices and speed limit signs in place.  A special grant should be made available to local authorities to achieve this because it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest.  Local authority members recognise they should do more to reduce speed on certain roads but they do not have the necessary manpower or funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Paddy Burke for sharing time with me and I am aware most of the relevant points have already been made.</P>
        <P>Statistics on road safety speak for themselves and consequently road safety must remain a top <Col N="1281"/>priority, not just for the Government and Road Safety Authority but for us all.  We must all take responsibility, not just for our own actions but also for actions that would influence the communities in which we live.</P>
        <P>Statistics suggest that many of the measures adopted to date have been successful.  It is especially important to note this.  Perhaps we are not sure which measure has been most successful, be it the penalty points system, the drink driving legislation or the graphic advertisements on television.  I have no doubt that all the measures have had a role to play.  This will have been the first time in the history of the State in which there will have been a road safety strategy in operation.  When drawing up the strategy, it might be well worthwhile identifying specifically the immediate needs.</P>
        <P>I always underline the issue of education.  Perhaps graphic advertising forms part of this but I am referring to education in schools.  I am not just suggesting that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other representative visit the schools every year because road safety should be part and parcel of the curriculum.  It is so important to the lives of young people.  I am not just picking out young people because everyone is affected.  I recently saw on television a list of those who had died in road traffic accidents over the previous year.  Their ages were listed also and I was particularly surprised by their range.  It was not only young people who were involved.  Education must extend beyond the school and it should be regular.  It should not only point out the dangers to ourselves but also the irresponsibility associated with placing other people&rsquo;s lives and limbs in jeopardy.</P>
        <P>One must ask how much inconvenience motorists will accept.  When the drink driving laws were first introduced, there was all manner of debate in which some Members argued that exemptions should be made in certain cases.  However, if we want to prevent the carnage on the roads, as we all do, we must decide how much inconvenience we are prepared to accept.  The same applied to the penalty points system.  It was introduced over a holiday period and I remember how we all slowed down at the time.  We gradually built up our speed until we received our first two points and we then started to slow down again.  This demonstrates that the system works.</P>
        <P>I remember having been a passenger in cars in the United States and noted that US motorists take driving quite seriously.  They watch out for speed limit signs and speed cameras.  The Administration there must have succeeded in instilling such concern and fear into motorists.  I compliment the Government and Road Safety Authority on what they have done to date.  I hope we all have an opportunity to discuss and have an input into the strategy on an organic basis.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important topic.  The Minister of State, like his predecessors from Donegal, has an opportunity to be remembered for years to come for the work he may do to ensure road safety.  We know the work his predecessor, the former Ceann Comhairle Joe Brennan, did as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The two longest speeches ever recorded in the Houses of the Oireachtas were made by former Senator Bernard McGlinchey, a colleague of ours.  These men have been remembered for their contributions in the House.  The Minster of State, Deputy Gallagher, who is also from the north west, can also make a significant change by addressing the topic under discussion.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Senator Ellis, formerly a Member of the D&aacute;il, was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport.  I would like to believe we both made a significant contribution to bringing about the current position on road safety, given the level of carnage on our roads five years ago compared with today.  There were only 575 personnel in the dedicated traffic corps three years ago.  The Garda Commissioner, along with the three Ministers of the time, allowed this to take place.  The number of personnel increased to 800 last year and 1,000 this year.  The number will increase to its full compliment of 1,200 next year.  When the dedicated traffic corps in New York was given the funding and wherewithal, not only was there a reduction in deaths and serious injuries, there was also a 30% reduction in crime.  It is a win-win situation for everyone concerned.</P>
        <P>The biggest change we have seen is the introduction of random breath testing.  In the period between its introduction on 21 July 2006 and 20 July 2007, over 80 lives were saved and over 1,200 people were saved from serious injury.  It will grow and be enhanced.  That is on record and it is to the eternal credit of the Road Safety Authority; its chief executive at the time, Eddie Shaw, who was of enormous help to the committee; its current chief executive, Noel Brett; and its current chairman, Gay Byrne, that they have taken this issue seriously.</P>
        <P>For an additional cost of &euro;15 in the manufacturing process, vehicle manufacturers can, and have an obligation, to ensure that seatbelts are connected to the ignition.  If three people get into the car but do not fasten their seatbelts, the car will not start.  We are making this very simple request of manufacturers today.</P>
        <P>The Government must lead by good example.  A total of 53,000 vehicles, such as taxis, buses and <Col N="1283"/>school buses, are registered by the Government.  Black box technology should be installed in those vehicles.  This technology only costs about &euro;200 and three manufacturers are offering to play an enhanced role in this.  Accidents are not planned, rather they happen.  If someone travelling home on their own at night has an accident, either through falling asleep at the wheel or something else, they could be dead within half an hour.  For example, they could bleed to death.  Black box technology will notify emergency services immediately after the accident.  The nearest hospital or Garda or fire station, which could be 15 miles away, will be alerted and on the scene 15 to 20 minutes later.  This will save lives.</P>
        <P>We have seen how, unfortunately, school buses have been involved in accidents and young people have been killed.  No one definitively knows what has caused these accidents.  A bus mounted the pavement below the Clarence Hotel in Dublin on a Saturday afternoon and people were killed.  No one definitively knows what happened.  Within 20 minutes, the black box technology will tell one the cause of the accident, in the same way as a black box fitted in an aircraft.</P>
        <P>Insurance companies have come on side and have said that they will reduce premiums by a minimum of 20% for anyone who installs this technology.  The Government must lead by example and I call on one of the most experienced Ministers of State in the Government to bring the matter to the attention of his Department.  Black box technology was strongly recommended by the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment in its fifth and final report to the Government.  In fairness, the Road Safety Authority and the Department have accepted most of our proposals in the last four interim reports and the final report.</P>
        <P>I could speak on this matter for a long time.  The Minister of State can see that this has been a very worthwhile debate and I hope we will look forward to making the roads and country of Ireland safer to live and work in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators from all sides of the House for what can only be described as a well-informed debate on road safety.  Their interest and concern, which is not surprising, is very evident from the contributions of all Members.  </P>
        <P>The Government has made great strides in the area of road safety.  I am possibly more aware of this than most, having worked in that Department with the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, for about 16 months during which time I took a particular interest in this area.  There is a committed strategic integrated approach by all the relevant agencies to reduce the level of deaths and injuries.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise the subject of injuries.  We always talk about fatalities and the statistics at <Col N="1284"/>which we look concern fatalities.  However, injuries on our roads can be horrific.  I know many people who have been paralysed for life, a situation which is extremely difficult for them and their families.  Many of those people have very special needs and will need full-time care and attention for the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>Significant initiatives identified in the last road strategy for 2004 to 2006 have been realised.  We want to continue to see the results of the mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.  Since the commencement of these checkpoints in July 2006, over 30,000 drivers per month have been tested.  Aligned with a significant increase in high visibility enforcement, some 90 fewer people died on our roads in the period to the end of July 2007, compared to the same period to the end of July 2006.  It can be said that this reduction is a direct result of the introduction of roadside tests.</P>
        <P>The request for tender to deploy and privatise the operation of speed cameras was recently issued, with six companies being short-listed as part of that overall process.  The applications are being examined, with a view to selecting the contractor very shortly.</P>
        <P>I will also refer to what the Government has achieved to date.  A dedicated road safety strategy has been produced.  The Government has invested in new, improved and safer roads.  Of course, there is much more to do.  However, over the past ten years, through the Road Safety Authority and various local authorities, the Government has invested heavily in our roads, making them safer, which is to be applauded.  Much more remains to be done and the Government, including the Department of Transport which is responsible for the National Roads Authority and non-national roads, will continue to ensure that this level of investment continues.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system has been in place for some time but was extended in April 2006, featuring 35 separate offences, as well the addition of mobile phone offences from September 2006.  Fixed charges apply to almost 60 offences.  Over 570,000 drivers have received penalty points to the end of 2007, with 93 drivers on 12 penalty points, resulting in six months disqualification.</P>
        <P>We also established a dedicated traffic corps whose current strength stands at over 800.  There will be an additional 400 members attached, bringing the total to 1,200 by the end of next year.  This commitment will be realised.</P>
        <P>Greater levels of visibility and enforcement contribute greatly to road safety.  The Road Safety Authority was set up in 2006.  We have a ministerial road safety committee on which I served with colleagues from the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Taoiseach attended the committee at various times, which is an indication of his commitment and that of the Government and all Members of the Oireachtas.  The new rules of the road were launched last March.  Following its development <Col N="1285"/>by the RSA, the new road safety strategy 2007-12 was launched last month.  It is quite detailed and its primary target is to reduce deaths to no more than 60 fatalities per million people by 2012.  It may seem ambitious but it is realistic.  This equates to 21 road deaths per month or 252 per year.  This year the average is much too high, 28 per month.  The recent introduction of the new regulations regarding driving licences and learner drivers is a building block in the introduction of the graduated licence system in Ireland.  There was criticism of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, for not having a lead-in time but he was pragmatic in deciding that the period should be extended to June, a welcome decision.  The changes involve the replacement of the provisional licence, details of which Senators are aware.</P>
        <P>There is a downward trend as a result of various Government and departmental initiatives.  There have been 285 deaths to date this year, a reduction of 34 on the same period last year, but these statistics are cold comfort to the families of the 285 people who died on our roads.  We must continue to achieve a lower rate, as outlined in the road strategy.  If the current trend continues to the end of the year we will achieve one of the lowest death rates on Irish roads in 40 years.  The strategy contains a range of initiatives in education, enforcement, engineering and legislation.  It expressly provides for the evaluation of road safety policies.  The implementation of the measures in the strategy should achieve further reductions in road deaths, a goal shared by all Members.</P>
        <P>When this legislation was being debated in this House reference was made to penalty points and the revenue generated.  This was not the intention.  The Gweedore stock car rally track has been successful.  Other areas should try to emulate it.  It came about as a result of the death of Mr. Hugh Sweeney from Gweedore station.  He made such an impact on people that his friends decided he should not die in vain.  I believe he did not die in vain in light of the developments that have taken place.  His parents and brothers can take comfort from the fact that his death may have saved the lives many others in west Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The track in Gweedore is well organised and the young people who use it are committed to saving further lives.  It has the full support of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to which Senator Doherty referred.  We met representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last week in the Gweedore forum.  We should promote it in all parts of the country where young people between 18 and 26 will use it.  Statistics suggests that many accidents involve young male drivers between the ages of 18 and 26 and occur between 12 midnight and 4 a.m.</P>
        <P>We can refer to legislation, strategies, the RSA, the Department, Members of the Houses and the good advice we are given but we must remember each one of us is responsible for his or her safety.  If every individual were to decide to be more <Col N="1286"/>careful, not to pass out on turns, single and continuous white lines, and to be responsible for safety we could drastically reduce the number of road deaths.  Young people are prepared to take risks, which I see in my area.  They pass out at 100 mph and further down the road one sees them stopped behind traffic or at traffic lights.  We must instil in them an awareness of the dangers of driving at speed.  Alcohol also contributes, as does a refusal to wear seatbelts.</P>
        <P>The world rally championship will take place over the next few days.  I was at the first meeting about the rally, when we met the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and the event will be economically important for the north west.  It will be a showpiece for Ireland and will be transmitted to millions of people.  We must send out a word of caution to the many young people who will try to emulate professionals.  They should slow down, take care and keep the race in its place.  I pay tribute to the organisers of the world rally championship.  They have made a major contribution.  I hope the weekend will be accident and fatality free.</P>
        <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l do na Seandad&oacute;ir&iacute; go l&eacute;ir a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhactach seo.

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Alex White.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  There is no doubt that the Government&rsquo;s planned changes to the subsidies paid to certain child care facilities will cause immense problems for working parents.  Single parents will be pushed out of the workforce and working <Col N="1287"/>couples on lower incomes will struggle to meet the full commercial charges of child care facilities.  Anyone working part-time or in receipt of family income supplement will be disadvantaged.  As a result, parents will effectively be forced to withdraw their children from these facilities altogether.</P>
        <P>The equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 was created to develop child care to meet the needs of parents in employment, education and training and to help them to return to work or access resources which would have been previously impossible to avail of without affordable child care.  With this new initiative, many of those originally targeted will be precluded from re-entering the workforce simply because they cannot afford to pay the rates charged in their local child care facilities.  From next year, most parents will receive no financial assistance and subvention payments will be restricted to those on social welfare payments of &euro;80 per week and family income supplement payments of &euro;30 per week.</P>
        <P>A tiered system whereby parents on higher incomes would pay an appropriate rate is essential and I see no difficulty with this.  Many child care providers &mdash; such as those at Abbeylara, Kilbeggan or Clonmel &mdash; already operate such a system.  However, low income working families will be priced out of these facilities if this decision is proceeded with.  The current course of action was not recommended in the review that took place and, when the manner in which they receive financial support is changed, it could potentially herald the end for many community-based child care facilities.</P>
        <P>The existing equal opportunities child care programme is excellent.  Affordable, high-quality child care is delivered with the involvement of the Health Service Executive, and public health nurses and environmental health officers visit to assess and ensure the ongoing quality of the service.  A staff support grant is paid to child care facilities which helps them meet the cost of the children&rsquo;s care.  This has clearly been an essential support for those on low incomes.  It was especially relevant to single parents entering the workforce and has ensured the provision of affordable, quality child care for 62,000 children through 33 city and county child care providers.</P>
        <P>If this change is implemented, it has the potential to ruin many village communities that have developed throughout the country in recent years and I can only see a negative fallout from this revised approach.  Feedback from urban and rural facilities demonstrates one common opinion from management and staff alike, namely, they feel certain they will be forced to close as the numbers availing of the service inevitably fall.  Many of these committed people have invested valuable time and effort in obtaining certification in child care and are delivering an excellent standard of care to our children.</P><Col N="1288"/>
        <P>Providers of not-for-profit child care had already implemented a tiered structure to facilitate different needs.  The structure the Minister of State proposes will be a disincentive to many parents and can only contribute to a culture where people will avoid employment in the event that they might lose their subventions.</P>
        <P>This decision must be reviewed and the Government must ensure the current staff support grant is maintained and developed ultimately to provide an equitable system of access to community child care programmes.  Additional support for child care to those in receipt of social welfare payments can be provided through the increased financial provision set out for the next three years in the child care budget.  If the Minister of State does not revise this decision, facilities throughout the country will be forced to close because there will not be enough working parents in a position to afford the full costs facing them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions during his contribution, the Minister of State emphasised the amount of money being set aside for this scheme.  He indicated that &euro;153 million will be dedicated to the scheme over three years.  Global figures relating to schemes of this nature are important and are always welcome because it is good to know how much taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent in respect of them.  However, it is not enough for a Minister or Minister of State to come to the House and merely trumpet the fact that so much money is being spent on a particular scheme because other issues are involved.</P>
        <P>The issues to which I refer revolve around equity and sustainability.  As Senator Prendergast indicated, there is a concern throughout the sector regarding the likely sustainability of many facilities as a result of the changes the Minister of State proposes.  In this area, perhaps like no other, it is most important to have the confidence of parents, managers and volunteers that the service will be able to be provided into the future.  There is no point in stating that everything might be fine this year and that we will see what might happen next year.  To some extent, that is what the Minister of State is saying.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that he lacks data and that he must collect it.  He justified the change in the scheme largely by saying that his Department does not have sufficient information to indicate whether some disadvantaged parents are perhaps no longer disadvantaged.  That is the way the Minister of State pitched this matter.  He stated that we need to discover whether people who should not be getting it are, in fact, in receipt of the subvention.  Essentially, that is the argument he is making and it moves the emphasis away from promoting and expanding a valuable community service towards an approach which is restrictive and which seeks to root people out and discover whether they are claiming that to which they are not entitled.</P><Col N="1289"/>
        <P>I am not stating that people should avail of services when they are not entitled to do so.  As many speakers on both sides have stated, however, in the area of child care the situation is already quite precarious for many facilities.  It would not be right to introduce a further uncertainty regarding the future for these people, many of whom initially established their operations as voluntary schemes when they identified a need in their communities and banded together to set up facilities.  As already stated, their situation is precarious, especially in terms of the numbers of people they can recruit and the numbers already working for them, the use of community employment schemes &mdash; some of which are under threat &mdash; etc.  There is already a great deal of uncertainty in the system.  Unfortunately, this change increases the uncertainty rather than reassuring people and giving them confidence in the future which is what we need to do.</P>
        <P>Last week I listened with interest to my namesake, Senator Mary White, in particular when she wondered why would there be a fundamental objection to people making known basic information.  That is a fair point.  We fill in forms every day of the week.  What is the objection to people setting out clear and objective information?  It should not be a problem.  In fact, it does raise a problem in the context of the facilities themselves.</P>
        <P>This problem has various aspects.  Increasing the extent to which forms must be filled and administrative work must be carried out within these facilities will tie up the time of people who should be working on innovative approaches to child care, improving services and looking after children.  Nobody objects to people giving information where it is appropriate to do so.  However, surely it is wrong to ask people to give personal information such as a PPS number, schemes they are on or, in the new band, earnings.  Where a voluntary group has come together with a voluntary board of management people know each other and will be concerned about sharing intimate personal information with other people in the community.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Planet group made the point that the difficulty is that requiring people in a community to give information across the table to people they know and with whom they have worked will cause concerns.  How many of us in this House would be interested in sharing such information with people we know in our communities?  It would be interesting to see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is just a PPS number.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.  Senator Mary White has not examined the proposal if she believes it is only a PPS number.  The PPS number and the number of children using the service are not controversial.  However, one must also state whether one is on social welfare or any other scheme and which scheme one is on.  Senator Mary White should read it.  The so-called &ldquo;third band&rdquo; has not been clarified by the Minister of State and we are all waiting to see precisely what he means and how it will work.  It will require information on people&rsquo;s earnings.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White may not have a difficulty with this and many people in the community may also not have particular difficulties with it.  However, it will affect many parents already vulnerable in terms of the community or the workforce and who would consider it extremely invasive and ultimately divisive.  It could put at risk the participation of many parents in the schemes and on the management committees of these bodies at a time when we are all trying to encourage an increase in voluntary participation in facilities such as these.</P>
        <P>Women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce is at the heart of this debate.  We want to ensure that where possible, women are encouraged to return to the workforce.  However, life is never as straightforward as it sometimes may appear to us in this House.  Women&rsquo;s participation in the workforce varies over time and it is not as straightforward as deciding to take one course or another.  People may move from welfare to work and back according to the ages, stages of development and needs of their children.  We must encourage women to engage in the workforce as far as possible but we must also allow for the changes which take place over the course of time.</P><Col N="1291"/>
        <P>This is a complex issue and its complexity is neither addressed by the initial version of the change which confined the subvention to social welfare beneficiaries nor by the changes signalled by the Minister of State.  The emphasis in the system is restrictive.  Instead of expanding, promoting, seeking new ideas and new people, taking a positive view of the future and encouraging people to be progressive about the type of child care provided it is regressive, restrictive and puts people off.</P>
        <P>If this is an excessive form-filing exercise in which people must share this information, those who put a great deal of work into child care over the years, built it up and received grant aid for buildings will wonder where is the child in this.   Rather than turning the managers of child care facilities into administrators and stigmatising particular parents why cannot we simply ensure the child is at the heart of this?  We should all be interested in providing quality child care.</P>
        <P>Nothing should be done to undermine the commitment of people to improving quality child care in the community, particularly those who come from the voluntary sector.  Unfortunately, the scheme as it was introduced, the failure to explain it properly and the abject failure to consult with anybody in the sector has not been to the benefit of the child care sector.  The Planet group stated it was aware of one group which was consulted.  I hope the Minister of State will at least extend the six-month time period to a year and ensure we have a child care system that is grounded in a child development policy.</P>
        <P>This morning, during the Order of Business we discussed briefly the issues which arise in many communities throughout the country where young children are at risk and which have a high dependence on welfare or a lack of incentive to work.  Children find out about these and are affected by them early in their lives.  Early start programmes driven by the child care system is the way to address these issues.  I do not doubt the Minister of State&rsquo;s personal commitment to addressing them.  However, I suggest to the House the scheme he proposes will have the opposite effect to what we seek to introduce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, to the House.  He is representing his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, who has responsibility for children with regard to the proposed changes in child care.  I emphasise these are proposed changes and the time for consultation is now.  The proposal is to be implemented in June 2008, which provides an opportunity for all stakeholders to have an input into the shape of future child care facilities.  That is welcome.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Mary White, is our spokesperson on child care and she has taken a deep interest in the issue.  Long before she became spokesperson she brought out a docu<Col N="1292"/>ment, A New Approach To Child Care.  I commend her on it because while many people recently woke up to the question of child care she was ahead of the posse and wrote a very good document.</P>
        <P>The previous programme on equal opportunities child care which ran from 2000 to 2006 was of great benefit to parents across the board.  It was a free structure which meant those most disadvantaged benefited most.  The interesting aspect of this debate on child care is that we have become accustomed to the fact that we have completely free first-class primary education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of charging has been introduced to pre-primary school education.  If the Minister of State wishes to consider future staffing arrangements he should re-consider the entire staffing of the HSE which is completely over-staffed.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a former Minister of State at the Department of Health.  When the health boards were amalgamated under the Health Service Executive no redundancy programme was put in place.  Instead of a reduction in the number of managers along the line, there has been an increase in that regard.  There is room to consider some of them moving to the child care area if they are qualified in that regard.</P>
        <P>Even though it is true that the overall funding for child care will increase by 16%, the new system with its stringent rules will mean that some rural child care centres may face closure as many of their customers, generally low income parents just above the threshold for receipt of social welfare, will be unable to afford these services.  The matter is under debate in this House, in the D&aacute;il and in the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, which is a very important forum for debate regarding these issues.  It is not going to happen all of a sudden in January 2008.  It is under very careful consideration by the Minister of State and all the members of the parliamentary party.</P>
        <P>One typical child care centre in Roscommon has 50 children in attendance.  Of these, four children are from families in receipt of social welfare benefits.  In effect under the new scheme 92% of the parents with children in these centres will be paying more than they are at present, with the increase being especially hard on families with incomes just above the social welfare threshold.  This is the group being hit hardest in this regard.  For example, a job sharing, low income family with one child in part-time care could end up paying &euro;160 per week as opposed to &euro;60 to &euro;80 under the existing scheme.  With mortgage repayments rising by &euro;120 per month for many families in the <Col N="1293"/>current economic climate, this could result in great difficulties for many of them.</P>
        <P>An example is the Drumshanbo community child care centre in County Leitrim.  A representative of the centre brought this case to my attention at a very early stage when the dangers of the proposals became clear.  The centre with 125 children availing of its services expects to lose eight of its 22 staff if the new scheme is introduced, which would lead to the loss of either a number of child care spaces or the level of care provided.  Ultimately the children would lose out on the crucial early stages of their development.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, met the Fianna F&aacute;il group of councillors in County Roscommon on 15 October.  I received a copy of a submission made by Councillor Orla Leyden.  I declare that she is my daughter.  However, she made this submission in her own right as a councillor, young mother and someone in regular contact with young parents.  She made a very detailed submission to the Minister of State outlining her views, which I will put on the record of the House because she has considerable experience in child care and is in touch with other parents with children in child care.  Her submission stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The new scheme only provides a subvention to the parents of children that are in receipt of social welfare ... it is equally important that children with parents on low to middle incomes have access to affordable childcare.  Many parents are struggling as it is to provide for their families, their pay package is gone very quickly between the rising cost of mortgages, utility costs and the general high cost of living.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This new scheme will force many parents and women in particular out of the work place due to the higher cost of childcare ... This scheme will mean that it will no longer be worthwhile financially for a woman with for example two young children to work part-time, as the cost of childcare will be too great ... Parents should have the choice to care full time for their children, to work full time and employ childcare or work part time and also care for children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Having given the scheme some thought it is clear that following research by the Office of the Minister for Children, the Minister of State is trying to find ways to disqualify middle income families from benefiting from community child care as it stands.  These are the families that have created huge revenues for the Government and built our economy.  These families find themselves under increasing pressure to pay for mortgages in the current climate, especially those who took out 100% mortgages.  The need for leniency for those in the middle income bracket is crucial to allow parents remain in employment.  The Government has a responsibility to these families.  We do not want this scheme to create a spiral in which parents have to give up work to take care of their children, thereby increasing unemployment fig<Col N="1297"/>ures and reducing the skilled workforce our economy so badly needs to remain competitive.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The economic implications need to be considered carefully.  According to the Chambers Ireland labour force 2007 survey people are already making work decisions around child care.  Currently, 30% of company employees have reduced their working hours due to child care demands and 50% of all companies have introduced flexible working hours specifically to meet employee child care demands.   It is important to proceed with caution if we are not to tip the balance against the attractiveness of work at an uncertain time in our economy.</P>
        <P>The proposal has additional social implications.  Currently, those who are unmarried and not cohabiting qualify for benefits such as council houses and free child care while working up to three days per week, provided they earn under a certain amount.  We do not want to encourage a society in which it is economically preferable to be an unmarried mother living alone rather than married or cohabiting with the support of a father.  We should never promote one-unit families or force women into dependence on benefits.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This subvention scheme is going to cause job losses in the majority of cr&egrave;ches and the closure of a large number of facilities, resulting in a similar move towards privatisation to that seen in the health sector.  The dependency on the private sector will probably drive up child care costs because of the sudden monopoly the scheme will create.  Private cr&egrave;che operators have told me the scheme could benefit them by permitting them to charge any fee they see fit for children on their waiting lists for vacancies.  Yesterday, one play group leader told me that if the local cr&egrave;che closed, parents would be forced to travel more than nine miles to find alternative child care because the private facility in the area is already full.  Another leader spoke about a cr&egrave;che with only two staff which would close without funding.  That community playgroup has been operating for the past 25 <Col N="1298"/>years but only five of its 19 children would qualify under the new proposals.  The building was redecorated a few years ago and it would be a waste of money if it did not receive funding from somewhere else.  Children are the real victims in this new scheme.  A play group leader noted that children will lose out on the early childhood supports, such as speech therapy, which help to develop language, learning and social skills.</P>
        <P>As an educator, I see the severe negative social effects this scheme will entail.  It will split up communities, particularly those in rural areas.  Only socially disadvantaged children will end up in the cr&egrave;ches, which is not good for children or the social mix.  The Minister may not have thought through the social segregation that will result.  Shame on her for that.  Socially disadvantaged area schools already experience low retention and high drop-out rates and under-achievement by at least 20% of students.  At least the former scheme facilitated a good start.</P>
        <P>The new scheme will not benefit children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  A disadvantaged background should not mean a disadvantaged future.  It is shortsighted in the extreme to ignore the overall effects on people&rsquo;s lives across the socio-economic spectrum.  I urge the Minister to redraft the scheme, bearing in mind its implications for young families and the nation&rsquo;s most precious resource, children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the capital investment made by the Government in community cr&egrave;ches.  Ten years ago, child care facilities were non-existent.  We have come a long way.  I would like to extend the current facilities. However, the tiered fee structure the Minister has instructed community and not-for-profit facilities to implement is socially backward and should be reconsidered.  The new scheme assumes parents who are not in receipt of social welfare payments can afford higher child care costs but that is not the case.  With several interest rate increases in the past year, families are put to the pin of their collars in trying to make ends meet, never mind paying child care costs equivalent to the private sector.</P>
        <P>A rural village in County Westmeath which provides an excellent before and after school service costs &euro;100,000 annually to operate, including staff costs.  Approximately 20 families use the service on a daily basis and another 15 use it on a drop-in basis.  To continue under the new scheme, this wonderful facility will have to charge &euro;9 per hour, which is a lot more than some parents are earning.  Parents in the area face the prospect of quitting their employments, cutting their hours or reverting to having locals look after their children because they will be unable to afford the service.  The implementation of the scheme will encourage latch key children, with some parents reporting their children will have to wait an hour or more at home for them to return from work.  It is also a serious disincentive for <Col N="1299"/>parents on social welfare to enter the workforce.  Children will be boxed in when their families are told they are disadvantaged.  There will be little or no social mixing because subvention will be available only to those in receipt of social welfare and family income supplements.  Sadly, parents on social welfare are less likely to use child minding services because they have less need of them other than for the social, educational and developmental purposes.</P>
        <P>If this scheme is introduced, there will be no access or equality and parents will feel disenfranchised, which contradicts social inclusion and equality.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science stated last week that he will collate and analyse the data he received from parents throughout the country.  I understand he also undertook to change the income threshold for families on low and middle incomes in rural and under-populated areas.  These are the people who are completely reliant on not-for-profit community child care services.  He also stated, &ldquo;It is recognised that there may be particular issues for smaller scale services, but they will be considered when the data due to be returned this month are analysed.&rdquo;  I hope the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party is also behind this initiative.</P>
        <P>Last week I attended a meeting convened by the Mayor of Longford County Council, Peggy Nolan, at which Councillor Alan Mitchell proposed a resolution that was unanimously passed by all members of the council and supported by all Oireachtas Members from Longford-Westmeath.  The resolution proposed postponing the current proposals in order that the Department could engage in open consultation with child care providers and parents, maintaining the current level of funding pending the completion of an analysis of the data, introducing a system of long-term guaranteed core funding for the administration of community child care facilities, and providing staffing grants to community child care facilities in addition to funding provided under the subvention scheme.  It was also proposed that the Minister would introduce a system in which each child, irrespective of parental income or family circumstances, is entitled to a capitation grant for attendance at a quality child care facility which is community or privately operated, thereby ensuring all our children are treated equally and given equal educational opportunities by the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a youth and community worker by profession and in the 1980s when I was thinking about progressing along that career path, I sought a professional qualification which would help me to do so.  At the time there were not many standard educational qualifications in that area so the course I chose was one in child care at the then Regional Technical College in Cork which is now the Cork Institute <Col N="1300"/>of Technology.  One of the subjects we had to do as part of that course was child psychology.  </P>
        <P>The work of a British child psychologist called John Bowlby was quite often quoted in the course.  He helped define a theory called &ldquo;maternal deprivation&rdquo;.  It was not a theory for which I had much time.  Controversial as it was then, it is even more controversial now.  It was along the lines that infants were shown to be more progressive in their cognitive development if brought up by a stay-at-home mother.  I had even less respect for that theory when I learned the study had been done in the late 1940s and that it was paid for by the British Government as a way to encourage women to leave the workforce after the Second World War.</P>
        <P>I mention this because it is not unlike the situation the Irish economy and society now faces.  A number of policy measures have been taken in the past decade to encourage more women into the workforce, some of which were done for progressive reasons.  There was an imbalance in the workforce.  The quality of work being promoted in the economy lacked a particular skill set which only women could provide.  It was very much needed and benefited the economy subsequently.</P>
        <P>Some of the policies adopted were to appeal to people&rsquo;s wish for a better livelihood, such as tax individualisation and other incentive measures.  We now know that the way they were implemented had a societal impact.  Corrective measures have since been taken in respect of those policies.</P>
        <P>Alongside that, there was a major policy to put in place a child care infrastructure where none had existed, as was admitted in this debate.  A large amount of Exchequer and EU funding went into that.  It was always understood that the level of funding required to put in place the capital infrastructure for a child care network would not be followed by current expenditure support.  In the current climate in which we now find ourselves the budget which can be allocated for this is less than what it has been.  How that is allocated in a socially just way is at the heart of this debate.</P>
        <P>A sincere attempt has been made to try to put in place a tiered set of payments which is generally lacking in our social welfare system.  The lack of staggered rates of payments in terms of State services has created unnecessary poverty traps in the past.  How we pay people in terms of social security and how they can access social services according to need will determine how successful we are as a society in the future.  No one in this House has accepted, or would accept, that the set of figures produced in the first instance is a successful way to do that.  As Senator Healy-Eames said, the problem is not with those on middle incomes but with the likely effect of the figures which exist on those on lower incomes.  The changes which need to be made, which are being considered in debates such as this and the concerns expressed by the child care sector must take <Col N="1301"/>into account that people on modest incomes could be cut off and expected to pay an exorbitant amount in terms of increases in chid care costs.</P>

	<P>The salient point I make is true.</P>
        <P>In raising this issue on the Order of Business, the leader of the Fine Gael group read out a letter she received from someone known to me who I would call a friend and whose circumstances I am very familiar with.  She is a young mother with a young child who has chosen to work in the arts sector on a minimum wage because she gets job satisfaction from the job she does.  Her circumstances would see her child care costs increase by &euro;50 per week which her current salary would not meet.</P>
        <P>The difficulty I have with the current tiering is a criticism I would make about how social welfare payments and services are generally assessed in that there is no consistency in this area.  For instance, if someone qualifies, as does this young woman and her family, for a doctor only medical <Col N="1303"/>card that, in itself, is a cut off which means there should be better tiering in regard to this payment.  I hope the debate will help to inform that.  I have every sympathy for the civil servants who came up with this package.  They were told the budget is so much and to produce tierings which would spend that amount.</P>
        <P>We can still address this by devising a more socially just and equitable method which will see child care services of the highest quality produced in local communities.  Child care services are best provided in a community based way rather than by way of private child care.  Following this debate, the final tweaking of these proposals and following ongoing consultation with the child care sector, figures will be produced which will allow that to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am particularly pleased this debate is taking place and that I have an opportunity to speak.  It is six weeks since I first raised the matter on the Order of Business.  I did so on a weekly basis until there was a groundswell of support for the debate now taking place.  My party has been to the fore on the issue of child care funding.  I have met child care providers.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s health spokesperson in the other House, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has also raised this issue.  We believe the new system of funding community and voluntary child care facilities is causing grave concern in this sector.  There are real fears that it will result in cr&egrave;che closures, job losses, fee increases which will have to be borne by many parents and the development of a two-tier system.  This scenario has arisen primarily due to a lack of consultation with those working at the coal face of child care provision.</P>
        <P>Nobody disagrees with the stated intent of the new programme.  It is about making child care more accessible for low-income families.  Far too many families continue to be unable to access child care due to a lack of affordable places, with serious consequences for parents who wish to improve the lives of their families by working in part-time and full-time employment.  Under the new scheme, community child care providers will receive a subvention to enable reduced fees to be charged to disadvantaged parents.  Such parents must be in receipt of social welfare payments, however.  Many families using community child care facilities earn low incomes but do not receive social welfare payments.  Community cr&egrave;ches which do not have a sufficient number of welfare recipients on their books will be forced to close or to raise their fees for those who do not qualify for the subvention.  Therefore, many low income families which are already trying to cope in straitened circumstances may be forced to pay more for child care.  That would make a nonsense of the claim that the new scheme will be better for the disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>There are genuine fears that the new scheme will lead to the creation of a distinction between <Col N="1304"/>welfare recipients and other service users.  We could end up with a two-tier child care system, mirroring our two-tier health system.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for the new scheme to be suspended pending an urgent review of it, including full consultation with people in the community and voluntary child care sectors.  It would be shameful if an ill-thought-out scheme were to undermine this country&rsquo;s voluntary child care infrastructure, which has been built up from scratch over recent years.  Sinn F&eacute;in favours the development of a comprehensive and universal system of child care.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to listen to some of the arguments which were made by Government Senators.  I had to pinch myself to make sure I was in the Upper House of the Oireachtas and not anywhere else.  It was difficult to believe what was being said.  This scheme is in place &mdash; it is not still at the discussion document stage.  It is not still being promoted by civil servants &mdash; it is in place.  The extent of this problem is not being exaggerated by people on the Opposition benches, or even by the 41 members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party who raised it at a recent meeting of that body.  This problem is being brought to the attention of politicians by those working in the child care sector and those sending their children to community child care facilities.  These people are asking politicians to govern and to ensure there will be enough child care places for children on 1 July next.</P>

There is no reason that cannot be done, as the scheme does not come into effect until 1 July next.</P>

	<P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, spoke about this issue last week, he claimed there has been full consultation with the child care sector.  I discussed this issue directly with the Minister of State during a debate.  My information is that just 11 voluntary community child care groups, from a total of more than 1,100 such groups, were consulted.  That does not constitute full consultation with this sector.  The Minister of State suggested that these forms are simple and the information demanded is simple.  Having spoken to and listened to those who have filled out the forms, or asked parents to fill out the forms, I can inform the House that the voluntary committees were required to put the forms in envelopes, accompanied with a cover letter stating that they would not open the envelopes to look at the <Col N="1305"/>information being provided to the Department.  It is unfair on members of voluntary committees to be given access to information on the social welfare payments of their neighbours, friends and, in some cases, family members.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State suggested that there is ill-information and misinformation among the public.  If he attended some of the meetings which are happening throughout the State, he would hear that people&rsquo;s concerns are based on real facts, rather than distorted information.  If he had been at a meeting in County Donegal that was attended by more than 100 people, he would know that some child care facilities are having to increase their fees by 95%.  He would have heard that a playschool in the county is closing down because of this scheme.  He would have heard that a woman who is currently in employment in County Donegal intends to go on social welfare from 1 January next because that is the only way she can afford to get child care for her child.  She is falling into a poverty trap.  The Minister of State would have heard that the Government&rsquo;s investment of &euro;1.3 million in child care facilities in Ballyshannon will be a white elephant unless this scheme is suspended and then altered.  He would have heard about the countless parents who are so concerned about the Government&rsquo;s introduction of this scheme that they are considering taking various forms of action, such as strikes and marches.</P>
        <P>I had thought the days of devising policies on the back of an envelope were gone, but that seems to be how this scheme was drawn up.  I do not think it is fair to blame the Civil Service.  The Minister of State spoke about introducing a scheme that he has already introduced.  He said he would collate the data to find out what impact it will have.  Why did that not happen prior to the introduction of the scheme?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s attempts to defend his position on this scheme show he is completely out of touch with what is happening on the ground.  It is not good enough to talk about adjusting the scheme &mdash; it needs to be suspended fully.  We should listen to those who are providing community child care throughout the State, including the voluntary committees.  We need to come up with a better scheme.  I do not doubt that all Opposition parties would support some changes.  The Minister of State needs to listen to the many Deputies, Senators and Ministers from the Government parties who do not support this scheme.  It is unfortunate for the Government, which has done a number of U-turns in the past after trying unsuccessfully to implement various ill-thought-out policies, that the Minister of State will have to do another U-turn in this instance.  He will have to suspend the scheme, embark on full consultation and try to come up with a valuable scheme that will secure the future of the voluntary child care sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on this important matter.  Child care has become one of the most symbolic issues in modern Irish society.  It is worth noting that this Government and its two predecessors built a formal child care structure from scratch.  We now have a fantastic and evolving professional structure.  The workers in this sector deserve to be consulted at all times on all child care matters.  More than 35,000 new child care places have been created since 2000.  Some &euro;500 million was allocated to this sector between 2000 and 2006, under the equal opportunities child care programme.  More than 3,300 grants were allocated to a mixture of community and private providers.  However, Pobal should be criticised for the manner in which it has impeded progress in this area.  Child care places could be provided far more rapidly if Pobal&rsquo;s administrative problems could be resolved.</P>
        <P>The child care subvention scheme is part of the national child care investment programme, which succeeded the equal opportunities child care programme.  A budget of &euro;575 million has been made available for the national child care investment programme over the next three years.  The programme aims to provide 50,000 additional child care places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for children aged three and four.  By 2010, the Government will have spent more than &euro;1 billion of public money on the child care sector.  We should ensure these funds are not wasted, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some real concerns about the new scheme.  We need to examine the changes which need to be made in respect of low-income parents who depend on community child care facilities to enable them to access work.  Some of the parents who have raised their concerns with me have also said they benefited enormously in the past five or six years from the availability of valuable community child care centres.  Child care places which are based in community centres are accessible and do not cost very much.  They facilitate people who would not otherwise be able to enter employment.  It is good for children to be able to avail of this form of child care.  Many parents feel the proposed changes under the new scheme will freeze them out.  They suggest that as they are unable to avail of prohibitively expensive private child care, their only option is to become welfare-dependent again.  We should acknowledge that many of these parents do valuable work in the community.</P>
        <P>Child care facilities were originally intended to allow people to return to education and work.  The proposed new scheme could represent a backward step in that regard.  I noted Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments during last week&rsquo;s debate, when he said that child care is regarded almost exclusively as a woman&rsquo;s issue.  He argued that if more men took an interest in it, we would go a long way towards tackling the problem.</P>

	<P>I agree with him.  If we are to obtain greater support for the implementation of a more progressive programme, not only should we encourage the electorate to elect more women, but we should also promote the fact that men share the economic cost of child care.  Paternity leave is essential and we must also consider other radical measures including tax breaks for middle and high earning income brackets to allow such parents to provide child care in the home or in other private facilities.  Such measures would also free up publicly-funded child care places for those on lower incomes.<?oasys _jy ?>Creativity is required when dealing with this issue.  </P>
        <P>There must be progress towards universal early education for three to four year-olds, as advocated by Senator Mary White.  Community child care must be the cornerstone of our policy.  I urge the Minister of State to make the changes necessary to make this scheme workable and to continue the wonderful work that has been done over the past seven years.  I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government for providing the hard cash for this scheme and a few hard thoughts are needed now and perhaps a few hard changes.  The budget is in place so we must push forward and there is no need for any suspension.  We must ensure a poverty trap is not created as a result of the changes to the scheme.  This programme is an opportunity to solve the problems rather than to subsidise them.</P>

It is not the fault of the Minister of State because he is not the Minister responsible.  I wonder what Piaget and Erikson would think of this debate.  Senator Boyle referred to the issue of cognitive development and he quoted an infamous British psychologist.  Cognitive development is important but so too is child-centred education and child care.</P>
        <P>This debate should consider a holistic approach.  I proudly acknowledge the immense investment in child care in the past decade or more and a structure has been established.  I congratulate all Governments who have been responsible.  However, it has been a case of playing catch-up.  The parents of this country were the ones who created the wealth to allow for investment in child care.</P>

For a moment I pictured myself &mdash; but perish the thought &mdash; sitting in the RDS at a Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis because there was a clarion call, a &ldquo;Battle Hymn of the Republic&rdquo; speech from Senator Leyden announcing that, &ldquo;I am going to save child care, hallelujah&rdquo;.

	<P>I will speak about Senator Mary White in a moment.</P>
        <P>Since this scheme has been proposed and promulgated, Senator Leyden and others have listened to their own constituents and to the women and the men who are equal partners in child care and this should not be forgotten.  They have been told that this scheme in many cases is unworkable, cruel, anti-woman, anti-family and anti-child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will pay tribute to Senator Mary White of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am not being patronising but she has a genuine passion and interest in this subject.  I read her document before I became a Member of this House.  If she was in Government, this scheme would not be here today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>If she is, I advise her to start talking more to the Ministers and they should listen to her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to support parents who are raising families, the young people who are struggling.  They are getting up earlier, they are stuck in traffic and there are no buses, as was the case in Dublin yesterday and today.  I know that children are in school at 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. or 5 p.m.  Being a parent today is becoming more stressful and it does not need Government to make it worse.</P>
        <P>The partnership approach has been espoused by all sides of the House and child care is deserving of support because it is a central pillar of raising a family.  When I was young my mother opted to stay at home rather than go out to work.  That was her choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Last Thursday night, the women of Cork spoke at a meeting and they had a common bond of frustration at the proposal before them.  They said it would lead to further marginalisation and that many qualified child care workers would lose their jobs.  They feared it would be impossible to maintain quality standards of child care and many services would be forced to close down.  The community child care facilities play a pivotal role in this debate and they deserve to be recognised.  Children are the most important and central focus in this debate.</P>

	<P>I listened carefully to the Minister of State&rsquo;s contributions on the scheme in this House, the D&aacute;il, at a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting and at other meetings.  I am under the impression the scheme will be fluid and the reason he is seeking information is he wants to amend it.  I am glad he is present for the debate because it is a live issue in Donegal.  A number of people there would like the scheme to be forgotten about altogether and the old staffing grant retained while others do not consider the <Col N="1311"/>staffing grant to be an appropriate solution but they also have a problem with the new scheme.  While there are misunderstandings about the scheme, it also contains a number of discrepancies.  It would be much better to deal with them as soon as the Minister of State obtains the relevant information rather than delaying that process, and this is his intention.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Government on the serious capital investment in child care in the recent past.  While it may have been well overdue, in the case of Donegal, 64% of such facilities have been developed on a community basis.  The involvement of communities has been maximised on the basis that their need drove them to draw the moneys down and they were central to the development of the service from the bottom up.  When Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue served as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he met a number of community activists in Buncrana.  He implored them to make an application to draw down money under the then scheme to Pat Murray, the relevant official at the time.  He also moved on to greener pastures.  While applications were slow in arriving initially, its success is visible nowadays in many locations.</P>
        <P>Expertise has been developed in Donegal because many of those who lost jobs in the textile industry were encouraged to consider child care as a new employment source.  Generations of young girls pursued the qualification and they are well qualified in child care.  They feel most under threat currently and I would like to know whether they are right.  The goal of the new scheme is to assist those in greatest need achieve affordable child care.  It also goes beyond those on welfare payments and assists those on family income supports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A public meeting on child care in Letterkenny last Monday night was well attended and a number of people stated all child care should be free and if that was not possible, the cost should be the same for everybody.  I believe in the concept of free preschool education and I am a firm <?oasys _dc18- ?>advocate of investment in the zero to six years age group.  If wisely spent, this would be the greatest investment made by the Government because it would ensure the neurological development and socialisation of our children through music, co-ordination and rhythmic development and speech development.  By a child&rsquo;s seventh birthday, it would be too late to invest these funds if the Government wished to attain the same results.  This would be the wisest investment ever made by officials in the Department of Finance because lower investment would be required as a consequence tackling issues such as juvenile delinquency and learning disability.  Solutions to many attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder related issues that evolve later in life could be provided earlier.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

Therefore, resources need to be targeted so that families can avail of the advantages of child care for the sake of the parents and the child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was accused on Monday night of only being interested in children, which is an interesting accusation at a child care meeting.  However, I would not like to overstate the comment in the recent Health Service Executive report that Donegal is only one of four counties in which none of its cr&egrave;ches that were inspected were given the all clear because minor issues can prevent a cr&egrave;che from obtaining a clean bill of health.  However, the child and his or her welfare should be to the fore in the provision of child care.</P>
        <P>I refer again to the issue of those who sense their jobs are threatened by the recent changes.  Both at Monday&rsquo;s meeting and on other occasions, the priority placed by facilities in Donegal on keeping abreast of best practice and ensuring staff undergo constant training was highlighted.  This concerns balance because it is important that if a national preschool programme is to be developed, facilities must be given the ability to buy expertise or to ensure training is undertaken.  If the subvention is provided as outlined, will the development of expertise be impeded?  I may bore people by continually referring to the connection between music and the brain but the neurological proof and research is only being published now.  To maintain this expertise, we cannot call a halt to such research and we must always try to keep people up to date.</P>
        <P>Small community facilities are legally required to maintain a minimum number of staff.  Is it proposed to provide a minimum level of support through the subvention scheme?  How will such facilities survive otherwise?  When two-teacher primary schools were under threat, Fianna F&aacute;il made a decision to support them, whether the pupil numbers were maintained.  A minimum subvention payment should be provided for community and other child care facilities to ensure the staff can be retained.  For those working in cr&egrave;ches and other child care facilities, a recent report by the Border Counties Child Care Network revealed that only 12% of child care workers earn wages deemed acceptable by child care groups and trade unions.  Can we stand over this continuing?  Will the subvention be sufficient to support the facilities in place even to deliver wages in compliance with the national minimum wage legislation?</P>
        <P>I wonder about voluntary groups incurring charges under the scheme.  For example, I asked a number of the child care groups in Donegal to forward precise information.  I received a fax from one group in this regard last Thursday while the <Col N="1313"/>debate was under way and I raced to the Chamber to give it to one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials.  The group felt that instead of paying &euro;30 per week, clients on social welfare would have to pay &euro;95 a week under the new scheme, which is a significant increase.  However, the officials examined the case and it transpired the group had made a substantially incorrect calculation.  Category C clients will pay &euro;36, an increase of &euro;6 while category A clients, those on social welfare, will pay a greatly reduced fee of approximately &euro;12 per week.</P>
        <P>I do not condemn the group&rsquo;s administrators for providing incorrect information because they are only volunteers.  The difficulty is a group does not look after five children in five specific categories for five hours a day, five days a week. The cases of which I have heard involve complex computations.  For example, two children under the age of one may be in a child care facility for two hours, three days a week and the parents may come from different social backgrounds.  The calculations involved are much more difficult than people might believe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other case that was brought to my attention involved a girl whose first child is autistic.  I appreciate that tough cases made bad law.  This girl said that she did not mind my referring to her case.  Her second child was born and she has suffered from depression.  She began working because her doctor said it would be the best thing for her.  She was working 17 hours per week.  She looked into this scheme and noted that if she continued to work 17 hours, she would not qualify for the type A subvention, whereas if she worked 15 hours she would qualify for social welfare benefit.  Her case was an anomaly and I wonder how many more anomalies exist in the case of other people.</P>
        <P>Not every facility will accept children with special needs.  I wonder whether we have to separate the ability or disability of the child from the financial aspect.  We talk about disadvantage but sometimes geographical disadvantage can be as bad as financial disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister of State has agreed to meet a delegation from the Donegal child care forum to discuss its issues first-hand.  That meeting is urgent.  I thank the Minister of State for the forthrightness with which he has spoken when people were listening and that we have seen the best scheme emerge and that it is an evolving one.  I look forward to the Utopian days when the Opposition can freely advocate when everything is free but I realise that will take a decision by the people of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

From the perspective of the Department of Finance a euro invested in children aged up to six would involve a great saving at a later stage in terms of expenditure by the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The benefit of such investment has yet to be realised by those who hold the purse strings.</P>

	<P>I apologise to Members for not being able to be here for the earlier debate as I had to attend a Cabinet sub-committee meeting.  I understood that this debate was to be finalised yesterday.  I apologise for my absence.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney made valid points, as she has done since August, in regard to this scheme.  As I outlined to the House last week, the scheme was announced in July.  It was stated clearly on numerous occasions by myself and Department officials that there was a transition period up July 2008 and that the community facilities that were in receipt of funding would be funded for the first half of 2008 on the basis of the funding they received in 2007.  A 12 month transition period was introduced from the outset on the basis that we wanted to get more specific data on the profiles of the parents who had children attending these particular community-provided facilities.</P>
        <P>Another phrase that I, politically, and the Department officials used continuously was that if there were particular trends emerging that would cause difficulties for people, we wanted all the data to be available so that we could make further decisions and enhance the scheme.  That has been the stated position since last July.</P>
        <P>I was here last week and I could not be here earlier because the business of the House was changed yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am well able to listen to people.  When I was here last week the only person who I recall mentioning the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; in regard to the provision of child care was Senator Mary White on this side of the House.  Other speakers pontificated about what they saw as deficiencies in the scheme, but nobody made the point that as the scheme is being operated in some places, the most needy children were being deprived of a place in some of these community facilities, the children from whom these schemes were devised initially.  </P>
        <P>I want to ensure that the tiered fee structure that was supposed to be in place in all the facilities is more uniformly applied.  I want to say to the community providers who have done excellent work in providing child care facilities, and who applied the tiered system in a proper way on the basis of the ability to pay to ensure that more children could avail of that service and that there would be less demand on the less advantaged parents, that we want a uniformed tiered system introduced.  Some Members of the Lower House and Upper House have said that the tiered fee structure was never part of the criteria, but it<?oasys _jy ?>was.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I remind Members that there was no child care sector in this country until recent years.  We built a child care sector a number of years ago that is providing good child care throughout the country.  In the decade up to 2010, &euro;1.1 billion will have been spent by Government, mainly through Exchequer funding and some of it supported through European Union sources.  We will have invested directly in the provision of new facilities and in assisting the staffing costs.  We will have invested &euro;1.1 billion.  It is ludicrous for anybody to think that the Government will walk away from that investment.</P>

	<P>I want to comment on a number of points that were well made by Senator Keaveney.  She outlined cogently the value and great contribution that the community child care sector has done throughout the country, with which we are all familiar.  Senators Keaveney, Wilson and I, who all come from rural communities, appreciate it is not always possible for a facility in a remote rural area to have the critical number of attendees that would justify and make it viable.  I can assure the House that in the enhancement of the scheme, as we stated from the outset, in regard to issues such as peripherality, a rural factor or an isolation factor, we will ensure there is a weighting in favour of those types of projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should talk to the service providers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we have created almost 40,000 new child care places under the EOCP and we have the target of creating a further 50,000 places under the national child care investment programme.  We will ensure that we will deliver those figures.  I also re-emphasise that from the outset when we announced the scheme in July, we stated that there would be a 12 months&rsquo; transition period that the new scheme would not take effect in reality until July 2008.  We stated clearly that we wanted the data back from every community child care sector in order that the officials in the Department could analyse it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not wrong.  It is absolutely correct.  There was a campaign by some people to tell groups throughout the coun<Col N="1318"/>try that the questionnaires and forms should not be returned to the Department. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Department&rsquo;s officials at every seminar they attended insisted we wanted all the data possible.  In the past, as the scheme grew we had only generalised data available, whereas now we want specific data to ensure we have the profile of the beneficiaries who use the service.  I am very glad to report to the Seanad, as I did to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last night, that we indicated to all groups that we wanted the data back as early as possible in November.  At this stage 75% of the groups have responded in complete detail to the questionnaires we sent them.  Quite a large percentage of the remainder have contacted the Department by telephone to state the data are being compiled.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Cecelia Keaveney has made a very valid point.  She spoke to me on the telephone late one night regarding the group&rsquo;s data for which she wanted a quick analysis.

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: </P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann commends the Government on its publication of the Green Paper on pensions as a first step towards ensuring that as our society ages there is adequate pension provision, particularly for people on low and middle incomes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce this motion on the development of an adequate and sustainable pension system to meet the changing demographic circumstances that our country will face in the coming decades, and I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
        <P>Pensions should be a matter of great importance to everybody and how they are to be provided for in the future is an issue that requires full-scale debate.  The Green Paper sets out in a clear and comprehensive manner the issues the country is facing and the potential options which <Col N="1319"/>are available.  There has been some criticism that it does not reach definitive conclusions as to the various options.  I believe, however that is somewhat misguided.  Any effective solution requires a sustained long-term approach based on a broad consensus and this can come only from an informed national debate.  Hence the consultation period.  The motion gives Members of the House an opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
        <P>Ireland is lucky in the sense that because of our recent strong population growth, we have more time than most developed countries to fashion a response before we have to adjust to a decline in the number of workers who will sustain pensions, or resolve how to deal with a situation where we have a much smaller number of people of working age relative to a much larger number over pension age.  While this demographic change may be delayed in Ireland, it will happen and in the event will represent a major social change.  As the Green Paper points out, the population aged 65 and over will increase by 59% in 2021 and by a further 142% by 2061.  As a result, the ratio of people of working age to those over 65 will decline from 5.6:1 in 2006, to 1.8:1 in 2061.</P>
        <P>This is largely as a result of people living longer and healthier lives, which undoubtedly is a cause for celebration.  All the projections suggest that as a result of economic growth and technological change the standard of living will continue to increase.  Good governance is about preparing and planning for this future scenario.  It would be reckless in the extreme to ignore the inevitability of our future pension needs and liabilities.  Government must act to make the necessary policy adjustments to plan for the future, and prudence would dictate that we act now.  Furthermore, given the projected ratio of working people to pensioners, Government must alert, encourage and incentivise people to plan for their future retirement needs.</P>
        <P>It is obvious we need to agree on a national strategy in relation to the provision and funding of pensions that will ensure future pensioners have the resources to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and that this is done in a manner that does not place an unsupportable burden on what will be a proportionately smaller labour force.  This is the vital issue.  We cannot burden workers today or in the future with the pension requirements that are needed further along the way.  It cannot be an unsupportable burden and that is why we need prudent planning.  Planning for future pension provision will have to be facilitated through successive governments and therefore a political consensus is necessary.</P>
        <P>The State pension must, in my view, form the basic pillar of any such system.  I am proud of the improvements in the State pension in the past ten years.  In 1997 the contributory old age pension was &euro;99.04 per week.  It was increased to &euro;147.30 by 2002 and is now &euro;209.30.  This represents a significant real increase, over and above the increase in the cost of living of more than 60% since 1997. <Col N="1320"/> It has more than kept pace with the increase in earnings, growing from 31% of average earnings in 2006 to 33% in 2007.  The Agreed Programme for Government commits to an increase in the basic State pension to at least &euro;300 per week by 2012.  This will bring the State pension to around 36% of average earning in 2012.  I believe we should see this as a staging post on the way to reaching a target of 40% of average earnings within the lifetime of the next Government.  Furthermore, I would like to see a national commitment towards  maintaining at least this level into the future.</P>
        <P>Nothing has worked to alleviate poverty among older people quite like the pension increases.  That is why it is so important that we commit to linking the pension to the average industrial wage, thereby continuing the significant reduction in the poverty rate among older persons, and hopefully eliminating it ultimately.  This would provide all who qualify with a guaranteed level of State pension that would provide the basis from which they could plan additional provision.  I am aware that the Green Paper raises concerns about the sustainability of the State pension even at existing levels of provision.  However, I believe it is essential that we provide for a reasonable level of basic provision linked to average earnings.</P>
        <P>If the State pension is to be increased to, say, 40% of average earnings, then serious consideration must be given to reforms that will make this sustainable, including increasing the share of the population in work, and raising the retirement age.  With increasing health and longevity, an increasing number of people will in any event want to work longer, and we must put in place measures that encourage and facilitate this trend.  In this regard, I urge that the earliest possible implementation of the commitments in the programme for Government to increase the State pension in respect of every year that a person over 66 delays taking it and to extend the amount those in receipt of the State non-contributory pension are allowed to earn without affecting their pension entitlement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On supplementary provision, there are significant and ample tax incentives available to those on higher incomes to provide for their retirement.  In any event, these people usually have sufficient incomes to enable them to make additional provision without undue hardship.  I favour the continuation of tax relief for pension contributions but support strongly the measures introduced by the Minister for Finance in the last two Finance Acts to eliminate potential abuse.  They should be an incentive for a reasonable level of pension provision, but only for a reasonable level.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the current system of tax incentives does not appear particularly attractive or user-friendly for low and middle income earners.  It was for that reason the Progressive Democrats, in its election manifesto, proposed an SSIA-type scheme for those earning up to twice the average industrial wage to encourage them <Col N="1321"/>to make personal pension provisions.  Under our proposal, instead of offering tax reliefs, the State would add &euro;1 to a pension fund for every &euro;2 contributed by the individual.  The rules for contribution limits would be broadly similar to those applying to PRSAs at present.</P>
        <P>We witnessed an extraordinary and massive uptake of SSIAs by people of all levels of income and this was for a scheme that offered a return of one additional euro for every &euro;4 contributed.  Furthermore, we have seen that people have, to a large extent, continued to save at the same level and not splurged their savings, as some more excitable commentators predicted.  Our proposal of offering &euro;1 for every &euro;2 contributed is warranted in the case of pension funds because people are making a longer-term commitment than was the case with SSIAs.  It also represents a significant improvement on the relief for those in the standard tax band.  This relief is available to those on more modest incomes but it is not encouraging people to provide for their pensions as we would like.</P>
        <P>In many instances people on modest incomes are also inhibited from contributing to a pension scheme by the high level of charges levied by the fund managers.  As in the case of the SSIA scheme, there should be maximum charges specified for providers of funds.  I am pleased that the programme for Government commits the Government to develop, in consultation with the social partners, proposals &ldquo;to provide an SSIA type scheme in an effort to make supplementary pension provision more attractive to those on low incomes&rdquo;.  I recognise that there are many variants to the scheme other than those we in the Progressive Democrats have proposed and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s proposals arising from the consultation process.  Our scheme would be more attractive to individuals on modest incomes and obviate the need for a mandatory scheme, which could be regarded as a tax and would be fraught with difficulty.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to address the broad issue of pension regulation today but one matter in this area raised by constituents should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It arises where people in the workplace have a defined contribution scheme rather than a defined benefit scheme, which is increasingly the case.  In the case of defined contribution schemes, the pensioner, upon retirement, can take a lump sum equal to 25% of the value of the fund but must use the rest of the fund to purchase an annuity.  Annuity rates have fallen considerably in recent years and many pensioners feel they are getting a very raw deal.  They also point out that PRSA holders do not have to take out an annuity but can opt for other arrangements.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there are pros and cons in respect of requiring the purchase of an annuity, but I believe people deserve to have a wider range of choices than they have at present.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to <Col N="1322"/>extending such choice to individuals in defined contribution schemes at an early date.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Green Paper and congratulate those who prepared it on the comprehensive manner in which it lays out the issues.  The challenge we face on pensions is a problem of success in that it results from people living longer and healthier lives.  Our recent economic success provides us with the opportunity to address it effectively.  We must grasp this opportunity, learn from the experience of others and forge a national strategy that will ensure this and future generations will have the resources to enjoy a secure and productive retirement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this motion.  As my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Malley, said, this is an issue of great importance for the nation.  The provision of an adequate and sustainable pension system is of great importance not only to current and future pensioners but also to the future prosperity of the country.  If our generation, living at a time of considerable prosperity and benefiting from a historically high ratio of workers to pensioners, does not address this issue properly, it will place an unsustainable burden on workers in the future and endanger national prosperity.  While the Green Paper does not give all the answers, it sets out the issues fairly and indicates the range of options to address them in a satisfactory manner.</P>
        <P>I believe strongly that an adequate and sustainable State pension is the essential foundation upon which any system must be based.  The Progressive Democrats has always been at the forefront in seeking to improve the State pension.  It was the first party to advocate a pension of &pound;100 per week in the mid-1990s when others said it was unaffordable.  In Government, we achieved it.  We then advocated a pension of &euro;200 per week and this was more than achieved by 2007.  In the previous general election we committed to a pension of &euro;300 per week by 2012 and I am delighted that this has been included in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that the Government faces tight prospects in the forthcoming budget, I urge the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance to give priority to giving a significant increase to pensioners on 5 December to make more apparent our determination to reach and, if possible, exceed the &euro;300 target in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
        <P>Another important issue concerning the State pension affects the status of women who left the labour force for various reasons prior to 1994 when the homemaker scheme was introduced.  Those of us who canvassed in the previous general election will have met many such women, many of whom are now widows, who were effectively forced out of work either by formal or informal marriage bars.  They rightly resent the fact that their pension entitlement, if they have any at all, is dependent on the contributions of their husband.</P><Col N="1323"/>
        <P>In our election manifesto we committed to amending the homemaker scheme to ensure the aforementioned women would be entitled to a contributory pension.  While this is not addressed specifically in the programme for Government, I welcome the commitment it contains to remove anomalies identified in the pension system and ensure women are treated fairly by way of pension provision.  If any group of women deserves to have this anomaly removed, it is the women in question.  Such reform will cost money but, unlike many initiatives in the pensions area, the cost will decline over time.  This is because it only applies to people who left the workforce prior to 1994.  In any event, an increasing number of women stay in or leave and return to the labour force nowadays and thus qualify for a contributory pension in any event.</P>
        <P>I would strongly support further increases in the State pension as a proportion of average earnings after 2012 to bring it to approximately 40% of earnings.  I recognise that if this is to be sustainable over time in light of changing demographic trends, we will all probably have to work longer.  Most people today would be more than prepared to do so but every effort needs to be made to provide an environment that makes it possible.  I therefore welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to allow people to benefit from PRSI contributions made after they reach 65.</P>
        <P>However, initiatives must go beyond Government.  Employers must be prepared to offer more flexible working conditions to workers at or approaching what is now regarded as retirement age.  As we confront our changing demographics, the concept of a retirement age will become increasingly irrelevant.  I therefore refuse to regard the change in the age structure of our population as a burden.  We are living longer and healthier lives.  In October 2006, Dr. Garret FitzGerald described this nation&rsquo;s rapid increase in life expectancy from 1999 to 2005 as a &ldquo;remarkable phenomenon&rdquo;.  Ireland had the lowest life expectancy of the 15 EU member states in the early 1990s.  By 1996, it still had the third lowest life expectancy but by 2005, it had the sixth highest.  Our workforce is increasingly healthy, educated and adaptable.  We have proven ourselves capable of dealing with massive social change.</P>
        <P>An adequate, sustainable and flexible pension system is an essential component in making a successful transition to this new demographic reality.  The Green Paper gives us the tools with which to address the challenge of designing such a system.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am pleased to meet the Minister for the first time and thank him for taking the time to come to the House.  Senator Cannon noted that in the agreed programme for Government, the Government promised to increase the basic State pension by around 50% to at least &euro;300 per week by 2012 while reducing the rate of PRSI from 4%to 2%.</P>
        <P>A recent report proved that by 2010, PRSI contributions will not be enough to pay for welfare benefits.  This means that the social insurance fund will move into huge deficits.  The current surplus of &euro;2 billion will be gone by 2010 and by 2016 we will have reached a deficit of &euro;12 billion in today&rsquo;s money.  According to recent poverty figures, almost one in five pensioners is at risk of poverty.  The other day I met an 80 year old man who retired on a pension that was not index linked.  His pension at the age of 80 is the same as it was 15 years ago.  How can we talk about the pensions of the future while standing over the failure to index link the pensions of the elderly today?  I know this is mentioned in the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>We are putting away money to provide for the pensioners of the future when the pensioners of today are the people who gave us the Celtic Tiger.  It is these people who are in poverty and it should also be noted that the majority of pensioners are dependent on social welfare.  The number of people over 65 is expected to increase by 60% over the next 14 years.  That people are living longer, healthy and full lives is to be welcomed.  However, it means that the number of pensioners at risk of poverty will rise significantly.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the pensioner support ratio, which is the number of people of working age compared with the number of people over 65, will fall from six in 2006 to two in 2061.  In addition, Ireland has the lowest State pension expenditure <Col N="1325"/>as a percentage of gross domestic product among EU members.</P>
        <P>Given these facts, how does the Government realistically expect to provide pensions in the future?  How does it expect to deliver on its promises to increase State pensions, a move we also want, and reduce PRSI?  Fianna F&aacute;il has been in Government for ten years and this Green Paper is its first attempt to provide adequate pension coverage.  Senators O&rsquo;Malley and Cannon commend the Government&rsquo;s publication of this Green Paper but it has taken ten years, which is a very long time.  The Government promised this Green Paper seven months ago.  I acknowledge the work of the former Senator, Sheila Terry, who worked on this issue for a significant period and put forward many constructive proposals in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>Pensions should be dealt with by one Department.  It could be argued that there should be one Minister with complete responsibility for pensions, perhaps the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  As it stands, the regulatory body for life assurance companies and pension funds is in the hands of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Pensions Board regulates occupational pension schemes, while the Department of Finance controls the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the SSIA scheme.  The latter scheme, to which Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred, would, if slightly modified, make an excellent pension vehicle.</P>
        <P>Only one third or 32% of pensioners have an occupational pension.  Around one half of pensioners get 80% or more of their income from social welfare.  Half of those currently working hard and paying taxes to the Government expect their main retirement income source to come from occupational or personal pensions.  The other half of the working population is not part of any occupational or personal scheme.  This means they expect the State to provide their full income after retirement.</P>
        <P>A total of 27.5% of people under the age of 25 have a pension.  It is crucial that the views of young people in their 20s and 30s are heard in this debate as they will be most affected by these policy changes.  I consulted the National Youth Council of Ireland when researching for this debate and it was made very clear to me that young people recognise that there is a long-term need for a greater uptake of private pensions by young Irish workers.  The Government should encourage young people to take out pensions as soon as they start work.</P>
        <P>In light of this, it is essential the Government takes a role in changing people&rsquo;s views on pensions.  It needs to take a lead role in encouraging people to plan ahead, find other sources of income after retirement and not depend solely on the State pension because this Government will not be able to provide it.</P>
        <P>It is important the Government looks at the distribution of tax benefits for private pensions and considers ways to better target tax incentives <Col N="1326"/>at lower and middle income earners, drawing from experience with the successful SSIA initiative.  I call on the Government to rise to this challenge.  We must ensure the consultation process set out in the Green Paper is concluded by the deadline of mid-May 2008 and eventually leads to positive legislation</P>
        <P>A pension is a property right which is protected under our Constitution.  It is a breach of an individual&rsquo;s constitutional rights to force him or her into a pension which ultimately turns out to be more or less worthless.  Some people continue to be forced into such schemes as a condition of their employment. Will the Pensions Board continue to stand over current circumstances in which a person does not have a choice to opt out of a pension, even where an employer seeks to make it a condition of an employee&rsquo;s contract?</P>
        <P>The Green Paper on pensions represents a comprehensive examination of the challenges and options facing Ireland in ensuring all our people have adequate pension coverage, and I welcome it.  Given that one half of the working population does not have any personal or occupational pension scheme and few have the security of a defined benefit scheme, it is vital that major steps are taken in the coming years to improve pensions.  I ask the Minister to honour the promise to increase the basic State pension to &euro;300, provide for it in the upcoming budget, remove the anomalies identified in the pension scheme in respect of farmers and ensure women are treated fairly in pension provision, especially those affected by the marriage bar, as Senator Cannon noted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his elevation.  This debate is timely and opportune.  In many people&rsquo;s eyes, the time for debate is over and it is now time for action.  I commend Senators O&rsquo;Malley and Cannon on tabling this motion.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the Green Paper.  I suppose it is a case of better late than never.  Like the bus, it is better to have it than not to have it.  This Private Members&rsquo; motion is being played out in every private house across the country and ignites a debate about provision of a comprehensive pension scheme.  Members are aware of the fear of growing old and not having adequate cover to survive the last few years of life.  The Green Paper represents a detailed diagnosis of the current situation and of the challenges we face, as Senator McFadden stated.  It gives us options.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley that we need to plan for future provision of pensions.  There is consensus on all sides of the House on that matter, provided it is done thoroughly and fairly.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley also referred to increases in pensions in successive budgets.  It is correct that it was increased for citizens whose toil and labour gave rise to the Celtic tiger.  She neglected to mention that the cost of living has risen in tandem with the old age pension.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1327"/>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point that the pension increases were far above that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  We all aspire to the &euro;300 figure by 2012 and that this be a staging post.  That is the consensus on this side of the House.  We need to alleviate poverty.  There is a growing differential between people in society at present.  On Monday night I knocked on doors in Cork South-Central.  An elderly woman opened the door in her coat, jumper, scarf and gloves because she was afraid to put on the heating.  That is the reality, not an invented story.  Her money is gone before it comes in.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s suggestion of an SSIA-type scheme for pensions.  Let us have a detailed proposal on that.  We need to engage people in a debate.  Successive advertising campaigns have been run but we need a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon referred to women forced to leave the workforce.  This constitutes an anomaly that must be rectified.  Ireland has an ageing population.  How does the Government propose to provide adequate pension cover for its citizens given that the Green Paper does not give us a way forward?  Perhaps the Minister could respond to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>Then it would not be a Green Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost half the women in our workforce of 2 million do not have personal pensions.  Only 43% of the private sector have personal pensions and this must be rectified.  Will a one-for-one pension scheme, espoused by the Members opposite during the general election campaign, be introduced for those on low incomes?  Will this result from the Green Paper or must we wait for it until after the tax cut commitments are delivered?  Senator McFadden referred to the fact that one in five elderly people is at risk of poverty and that EU data show that, among member states, Ireland has the second highest rate of risk of poverty for those aged 65 or over.  That is a sad indictment.  The number of these people will increase by 60% over the next 14 years and we must have a scheme to cope with this.</P>
        <P>According to some independent commentators, PRSI contributions may not be sufficient to pay for social welfare benefits in three years&rsquo; time.  The Minister may disagree with this but how does he expect to deliver on the promise to increase the State pension and reduce the rate of employee PRSI to 2%?</P><Col N="1328"/>
        <P>We need action on pensions.  It is almost 12 months since the Pensions Board proposed a mandatory system.  The Green Paper has been published.  At the launch the T&aacute;naiste stated that we face &ldquo;a difficult challenge in ensuring the financial and economic sustainability of our pension system as the task of financing increased spending on pensions falls to a diminishing share of the population&rdquo;.  That presents a challenge and it behoves us to ensure people do not live in poverty and that our elderly and those who have contributed to society are treated well at their most vulnerable time.  The proposed amendment recognises this and I ask the House to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first opportunity to welcome the current Minister in this Administration and to wish him well in his portfolio.  I thank my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats for tabling this motion on what will be one of the most important issues in the future.  I wish to comment on some of the issues I have come across in the Green Paper, even though Deputy Olwyn Enright&rsquo;s reaction was that there was nothing in the Green Paper.  Senator Buttimer, who has just left the Chamber, commented that the Green Paper has no concrete proposals.  The Minister intervened to explain that the nature of a Green Paper is to inspire reaction and suggestions.  It is a mature admission by Government that this is such a problem that, after 2012, if still calculated as a proportion of incomes, pensions will be in unsustainable territory.  It requires all of our ideas and innovation to come up with a strategy that can best address this issue.</P>
        <P>By 2021 the population of those over 65 will have increased by 59% and by 142% by 2061.  The worker to pensioner ratio, currently 6:1, will be 1:1.  This is frightening when one considers its implications.  I hope all sections of society will buy into the process and allocate thought time to their views on planning and tackling the issue.  One of the greatest challenges is that working class people, or less well-off people, are those on whom we must focus because they are least likely to be in a position to provide for their future.  We must be most innovative in this regard.</P>
        <P>Research by the Irish Association of Pension Funds suggests that 86% of those without a pension in the services sector would start one if the Government contributed &euro;1 for every &euro;1 saved.  That is not sustainable.  It also stated that 91% of those with pensions said they would increase their contributions.  Again, we are not dealing with those who are already making pension contributions but rather with those who are not doing so.  I refer in this regard to younger members of the population who must be told to make provision for the future.</P>
        <P>When one is 18 to 21 years one may well be a student.  For those between the ages of 21 to 26, the emphasis may be more on taking a year out to travel to Australia, buying a first car or whatever.  It is alien in the extreme to young people <Col N="1329"/>to consider providing for their futures by way of making pension contributions.  We must focus on ways to encourage these individuals to make such contributions.  Perhaps we could do so via a scheme under which it might be possible, if the scheme was successful, to withdraw an amount of money every five years &mdash; until one reaches 45 &mdash; in order to make key purchases.  People might be of the opinion that they could reap benefits from such a scheme.</P>
        <P>I first paid into a pension scheme from the age of 21.  I thought I was being exceptionally prudent.  However, I reached a period in my mid-20s where, when buying a car or whatever, I realised that I would not see the benefit of the money I was putting away until I reach the age of 65.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>That age is beginning to draw near.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is drawing nearer in any event.  Many of my friends, none of whom was contributing to pension schemes, laughed at me and stated that it was my tough luck.  Perhaps I will eventually have the last laugh.  These are some of the reasons the people who will be most vulnerable when the time comes have not bought into the process.</P>
        <P>In discussions on the Green Paper, perhaps we could consider the introduction of SSIA-type schemes.  It is interesting, however, that the pension-incentive tax credit scheme &mdash; which post-dated the payment of SSIAs &mdash; attracted only 1% of people.  That is significant.</P>
        <P>As already stated, this is one of the biggest challenges we face.  The population is getting older.  There are positives in that Ireland currently has the lowest number of people over the age of 65 among EU member states.  That gives us time and creates a window of opportunity to allow us to be proactive and tackle this matter in the most effective way.</P>
        <P>This issue is non-political and cross-party in nature.  While we may kick many a political football around this and the Lower House and beat up one another in respect of all sorts of issues, it is my opinion that there would be broad agreement on this matter.  There also would be broad agreement that this is a good news story.  The Green Paper is good and we look forward to having an input into the debate on it.  I hope that solid actions will eventually result from the publication of the White Paper that will follow this one.</P>
        <P>The publication of a Green Paper is likely to be regarded as one of the most important events in a Government&rsquo;s term of office.  Such a document is deserving of the closest scrutiny.  The future direction of policy in this area is obviously vital to the long-term health of the economy.  Any decisions we take on foot of the publication of this paper will have profound and long-term consequences.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to be overly repetitive and everyone recognises the importance of this matter.  In <Col N="1330"/>my opinion, significant innovation will be required to allow us to arrive at an optimum solution.  I will be preparing a submission, which, I hope, will help in some way.  I also hope that everybody prepares a submission.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to focus our efforts on encouraging those people who are of the opinion that, at this stage, pensions are not remotely relevant to them to buy into making contributions.  We should be innovative and develop a system under which people could, at key stages of their lives up to a maximum age of 45, reap the benefits of pension funds that are performing well.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming before the House.  I again thank my colleagues from the Progressive Democrats for using their Private Members&rsquo; time to table this most important of motions, which I obviously support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and I wish him well in his new role.  I am also pleased that Senators O&rsquo;Malley and Cannon tabled the motion because, as Senator MacSharry stated, Green Papers must be discussed.  This is exactly the forum at which the debate on them should take place.</P>
        <P>One of the options examined in the Green Paper is the question of introducing some form of compulsory pension system.  I hope this option will be considered carefully because, realistically, it is the only option that will deliver what we want and need in this area.  Sooner or later, we will accept that compulsory pensions are inevitable.  It is very much in our interest that this should happen sooner rather than later.  I accept, however, that this is a difficult nettle to grasp.</P>
        <P>The truth is that too few people want to make voluntary provision for their pensions.  When one is young and at the beginning of one&rsquo;s career, one fools oneself into believing one will always be young and healthy.  Looking ahead to what will be our financial position nearly half a century hence requires more foresight than most young people in their 20s possess.  As someone pointed out to me recently, many people expect to win the lottery at least once in 50 years.  If one is 20 years old, one will assume that one will win the lottery before one reaches 70.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons people do not start to make provision for their pensions at the start of their working lives.</P>
        <P>Most people only start to consider providing for a pension, if at all, when they get married.  By that time, they are older and providing for a pension is more expensive.  Moreover, this is a period in their lives when they must cope with many additional calls on their incomes.  The result is that a shockingly small percentage of our population approach pensionable age having made a proper provision for their declining years.</P>
        <P>Given that, as individuals, we are reluctant to face up to the consequences of this challenge, as a society we have no option but to take collective action.  All Governments have a responsibility not only to serve the voters of today but also to protect the interests of the next generation and the <Col N="1331"/>generation beyond it.  If this necessitates making unpopular but correct decisions, so be it.  No one ever said that government involved making only the easy decisions.</P>
        <P>The only way out of the problem we face in respect of pensions is to make it compulsory for everyone at work to contribute to his or her pension.  While one could argue that we do this already through the PRSI mechanism &mdash; providing for pensions was the original purpose of the scheme &mdash; we must face up to the fact that the sums simply do not add up in that respect.  If people are to have decent pensions to provide for them in retirement, they must pay out more than they do at present.  If they expect a future Government to play fairy godmother to them, they are only fooling themselves.</P>
        <P>By now we have had more than enough experience of the voluntary approach to know that it simply does not work to the extent required.  Only a tiny minority of the population has proper pension provision.  I forecast that the position will not change for as long as we continue to consider pension provision to be a voluntary matter.  I say this in the knowledge that a large number of people involved in business are frightened at the thought of that.  They say that if we are to maintain competitiveness in this country we must be extremely careful in the context of how we monitor our costs.  People in business recognise that something must be done and that it is the Government&rsquo;s duty to take action.  The Green Paper gives us the opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
        <P>There is nothing outlandish in the idea that pension provision should be compulsory.  Several countries already operate schemes of this kind, all of them with, as far as I am aware, conspicuous success.  Finland, Germany, Singapore and Switzerland operate compulsory pension schemes and Australia is, I understand, phasing in a new scheme.  I am not pushing an idea that has not been tried before.  On the contrary, compulsory pensions work and a number of countries already have them.</P>
        <P>One of the great benefits of the compulsory approach is that people start providing for their pensions from their first day at work.  In other words, they start paying in to their pension at precisely the best time for them to do so.  By putting aside money for their pension throughout their working careers, individuals make it possible to get a decent pension at a reasonable cost, which is not the case if they leave the matter until they are in their 30s or 40s.  In the past when I suggested to an employee aged between 19 and 25 years that he or she should set money aside for his or her pension, I discovered that he or she did not regard this as a major concern and it was not high on his or her list of priorities.  Young people setting up home and having children are tempted to put off providing for retirement because they face additional costs at that time.  One day we will <Col N="1332"/>have to face up to it and the sooner we do so the better it will be.</P>
        <P>The case was made to me on the difficulties caused by defined contributions as opposed to defined benefits.  We cannot argue with this.  We live in a world where it will be defined contributions and not defined benefits and we must recognise this.  The State has its own headaches with this but we have managed to convince our citizens to recognise that their pensions will be based on what they contribute and not on defined benefits.  We face a challenge.  I am pleased this motion was tabled this evening.  I am pleased the Green Paper provides us with the opportunity to debate it.  This should be the start of a debate in which the Minister will take an interest.  I am confident he will not allow this to be put on the long finger and will act on it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the tabling of this motion this evening.  It is stark in its simplicity.  I am more than a little surprised that an amendment to it has been tabled.  I would have thought everyone in the House would have welcomed the publication of a Green Paper and the consultation process accompanying it.  It is clear we must prepare for the future.  Policies are in place which are beginning to address this matter and we need a national debate to define how we make the journey from now.</P>
        <P>Much was said about the future demographic difficulties.  I prefer to be more positive in this regard.  In European terms, we remain a young country and during recent years we have had immigration to our country.  Both of these factors mean our dependency ratio is much better than more established European countries such as Germany and Italy.  That said, we must provide for future pensions and how we go about it will determine the livelihoods of those, including ourselves, who will be older in future years.</P>
        <P>We need to have a debate on having either State or private pensions or the best combination of both.  In recent years, we struggled with getting this balance right.  On the State pension side, major progress has been made from the old &pound;100 to &euro;200 to the projected &euro;300 and beyond.  We are fast catching up with the rates of pension provision found in other countries and keeping in line with 30% of average income, which is a policy objective as a result of the partnership agreement.  We also fail to factor in to the State pension the ancillary benefits which accrue such as free travel, electricity, gas and television licences.  When these are factored in, we come closer again.  That said, issues of equity must still be tackled and I hope the consultation process will address these.</P>
        <P>The issues of women having separate social insurance records and being obliged to leave the public service in the recent past were raised by other speakers.  These must be addressed through improvement of the non-contributory pension.  It must be acknowledged that steps were taken in most of the recent budgets to address this anom<Col N="1333"/>aly.  I look forward to it being addressed again in the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>The situation with regard to private pensions should be scrutinised carefully.  I take a more dubious view of the talk of impending meltdown in the pensions service which is informed by a vested interest in the private pension industry itself.  Those of us in the political process need to take due regard of the fact that our primary responsibility is to ensure the State pension is properly resourced now and in future.</P>
        <P>Previously I stated the support measures which exist to encourage private pension take-up are badly in need of examination.  Although it is the mainstay of current policy, I do not believe the use of tax relief is the most effective way of bringing it about.  That the State now forgoes more in tax than it pays in State pensions while supporting private pensions is not a statistic in which we can take pride.  It is useful that the Green Paper points out alternatives we can follow in addressing this anomaly.</P>
        <P>In opening the debate, Senator O&rsquo;Malley discussed the SSIA proposal.  My party made similar suggestions in the past and had such suggestions included in the Green Paper.  We should go towards the idea of a long-term savings plan where the benefit is targeted towards the lower paid.  The modification we can make to encourage future pension take-up is that the payback of such a special savings scheme should have higher amounts for people on lower incomes tapering down for people saving on higher amounts.  Accepting this principle could address the difficulties we saw in the past with the take up of the PRSA.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Minister is addressing this issue with sufficient gusto and is giving commitments that the consultation process will be advanced to a major extent by next July.  If we stick to this timetable, whether it is accompanied by a White Paper or promises of specific legislation, we can look forward to putting in place reforms of the pension system during the lifetime of this Government, a system which has gone unchanged for too long.  A generation of people need a reformed system put in place.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and congratulate the Progressive Democrats on tabling the motion.  I look forward to the House in its entirety accepting the motion which, in its stark simplicity, is a sufficient statement for the House to make without resorting to amendments.</P>

	<P>As spokesperson for older people I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate.  I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, to the House.  I greatly acknowledge the major contribution older people have made to our economic success and continued prosperity.  We have an ageing population which, I am glad to say, is living longer and in a healthier condition than was the case previously.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A number of years ago, when I was on the national executive of the Irish Nurses Organisation we profiled the ages of nurses as part of an assessment of the future needs of nursing.  It was not good because we discovered that more than two thirds were over 40 years old.  Through the census we will know what the future needs of society will be.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>I welcome this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  The Green Paper goes some distance towards meeting future pension requirements and will excite <Col N="1335"/>debate among many segments of the population, such as at meetings of the ICA and widows&rsquo; associations.  I concur with previous speakers who recounted how when we were canvassing we met people who were cold, wearing extra clothing and fearful of putting on heat.  They were worried about the cost of living meeting their needs.  The Mercer actuarial assessment of the social insurance fund, which was published last month, shows that current PRSI contributions &mdash; the money going into the social insurance fund &mdash; are running slightly ahead of expenditure and payments.  However, in just three years&rsquo; time a deficit will begin to emerge.  The Mercer report is based on the existing PRSI rates and the current entitlements in terms of payments.  It does not take into account the Government commitment to increase the pension to &euro;300 per week or the promise to cut PRSI contributions for employees and the self-employed.  The cost of the PRSI cuts promised would be &euro;645 million per year and the full cost of increasing the pension would be &euro;2.019 billion.  If both were to proceed, the social insurance would be plunged into insolvency, which might lead to increases in taxation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  The Green Paper is a step forward and I would like to think that in our term it will be progressive, forward thinking and positive.</P>

	<P>I thank the Members of the Seanad who have already spoken.  In particular I thank Senators O&rsquo;Malley and Cannon for tabling the motion.  It is important to have a robust and substantive debate on the issue.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is often a place to get leadership on such a debate.  Interestingly, some Senators, including Senator Quinn who has left the House, have taken an employers&rsquo; point of view.  I disagree with his analysis that defined benefits should be regarded as a thing of the past.  That is not my approach to the debate.  They are not a thing of the past in many other countries that have been highlighted in the House this evening as having a good pensions regime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It highlights the complexity, vested interests and different perspectives that will be reflected in the debate in coming months.  For that reason it was somewhat disappointing and missed the point of what the Seanad can achieve that an amendment to the motion was tabled.  The motion was sufficiently all embracing to allow the Seanad to give leadership by initiating this debate in an important public sense because of how the Seanad is viewed.  In recent weeks motions in the D&aacute;il have been accepted by the Government side because they were regarded as sufficiently all embracing for us as politicians to give the leadership that is required in a debate such as this.  I view the debate in the Seanad this evening in the same context.  Perhaps the Opposition will choose not to press the amendment because it misses the <Col N="1336"/>point of what this debate will be about in coming months.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Green Paper on pension policy marks another major step in the process of reviewing our pension system.  More importantly it marks the start of a major debate to decide how we, as a Government, and as a society, plan and secure the future of those currently in retirement and those of younger generations.  Pensions have been an important issue on the Government agenda for a number of years and we are proud of our achievements for older people.  In the past ten years there have been a number of major initiatives to ensure that our pensions system is sustainable in the future, that social welfare pensions offer a decent income to those who are already retired and that younger people make provision for their futures.</P>
        <P>We introduced the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2001 to pre-fund part of future pension liabilities.  At the end of June the fund was just more than &euro;21 billion and is continuing to grow.  Great credit is due to the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, for having taken this policy initiative.  While it does not resolve the future pensions issue, we all accept it will form part of the solution.</P>
        <P>We have increased social welfare pensions significantly &mdash; by 56% since 2001 which is higher than the rates of increase in both earnings and prices.  The rate is now in excess of 34% of gross average industrial earnings which was the target recommended in the national pensions policy initiative published by the Pensions Board in 1998.  We have promoted an increase in the number of people contributing to a private or occupational pension through the national pensions awareness campaign and the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts.  More than 1 million people now have a personal or occupational pension with about 120,000 of these contributing to a PRSA.  I am somewhat disappointed in this figure and we need to review its structure to encourage more people into the system.</P>
        <P>Despite these major improvements, there are serious concerns for the long-term future of our pension system.  Given our experience in the past ten years, it is entirely appropriate that we should now review our overall approach in order that we have in place a pension system which is sustainable in the long term and which will deliver an adequate retirement income to all retired people.</P>
        <P>While the focus in this area is often on the future, we must not forget that we also have a duty to ensure that today&rsquo;s older retired people also have an adequate income in their retirement.  The occupational pension system in this country is still relatively immature with only about one third of existing pensioners having an income from that source.  Accordingly, a large part of the existing retired population rely on social welfare pensions for the bulk of their income.  It is important that we maintain, and where possible, <Col N="1337"/>improve on the value of social welfare pensions.  The Government is committed to a pension of &euro;300 per week by 2012, and I will be seeking to make progress towards this target in the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>Let us be in no doubt that we face difficult challenges ahead.  People&rsquo;s working lives are now shorter and we are living longer in retirement.  At present men aged 65 can expect to live another 16 years and women 19 years, in round figures.  By 2036 this will have increased to 21 and 24 years, and to 22 and 26 years by 2061.  Those figures indicate to me that the men will never catch up with women in terms of longevity.  This translates into an increase of up to 40% over the period which will be reflected in pension costs, as the longer a pension is paid the more expensive it becomes.  While longer life expectancy is something to be welcomed and celebrated, it poses challenges for us in terms of the sustainability of our pensions system.</P>
        <P>While we have one of the youngest populations in the EU with approximately 11% over 65 years of age, this will change in the decades ahead when those aged 65 and over will more than double to 28% of the population.  In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to gradually decline from 62% to 51%.  In the decades ahead we will move from having almost six people of working age for every person of pension age to having fewer than two, a point well made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley.  Long before we reach that level, however, we will face the same challenges on pensions and other age related costs as many of our EU neighbours are facing at present.  However, as a country we are fortunate that we have time before these changes will impact and we must use that window of opportunity to get things right.  As we know major economies, such as the UK, Germany and France, are already in this difficult situation whereas at least we have a window of opportunity, albeit narrow, to get this right.</P>
        <P>We know that progress has been slow in ensuring that those in employment have an occupational or private pension.  The national pensions review target is to ensure that 70% of those aged over 30 in employment have such a pension.  While progress is being made towards this target, with 62% of the workforce participating in a pension scheme, the rate of improvement does not suggest we will reach our target within an acceptable timeframe, which should form part of how we consider pensions structure in the course of this debate.</P>
        <P>While improving pensions coverage is a priority, we also must be concerned about the quality of the arrangements already in place.  There are concerns that the level of contributions being made to some schemes is not adequate to ensure a decent pension at retirement.  Many defined contribution schemes were set up, and continue to operate, on the basis of quite a low level of contributions.  The Irish Association of Pensions Funds recently found that this is <Col N="1338"/>improving but, nevertheless, it is something which continues to cause concern.</P>
        <P>As has been highlighted in this debate, women continue to have a lower coverage rate than men, although the gap is narrowing.  Certain sectors of the economy such as hotels and restaurants, agriculture and retail continue to be extremely difficult to reach.  Despite the progress we are making there are still upwards of 1 million people who will rely exclusively on social welfare provision for their retirement incomes unless action is taken.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper addresses all of these challenges and puts forward a number of options for dealing with them.  Its preparation follows a period of increased activity in the development of pensions policy in which we have had the benefit of two major reports by the Pensions Board.  The Green Paper takes account of these reports but it examines the situation in a much broader way to deal with other issues, such as the operation of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes, together with a comprehensive look at issues pertaining to social welfare pensions.</P>
        <P>Another important input to the Green Paper was the actuarial review of the social insurance fund, which I also published recently and which sets out the position of the fund at end of 2005 and updates the previous review undertaken five years ago, particularly in light of the impact of recent policy and demographic changes.  This valuable work will contribute to the ongoing development of social insurance and pensions policy in Ireland.  The review complements the Green Paper by providing another important reference point from which the emerging challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s social security and pensions system can be assessed.</P>
        <P>Awareness of pensions issues is now extremely high.  The Government was pleased at the focus on pensions in the partnership talks on Towards 2016 and was happy to commit to the publication of the Green Paper.  We have a golden opportunity to hold a serious debate on the pensions system and its future structure to ensure that we meet the needs of those currently in retirement as well as future generations.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper sets out the key issues and challenges facing our pensions system for the future.  The major topics include the demographic challenge, sustainability of the pensions system, work flexibility in older age, the roles and relationships of social welfare, private occupational and public service pensions in the future, the role of tax incentives in the current system and their efficiency and effectiveness in supporting Government objectives in the area, the role of annuities and the operation of that market, the role of regulation, including the charges levied by pension providers, and pensioner incomes and the contribution various elements of the pension system, including the social welfare system, can make to the adequacy of this income.  The Green Paper includes a comprehensive review of social welfare pensions and the issues which are raised <Col N="1339"/>from time to time in representations and parliamentary questions, together with the implications of making provision for those affected.  In regard to the role of annuities and the operation of the market, Senators may be aware that a report on the annuity market was recently published by the Department of the Taoiseach in conjunction with the launch of the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>In terms of solutions the Green Paper puts forward a number of ideas for consideration.  I am open to other proposals because I do not believe the Green Paper has to be totally prescriptive.  This is a worldwide issue and new methods will probably emerge.  I see no reason why Ireland should not be part of any new and innovative approaches that emerge in the coming years.  I would like the Government, unions, employers and the pensions and financial markets to start collectively thinking outside the box because the challenge is to move away from simplistic vested interest positions.  By meeting that challenge, we have some chance of finding a path on which we can agree but we will otherwise have to go down the road of an imposed solution.  I would like to build consensus at least on the core issues.  Employers and employees have to consider the issue with a view to finding a solution which benefits the entire society so that everybody can win as we approach 2050.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The options set out in the Green Paper include maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, which with the wider coverage levels we have seen in recent years will bring some measure of improvement to this area; delivering improved adequacy through an enhanced social welfare pension; improving the incentives to encourage pension take up by using SSIA-type matching contributions instead of tax relief; introducing a mandatory supplementary pension system funded by employers, employees and the Exchequer to cover a certain level of earnings; and the use of soft mandatory approaches like the Kiwi save system introduced in New Zealand, where people are automatically enrolled in a pension scheme when they start work but are allowed to opt out.  The latter is a psychological way of approaching the issue because, as we know from human nature, people generally will not take the decision to opt out.  It is an interesting solution.</P>
        <P>In an EU context the pension challenge is being approached using a number of basic principles, including support for longer working lives and active aging, balancing contributions and benefits in an appropriate and socially fair manner and promoting the affordability and security of funded and private schemes.  In an Irish context some or all of these principles can be applied.</P>
        <P>Although the Green Paper sets out some ideas on an approach for the future, it would not be appropriate for me or the Government to champion any particular approach at this stage as this would focus the debate in one direction and diminish the consultation process which is being undertaken.  I stress that the purpose of the <Col N="1340"/>Green Paper is not to recommend any particular course of action but rather to set out clearly the current situation and the implications from an economic and social perspective of various courses of action.  However, we must be clear that good pension provision is expensive, whether it is done through personal contributions to private pension schemes or through the State by way of PRSI contributions or taxes.  The tension that exists between the two key challenges facing us in this area, namely, the provision of adequate retirement incomes and the cost of providing that system, is apparent in the Green Paper.  Pensions is one of the major issues the country must address and any decisions we take at this stage will impact on society for decades to come.</P>
        <P>Given the importance of the issue I am anxious to hear the views of as many people as possible on how they would like to see the system developed.  The Seanad has a great tradition of leading societal debates.  It is not a good idea at this stage to divide the House because doing so would send the wrong signal to the various stakeholders.  I have no doubt, however, that once we reach the point at which decisions must be made, people&rsquo;s perspectives will differ.  As politicians and leaders in this area, we need to be careful and that is why I commend Senator O&rsquo;Malley on the care she took in crafting her party&rsquo;s motion, which embraces the issues in a general way rather than begging an amendment.</P>
        <P>With the publication of the Green Paper, I have initiated a consultation process which I want to be as inclusive as possible.  Given the complex nature of the subject, I want to ensure people have ample time to consider the issues and formulate their ideas and comments.  The consultation process will remain open until mid-2008, an appropriate period given the nature of the issue.  This approach may pay dividends when it comes to developing our final proposals.</P>
        <P>It is important that we receive the views not only of representative organisations but also those of the public and I hope as many people as possible will take the time to contribute.  We accept submissions by way of e-mail, letter or fax.  Copies of the Green Paper are available from my Department or via the dedicated website, <i>www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie</i>, and submissions can also be made via that route.  I am pleased with the level of interest shown thus far by the public.  We have had in the order of 2,500 hits on our website since the site was launched.  The website also includes copies of the related documents mentioned earlier, the actuarial review of the social insurance fund and the study on the annuity market.  The public fora convened to discuss the issue have been well attended and people have been positive about the timeframe of six months for engagement in the debate.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the diverse views that exist on how the pensions system should develop and there is no doubt that building a consensus on any approach will not be easy.  However, in the interests of those who are already retired and of <Col N="1341"/>future generations of older people, it is a challenge to which the Government and I will have to respond.  I intend to meet the timelines I have set out.</P>
        <P>Next year will be an important milestone for pensions policy in Ireland.  As a society we need to consider and debate the type of retirement we want for our older people and how we might pay for it.  I am pleased we have embarked on that debate.  I hope that by this time next year we will have a clear vision, which will command broad acceptance, on how our pensions system should be developed for the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to make some points which might help to clarify one or two issues which arose in the debate.  The pensions system in Ireland comprises two main elements.  The first is the social welfare system and the second is voluntary supplementary pensions provided through the private sector.  The function of the social welfare element is to provide a basic income with the earnings related part of the pension provided by way of occupational and private pension provision.  The structure of the Irish system is unique in contrast with those in many other countries where the state system performs both functions, that is, basic income and earnings related pensions.</P>
        <P>Given the way our pensions system is organised, some surveys can provide a distorted picture of the economic position of our older people.  These often focus on the cash income provided through state pensions systems, as highlighted this evening, but in our case they make no allowance for the role of the private sector or the additional supports provided such as household benefits, medical cards, free telephone rental and free television licences.  All of these form part of it.  I am not trying to present it as the solution but when one looks at some of the comparisons made on a simple cash basis, one is really only looking at a snapshot of a pure cash payment.  That is not relative.  We should take everything into account.  I do not believe we should base our argument on the fact that somebody else gets this or that because, in most cases, we are not comparing like with like.  I hope we take a much more holistic approach to the debate.</P>
        <P>There is a very high level of home ownership in Ireland, especially among older people, which is not the case in many other countries.  That is not reflected in surveys.  This impacts on the disposable income levels available in retirement.  While such surveys are useful to compare aspects of the pensions systems across countries for the reasons outlined, they are not a true indication of the economic position of older people.  I say that not to be argumentative but so we can have a much rounder debate.</P>
        <P>Our State pensions system provides flat rate payments to older people.  Combined with the fact that the proportion of older people in the Irish population remains low when compared with EU countries &mdash; 11% against the EU average of more than 16.5% &mdash; this means that by international standards State spending on pen<Col N="1342"/>sions is low.  We are spending less because we have a smaller older population.  It is blindingly obvious why that figure is there.  Saying we are paying less is not making the full comparison.  Since we probably have the youngest population in Europe, of course we are paying less.</P>
        <P>These surveys make no allowance for the fact we have about &euro;2.5 billion, which the Green Paper highlights, in tax forgone by the State in terms of incentives to people to have private pensions.  The people involved in the Green Paper said the figure is approximately &euro;2.5 billion in tax which we, as a society, have forgone annually through incentives to allow people to get into private pensions.  That is also very much part of how the mix has come about in our pensions scheme.  I make those points which are important in the round.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion and hope to come back to the Seanad as this debate progresses and as issues become clearer in terms of the direction we may take.  I am sure Senators will have a very good input into that debate as we move forward.  I thank Senators for inviting me to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this very timely debate.  It is a bit of an old chestnut which comes up from time to time but nothing ever seems to happen.  We debate pensions every few years but there does not seem to be any dramatic movement.  We seem to say the same things and be somewhat impatient.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech because he has an understanding of, and perhaps even a sense of urgency about, this issue about which we should be almost alarmist at this stage.  It is not one which will particularly bother my generation but it will be very serious for the next generation if we do nothing about it.</P>
        <P>It is very difficult for politicians to tackle this problem because it involves issues which do not result in any immediate dividends for them.  They do not get votes out of it because they are looking after future generations.  They are, in effect, taking money from present generations, who are the voting population, to give to future generations, who probably are not.  It is a difficult issue.  Although there are flaws in it, I applaud the initiative taken by the previous Minister for Finance in setting up the National Pensions Reserve Fund under the auspices of the National Treasury Management Agency and in taking a percentage of gross national product out of the Exchequer to fund that.  That was a very courageous political move for which he and the Government at the time received no benefit.  It is the sort of foresight politicians should be encouraged to have even if they do not get immediate applause.</P>
        <P>There are two elements to this motion.  To some extent, the Minister concentrated on the first one, namely, the actuarial difficulties, the benefits between defined contributions and defined benefits and the way it will be approached because of the demographic problems we have.  I do not wish to address that specifically in the time I have but wish to say <Col N="1343"/>something about the pensions industry.  We should ask how and why we are in such difficulty.  We have a small older population and a very large younger one.  We face a real problem with pensions deficits not only in private sector bodies but in semi-State ones as well.  The Minister will be aware of that.  The ESB and many other bodies have serious problems which will have to be tackled.  Otherwise people will be left without pensions or with much lower pensions in the years to come.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to make broad sweeping statements about actuarial presumptions into the future and to make predictions, which actuaries do, about funding deficits which are accurate in as much as they can be, although they are based on certain assumptions.  In a debate of this nature, I suggest to the Minister that he look at the pensions industry in a different light, and I was in the financial world for many years, although I have been out of it for many years too.  It is a kind of honey pot for the financial world.  As the Minister knows, in the pensions industry vast sums &mdash; billions of euro &mdash; are being played with by people who supposedly know a great deal about investment.  It basically supports stockbrokers, bankers, lawyers, actuaries and fund managers.  They all have their greasy hands in this very large pot and are all taking an awful lot out of it.  At the end of the day, they are all doing very little for the pensioner.</P>
        <P>The most bogus profession in the world is fund management.  These people are entrusted with our pensions and charge vast sums of money for giving us advice on where we should put it.  They almost inevitably get it wrong.  It is quite staggering that any study of almost any group of pension funds over a period and the way they are managed will come up with the same result, namely, that it would have been far better if the original investments had been left alone and not meddled with by these particular experts.  This makes me wonder whether we should ask not so much about the actuarial predictions and the demographic changes which will take place but about who the hell these people are who have this money and what they are doing with it.</P>
        <P>Pension fund managers all charge approximately 1% for churning one&rsquo;s money around and producing pretty similar results.  This is particularly the case in Ireland and especially so among pension fund managers with household names.  They all charge the same amounts and over a long period there is no difference in their performances.  They are paid huge sums of money but once a benchmark is applied, it shows they have not done anything for the pensioner.</P>
        <P>I have studied this subject in some detail.  Most managers of pension funds benchmark themselves against each other, not against any index known to man, and they all come in together and very close to each other because they all invest in the same things.  This may be a slight use of a broad brush generalisation but they all invest in <Col N="1344"/>the same asset allocation and the same type of proportions in property, equities, gilts and cash.  They show similar annual rates of return over a long period and it does not matter very much which pension fund one chooses because the result will be the same.  The people who benefit most are the pension fund managers, the stockbrokers and the bankers whereas the pensioner will get very little.  There will be no bang for one&rsquo;s buck from these guys because this is a honey pot for them.  They do not have to do very much and the business is a mystery to the layman who thinks that these guys have some sort of magic which will increase his pension.  They are what is known in the industry as index huggers.  They put investors&rsquo; money into various leading shares in various leading indices and markets and they all achieve very similar results.  The result is partly the reason for the enormous pension fund deficits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about the Irish Pensions Board, not because it is a politically appointed board but because I query whether it does anything to regulate pensions.  When the Irish airline pilots bought Aer Lingus shares, they bought at a very heavy price.  It was patently obvious to everybody they were using their pension funds for strategic reasons in the battle for control of Aer Lingus and in the battle between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, and for other reasons.  It was quite obvious the shares were not being bought for investment purposes.  I cannot understand how the Pensions Board can stand behind pensioners&rsquo; money being used for strategic instead of investment purposes.  The trustees and others should have been down their necks about it.  The Pensions Board has failed the ordinary airline pensioner as a result.  I hope there will be no more cases of this nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  A debate on pensions is a perennial occurrence because we must all give thought to our pensions.  History records pensions as deferred consumption or deferred pay.  Even the Pharaohs of Egypt relied on Joseph to remind them that there would be seven good years followed by seven bad years.  The Pharaoh took Joseph&rsquo;s advice and provided for the seven bad years.</P>
        <P>In the same way a Government and a people must provide for pensions.  The Government has committed to providing a pension of &euro;300 per person per week by the end of its term.  It is a great credit to the Government that it met its objectives in the last term.  The House can have full confidence that it will meet its objectives in this term.</P>
        <P>I would welcome provision for a mandatory pension modelled on the New Zealand system which is known as a Kiwi save pension.  This seems to be a very sensible proposal.  I suggest the opt-out clause would only be available once a person has been paying for ten years because the first ten years are the most productive over a <Col N="1345"/>40-year contribution period.  I refer to the Government&rsquo;s great work in providing for the future through the National Treasury Management Agency.  The proceeds of the sale of Eircom amounted to &euro;5 billion and has now grown to &euro;16 billion, making all our futures more secure.</P>
        <P>The provision of adequate pensions is a critical national issue for the future of the people.  Pensions, whether provided through the social welfare system or through supplementary pensions, will have a significant impact on the quality of life of all.  While I am impressed by some of the advertisements for pensions which seem to indicate there is a place in the Caribbean waiting for me, Senator Ross has pointed out that I need not become too optimistic because such pensions are all the same, for which I thank him.  He has provided a dose of reality.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that pensions should now be an important issue on the national agenda.  Decisions about pensions are long-term decisions with a long lead-in before they become fully effective.  For companies which can afford it, a defined benefit pension is more beneficial as skilled workers will be attracted by such an option.  However, the number of those in defined contribution pension schemes continues to increase.  A total of 255,000 people were in such schemes at the end of 2006, with 95,000 PRSAs in existence.  The issue of increasing longevity, lower investment returns and investment risk affects these savers just as much as members of defined benefit schemes.  However, the effect of these issues will be borne solely by the individual and many will not become aware of the effect on their retirement savings until closer to their retirement.  It could also go the other way, with a number of years of strong growth in the market which would see those with defined contributions doing well.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the data provided by the national pensions review and other sources that the typical contribution to a defined contribution scheme, PRSA or retirement annuity contract will not be enough to maintain the contributor&rsquo;s standard of living in retirement.  We must be aware of the significance of pension adequacy.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for facilitating this debate on pensions.  It is projected that by mid-century there will be approximately 1.7 million people over 65, compared with 500,000 today.  From the point of view of funding pensions, it is projected that we will move from a ratio of six people of working age for every older person to a ratio of two to one by 2050 or 2060.  This is a reminder that foreign workers are providing for the people of this country and this should be taken into account when assessing their contribution.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper covers the background to the Irish pensions system and a broad range of issues relating to social welfare, occupational, personal and public service arrangements.  It sets out a number of questions which require responses from the pensions industry, social partners, the public and all individual stakeholders.  The demographic and sustainability challenges facing <Col N="1346"/>Ireland in the decades ahead are outlined and a number of scenarios and options are discussed.  These include measures to address the sustainability challenge, maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, universal provision, increasing social welfare pensions, SSIA-type tax incentives and mandatory approaches.  Other elements covered include annuities, the role of regulation and issues relating to work flexibility in older age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not the purpose of the Green Paper to recommend any particular course of action but rather to set out the challenges our pension system faces in the future and to seek views on a number of suggested ways in which we might proceed.  In that light, the Minster was correct to say it would be divisive to divide on this motion.  The purpose of the Green Paper is to promote the debate, discuss various issues involved and make proposals, possibly even on a consensual basis.  The Minister and the Government are determined to meet this challenge so that current and future generations will have in place a pension system that will deliver a secure and fulfilling retirement for all.  The work of the past ten years, which included increasing the old age pension to more than &euro;200 per week and making provision through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, is a credit to the Government parties concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Whenever Ministers want to give everyone a big hug so that we will all work together on an issue, one knows it must be incredibly difficult or the Government is afraid to deal with it because it does not want to take the blame for what is happening.  The only people guaranteed to be on a yacht in the Caribbean are the fund managers to whom Senator Ross referred and Ministers.  Last week, legislation was rushed through the House to ensure a former Minister will enjoy the perks of the Caribbean.  Sadly, the same speed has not been demonstrated by the Government in looking after a sizeable proportion of our people who do not have pensions or whose pensions are inadequate.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund is in place to cover the Government&rsquo;s liability on public sector and Civil Service pensions in the years to come.  A contribution of 1% of gross domestic product annually will reduce the cost of those pensions to future generations and it is good to plan for them now, otherwise the entire apparatus of State could collapse in 20 years if allowance is not made for this.  The pensions paid to civil and public servants, including Oireachtas Members, are defined benefits.  We are all guaranteed good pensions which will be index linked.  Private sector workers are affected by the shortfall in pension cover but they are paying our pensions now because the contribution from the NPRF to our pensions is paid by every private sector worker who receives nothing in return.  The people who will be in trouble in the future work in the private sector and are not making adequate pension provision.</P><Col N="1347"/>
        <P>The Green Paper is a little late in the day.  If the Government moved to look after private sector workers with the same speed it did when dealing with its own pensions, this debate would not be the subject of a lackadaisical stroll through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We are only having a discussion because the Government is not concerned about coming up with solutions.  Private sector workers will be in trouble unless they are given a benefit and looked after.  A total of 1 million people have no pension and we need something more than a Green Paper and a discussion lasting into 2008.  The State is a decade behind and nobody should believe the Exchequer is protected because only 11% of the population require a pension currently.</P>
        <P>A ratio of six workers per pensioner is bandied about and it is suggested that by 2030, when many of us will retire, that will reduce to two workers per pensioner.  However, 20% of the workforce is engaged by the public and Civil Service, which is higher than in other European countries.  Even though a smaller percentage of the population is aged over 65, a higher percentage of the workforce is employed in the public and Civil Service and they will receive defined pensions.  As a result, the cost of pensions will increase down the line and the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, recognised in 2003 that this would be a major burden on the State by 2025 unless something urgent was done.  This was also acknowledged by Opposition Members at the time but we do not believe there is time to stroll through the park on this issue.</P>
        <P>It is time to look after people in the private sector who do not have pensions and to ensure provision is made for them or mechanisms are put in place to protect them.  I have a private pension which I have paid into since 1999.  My contributions equal the monetary value of the pension and, therefore, I will gain nothing even after eight years.  A significant number of people face the same scenario but they are not stupid.  The Government should not talk to them about mandatory pensions.  Senator Hanafin typified the arrogance and ignorance of Government Members.  It is easy to lecture people about mandatory private pensions when one&rsquo;s own pension is so bloody well protected.</P>
        <P>When a worker is forced to invest his pension in a fund, however, he or she is subject to a 1.5% administration charge annually.  The reason PRSAs do not work is because they involve a 3% set up charge and a 1.5% administration charge on the entire fund annually and not only the profit.  Workers will not throw away their hard-earned money stupidly on the basis that somehow, somewhere somebody might make more money for them than they could make themselves.  That is why they invest in property or stocks and shares.  The reason the PRSA initiative did not work is the Government did not trust the people to make decisions on their own future.  The Government could begin to treat them like <Col N="1348"/>adults and give them the opportunity to invest in their future and make the decisions themselves without tying them into institutions with vested interests.</P>
        <P>The Opposition should not be lectured about agreeing with the Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats did nothing about this problem over the past decade and they will do nothing over the next three or four years.  Having published the Green Paper, they should show a little balls and publish proposals they might implement so that the Opposition can agree or disagree.  They should stop the silliness because our pensions are well protected and they are too good.  That is why we are forgetting what is happening to the rest of the workforce.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs lectured us earlier about agreeing with him but he will retire on a pension that is a multiple of the social welfare pension.  Members on the Government side should not boast about the increase in that pension to &euro;300 per week over the next five years.  The current pension of &euro;208 per week is a fraction of what the Minister&rsquo;s pension will be.  It is time for him to be serious about what he is doing and to bring forward proposals we can genuinely debate.  He should not try to hug the Opposition into agreeing with his proposals or mock us for causing the problem.  The problem is on the Government&rsquo;s desk and it is time to deal with it urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am an action woman.  Dr. Twomey has called for action on the issue of pensions.  I would like to achieve over the next two years the abolition of mandatory retirement at 65 years.  In my document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, I made 28 recommendations on which I would like action to improve the quality of life of older people in Ireland, the first two of which concern compulsory retirement at 65 years.  Mandatory retirement in the public sector for people who entered their posts before April 2004 is 65 years.  This age limit was fixed at a time life expectancy was 65 years.  In 2007 the retirement age of 65 is out of date.  I put a valiant effort into including this proposal in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto for the general election.  It took a considerable effort because it was not the sexiest item around, but I am pleased that in An Agreed Programme for Government 2007 the abolition of mandatory and phased retirement has been agreed.</P>
        <P>I would not like the Green Paper on pensions to introduce a measure whereby people would have to stay on in work until the age of 65 or 70.  There should be choice in terms of when a person retires.  A person should not be required to retire from his or her job when he or she reaches the age of 65.  New entrants to the public sector after April 2004 can continue to work after the age of 65.  Anybody who joined the Civil Service post-2004, therefore, can remain working for as long as he or she wishes.  There is no mandatory retirement in the private sector but a contract is drawn <Col N="1349"/>up for people starting out requiring them to retire at 60 or 65.</P>
        <P>As my colleagues who were Members with me in the previous Seanad are aware, the recommendations in my document are based on public meetings I held in this city over a period of two years.  People came to my meetings who were in desperation.  They told me they would have to retire in two years and were psychologically distressed, at 63, that they had to retire at the age of 65.  They did not want to retire.  Many women who attended my meetings told me that this was the second time they were being discriminated against.  I include myself in that category.  I had to give up my job when I married but I was fortunate in that I had a skill that I was able to use to earn an income.  Many women approaching the age of 65, however, had to give up their jobs in the Civil Service when they married and now they are being discriminated against for a second time.</P>
        <P>I want to outline four key reasons for abolishing the obligatory retirement ages.  As the population ages, people who continue in employment longer will remain financial contributors to the economy, something the OECD argues will be of significant benefit to the economy.  During the last session of the Seanad I attended a day conference in Paris on Ireland and pensions, and allowing people in this country to remain in their jobs was a key issue because of the pensions situation.</P>
        <P>The second reason is the availability of more experienced and senior staff to help people taking up jobs.  Why would a person be let go when he or she is coming into the peak of his or her experience and skill?</P>
        <P>I remind Members who were not in the House on the previous occasion that politicians do not have to retire at the age of 65.  The people who make the regulations for the people who work in the public and private sectors can continue working for as long as they wish.  Eamon de Valera was 76 and still working in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not say any more; I might agree with the Senator.  Boston College&rsquo;s research has shown that people who remain in employment past the determined age of 65 are healthier and happier as a result of their continued employment.  It is not just about money but the social interaction.  With modern medicine, nutrition and housing conditions people are flying, so to speak, at 65 and 70.</P>
        <P>Forced retirement is a clear example of ageist discrimination and a violation of the spirit of the European Union directive 2000/78 which clearly states that direct discrimination shall be deemed to occur when one person is treated less favourably than another.  It is ultimate discrimination if <Col N="1350"/>a person must retire because they are 65.  That is a regulation introduced when average life expectancy was 65.  It is about time we got rid of it.  I am on a mission to abolish it but there should not be any hint from the Pensions Board that people must stay on in work.  I am talking about giving people a choice similar to that given to married women.  If they wanted to stay in work, they could do so but if they wished to retire they could do that.  I am talking about choice to stay on in employment after the age of 65, not only for financial reasons but for intellectual and social reasons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Solidarity between generations is what this debate is all about and it is essential for our well-being as a society.  Eamon de Valera, who received some less than flattering comment in the last few minutes, had a vision of Ireland where he spoke of our firesides being forums for the wisdom of old age.  That vision has not just been undermined by the disappearance of firesides but also by the disappearance of that interaction between children, young people and older people.  That is a sad downside of modern living.</P>
        <P>We must have a visionary approach to the future in regard to the pensions debate.  We have had much discussion about it.  It seems the Green Paper does no more than restate discussions that have been taking place since the national pension policy initiative in 1996.  It is time for action and proposals and for politicians to start taking decisions.  It is easy to pursue the discussion when one is afraid of taking decisions at which people might baulk.  However, the fact is, as Senator Quinn said, we need to examine mandatory provision of pensions.  We need to examine employers making a generous contribution to that.  We also need to give leeway to young people to give them a few years in the workforce before such mandatory pension provision would kick in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for this opportunity to record my view and that of my party on this matter.  We disagree with this motion because we believe the Government is not serious about tackling the issue of pensions.  It hopes the individual will provide for his or her own pension, saving the State from dealing with this crisis.  It is just another example of an abdication of responsibility from this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration.</P>
        <P>The truth can be seen in the Government&rsquo;s plan to cut the rates of PRSI &mdash; a pre-election promise &mdash; which contribute directly to the fund from which State pensions are sourced at a time when we are bombarded with information about <Col N="1351"/>the pension crisis.  Members will note that the Government has failed to seize the opportunity to increase the rate of revenue going into the social insurance fund by eradicating the ceiling on PRSI over certain income levels.  The current system sees those in the lower end of the payscale pay disproportionately more into the fund.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are proposals and I agree with the previous speakers that there is a time when the talking must end and the action must begin.  We want to see a basic non-means tested pension for all people above a certain age, a second tier of pensions related to social insurance contribution, reform of the PRSI system by removing the employee PRSI ceiling, insisting that the defined benefit schemes are fully retained and a significant curtailment of the tax incentives for occupational pensions.</P>

	<P>There was a recognition that the purpose of the Green Paper is to highlight and prepare for a White Paper that will outline policy.  As the Minister said in his speech, it is at that point that some opposition might be expected.  I made the point that this is an issue which is going to be dealt with by successive Governments.  It is not partisan.  As a political establishment, I would have thought we would be united on what confronts the country.  We are required to look, and this is good planning.</P>
        <P>That is why I was amused to hear Senator Twomey say the Government had done nothing for ten years and then quote the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, who made changes in 2003.  Senator Ross mentioned that he got no credit for doing it, as no politician ever will for tackling the pensions issue.  That may be part of the reason there is no tendency towards long-term planning.

	<P>I am raising this matter to draw attention to the need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the exact position on cancer care services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  We have all heard the serious announcements of the Health Service Executive over recent days.  Some 660 women have attended the hospital to have various tests but unfortunately 26 required further medical care.  What is the timeframe of the HSE for <Col N="1354"/>implementing the changes to services at the hospital?  Excellent care was given to all women in the hospital down through the years by Dr. McGill and his staff.</P>
        <P>In the HSE statement we are told that the delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome, irrespective of geography.  The decision of the HSE in respect of the designation of four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The statement concludes by saying that the HSE plans to have completed about 80% to 90% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by the end of 2009.  I want to hear the Minister of State say in plain English that those women attending the hospital under the care of Dr. McGill will continue to have their care attended to.  Must all new patients go to the Mater Hospital in the future?</P>
        <P>The Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar is the only hospital on the road from Dublin to Sligo, a distance in excess of 100 miles.  It has a staff of almost 700 and 220 beds, increasing to 270 beds with stage 1 of phase 2B early in the new year.  It is a serious hospital that provides magnificent services.  Like the Cathaoirleach, who was chairman of the health board, I was a former member of the Midland Health Board for more <Col N="1355"/>than 18 years and we know the dedicated staff who work in the Midland Regional Hospital.  There is nothing more important to us than the completion of stage 2 of phase 2B.  I understand that all the various designs have been agreed, the Department of Health and Children and the hospital have recommended that the project proceeds and that value for money considerations have been assessed and completed.</P>
        <P>It has been a serious disappointment to everyone in the midlands, particularly women in the midlands counties of Westmeath and Longford, because we serve Longford and Westmeath on a two-county basis.  It is an extremely important health facility for the area.  Looking forward, those of us in Longford and Westmeath must press on the Minister of State the importance of allowing the cancer care unit to continue until all the facilities and access in the Mater Hospital are in place and stage 2 of phase 2B is given the go ahead as soon as the builder vacates the site at the end of the year.  Today was a watershed in Mullingar because I understand that the first nurses entered the first phase 2B, stage 1 of the great work taking place there.</P>
        <P>I will give the last minute of my time to Senator McFadden who wishes to join with me in this regard this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful to Senator Cassidy for his generous allocation of time.  My concern is that the centre of excellence in the Mater Hospital has not been set up.  Last Friday, the Minister took it upon herself with one fell swoop to cease the delivery of services at the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.  </P>
        <P>As Senator Cassidy said, Dr. McGill provided an excellent service and I cannot see why this service cannot continue.  It could be an outreach centre where women can undergo mammograms which would be read by the preferred option of a pathologist, surgeon and radiologist in Dublin.  I believe this should happen and that women should not be discommoded and forced to travel over 100 miles to Dublin.  A very good friend of mine found herself in this situation and had to leave Athlone at 5 a.m. to travel for chemotherapy.  I cannot see why this service could not be delivered on a local outreach basis.</P>
        <P>I am concerned because the centre of excellence has not been established in the Mater Hospital and no transport arrangements have been made for the women in question to travel to that hospital.  I received an e-mail from the Health Service Executive which said that people without cars could avail of transport if they had a medical card or they could see the community welfare officer.  That is an insult to these women, who are suffering and vulnerable, and I ask the Minister of State to look again at the situation until the proper transport services are put in place and the centre of excellence has been established in the Mater Hospital.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Cassidy for raising this issue on the Adjournment and for his contribution.  I also thank Senator McFadden for her contribution.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children who is unable to be with us this evening.</P>
        <P>However, I welcome the opportunity to set out the current position in respect of the reorganisation of cancer services nationally, with particular reference to the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar.  Arising from the designation of eight cancer centres nationally and to comply with the national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease, the Health Service Executive announced last week that within the coming weeks, breast cancer services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar will be transferred to the Mater Hospital in Dublin.  GPs will be fully informed about the new arrangements and will be in a position to refer new patients appropriately.</P>
        <P>A total of 26 breast cancer procedures were carried out at the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar in 2005.  The HSE has advised the Department that the hospital currently has two consultant radiologists with specialist training in breast disease who work closely together to ensure high quality imaging services.  The radiologists work with the consultant surgeon who also has a specialist interest in breast care.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the consultant surgeon is due to retire very shortly and it would have been deemed inappropriate to recruit a new surgeon with the planned implementation of the national cancer control programme and the transfer of services to the eight designated cancer centres.  The HSE has also confirmed that although no new breast cancer patients will be seen at the hospital, appointments for mammograms already arranged will be honoured and returning patients to the consultant surgeon will continue to be seen until their treatment is completed.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the patient services officer in the Mater Hospital and hospital management at the Midland Regional Hospital are in discussions concerning the planning of an orderly transfer of patients from that hospital to the Mater Hospital, including transport arrangements, where required.  I take the point raised about transport and will highlight this with the Minister and the HSE.  Both sides are in discussions and will also refer to transport arrangements.  The HSE has assured women who have been receiving care in the Midland Regional Hospital that they should have no concerns regarding this service and has emphasised that this transfer is part of the move to the eight designated specialist breast centres.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE in respect of the four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE has designated St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital as the <Col N="1357"/>two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE Dublin mid-Leinster region, which includes the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the HSE has appointed Professor Tom Keane as national cancer control director to lead and manage the establishment of the national cancer control programme.  He is due to take up his post next week.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to cancer centres by the end of 2008 and 80% to 90% by the end of 2009.  The HSE has confirmed that services will not be transferred until appropriate capacity has been developed in the receiving centres.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards.  The developments outlined will ensure a comprehensive quality assured service is available to all patients with cancer nationally, including in the midlands region.</P>

    <Title>Decentralisation Programme. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the proposed decentralisation to Mallow of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I was once an employee of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I seek clarification for my former colleagues who want to know where they stand in respect of the decision, drawn up on the back of a packet of John Player Blue, to move them to Mallow.  Will the Minister proceed with this decision?  Staff are in limbo at present and need to know.</P>
        <P>Many problems relate to this decision.  Not one person has applied to be transferred and there is an issue regarding the transfer of pensions between the Civil Service and State bodies.  The organisation is already decentralised through the integration of regional offices and has offices throughout the country.  Management is not in favour of the programme of decentralisation as far as I know and has shown no willingness to proceed with it.  A number of staff will need to remain in Dublin owing to their need to be close to the airport, especially for publicity events.  A Dublin training centre is required and must be maintained.  It is likely that, in the near future, a Minister will decide it is crazy to have two tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, overlapping and this will render meaningless the decentralisation decision.</P>
        <P>If the decentralisation programme is proceeding, why have staff been moved from the Baggot Street office to the Amiens Street office this year if they are going to move again to Mallow?  Why <Col N="1358"/>are we spending taxpayers&rsquo; money on the refurbishment of Amiens Street and the maintenance of Baggot Street while this move is proposed?  How much is this costing? Why do we need offices in Amiens Street that will hold the staff in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s head office, when they will be moving to Mallow?  If the move to Mallow is still on the cards, why is so much money being spent?</P>
        <P>Has it anything to do with the fact that the chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the chairman of Irish Life, which owns the Baggot Street building, is the same person and that the 60-year lease on the Baggot Street building is a liability on the books of Irish Life?  Did this have an impact on the decision?</P>
        <P>I am being collegiate because I was a member of the staff of the body that preceded F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Bord F&aacute;ilte.  The staff have been through the mill, with an extraordinary amount of change in recent times.  Bord F&aacute;ilte created Tourism Ireland in 2001 and merged with CERT to form F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2003.  There were further merges with South East Tourism and North West Tourism in 2007.  A move within Dublin, bringing staff together before the planned move to Mallow, took place in 2007.  Staff do not know if they are coming or going.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The management in F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not believe in conversing with the staff and drove the workers to striking for two weeks earlier this year.  I was on the picket line.  It is unbelievable that F&aacute;ilte Ireland staff would strike and they would not need to unless things had become very bad.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been living in Tom Johnson House with the Labour Relations Commission in recent years on numerous matters.  It is ridiculous and no way to conduct one&rsquo;s business from the viewpoint of industrial relations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is still a lack of information with the regard to the move and I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter.  Management has stated that all future employees will have a stipulation in their contract that they will move to Mallow if employed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  This was tried in the case of F&Aacute;S moving to Birr and it did not work.  Why is the management doing this?  Workers want to know if it will be allowed to proceed.</P>
        <P>I have used the forum of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to generate some information for the workers on their future and to determine whether the move to Mallow is on the cards and, if so, what is the projected timeline.  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland staff have been through much over the years and deserve to know these answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is unable to be with us.  As the Members of the Seanad will be aware, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is one of three State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism designated for relocation under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme.  The announcement was made in the context of the 2004 budget, which identified the town of Mallow as the location for the transfer of F&aacute;ilte Ireland. <Col N="1359"/> However, unlike the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, which is scheduled to relocate to Killarney in the last quarter of 2008, F&aacute;ilte Ireland was not designated as an early mover by the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, that was appointed by the Government to oversee the decentralisation process.</P>
        <P>Even so, F&aacute;ilte Ireland prepared a decentralisation implementation plan in 2004, which was made available to all staff, and which it kept under review.  It is working on a reiteration of this plan and is pursuing the matter of the acquisition of a suitable site in Mallow with the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>Some 86 applications to transfer to Mallow with F&aacute;ilte Ireland have been received under the central applications facility.  Of this number, 74 are civil servants and 12 are public servants.  There are no internal applications.  The latest report from the DIG, chaired by Mr. Finbar Flood, concluded that the implementation arrangements for the decentralisation programme were generally progressing well, although it was concerned at the rate of progress in the State agencies.  The Government has accepted the recommendations in the latest DIG report and has reaffirmed its commitment to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme as provided in the programme for Government.  The Government has also noted that added impetus needs to be given by all Ministers to the implementation of the programme for respective Departments and State bodies.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance has acknowledged the remaining challenges identified by the DIG and has confirmed that his Department and the wider management of the public service will continue to work closely with staff representatives to seek appropriate solutions to address the concerns of the professional and technical staff employed in the State agencies while also ensuring the delivery of the Government programme.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked the chairmen of the agencies under the remit of his Department to renew the drive to make progress on the transfer under the decentralisation programme.  This includes the relocation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to Mallow, the Sports Council to Killarney and the Arts Council to Kilkenny.  It is expected that the Civil Service elements of the current programme will be substantially completed by the end of 2009.  The Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism is expected to have relocated to Killarney by the end of next year.  Killarney has proven to be a popular location and has been oversubscribed at most grade levels.  Already, 70 members of staff of the Department have transferred to temporary premises in Fossa, Killarney, in two phases.  The permanent accommodation for the new headquarters of Department is under construction on New Road, Killarney.  The building is expected to be ready for occupation by the last quarter of 2008.</P><Col N="1360"/>
        <P>The Government expects that significant progress in its decentralisation programme will be made by State bodies, including those under the aegis of the Department, during the lifetime of this Government.  The Minister has recently written to the chairmen of the three agencies, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, asking them to accord priority to the task of the transfer of their organisations.  He is aware that there are certain difficult issues to deal with but I know the Department of Finance is working to resolve issues such as the redeployment of staff in agencies who have not volunteered for transfer.  The Department&rsquo;s officials are available to assist the agencies in any way possible and are meeting representatives of the three agencies to discuss how best to make progress in respect of the relocation of the agencies to their designated locations.  Furthermore, the decentralisation implementation group has invited representatives of the Department to accompany the chief executive officers of the three agencies to a meeting to be held later this month to discuss the progress in respect of the decentralisation of the agencies.</P>

    <Title>Musical Education. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this important and evolving issue.  Recently there have been a number of reports on parents spending money on sending their children for mathematics grinds.  However, the success of this action has not been very positive.  I wish to extol the virtues of considering another approach which is not as effective if attempted from the age of 15 as it is from birth to six years.</P>
        <P>It has long been felt that music plays a pivotal role in the development of children.  As a musician, I am aware that performing music has an effect on social skills.  Music teaches discipline because one is obliged to practise, and appreciation of others, especially when one plays in a group.  It also leads to physical improvements such as those relating to hand-eye co-ordination and language development.  Rhythm is the basis of all music and rhythmic patterns are the basis of speech.  One need only consider the number of processes that are in train when a person sits down to play the piano and follow a score.  His or her hands, eyes and feet are all active at once and music is produced.</P>
        <P>Merely feeling that music is good for a child&rsquo;s developing brain has not been good enough to win the hearts of officials from the Departments of Finance and Education and Science.  It is for this reason that I raised this matter.  More information is emerging from research projects.  Images have been taken of professional musicians&rsquo; brain structures and this work has uncovered actual enlargement in the corpus callosum &mdash; the element that links the two hemispheres of the brain &mdash; and other specific anatomical phenomena relating to the auditory cortex, including increased volumes of grey matter.  The <Col N="1361"/>latter was something to which Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Hercule Poirot used to refer.  Music develops elements of the brain which, for example, support the development of reasoning.  Researchers have experimented on how this transcends into educational opportunities.</P>
        <P>Experiences from an early age determine which brain cells will connect with other brain cells and which ones will die.  Music training generates the neural connections used for abstract reasoning.  By exposing children as young as possible, but preferably before the age of seven, to music, it develops their ability to understand and solve mathematical and scientific concepts, thus reaping long-term benefits for their future studies.</P>
        <P>Neurological research has been extensive over the last decade in linking music to the development of the left hemisphere of the brain.  According to Dr. Rauscher and Dr. Shaw of the universities of Wisconsin and California, respectively, music involves ratios, regularity and patterns, all of which parallel mathematical concepts.  I could go into the details of a number of studies but I do not have enough time to do so.  I will say, however, that in controlled situations, young children exposed to piano tuition realised that if they had 16 beats of music, they then had four sets of four beats.  Music, therefore, enables students to learn multiplication tables and mathematical formulae more easily.  They do not even realise they are learning in this way because it is part of the process of learning the piece.  Rhythm students learn the concept of fractions more easily.</P>
        <P>In the test carried out, students who learned rhythms were 100% more successful in fraction tests compared with those who had received no musical education.  The results of the study found that children who had received private piano and singing lessons had performed 34% higher on tests measuring spatial-temporal ability.  In a study carried out in Canada involving three to five year olds taking an academically appointed mathematical ability test which assessed concepts of relative magnitude, counting skills, calculation skills, knowledge of conventions and number facts, it was discovered that after six months the three year olds had higher test scores than four and five year olds who were not exposed to musical tuition.</P>
        <P>Many people have disputed much of this research, which is sometimes called the Mozart effect.  It is not specifically the Mozart effect but one of the greatest sceptics, along with Takako Fujioka, carried out a study in 2006 involving 12 children aged four to six.  In this study, half the children were taught Suzuki violin for one year and the other half were not.  Fujioka studied the brain activity of the children by measuring the magnetic fields in their brains.  Analysis showed that across all children, larger responses were seen to violin tones than to white noise.  This indicates that more brain resources were put into processing meaningful sounds.  Testing continued for the year and concluded that the time that it took <Col N="1362"/>for the brain to respond to the sounds decreased over the 12 months.  The latter means that as the children matured, the electrical conduction between neurons in their brains worked faster.  It concluded that the memory capacity of children engaged in musical training also improved when compared with that of those who received no such training.</P>
        <P>The older children get without exercising their musical aptitude, the more that will be lost and never regained.  The reason for this is neurological.  By the time a child reaches 11, the neuron circuits that permit perceptual and sensory discrimination, such as identifying pitch and rhythm, become closed off.  In my view, this is why people who try to learn languages in later life find it difficult to do so.</P>
        <P>Music will not suddenly turn all our children into masterminds.  However, if musical education were made accessible to all young children it would enhance their overall learning capabilities, especially as the developmental brain is open to the lessons that music alone can teach in respect of subjects other than mathematics. Third level institutions continually complain that not enough children are interested in science and research.  The research carried out proves that giving young children access to music will not only benefit their future but also ours because it might help form them into well-rounded individuals.  In addition, it might also produce a few musicians.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on this matter.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the importance of using teaching approaches designed to stimulate both sides of the brain and which meet the needs of children with different learning styles.  Music helps children to respond creatively, to express feelings and attitudes and to interact with others, as well as inculcating an appreciation of beauty and art.  It supports the development of communication, co-ordination, numeracy, creative skills, social skills, team work and leadership skills as well as promoting children&rsquo;s self-esteem and an enjoyment of learning.  It is also an important vehicle for personal enrichment and cultural expression.  Further, it creates awareness and respect for other cultures.  I am aware of the research which shows that exposure to music at an early age can result in improvement in general cognitive skills.  I am also aware of its role in promoting long and short-term memory and spatial reasoning.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is finalising a national framework to support early learning among children from birth to six years.  This work highlights the role of music as part of the physical and creative development of the child.  The framework is aimed at early learning provided in cr&egrave;ches, early childhood education settings, infant classes in primary schools and by parents in the home.</P><Col N="1363"/>
        <P>Music is a core part of the arts curriculum in all primary schools and comprises listening, responding, performing and composing activities.  In infant classes, songs, nursery rhymes, clapping, movement and singing games and activities are important in language development and literacy as well as in promoting co-ordination, rhythm, self-esteem, self-expression and creativity.  Music is also a recommended part of language development in infant classes.  Listening and responding to stories, rhymes, poems and songs forms part of the curriculum in the infant classes.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that a revised primary curriculum in music, supported by a national programme of in-service training for teachers, was introduced in 2005.  In May of that year the Minister for Education and Science announced a national tin whistles for teachers initiative.  The latter is supported by IRMA and the Corrs in collaboration with the primary curriculum support service.  Under this initiative, free tin whistles were made available to all teachers to support the implementation of the revised syllabus in music.  In addition, an intensive first notes programme offered to teachers through the network of education centres has attracted high levels of participation.  This investment is supplemented through a series of summer programmes in the arts in disadvantaged schools and a music initiative<b> </b>under which schools in disadvantaged areas are given once-off funds to purchase or replace musical instruments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At post-primary level, music is an optional subject offered at ordinary and higher levels in the junior and leaving certificate programmes, and the curriculum continues the themes of performing, composing and listening skills, the development of music literacy and aural perception and the regular practice of vocal and or instrumental music.  The leaving certificate syllabus allows students to specialise in the component of the course best suited to their needs and abilities, and the broad range of performance options has increased accessibility to the subject, allowing for students from diverse music backgrounds to participate.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, the equivalent of 93 whole-time teaching posts are allocated to a range of vocational education committees to support music education.  This takes the form of indi<Col N="1364"/>vidual tuition in instrumental and vocal music education and the provision of supports for choirs, orchestras and ensembles.  Through this, approximately 68,000 hours of music tuition are provided annually.  The Department of Education and Science also funds two pilot programmes in the City of Dublin and County Donegal VECs which promote music education partnerships along the lines recommended in the music network report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department also provides for substantial levels of investment in music education at further and higher level.  Overall, significant resources are invested in the provision of music education.  Of necessity, the demands on the system require that we prioritise the actions to support the curriculum in schools.  The Department is working closely with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to explore how best a synergy can be promoted within school activity and the work of other agencies and how best our combined investment can be used to optimum effect.  In this context, the artists in schools guidelines issued to schools are an important resource in informing schools of how best to plan, implement and evaluate partnerships with local artists and organisations which will provide stimulating and interesting learning experiences for children.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.  Will he continue to monitor this issue?  It is fundamental not to the creation of the musicians of the future but to the overall development of our young people.  Given that the Minister mentioned the funding by the Department of Education and Science of the two pilot programmes in Donegal and Dublin, will he examine both programmes and consider mainstreaming and expanding them nationally?  Recently, I met the City of Dublin VEC group and it has a good pack which it wants to distribute to the entire country.  This links into the in-service training required for primary schools which the Minister of State mentioned.  I do not want to use the term &ldquo;idiot-proof&rdquo; but mainstreaming and supporting the idiot-proof pack for people who are not musically inclined which exists under the pilot programme will give impetus to the good work mentioned by the Minister of State in his response.</P>
