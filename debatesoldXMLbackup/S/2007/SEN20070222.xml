	<P>I have notice from Senator O&rsquo;Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Recognising the fact that a married person who works for his or her spouse who is a sole trader is designated as a class M or a class K worker, the need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in the context of equity, fairness and equality, to give a rational explanation why this is not invidious discrimination and why such people should be deprived of social benefits, including maternity benefit, disability benefit and State contributory pension.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify whether he is aware of the major historical importance of Brownshill Dolmen, Hacketstown Road, Carlow, and whether he has any plans to improve the facilities for visitors at the site.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator White of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to rectify the current unfair situation regarding retirement in the public sector, by extending to all serving public sector employees the entitlement to work beyond 65 years of age, which is currently applicable only to public sector employees who joined after 1 April 2004, and to remove the exemption contained in the Employment Equality Act 1998 that allows employers to set retirement ages in employment contracts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator<?oasys _jy ?>Cummins of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide adequate resources to allow the City of Waterford Vocational Education <Col N="470"/>Committee to continue its programme for adult and community education in Waterford.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Browne and White and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator<?oasys _jy ?>Cummins may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 15 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, which concerns the amending and extending of the Diseases of Animals Acts 1966 to 2001, and the enhancement of the Minister&rsquo;s ability to deal with all animal disease situations and with criminal activity in regard to animal health, is being referred without debate to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food for consideration; No. 2, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 12 p.m.; and No. 3, the Control of Exports Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 12 p.m. until 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes each, and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The clear impression was given last night that all Stages of the emergency legislation before the House had to be passed by 12 midnight.  It subsequently transpired that was not the case and that more time could have been given because the President only had to sign the legislation before 9 a.m. this morning, not 12 midnight.  I wish to register my protest and that of my colleagues at the way the Government dealt with this issue.  A total of nine minutes was given to Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to debate that emergency legislation, but we could have had more time.  It is very important that in the course of questions and answers during the limited time, Senator Bradford elicited crucial information from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is entitled to make his protest but that was yesterday&rsquo;s business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That was then, this is now.  However, the current situation has a major impact on the health insurance market.  The effect of last night&rsquo;s legislation will be the end of competition in the health care market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We face a serious situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="471"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I point out that the Bill has been passed.  We cannot discuss yesterday&rsquo;s business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a current matter.  I do not seek a debate with the Cathaoirleach but if he wants one, I will have one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be no debate.  The Chair will rule and we must remain on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the House usually does not follow this behaviour.  She is opposed to the guillotine and has never employed it.  She was forced by the Government to introduce <i>la guillotine</i> in the House.  We did not have time to do our job.  We were told that the Bill had to be passed by midnight.  That was false information and someone must take responsibility.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Government address that issue?  It was for this reason that my colleagues and I opposed the amendment to the Order of Business last night &mdash; as a protest at how this House is treated.</P>

	<P>What about the Labour Party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill has a major impact on the current situation and the future for workers in County Cork and the 500,000 subscribers to BUPA Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In my 20 years as a Senator the Leader&rsquo;s office has never worked so efficiently as it does now.  Anything I say is no criticism of the Leader.  We normally receive notification of changes to the Order of Business but did not receive any such notification yesterday.  An Independent Member was present when the announcement was made in the House but understood that an e-mail would be sent to inform us of the change.  The Leader was under the same pressure as everyone else.  I checked my e-mail at 8.30 p.m. and there was no notification.  Consequently, some Independent Members were not present.  I would have supported the Bill but the issue concerns Independent Members making a contribution, about which we are diligent.  I regret that we did not have formal notification of the change to the Order of Business.  It was an embarrassment to Independent Members.</P>
        <P>Senators Ulick Burke and Quinn raised the report on teacher education during the week.  We need a debate on this.  It was a cheap, nasty trick by the Minister to deflect attention from an issue that was causing pressure.  This is a vulnerable group of young teachers who are left without a voice to speak for them.  I reassure the House that it may have trust and confidence in those young students because this was not a random selection, nor was the survey carried out using normal sur<Col N="472"/>vey rules.  It was a group of 140 selected by college authorities to fulfil a remit from the Department of Education and Science.  No blame attaches to them and we cannot make a judgment based on this.  We need a debate so that people understand that after graduation students spend a year under the control of the inspectorate in order to develop.  The Leader and I have had many rows wearing different hats but we fought face to face without placing blame on vulnerable people who had no voice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received two photographs yesterday of road signposts in County Galway.  These show the bilingual names of places such as Spiddal -An Spid&eacute;al and Carraroe-An Cheathr&uacute; Rua in County Galway.  The Minister is so quick and eager to put the boot into people in Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is but has a different set of rules in his own constituency.  It is appalling.  The position of people in Dingle has been articulated in a plebiscite and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government supports them.  The Government should deal with this in fair way.  It is quite invidious discrimination against Dingle.  It is wrong and should be corrected.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My understanding is that there is a well established procedure where a Member inadvertently misleads the House.  The person explains the mistake and the House accepts it.  The Bill was not passed until the House voted for it at 12.05 a.m. because there was no certainty until that point.  Either the legislation passed last night was invalid because it was passed after midnight or the Leader inadvertently misled the House.  Perhaps someone misled the Leader and she was put in an invidious position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is up to the Leader to clarify that is the rule in this House.  I do not suggest she did so deliberately but if I mislead the House inadvertently, it is my duty, out of respect to the House, to explain the mistake and apologise.  We can then move on and recognise that people make mistakes.  We need to know which of the two scenarios is correct.  This is a serious matter and if the Leader does not explain it, I will make a formal complaint to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about the House being misled, which is my prerogative and my intention.</P>
        <P>If we return to normal business, we should consider the state of the people of Palestine.  They are shuffled into compromise after compromise but then told that it is not enough.  The Palestinian people have suffered too much and have been punished for making a democratic choice and for not accepting a settlement imposed on them.  They were punished again this <Col N="473"/>week after coming to a compromise in which Hamas <i>de facto</i> recognised Israel.  Hamas is prepared to call a ceasefire and grant <i>de facto</i> recognition to Israel, yet the Palestinian people are told this is not enough.  In the history of humanity there has not been a more cruel decision by the world community than the one imposed on the Palestinian people.  I invite the Leader to arrange a debate on it after she clarifies the issue of the House being misled last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have suggested a debate on the Middle East.  I raised this in light of the recent visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Middle East.  It would be useful for the House to be updated on the situation.  Senator Ryan and I agree on the basics but as a result of the Saudi Arabian initiative last week, which brought Fatah and Hamas together for the purpose of forming a unity government, the Quartet met yesterday.  The Quartet represents what I believe to be world opinion and includes representation from the United Nations, Russia, the United States and all those among whom there would be a divergence of opinion on the way forward in the Middle East.  It is slightly disingenuous to suggest that world opinion is out of step with Hamas and its view regarding its forming a unity government.  There is, however, a lack of clarity regarding the way forward in the Middle East.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Ryan that serious, genuine and sincere attempts are being made by all sides in Palestine to stop the bloodshed.  Ultimately, it is the Palestinian people who are suffering as a result of the political vacuum that has been created.  It would, therefore, be important and timely for the Leader to request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs come to the House in order that he might outline the Government&rsquo;s position on this matter and that Members on all sides might have an opportunity to comment.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to a recent request I made regarding a debate on immigration.  A report, which emanated from the Commission on Immigration and Cohesion, was published yesterday by the UK authorities.  It points out that the most fundamental requirement relating to people who enter the UK and who wish to live there is that they should learn the language.  We should consider the report in question and take on board what it has to say.  Events in Britain provide a mirror image of what is happening here and the report focuses on the large-scale immigration that took place since the UK, Ireland and Sweden opened their borders to workers following the accession of new member states in 2004.  This is a serious issue for Irish society and we should focus on integration and policies attaching thereto.  It is time to engage in regular debates on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Rushing through legislation is always a matter about which we should be concerned, especially when such legislation is introduced by this jaded and fatigued Government.

	<P>Does Senator Bannon have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>While welcoming the mid-Shannon area tourism tax incentive scheme, which will bring valuable benefits to parts of the midlands, I am disappointed that all of County Longford was left out of the scheme.  The Minister for Finance, who has been very parochial in his activities in the midlands in recent years, should come to the House to explain why County Longford, which is in proximity to the area in question and through which the River Shannon runs,  was left out of the scheme.  People in the midlands are very disappointed about this development.</P>
        <P>The Minister is a parochial politician.  He moved the proposed gas pipeline away from County Longford and he has delayed the development of phase 2B of the development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader consider asking the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the report relating to the training of primary schoolteachers?  Many serious and unfounded allegations have been made.  For <Col N="476"/>example, Senator O&rsquo;Toole insinuated or stated &mdash; I am not sure which because I could not hear him very well &mdash; that the survey of 140 students was very selective.  I stand corrected if that is not the way in which the Senator presented the facts.  There appears to be a suggestion that the report was published for mischievous reasons or reasons not related to education.  I do not agree with this suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It was published for political reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be the first occasion on which that proved to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a necessity for a debate on the training of primary schoolteachers because, over a three-year period &mdash; between 2003 and 2006 &mdash; at college, I became aware that a significant minority of members of the student cohort were openly stating that they had no interest in or intention of teaching.  That was quite a disturbing development and it raises questions regarding aptitude, methods of interviewing and many other fundamental issues.</P>
        <P>Given the fact that primary schoolteaching is so much at the core of what the Celtic tiger economy is about and that we value primary schoolteachers so highly and the contribution they make, it is essential that we debate this matter.  In realistic terms, every profession has its good and bad performers and it would be naive to suggest that teachers &mdash; I was one myself &mdash; are an exception to that rule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My credentials regarding what occurred yesterday are reasonably beyond question because I took part in the various health debates.  I was dining last evening and, by accident, I happened to look at the monitor and saw that we were to be summoned back to the House at 10.55 p.m.  I asked various people if they knew the reason for this development but was informed that they had no idea.  I am the Whip of the Independent Group but I knew nothing about the change in yesterday&rsquo;s business and could not, therefore, inform other Members about the reason for it.</P>
        <P>This is a serious matter and we should consider what occurred.  We were informed that the reason for the late sitting was that the Attorney General had indicated that the Bill had to be passed by midnight.  It was not so passed and was not signed into law by the President until approximately 8.30 a.m. today.  Either the House was misled or the Attorney General gave the wrong advice.  We are entitled to know the exact position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Leader will recall that I specifically asked her on a number of occasions what the advice provided by the Attorney General was and why, in law, it was required to pass the Bill before midnight.  I received no answer but I know the Minister was prepared to remain in the House to allow <Col N="477"/>people to contribute.  As matters stand, not even all the spokespersons of the various groups made contributions.  However, I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach on this matter because he ensured that most of the groups had an opportunity to contribute.  We are all in his debt for intervening to ensure that even though we got only approximately 50 or 60 seconds, we could at least say something.  The Cathaoirleach maintained some shred of the dignity of the House by so doing.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are entitled to know the nature of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice.  I presume this advice was provided and that we were not misled further.  If it was given, what was the nature of it and was it wrong?  In my opinion, questions arise regarding the Attorney General&rsquo;s credibility in this matter.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On another matter, we should have another debate on the media.  We are currently discussing the Defamation Bill, which is a most interesting Bill.  The Minister has shown a degree of flexibility in response to pressure from this side of the House.  However, today we received disturbing news about the arrest of a journalist.  That is an extremely serious matter.  I am probably the only Member of the House who has criticised the Government for conceding to the press barons.  I am a member of the National Union of Journalists trade union.  Arresting journalists is a serious issue.  There must be an important reason for it.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I criticised a narrowness on the part of the some of the church authorities, having been provoked by Senator Mansergh.  Today, I pay tribute to the Roman Catholic hierarchy and ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the subject referred to by the hierarchy in its excellent pastoral, which was launched in the last few days, on the dangers of alcoholism.  There are very powerful lobbies involved.  It is clear that the Government is in the pockets of property speculators and pub owners.  The vintners are probably the most effective lobby in this area.  Society is being undermined.  Two bishops, including the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Martin, launched the church&rsquo;s campaign at the statue of Fr. Matthew in O&rsquo;Connell Street.  I believe we need another person like Fr. Matthew to lead a campaign against the consumption of drink.  Irish culture has been made synonymous with drink and that is an insult to the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of questions remain to be answered after last night.  During the debate the Minister admitted that the reason she was acting was a threat by VIVAS Health to pull out of the market and let the company be taken over.  She also admitted that the December court case forced her hand.  Why was this legislation not introduced in January?  Why wait two months?  The Minister also admitted meeting Sean Quinn <Col N="478"/>during the week.  This is all new information that was given in the course of the Seanad debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A Chathaoirligh, this is extremely relevant to the 400,000 customers and 350 employees, or former employees, of BUPA Ireland.  We are entitled to ask questions.  Last night I asked the Minister if there was a need for an independent financial analysis of VHI.  We hear rumours that it is in trouble.  It is time that was clarified.  The Minister has spoken about breaking up the VHI in the past but has not done so.  Why not?  Was the VHI on the verge of bankruptcy if the risk equalisation payments were not made?  If Sean Quinn decides to stay in the health insurance industry, the Minister, as a result of last night&rsquo;s action, has now guaranteed that he will have no new competition for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Last night the media reports constantly referred to the D&aacute;il meeting to discuss this issue.  We were here until after midnight and it is unfair of RTE and other broadcasters not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That was rectified this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.  They kept referring to the D&aacute;il and one would think the Seanad did not exist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should debate the issue raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Fitzgerald, the standards of teaching.  However, our attention should be focused on the teaching colleges and the relevance of their courses.  I have a B. Ed. degree but I was never taught how to fill in a roll book.  When we reflect on the course, I and many of my friends from college would question how relevant it was in preparing us to teach.  I spoke to the Minister last night about this.  Perhaps the Leader will arrange a debate on the issue, which should focus on the relevance of the course for preparing people to teach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a great deal of upset as a result of what happened last night.  The vote was carried by 26 Members on one side against a much smaller number on the other.  However, a substantial number of Senators were not informed that there would be a change to the Order of Business.  I and some other Members spoke in both health debates yesterday.  I left the House after listening to the Minister&rsquo;s speech at 5.50 p.m.  I was available to return for the debate but I was not informed.  I do not know why but I understand from Senator Norris that, as Whip, he was not informed but simply noticed what was happening.  He happened to be in the House.  Had I been in the House I might not have been informed either.  However, I was available to <Col N="479"/>attend, as was Senator O&rsquo;Toole and a number of others.</P>
        <P>So called &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; legislation is usually bad legislation.  Democracy is a delicate plant.  We have had our freedom under the Constitution since 1937 and we must be careful not to allow anything to interrupt that.  Last night elected Members of this House, who wished to vote and to participate, regardless of which way they wished to vote, should have been given the opportunity to do so, but were not.  There is a question as to whether this subverts our constitutional rights.  The Constitution provides that legislation should be debated and go through the various Stages in the House.  On the occasions when it is necessary to rush a Bill through the House, we should treat it carefully and delicately.  That did not happen last night.  I hope the comments made today will ensure that this never happens again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise the issue of teacher training, from the perspective of parents who are concerned about the report.  The report suggested that one third of teachers are leaving college and going into the education system without being suitably trained.  Senator Browne suggests that the debate should focus on teacher training.  We should have that debate, particularly on behalf of the students and the parents of young children who are now concerned that they are not getting the education they deserve owing to a fault on the part of those who are training the teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the content of a letter I received this morning from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern.  It informs me that the practice of stage payments in the purchase of houses in housing estates will officially end from 30 June next.  No new contracts after that date will permit it.  This is a voluntary code, of course, rather than a legislative provision.  Members of the House were unanimous about this practice, which is wholly one-sided and anti-consumer.  It puts a huge additional financial burden on people, particularly first-time buyers who can ill afford it.  However, I welcome this development.  Perhaps we can discuss it on another occasion.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised an important matter this morning, the different standards that are allowed to operate in Kerry and Galway with regard to road signage.  Unfortunately, visitors to the kingdom are being misled because of the road signage, whereas in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency visitors can read the road signs in a language familiar to most of them.  That discrimination must cease immediately.  I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who recently visited Kerry, will do something practical urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the report on education.  For some time I have <Col N="480"/>been disturbed that, as is the case with most professions, there are many instances of round pegs in square holes.  A number of teachers in the primary and secondary sectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier in the week the Senator said it was in every school in Ireland.  I look forward to him proving that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;are not up to the required standard and that is unfair to the children who go through their classes and do not get an education as a result.  It is also unfair to the teachers who do not have the necessary skills and are perhaps working under stress.  There should be a mechanism to allow them to leave a profession for which they are unsuited.</P>
        <P>There was a highly dangerous incident this week at a football match in Europe in which the safety of spectators was put at risk.  I hope appropriate security measures will be in place for the game in Croke Park on Saturday evening, especially to avoid a repeat of the English bringing armoured cars and machine guns, as they did on the last occasion they came to that place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to that, I hope we do not have a repeat of what happened last year on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  Irish citizens must behave with dignity, treat our guests respectfully and not go back to events in history.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Random breath tests and speed cameras are among the measures introduced to improve road safety.  I would like to believe these measures have led to a reduction in deaths on the roads.  An outstanding issue in terms of road safety is evident on our roads at night, especially in rural areas, where one observes that many pedestrians do not wear reflective gear.  The Minister should explain to the House whether there are proposals to make the wearing of such gear compulsory.  It is a dangerous practice to walk at night without any reflective apparatus.  An unfortunate motorist who knocks down a pedestrian is left wondering for life whether he or she should have done something differently.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about problems in regard to alcohol consumption.  A recent report indicates that consumption has reduced.  I hope this is a sign of a more mature attitude to alcohol.  I welcome the bishop&rsquo;s comments that we should ensure that consumption is further reduced.  The country would be better off for such a reduction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I speak in defence of schoolteachers in the wake of the critical report on the performance of new teachers.  This report is unfair.  These young teachers are straight out of college and they should be given time before undergoing this type of assessment.  As Senator Browne suggested, we must review teacher training practices, <Col N="481"/>with a particular emphasis on the practical component of training.  Theory is all very well but one must put that theory into practice.  An increased element of practical training, whereby young trainees would spend more time in classrooms, would be beneficial.</P>
        <P>We have experience in this regard in the training of nurses.  I have heard many older, experienced nurses say that young nurses trained by way of the new degree course and who do not spend as much time gaining practical experience on the ward are not equipped with the same abilities as their predecessors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not say this to be critical of nurses but to make the point that practical training is vital.  For several years now nurses&rsquo; training has involved greater emphasis on theory than practice.  A review of this situation may well conclude that practical experience is the best method of training.</P>
        <P>The system of promotion in schools is not of benefit in terms of encouraging young people to go into teaching.  It seems promotion is based on years of experience rather than ability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Terry refer to primary schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  I am not sure if this extends to secondary schools.  It is an unfair system.  Young people who enter teaching or any other profession want the opportunity to progress.  Their progress should not be stymied if they are entitled on the basis of ability to promotion.  This will discourage suitable candidates from entering or staying in teaching.  We need good teachers.  A general review of training practices must be carried out in teaching and nursing.</P>

	<P>My office was informed by the Government Chief Whip that emergency legislation would be introduced and that it could not be announced what it was about, only that it related to health.  I came to the House at 6.40 p.m. and announced that the Order of Business would be amended and the sitting suspended until 10.55 p.m.  A Bill put forward by an Independent Senator was being debated in the Chamber at that time.  This Bill was appreciated and welcomed by Members.  Senator Norris spoke effusively on Senator Henry&rsquo;s Bill while I was in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be clear on this.  I made the announcement in the House.  I did not say what the legislation was because I was not empowered to do so.  At that time, two Independent Senators were in the House, one of whom had brought forward a Bill which was widely accepted and one of whom spoke on that Bill, as did I.  The Official Report makes clear the times when Senator Norris and I spoke.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was asked by a Member last night why it was imperative to put through the legislation in this fashion.  She replied that this was the advice she received from the Attorney General.  She told me the same before she came into the Chamber, as did two of her officials.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>As a means of bringing this matter to an end, Senator Ryan suggested that the issue be dealt with at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We can then come to a conclusion and all Members can be reported to.  In fairness to the integrity of all Members who wished to contribute last night, we need at least a statement from the CPP about exactly what happened in respect of last night&rsquo;s debacle.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Let me be clear, I did not act unilaterally.  Obviously, I acted on the advice given to me and if there are 45 tribunals, that is what the answer will be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever.  There are enough tribunals.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan also raised the issue of Palestine, as did Senator Mooney, and called for a debate.  We simply do not have the time on the calendar.  The matter will be considered for the future.  Senator Mooney also mentioned the report on immigration and integration and I agree with him.  It is proceeding in too haphazard a fashion and without any coherence.  We should have a debate on the matter when possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bannon mentioned rushed legislation.  Neither the Cathaoirleach nor I would agree with <Col N="487"/>rushed legislation, and we always give time between Stages of Bills.  I learned from Senators Ryan and O&rsquo;Toole when I came into the House never to have Report Stage immediately after Committee Stage because amendments must be published.  We do not rush legislation but all Legislatures face times, such as we faced last night,  when there is a need to pass Bills quickly.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon also asked why County Longford was excluded from the recent tax incentive measures for tourism announced by the Minister for Finance.  Both County Longford and County Leitrim participated in the previous tax package for the Shannon region but this is a new package.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked for orderly debate so Senator Bannon must be orderly and respect the dignity of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that County Westmeath is participating fully in the scheme.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald, from his own knowledge, raised the report on teacher training and called for a full debate on the matter.  Perhaps the report has illustrated the need for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about what happened here last night but we shall not go back over that.  He also mentioned the Defamation Bill and raised the arrest yesterday of a journalist.  The Defamation Bill will be before the Seanad again next week so there will be an opportunity to discuss the matter then.  The Senator also mentioned the pastoral letter from the Catholic Church on the dangers of alcoholism and we should note that.</P>
        <P>Senator Browne called for an independent financial analysis of the VHI, saying that the Minister commented on it last night without elaborating any further.  He also mentioned the standards of teaching and the relevance of the curriculum in the teacher training colleges. I am sure that can be considered in the report and perhaps it needs to be considered.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn does not agree with quickie legislation, nor does anybody in this House.  I appreciate what he is saying because I do not like quickie legislation.  However, I recognise a major financial difficulty when it appears.  The point he made about teacher training and the parents is correct.  Even parents who did not have children in primary schools were worried about that report, which needs to be fully debated.</P>
        <P>Thankfully Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill has reached fruition in that he has heard from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.</P>

	<P>Senator Coghlan also asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to review the different standards of signage for Kerry and Galway.  Senator Jim Walsh also spoke about teacher training.  I expect a very full debate with widespread participation when the teacher training report is discussed here.  All those who spoke will need to attend.  Senator Feighan suggested that we should treat our guests respectfully when they come on Friday or Saturday.  I am sure many of them are here today.  He also spoke about random breath tests and suggested it should be mandatory for people walking on the side of the road to wear reflective gear, with which I agree.  Sometimes when driving I come across pedestrians wearing very dark clothes and I wish they had such reflective material.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Terry spoke in defence of teachers in general.  I understand promotions take place mostly on the basis of length of service.  There is nothing wrong with that.  However, the Senator feels it might not allow for an entrepreneurial young teacher to get his or her promotion.  She felt it should be on ability as opposed to on years of experience.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 22, to delete lines 14 and 15.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">A fundamental principle is involved here.  Section 15 will give the Minister extraordinary power to introduce provisions by regulation.  The section gives special powers enabling Ministers to make regulations to give effect to European Communities instruments relating to communications matters.  Transposing European legislation into Irish law is an extraordinarily serious issue.  The surreptitious way in which it was done by various Governments in the past is one of the reasons for the alienation of citizenry from the European project.  This section contains the most extraordinary proposal, which is the power for the Minister by order &ldquo;to provide for the offence to be also triable on indictment&rdquo;.  This is not primary legislation but secondary legislation which will sit in <Col N="490"/>the Oireachtas Library and is not required to be discussed in either House of the Oireachtas.  It can be annulled by either House but does not need to be discussed.  Subsection (6) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The maximum fine that may be provided for in regulations under this section shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(a) in respect of the conviction on indictment of a body corporate of an offence under the regulations, not be greater than&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) &euro;4,000,000, or</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister is taking on himself the power to write an order that does not need to be discussed in either House of the Oireachtas, which could result in a body corporate being fined &euro;4 million.  If the matter is dealt with in that way a person can be fined up to &euro;500,000.  If a person is fined &euro;500,000 and does not pay the option is for the person to end up in jail.  This introduces the most extraordinary rule by decree.</P>
        <P>I have a soft spot for Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, President of Venezuela.  When he claimed the power to rule by decree, half the western world exploded in anger.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is here claiming the power by decree without any obligation to consult the Oireachtas to introduce offences, which could cost an individual a fine of &euro;500,000.  This is dangerous stuff.  I do not expect to find myself in court because I break some European regulation.  However, this will allow European regulations to be introduced without Oireachtas debate and people will not know about them.  An individual could find himself or herself in breach of them and could be fined &euro;500,000 on indictment.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be permitted to introduce indictable offences.  I believe this is unconstitutional.  I know the Attorney General advised the Minister it was constitutional.  However, we know the type of advice the Attorney General gives &mdash; we witnessed it last night.  To introduce by decree indictable offences is unconstitutional and will be so ruled when some corporate body is summoned under these regulations.  It will appeal to the Supreme Court, which will rule that such provision should have been introduced by way of primary legislation.  I am saying this now because we could save ourselves considerable trouble by simply accepting the amendment to delete the subsection that allows the Minister &ldquo;to provide for the offence to be also triable on indictment&rdquo;.  This is pure laziness on the part of the Department, which is unwilling to go through the tedious process of having the nuisances on the backbenches of two Houses of the Oireachtas ask awkward questions.  It is much simpler to do it by decree.  It always has been the instinct of Departments to rule by decree and this is a classic example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment.  I support the amendment because it is a serious matter if <Col N="491"/>indictable offences are to be introduced through this kind of statutory instrument.  There is a palpable lack of democracy about it and Senator Ryan may well be right that a constitutional challenge might lie ahead.</P>
        <P>The advice of the Attorney General is not always infallible.  I pointed out this morning on the Order of Business that if he gave the kind of advice that he was purported to have given he was wrong and events have proved that he was wrong.  The advice that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claimed to have received from the Attorney General was described as &ldquo;guff&rdquo; by a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party last night in the other House.  That raises certain questions about the quality of the advice that the Government is receiving from the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Be that as it may, Senator Ryan&rsquo;s point that the practice of introducing indictable offences by ministerial instrument rather than as a result of full debate and legislation in these Houses is important.  It raises questions about the democratic basis of our institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment and comments.  We need to tread carefully on this issue.  I am surprised that it has come this far in the legislative process without ringing alarm bells in the Office of the Minister of State or that of the Attorney General.  We have an opportunity this morning to address this issue belatedly and should do so, rather than allow the courts to decide it, as will probably happen quite soon after the legislation is passed.  Let us deal with it now when it is obvious that this is not the way we want to or should do business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to accept this amendment.  In a fast-changing dynamic industry such as the electronic communications sector it is important to be able to legislate in a timely manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very handy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators raised the issue of delays in bringing forward primary legislation to give effect to the changes required for effective implementation in this sector on Second Stage.  The new powers proposed under section 46A will enable the Minister to implement any changes to the regulatory framework in a timely fashion and to provide for effective penalties for serious breaches of that framework.</P>
        <P>The framework was transposed in 2003 by regulations under the European Communities Act 1972 in order to meet the transposition deadline.  This framework is already under review and the EU commissioner will be bringing forward proposals for the change to that framework later this year.  Under this new power the Minister can implement any changes to the regulatory frame<Col N="492"/>work quickly and effectively to ensure that operators in the market comply with their obligations under the framework.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of fines.  The proposed fines are proportionate in the context of the industry to which they apply.  The major operators have a turnover of up to, and in excess of, &euro;1 billion and if the penalties are to have a deterrent effect they must be meaningful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I expected, the Minister of State did not even condescend to mention whether the Attorney General had at least advised that this was constitutional.  Maybe he did not so advise.  The Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel makes mistakes regularly.  I am tired of pointing out, and seeing Ministers have to accept, mistakes in legislation which obviously missed the eagle eye of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is unconstitutional.  The Minister of State is one of the nicest people in the Houses and I get on very well with him but the implications of what he has said are quite sinister.  He says that he wants to deal with these matters efficiently and the Houses of the Oireachtas get in the way so he will bypass them. That is exactly what he said: democracy is inefficient; therefore we will bypass democracy.  I may not be in the House by the time this comes to the Supreme Court but when it does it will be ruled unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>Ministers cannot be given the power to rule by decree.  In the past they have attempted to introduce major changes by decree.  It is no excuse to say that this is European legislation.  This country is gravely deficient in ways of dealing with such matters.  This means that the Minister can introduce fines of up to &euro;500,000 for individuals, leaving the corporate sector aside.  Individuals do not have turnovers of &euro;1 billion but they will pay large fines.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to spend any longer on this matter.  We have spent enough time fighting this morning.  The Government is wrong on this issue.  The advice is wrong and this is unconstitutional and will be so ruled when the Minister finally tries to punish somebody for outrageous behaviour.  The case will go all the way to the Supreme Court where the Government will lose and fall flat on its face, as has been the experience of ComReg repeatedly in dealing with the telecommunications sector.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should put this into primary legislation.  We will facilitate the Government if it is in a hurry.  When it was in a real hurry last night it was well able to drive legislation through the Houses in no time.  The reason for this provision is that scrutiny by the Oireachtas is a nuisance and a drag and every excuse is found to avoid it.</P>

	<P>If an individual uses a landline telephone and commits an act as I have listed, it is an offence.  If an individual sends an offensive or abusive text message or an electronic mail, it is not an offence.  The amendment proposes that the section deems an electronic mail or text message as having been sent by telephone.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister of State stated he did not intend to deal with this as it would be going outside the scope of the Bill.  That is not the case.  How could it be outside the scope of a broad-ranging Bill, dealing with offensive telecommunications, to claim certain forms of telecommunication message are offensive and prohibited by law?  Claiming it is outside the scope of the Bill is an excuse by the Minister for not dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister claims the law on harassment covers the point.  It does not.  Even though harassment is an offence, it is defined as requiring repeated misconduct.  This section does not require repeated misconduct but states, &ldquo;...any <Col N="495"/>person who sends by telephone any message that is grossly offensive, or is indecent, obscene or menacing&rdquo;.  It does not state &ldquo;many&rdquo;.  The rest of the section does not conform to the definition of harassment as repeated misconduct.  A once-off threatening message by e-mail, for instance, would not constitute harassment as the law stands.  The Minister of State referred to child pornography but this would be only a small part of offensive messages.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There is a considerable debate on the use of text messages for bullying and particular chat sites for frightening people.  This amendment proposes nothing more than to bring our legislation into line with how people communicate these days.

On copyright legislation, I demanded that computer-generated art be included until eventually it was.  The great fact about not being a lawyer is that one has to employ common sense in these matters.</P>
        <P>I do not know where the Minister of State got the excuse that this was covered by harassment.  Effectively, if one uses one&rsquo;s telephone to offend people or to send an indecent, obscene or menacing message, it is an offence.  If one uses text messaging or e-mail to do the same, it is not an offence.  Why should it not be an offence?  The only possible reason is that somebody conservative in the Minister&rsquo;s office did not and does not want to think about it and, therefore, the amendment will not be accepted.  It leaves young people, the primary users of text messages and e-mail, vulnerable to threats of abuse and obscene behaviour by others without a proper legal remedy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan has found an important lacuna in the Bill.  It is obvious that much bullying goes on by e-mail and text messages.  I hope this amendment includes visual images.  There is the horrible situation where young women, in particular, have been brutally attacked and it has been recorded on the camera element on a telephone to be then transmitted on boobtube or whatever they call it.  This matter needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ryan stated it had been indicated to him that his amendment was outside the scope of the Bill.  That is absolute rubbish and palpable nonsense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Minister of State claimed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter what the Minister of State claimed, it is still nonsense.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach obviously ruled the Minister was wrong on this.  However, he made another <Col N="496"/>ruling regarding an amendment of mine which I believe was wrong.  Given that Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment was allowed, I am astonished my amendment was disallowed.  I believe that was wrong and I will write to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This section deals with the use of telephone instruments and machinery for sending offensive messages.  It concerns the relationship between the telephone messenger and the receiver and the nature of those calls.  That places a whole area as the proper subject of the Bill.  My amendment concerned a common practice used by various agencies, including State agencies.  When one telephones them, and after they have delayed one for 15 minutes with their music, announcements and menu of choices, one is informed that the call may be recorded for the purposes of training.  My amendment proposed to remove that right.  It could not be more directly germane to this section.  It is exactly in the same area as Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment.  I am astonished it was ruled that it was outside the scope of the Bill.  I am here to protest about the ruling out of order of my amendment and to ask the Minister of State to examine this.  Communications on the part of an individual citizen should not be subject to violation in the commercial interests of companies.  This is a principle the Minister of State should sustain.  Although I have been improperly denied the opportunity to place this amendment before the House, I ask the Minister of State to reply to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s relevant amendment that reflects modern communications systems.  Legislation needs to be kept up to date to reflect modern telecommunication systems available to us.  Nearly everyone, particularly young children, possesses a mobile telephone.  The Irish are supposedly the greatest users of text messaging in the world.  Nearly everyone is capable of sending electronic mails.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was once the victim of an individual, inadvertently, sending me an e-mail about me that I was not supposed to see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it a positive e-mail?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not positive.  The sender concerned could be in some difficulty if I were to pursue a case.  Such actions must be covered in this legislation.  If the Minister of State does not agree to the amendment, what recourse has an individual if he or she receives obscene or abusive text messages or e-mails?  Certainly the legislation does not reflect those two modes of communication which are being used extensively.  We need to hear from the Minister how an individual can cope with this type of nuisance calling.  If he cannot answer that, it means the amendment should be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="497"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened very carefully to the points being made by the previous speakers.  On the one hand there is a deep and serious validity to what they have said.  I would agree with 99% of what I have heard in terms of the abusive content of messages being exchanged and the vulnerability of young and older people to harassment and intimidation and all kinds of illegal, immoral and unacceptable activities.  Nevertheless a distinction must be drawn between the purpose of the Bill, which is to deal with the provision of services, and the issue raised by Senators of the content of messages.  If messages are criminal in nature, are deemed to be so or are decided to be so by the Houses of the Oireachtas, such issues are appropriate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and not for this Department.  The intent of the Bill makes that clear.  I do not see any role or purpose for it within the context of this Bill.  Nevertheless, Senators have raised a valid point and it should be conveyed to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to accept this amendment.  The purpose of amending the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 was to increase fines to deter nuisance calls to the emergency call answering service, ECAS.  The change proposed by the Senators is a wider offence and I understand from the debate on Tuesday that they are particularly concerned about tackling cyber bullying.  The issues were raised again today by the Senators.  This type of regulation falls outside the remit of the Bill.  The sole intention of this provision is to address nuisance calls to the emergency services.  I have listened carefully as did the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the points raised by the Senators.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the regulation of a service.  The areas raised by the Senators would be more appropriate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>To respond to Senator Terry, it is an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 to harass a person by use of any means, including by use of a telephone.  Therefore, the issue is already dealt with to a certain extent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns raised by Senators about cyber visual bullying, which is a concern with the public.  Unfortunately, the Bill deals with the regulation of a service.  Many of the issues raised by the Senators to combat the offences raised do not always fall under the remit of our Department and are more appropriate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Certainly I will bring them to the attention of that Department.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="498"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the question I raised about recording calls?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Dealing with Committee or Report Stages of a Bill can be either one of the most worthwhile parts of a Member&rsquo;s time or among the most frustrating.  The most frustrating is when one gets nonsense being parroted by Ministers who obviously refuse to engage with the issue.  Harassment is defined as multiple activities.  The section of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 referred to deals with individual activities.  Harassment does not cover what we are talking about.  It is appalling to say that only if one receives multiple text messages is there any legislative protection.  If somebody telephones me to say my mother is dead, that is an offence under the legislation and correctly so, but if somebody sends me a text message to say my mother is dead, apparently that is a joke, or it is not sufficiently significant that the Government would even temporarily accept the amendment.  It could accept it.  It is only a redefinition of telephone.  I have seen legislation come through the House which defined a crossbow as a firearm for the purposes of legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Please do not tell me about the scope of Bills and so on.  The Cathaoirleach has accepted this amendment as coming within the scope of the Bill.  What the Attorney General is saying is that he knows better than the Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If I have to choose between the Attorney General and the Cathaoirleach, I know whom I would choose&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be on a different basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it would not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Very good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have very little evidence of the Cathaoirleach being wrong as frequently as various Attorneys General have been.  We already have a section in place.  Harassment is a smokescreen and is misleading.  The story is that it is only about the emergency services, which is an important fact, but the section of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951, as amended, will read:</P>
        <P LI="1">Any person who&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) sends by telephone any message that is grossly offensive, or is indecent[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">That has nothing to do with the 999 call-out service.  That is about any person who sends anybody a message.  I accept that the penalties are being amended but that is what the section is about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is refusing to redefine a message by telephone to include the two single most widely used forms of communication, e-mail and text messaging, both of which rely on the telecommunications system.  These are two forms of abuse carried out through the telecommunica<Col N="499"/>tions system which are of general concern to people, especially young people, neither of which the Government is prepared to make illegal because somebody somewhere in the depths of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, who is probably barely aware of the existence of e-mails and so on, decided to leave it out.  There is no other reason.  It is because somebody who was drafting the Bill did not feel comfortable with the issues of e-mails and text messages that he or she left them out.  It is perfectly reasonable to see the same hand behind that and this extraordinary attempt to give the Minister powers by decree to impose fines through the courts of up to &euro;4 million.  It is an entirely spurious reason which is being given not to do something simply because they do not want to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his time and I thank the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  I understand, although I was not present, that despite the disappointment expressed by certain Senators, some amendments were accepted.  I reiterate what Senator Kenneally said on Second Stage, namely, that this is a very important Bill, notwithstanding what certain people see as shortcomings and which they have identified today.  It will be an effective legislative mechanism, some of which is by regulation, to enable ComReg to deal with a rapidly changing industry where technology literally changes every day.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>On my own behalf and that of Senator Finucane, who has dealt with the Bill and who could not be here this morning, I thank the Minister of State and his staff for the work they have put into this Bill.  As was evident today, there are a few areas which could have been improved upon, but, generally, it is a very good Bill that will bring regulation into the market for <Col N="500"/>ComReg to deal with issues as they arise.  Anything that strengthens the market is to be welcomed.  This work was needed for the market, which is changing by the day.  I welcome the Bill and believe it will be very useful.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This legislation contains a considerable amount that is good.  I hope ComReg might be able and willing to use the powers it has to defend consumers against fairly powerful and predatory multinationals in particular.  However, I again regret that the opportunity to protect our children, in particular from the abuse that can accompany e-mails and text messaging has been abandoned.  I find it slightly ironic that a Government that is transfixed by a constitutional amendment to protect our children cannot do the little things that would help to deter those who would bully our children electronically.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is my pleasure to bring the Control of Exports Bill 2007 before the House today for consideration and debate.  The lessons of our <Col N="501"/>recent economic history have taught us the advantages of operating in a truly global economy where opportunities are available for all countries to access open markets on an equal footing.  As a strong supporter of trade liberalisation, Ireland continues to work with our EU partners and other like-minded countries within the World Trade Organisation to eliminate trade barriers and to promote the free movement of goods and services.  However, our adherence to the principle of free trade is tempered by our equally strong commitment to arms control and global disarmament.  The global community has a shared need for a stable, secure, inclusive and co-operative international environment.  To this end, Ireland and other like-minded countries have undertaken to regulate trade in military goods and products that have both civil and military applications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s existing legislation in the area of export controls dates from 1983.  While a mere 23 years have elapsed since then, it is true to say that the past is indeed another country.  In 1983, Europe and the world languished in the depths of the Cold War.  After the fall of the Iron Curtain and the democratisation of central and eastern Europe, we had every reason to anticipate a period of sustained global peace and stability.  Sadly, the tragic events of 11 September 2001 and subsequent events brought with them the realisation that new threats to international peace and security had emerged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has become apparent to us all that the enemy is no longer confined to massed armies without.  Increasingly, we must guard against wanton acts of terrorism within, impacting on people as they go about their daily lives.  Thanks to the wonder of modern communications, we cannot deny knowledge of atrocities perpetrated against innocent civilians in Darfur, for example, and other conflict zones.  Closer to home, the horrors of the recent Balkan conflict, including the massacre at Srebrenica, have dispelled any assumptions we may have had that Europe has advanced to a state that makes it somehow immune from the inhumanities inflicted on the inhabitants of other continents.  Our own recent history has also persuaded us that the ballot box, rather than the armalite, is the instrument best applied when seeking a lasting solution to conflict.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another challenge to be faced has been the blurring of the distinction between military and civilian goods.  Denied the possibility to import weapons directly, states and non-state parties have sought to develop their own weapons programmes by acquiring items not designed or developed exclusively for military purposes but which, nonetheless, can have military applications.  Twenty years ago, we had a very clear understanding of what we wanted to control &mdash; guns, bullets, tanks or bombers.  Again, however, we have been shaken out of our complacency.  The attack on the Twin Towers was not perpetrated with a missile launched from a B1 bomber but with a civilian passenger jet.  The <Col N="502"/>London Underground explosives in July 2005 were encased not in weapons-grade steel but in nylon backpacks. We now know that we live in an era when anything and everything can be used as a force for evil.  In the right hands, a hurley or a cricket bat can be wielded with sublime grace.  In the wrong hands, up a dark alley, either can become a lethal weapon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of these developments and concerned as to whether the existing 1983 legislation was adequate for the needs of a 21st century export control system, my Department in 2003 commissioned Forf&aacute;s to undertake a review of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing system for military and dual-use goods.  The overall objective of this exercise was to prepare a recommendation for the Government as to how best Ireland could modernise and strengthen its export licensing controls so as to ensure full compliance with our international obligations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Forf&aacute;s contracted Fitzpatrick Associates, Economic Consultants, in conjunction with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a highly respected authority on issues such as conflict and security, to prepare a report with four specific objectives.  The first of these objectives was to consult with Departments, end users, international organisations, specialised institutes &mdash; both national and international &mdash; involved in the licensing of military and dual-use goods and interested parties to determine the most appropriate export licensing system to be put in place in Ireland.  The second objective was to prepare background material for a public consultation process in order to allow members of the public to make submissions or contributions on the optimal method of licensing military and dual-use goods.  The third objective was to study international best practice with regard to export licensing control systems in other countries.  The final objective was to submit a report outlining the results of both sets of consultations and the review of international best practice with regard to export licensing systems for military and dual-use goods.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The work of the consultants was guided by an inter-departmental group comprising officials from my own Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice Equality and Law Reform, and the Revenue Commissioners.  The group provided assistance and support to the consultants.  However, I must emphasise that they had complete editorial independence and the report&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations were those of the consultants.  As part of this review process, roughly 40 public consultations were held with individual organisations in Ireland.  These included exporters, representative bodies, State agencies and others.  In addition, some 14 organisations responded to an invitation to members of the public to make submissions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to industry, the key lessons learned were that only a small number of companies had any involvement with the licensing <Col N="503"/>system.  Those companies that used the system were generally happy with it, while having some suggestions as to how it could be improved.  Specific topics identified in this regard included more advance information on developments in the system, greater clarity as to what was controlled and with regard to end uses and the need for an electronic application system.  Companies in general also emphasised the need to minimise bureaucratic requirements and pointed out the need to balance new restrictions against the possibility of making Ireland an unattractive location for certain highly mobile ICT activities.</P>
        <P>As with industry, interest on the non-governmental side was limited to a small number of NGOs.  In general, they were critical of what they perceived to be a lack of transparency regarding the decision-making process and outcomes in terms of detailed information on actual exports.  They also criticised gaps in the system on such issues as brokering, licensed production overseas and service exports, as well as the absence of end-use monitoring and checking.</P>
        <P>As part of the benchmarking exercise, a review of literature and information on export licensing systems in a range of countries was studied.  A more detailed examination was conducted on the licensing systems in place in the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden and the United States.  It emerged that many of the problems considered by us to be challenging were also a cause for concern in other countries.  These included controlling exports of intangible technology, putting into practice the EU&rsquo;s catch-all clause which controls non-listed items if they could be used in a WMD programme, enforcement of licence controls on non-compliant companies and promoting greater co-operation between licensing and customs authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final report of the Forf&aacute;s review was published in May 2004.  A key finding was that there was no one-size-fits-all solution for implementing export controls.  Rather, it was vital to factor in unique national circumstances such as the legal systems and size and scope of the production activities affected when designing an effective system.  The report identified a number of strengths and weaknesses of the Irish system.  On the plus side, we have a relatively accessible, straightforward system staffed by knowledgeable personnel and the turnaround times for licensing applications stand up well to international comparison.  Against that, however, the review recommended action to address a number of weaknesses, in particular the need for new legislation to address the needs of a modern, complex export control system.</P>
        <P>Before moving on to consider in detail the legislative proposal now before the House, I would like to focus briefly on some of the other, non-legislative recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s review and to brief the House on progress in these areas.  In line with the Forf&aacute;s recommend<Col N="504"/>ation, responsibility for the export licensing function has remained with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, much has been done to improve co-ordination with other Departments and State agencies, in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is consulted on all licence applications with foreign policy considerations, and the customs authorities of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The interdepartmental group established to oversee production of the report has remained in existence with a brief to promote and monitor implementation of all the review&rsquo;s recommendations.  As this process nears completion, it is my intention to transform this group into a standing interdepartmental committee which will take forward responsibility for co-ordinating the work of the Departments and agencies in the area of export licensing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A priority of the interdepartmental group has been the establishment of a technical advisory panel to act as a specialist resource for my Department on technical questions related to the licensing process.  Acting on the recommendation of the Forf&aacute;s review, a project to develop an on-line export licensing system has been under way for the past year.  I am pleased to announce I expect this system, OELAS, to go live by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  We have worked hard to improve the flow of information to exporting companies and in this regard I was pleased to host our first ever export control seminar last June in Farmleigh at which I launched our users' guide and customers' charter to export licensing in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Returning to the Control of Exports Bill, in January 2005 the Government approved in principle the drafting of new legislation in line with the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s review.  As the House will be aware, all Government proposals for primary legislation are now subject to regulatory impact analysis, or RIA, to determine whether the new regulation will have the desired impact.  RIA helps to identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with regulation and to quantify the likely costs of compliance for individuals or companies.  It also helps to clarify the costs of enforcement for the State.</P>
        <P>Prior to the general roll-out of RIA across all Departments and offices in June 2005, my Department participated in the pilot phase by offering the proposed Control of Exports Bill as a suitable test case.  A RIA was undertaken which looked at three options for regulating export control.  The first option was to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, namely, to continue to rely on the 1983 Act.  The second option was to introduce new legislation which would update penalties, broaden the definition of exportation to include intangible transfers and introduce audit and inspection powers.  The third option was to introduce new legislation along the lines of the second option but with added controls on arms brokering and technical assistance.</P><Col N="505"/>
        <P Just="Left">We quickly concluded the third option was the only one which would ensure Ireland&rsquo;s export control system was in line with best international practice and would enable us to meet our international obligations.  The absence of any evidence to suggest Irish-based firms were engaging in brokering or technical assistance activities led us to determine that the economic impact of these new controls would be negligible.</P>
        <P>Two key steps of a RIA are a public consultation process and an examination of enforcement and compliance issues.  We were fortunate that these steps had been examined in some detail as part of the Forf&aacute;s review.  Working on the basis of the Forf&aacute;s review recommendations and the findings of the RIA, the general scheme of the Control of Exports Bill was prepared in my Department and was approved by the Government on 19 July last.  Since then, this Bill has been a priority item of legislation for publication by my Department.  I am very pleased we were able to finalise the text of the Bill at the earliest opportunity and to publish it on 9 February.</P>
        <P>I wish to explain the provisions of each section of the Bill.  Section 1<b> </b>sets out the definitions of certain terms.  Where possible, we have aligned definitions with those in use in EU legislation.  Section<b> </b>2 sets out the general procedures for the making of regulations and orders and enables regulations and orders to be made for the purpose of giving effect to EU legislation.  Section 3 enables the Minister to make orders or regulations to control brokering activities in accordance with the EU Common Position<b> </b>2003/468/CFSP<b> </b>of 23 June 2003.  It provides for controls to be imposed on brokering activities undertaken in the State and outside the State if undertaken by an Irish citizen or company.  Section 4 enables the making of orders or regulations to prohibit or control the export of specified goods and technology.  Generally, such orders will take the form of a list of goods to be controlled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 6<b> </b>makes general provisions with regard to the issue or refusal of licences.  It will also enable regulations to be made governing licence application procedures.  Section<b> </b>7 deals with the appointment of officers authorised to enforce the Act and grants them necessary powers such as the right to enter premises, including vehicles, to inspect goods and technology and to require the production of documents and records.  This section also allows for joint inspections with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs and Excise officers.  Section<b> </b>8 creates summary and indictable offences and significantly increases the financial penalties from a maximum of &pound;12,700 under the 1983 Act to up to &euro;10 million and-or five years' imprisonment for breaches of the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 9<b> </b>introduces a provision for an annual report on the operation of the Act to be prepared and to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is in line with a key recommend<Col N="506"/>ation of the Forf&aacute;s review and responds to calls for greater transparency in the area of export controls.  Section 10<b> </b>is a standard provision for expenses.  Section 11<b> </b>provides for the repeal of the Control of Exports Act 1983 but confirms the validity of the Control of Exports Order 2005, SI No. 884 of 2005, which contains the current list of controlled military goods.<b>  </b>Section 12<b> </b>provides for the citation of the Bill when enacted as the Control of Exports Act 2007 and for its entry into force, in all or in part, to be made by ministerial order.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern.  I also welcome the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for his general overview of it and the detailed outline of what the various sections contain.  I reserve the right to strengthen the proposed legislation through amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill has many worthy aims.  It will regulate arms brokering in Ireland and by Irish citizens abroad, and will introduce controls on the sale of technical help, software and other technologies that could be used for military purposes.  It will also give Government officials the power to inspect and audit companies involved in exporting military goods or dual-use products.  I understand these include chemicals, high-performance computer components and telecommunications software that have civil and military uses.  Penalties for breaching the export laws are to be increased from a maximum of &euro;12,700, the equivalent of &pound;10,000 under the 1983 law, to a two-year jail sentence.  One could say, &ldquo;So far, so good.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">The arms trade is, to put it mildly, an unpleasant business.  Given the new uncertainty in the world presented by the perceived terrorist threat, the continued presence of armed conflict in many of the world&rsquo;s poorest areas, and the continued conflict in the Middle East, etc., many involved in the arms industry have become very rich.  We are perhaps cocooned from reality in this country.  As a small neutral state, some may believe that we have no arms industry, but that is not true.  I thank Amnesty International&rsquo;s Irish division for its great work on this issue.  Amnesty International points out that the quote attributed to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, &ldquo;Ireland does not have an arms trade&rdquo;, is deeply unfortunate and quite disingenuous given the legislation he is debating.  Amnesty International states that Ireland has an arms trade and that the Government needs to acknowledge this fact if it is to be serious about controlling it.  It is concerned that the content of the Bill outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s statement omits certain key requirements for an effective export and licensing control system.</P>
        <P>One important area not addressed is a monitoring system for end users of these exports.  The degree to which the legislation will exercise control over Irish citizens relocating outside Europe <Col N="507"/>and thereby bypassing European checks is unclear.  Fine Gael believes we must recognise that Ireland&rsquo;s existing export control system for arms trading is inadequate.  There is a lack of transparency and accountability in the current system and this has created a situation whereby there is an absence of democratic overview by the Oireachtas and journalists.  Members of the public cannot find out what is being exported from Ireland or what it is being used for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In May 2004 Forf&aacute;s issued a report entitled Export Licensing of Military and Dual Use Goods in Ireland.  It stated clearly that it can be estimated that actual exports of controlled military products and components are &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million annually.  The report also stated that the system has areas needing improvement, namely, the absence of dedicated primary national legislation governing the military licensing system, a number of recognised gaps in what is controlled under the legislation, scope for a more proactive approach, especially in the provision of advance information and advice, scope for greater involvement on an advisory and consultative basis to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the range of relevant State resources outside the Department, and strengthening of the relationship between the Department and Customs and Excise to ensure the most effective controls possible are being applied.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other areas to be considered include more proactive and wider enforcement, especially regarding possible exporters who are not applying for licences, rotation of staff at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Foreign Affairs, with a need for greater retention of corporate memory and expertise, increased and more structured access in the process to appropriate specialist technical and other expertise, and increased transparency of the decision-making process and criteria.  I want the Minister of State to confirm that these weaknesses have been dealt with under the provisions of this Bill.  Unless he can give such a cast-iron undertaking, we will seek to improve the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Forf&aacute;s report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In modernising and developing the system, Ireland in common with other countries must balance two competing interests, namely:</P>
        <P LI="2">the economic or &ldquo;trade&rdquo; interest of minimising administrative costs, reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on legitimate exporters, and ensuring that Ireland does not unnecessarily reduce its attractiveness to international mobile investment, particularly in the area of high technology dual-use goods and services;</P>
        <P LI="2">the &ldquo;control&rdquo; interest in terms of minimising the danger that any military or dual-use <Col N="508"/>good produced in Ireland would find its way to internationally undesirable uses, meeting international legally binding and political commitments, and generally protecting and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s good name and reputation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If the Minister of State wants my advice, he would be better off concentrating on the latter rather than the former.</P>
        <P>We must safeguard our economic competitiveness, our jobs base and the future of businesses in this country, but I need not remind the House of the horror unfolding in Darfur, Iraq, Afghanistan, Myanmar and hundreds of locations throughout the world.  We must ask ourselves if we can really have Irish participation, even in a minor way, on our conscience.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The need for this Bill arises from the fact that the EU does not yet have a common peace and defence policy.  National governments decide on these issues and, as a result, there is a mishmash of approaches throughout the EU.  The time has come for Ireland to define the circumstances in which it would depart from neutrality and take part in an EU defence entity.  Instead of just accepting the terms of this future defence arrangement, Fine Gael advocates that Ireland take a full and active role in the development of this defence arrangement.</P>
        <P>Our involvement in any future EU common security and defence system should be guided by five key commitments, namely, the commitment to adhere to the fundamental principles of the UN, the commitment to the pursuit of universal nuclear and biological disarmament and a promise never to use either type of weapon, the commitment to mutual defence with our EU neighbours but with specific provisions that would allow Ireland to decide whether to get involved in any conflict on a case-by-case basis, the commitment to providing peacekeeping and peacemaking operations, and the commitment to respect the right of other EU member states to enter other military alliances.  The House might consider whether the terms of how arms are traded could be included in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the publication of this Bill and commend the Minister of State on his excellent speech which outlined the background to this Bill.  Sometimes it is not always evident how legislation comes about.  This Bill seeks to limit the operations of arms brokers within Ireland and stems from the EU Common Position on arms brokering of 2003 that seeks to limit the operations of arms traders within the European Union.  It also seeks to limit Irish individuals and businesses that carry out the arms trade in third countries.  This Bill considers the control and limitation of force in the world today.  It seeks to limit those involved in the weapons trade by granting licences according to stringent guidelines and granting the State the power to prosecute those <Col N="509"/>who pursue unlawful trading, which is a welcome measure.</P>
        <P>This legislation depends on the adoption of the agreement by the various countries of the European Union, a matter on which I would like to question the Minister of State.  A 2004 Amnesty International report on arms trading outlines the countries which have adopted identical or similar legislation to this in Europe, praising Belgium, Finland, Slovakia and Sweden.  What other EU states have adopted this legislation?  The Bill depends on the whole of the European Union adopting the same or similar legislation to ensure a level playing field.  It leaves deals involving conventional weapons to non-embargoed destinations unregulated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation before us seems to recognise and limit this form of trade but the importance of the whole of the EU adopting this legislation means there is something of an inequality when one state does not.  Ireland has been very well behaved in adopting EU legislation.  Some feel we are more advanced than most European countries in adopting European legislation into Irish law.  This is a worthwhile and well-intentioned Bill but I wish to know more about the attitudes of other EU states to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also the question of the technology used in weapons of mass destruction.  There is no doubt weapons of this nature pose a grave threat to international security.  However, there is also a question of accountability.  There is a concern that an individual or company which sells a computer or software, that is seemingly for normal use, to a particular country or individual could be found culpable if its technology were used by others in the construction of weapons.  This gives rise to a sort of unintended consequence &mdash; one that is troubling and undoubtedly horrifying.  However, the question remains as to whether an individual or company that sold a product in good faith is guilty of crimes under legislation such as that before us and this gives rise to many matters of concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The United Kingdom Government has not adopted legislation of this nature.  The UK produces massive quantities of armaments, including that horrible invention the cluster bomb.  Diana, Princess of Wales, who unfortunately died so tragically, was leading a campaign against armaments of this nature.  She was a leading light in this regard and that did not go down well with the establishment in Britain at the time.</P>
        <P>When I served as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, I was always conscious of the fact that we could not under any circumstances promote a product that could be used in the arms industry.  We have high standards as far as neutrality is concerned.  Ireland&rsquo;s economic progress has not been dependent on exporting arms or weapons of mass destruction.  We do not produce bombs, bullets or guns.  Young people should be proud of that for which the State stands.  The Bill is important <Col N="510"/>because it will ensure Ireland will not, under any circumstances, be used by brokers to facilitate the sale or distribution of arms or weapons to any other country.</P>
        <P>The Bill is also worthwhile because it makes efficient provision in respect of the licensing of exports.  I have never &mdash; either while I served  in the Department or since I left &mdash; received any great level of representations regarding expediting licences for exports.  Ireland is completely export oriented and it must ensure exporters are given every possible priority.  We have in our midst Senator White who, in her life outside the House, is an extremely successful exporter of products.  I refer to one product in particular in that regard, namely, Lir chocolates.  I commend the Senator on the employment she has created in County Meath.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, on the work they have done.  The Minister of State has invested a great deal of effort in the areas for which he is responsible since his appointment five years ago.  I am aware of the effort required in this regard and I know one is often obliged to engage in extensive travel on behalf of exporters and to lead trade missions abroad.  One receives very little recognition in one&rsquo;s constituency in respect of this work, to which one must be extremely dedicated.  The leading of export delegations by Ministers and Ministers of State has given rise to the creation of numerous jobs.</P>
        <P>As the days of this Oireachtas and the current Administration draw to a close, I take this opportunity to wish the Minister of State well in the election.  I also wish him well regarding the ministerial appointments &mdash; for which I hope my party will be responsible &mdash; that will be made after the election.  The Minister has acquitted himself well in every way in his Department.  His work in respect of the areas of commerce and trade has been exemplary.  I had the honour of accompanying him to Milan and of watching him perform at first hand.  As he is aware, I am preparing a report on exports at present and I will submit it to him in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Bill to the House.  I wish to express my thanks, appreciation and respect to the excellent officials in the Department.  I reiterate that the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution was exemplary in explaining why the Bill is necessary.  I applaud the research carried out in conjunction with Forf&aacute;s and the consultation that took place before it was decided to introduce the Bill.  The merits of the legislation and the economic benefits to which it will give rise were all elaborated on by the Minister of State.  His contribution explained the position very well to anyone who would not have any great knowledge of the<?oasys _jy ?>field.</P>
        <P>I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Houses.  I hope it will be enacted before the <Col N="511"/>Government leaves office.  I compliment Senator Coghlan, Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesperson in this area, Senator Quinn, who is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his contribution.  I particularly liked his strong commitment to arms control and global disarmament.  There is little doubt a great deal of committed and sincere thought went into the drafting of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the work done by the late Diana, Princess of Wales.  I would like to think that we might be proactive rather than just being reactive.  Rather than stopping the trade in arms, perhaps there is something more we can do.  In that regard, I wish to comment on work relating to genetically modified organisms.  One such organism that was developed some time ago impressed me no end.  I refer to a particular type of grass seed which, as it grows, changes colour when it comes into contact with metal.  The concept is that a plane can fly over an area where it is suspected mines have been laid and drop this genetically modified grass seed, which grows quickly.  Where it comes into contact with metal, it will change colour and indicate possible sites where mines have been planted.  This marvellous invention is a reminder that we should not just turn our backs on everything to do with genetically modified products because there have been some very healthy and life-saving developments in that area.  I raise this matter because there is a danger that in concentrating our efforts on disarmament, we might be reactive rather than proactive.</P>
        <P>I am generally in favour of the Bill, although I have some practical reservations about it.  In some respects, I do not believe it goes far enough.  The overall driving purpose behind the Bill is to prevent this country being used as a location for arms brokerage.  That is an objective to which I have no problem in fully subscribing.  However, it is in this respect that I believe the Bill does not go far enough.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland should, as a matter of policy, set its face against having anything whatever to do with the production or sale of any product the main function of which is military.  Some people would argue this flows from our stance on military neutrality but I do not take that position.  Our neutral <Col N="512"/>stance does not prevent us from having an army or from taking part in international peacekeeping missions, both of which require the use of military equipment.  I do not, therefore, see how being militarily neutral can allow us to use military equipment but not be involved in producing it.</P>
        <P>I would argue against Ireland being involved in any way in the production or sale of military equipment because of the moral standing that would be conferred upon it if it were to adopt such a position.  If we have a stake, however small, in the production of military equipment, it will inevitably compromise our independence when we argue for the peaceful resolution of disputes &mdash; be they internal to one country or between different states &mdash; across the globe.  By completely turning our backs on this industry, we would be able to claim a position on the moral high ground.  Such a position would be totally consistent with the thrust of our foreign policy generally.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Up to now we have resisted taking such a position because of the possible impact it might have had on job creation.  For many years, our attitude was that we were prepared to do anything, so long as it created jobs.  That position was understandable when we had a serious unemployment problem and when there was a possible definite cost attached to adopting a principle of renouncing any involvement in the arms industry.  However, we have moved on from the days when creating jobs was the be-all and end-all of everything.  Now, we can afford to pick and choose the activities in which we should get involved.  We should renounce any involvement with arms production.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister to consider, between now and Committee Stage, how to broaden the remit of this Bill in order that the regulations made under it might apply not just to the narrow issue of arms brokering but also to controlling activity in regard to the production or sale of military equipment.  Making such a change would not commit this Minister or any future Minister to applying such controls, but at least it would provide the legislative framework for doing so at any time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have another reservation about the Bill, this time a matter of detail.  Section 3(2) deals with the scope of the brokerage activities covered by the Bill.  It applies to any such activities that take place in the State, which is obvious and not contentious.  However, paragraph (b) of the subsection extends the activities covered to ones carried on outside the State but by an individual who is an Irish citizen or by a company registered in the State.  I have no problem with the provision relating to companies but there are some questions about the provision relating to Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>Many Irish citizens leave this country and are not seen again for the rest of their lives, even though they continue to be Irish citizens and hold Irish passports.  My bemusement arises from wondering just how the State could control brokerage <Col N="513"/>activities which are carried on by a person who has not set foot in this country for perhaps 20 or 30 years.  How, precisely, could such a provision be enforced?  If it cannot be implemented, it is bad practice to legislate for it.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, this section makes no effort to capture brokerage activities carried on outside the State by someone who is a resident here, but is not a citizen.  We have a possible control on such activities because of the person&rsquo;s residence, but under the Bill, as long as the activities are carried on outside the State, they will escape.  The section, therefore, on the one hand purports to control activities by citizens who may not have had a connection with Ireland for many years, while it ignores activities carried out by residents here simply because they are not citizens.  These anomalies could be resolved by simply substituting &ldquo;resident&rdquo; for &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; in section 3(2)(b)(i).  The Minister should table an amendment on Committee Stage to that effect.  It is worthy of consideration.  If he cannot do so, I will introduce such an amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time.  I welcome the Bill.  I believe there is a role for the Seanad in refining and, perhaps, amending this legislation.  This is an interesting situation which we are addressing for the first time.  Ireland has a small arms industry.  The Minister will be aware of the famous Timoney armoured car, tank and other products.  There are very clever engineers in UCD.  The problem is the destination of these products.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall with sadness the late Robin Cook making a stand for an ethical foreign policy while simultaneously continuing to export Hawk aircraft to Indonesia in the knowledge that they were being used against the civilian population of East Timor.  This House took a particular interest in that situation, guided to a large extent by the remarkable work of Tom Hyland.  I also recall raising the arms issue when the French were sending Alouette helicopters to the same destination.  The French Prime Minister rebuked me and said the European Union was not a human rights organisation.  Luckily the articles have been amended and there are now human rights protocols in the foundation treaties of the European Union.  It was a cynical view; he was simply focused on the question of employment.</P>
        <P>The Minister raised an essential point from the Irish point of view when he said that one of the challenges to be faced is the blurring of the distinction between military and civilian goods.  Ireland is in some difficulty in that regard.  Ireland produces material that might not immediately appear to be military hardware but which has a clear military application.  Examples are computer hardware and guidance systems for weapons.  These are being produced here.  It is estimated that hundreds of millions of euro worth of the computer systems that are exported are used <Col N="514"/>for the guidance of weapons, including weapons used by the Americans against people in Iraq.</P>
        <P>At this point we reach a moral decision between employment or decency.  We must handle this clearly and take a stand.  We can try to safeguard employment or find other areas of employment.  There may well be a cost but we should not have blood on our hands.  I clearly recall that when Mr. de Valera&rsquo;s grandson, the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was on the Government benches in this House he spoke passionately against any Irish involvement in arms manufacturing.  I wish the voice of the late President Eisenhower had been heeded when, in the 1950s, he warned the American people against allowing a takeover by what he called the military industrial complex.  That is exactly what has happened under Cheney and Bush.  It has driven America into a disastrous situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with my colleagues that this situation must be examined.  There is horrendous immorality throughout the world.  I am half-English but one of England&rsquo;s largest income generators is arms.  England is either the largest or second largest exporter in the world of the instruments of death.  The licensing alone of exports is no good without an ethical framework.  I recall the British Department of Trade giving a licence for a custom-made torture chamber for one of the Arab states.  This occurred about 20 years ago although I do not recall whether it was for Saudi Arabia or Qatar.  The obscenity of somebody sitting in comfort in an office in Whitehall and signing an export order for a torture chamber, custom made for these savages, is outrageous.</P>
        <P>We should deal with this issue as a package.  We should examine the issue of cluster bombs.  The Independent Senators have a motion on the Order Paper dealing with the obscenity of these weapons.  Pax Christi has been extremely useful in advising the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We require a strong monitoring system for end use.  We must know what materials may or may not be primarily seen as instruments of war.  The end use is extremely important.  We must consider this entire area as a package and take a determined moral stand against the proliferation of arms.  We would receive moral credit if we did so on behalf of the majority of ordinary people who are against these.  A small number of immensely influential people are making money out of this filthy trade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister on his first-class speech.  It was eloquent, wide-ranging and interesting.  The culture and drive of the Irish people was never to go abroad and behave tyrannically in other countries.  We have never been marauders or colonisers.  Throughout our history, we have gone to other countries only to educate.  We are by our nature peaceful people.  The same cannot be said, however, of all our colleagues in the EU, many of whom have colonised different <Col N="515"/>parts of the world.  That is why they are so rich and their buildings so exotic and elegant.  Every time I visit London or Brussels, for example, I am aware that the beautiful buildings are there only because of the exploitation practised by Britain and Belgium in other countries.</P>
        <P>This legislation imposes controls on the arms industry.  I was not previously aware that Ireland produced arms.  It is hypocritical that these provisions are championed by some countries at a time when a war is being conducted by the United States and others in Iraq in which thousands of lives have been lost.  I was canvassing for a colleague last week in Dublin city when I met a man from Kurdistan who was granted political asylum here.  When I asked him what he thought of President George Bush he said the latter did not invade Iraq to help the Iraqi people but because of oil.  Every day, however, we are fed the propaganda that President Bush and company entered Iraq on a peaceful mission.  The reality is that the instruments they use are for killing people.</P>
        <P>We are doing our utmost to update our legislation to bring it into line with EU requirements.  We know in our hearts and souls, however, that we cannot control where the microchips that are being made are used.  I do not know what we can do about this.  The Minister of State referred to the war that took place in Bosnia and Croatia.  We all saw the television footage of Dubrovnik being blasted by guns, and many of us have visited that beautiful city since its restoration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The way to solve political problems is by dialogue rather than by shooting and killing.  When the British army entered Northern Ireland more than 20 years ago, its soldiers were welcomed by Nationalists, who hoped they would bring stability.  What has happened in Iraq in this regard is a mirror image of what happened in the North.  It is extraordinary that Britain has not recognised this.  Its army went into Iraq to keep peace but we soon saw images of soldiers kicking in doors.  Now there is civil war and a reaction against the British military.  The people the soldiers went in to protect have turned on them.</P>
        <P>Political problems are best solved by dialogue, communication and peaceful means.  This seldom happens, however, as power struggles and selfish interests dominate.  Where is the concern for ordinary citizens in these conflicts?  In Bosnia, Croatia, Iraq and elsewhere it is ordinary people who suffer.  The full story is yet to emerge about former Vice President Dick Cheney, Halliburton and the money being made from military contracts in Iraq.  In the last five years, the failure of the major international players to solve by dialogue the problem posed by Saddam Hussein and the conflict in the Middle East has been disastrous.  What ultimately had to happen in the North was dialogue.  We must listen to people&rsquo;s concerns.  Guns get us nowhere and only kill innocent people.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="516"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill.  It is an example of legislation which implements EU directives that have a relatively limited applicability to Ireland, in this case because we are not involved in any serious way in the arms industry.  There is more than one dimension to this issue.  When such legislation was considered 20 years ago, it was generally looked at solely from the perspective of Irish neutrality and our wish not to be involved, preferably even indirectly, in the arms trade.</P>
        <P>In reality, some of the equipment produced in Ireland, by multinationals in particular, has multiple uses, and it is difficult to impose controls in this regard.  If we want multinationals to come here, we must, within limits, be pragmatic.  I have no problem whatsoever with the type of manufacture mentioned in this debate.  Timoney armoured cars, for instance, have a role in peacekeeping.  We must recognise that there are many legitimate contexts for the use of force, including UN peacekeeping.</P>
        <P>The worrying dimension to this issue is that there are some states who are arguably trying to engage in the internationally illicit production of certain types of arms, nuclear weapons being the most obvious example.  Even more worryingly, not all the international players are necessarily states.  Various non-state groups have uses for arms.  One could argue that much if not most of the violence in the world today is caused not by inter-state conflict but by various non-state groups operating across frontiers.  We must guard against being unwittingly involved in such activity.</P>
        <P>I entirely agree that the Iraq war is an object lesson in the limitations of the use of force even where initial military victory can be achieved relatively simply.  I hope future leaders, particularly among our friends and partners but elsewhere as well, will relinquish the notion that it is politically advantageous to engage in foreign wars.  At the end of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Henry IV Part 2</i>, a royal brother, in conversation with the chief justice, talks about the king engaging in foreign wars as a distraction from domestic problems.  Unfortunately that is not peculiar to the 15th century but happens in the 21st.</P>
        <P>Can anybody honestly say that, had they foreseen the consequences of the invasion of Iraq, which we know was based on largely spurious grounds, they would have entertained that adventure?  There is a lot to be said for the wisdom of President Bush senior in 1991 when the invasion of Kuwait had to be confronted.  Nevertheless, the coalition stopped short at a certain point.  Tony Blair is coming to the end of his career as British Prime Minister and we have reason in this country to be extremely grateful for his contribution.  His achievements also include devolution for Scotland and Wales but it is a great pity that his historical reputation is likely to be marred and overshadowed by the adventure in Iraq.</P><Col N="517"/>
        <P Just="Left">It reflects well on the wisdom of Irish foreign policy and that of the European Union as a whole, though individual states have engaged in the coalition of the willing, that the emphasis is on political and economic solutions.  One can never exclude the use of force as a last resort in certain situations, such as in the former Yugoslavia, but it should be a last resort rather than an option based on the belief, prevalent in some sections of the political establishment across the Atlantic, that if one has superior force, one must use it.  I hope there will be a return to a more internationalist approach in which force is only used where there is unequivocal justification for it, rather than with a view to redrawing the map of the Middle East ideologically.  I do not know how many people over the centuries have succumbed to the snares and delusions of that policy.  They believe they are free to do so and will not meet any resistance but war is no more certain than a horse race.  Unpredictable things happen which blow people completely off course.</P>
        <P>This piece of legislation is fairly and squarely within our traditions and those of the EU, whose ethos and spirit are not far removed from our own.  I accept that other overlapping organisations have a different ethos.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I will address a couple of issues that have arisen during the course of the debate.  I am glad the Minister of State outlined the historical context because the world has changed over the past 20 years.  It is almost impossible to believe that individuals and states now have a common enemy, which is like a thief in the night.  The concept of standing armies facing each other is, since 9/11, completely outdated and we are now constantly under threat from mad individuals, assisted by Internet technology and the breakdown of social order in some former Soviet states which provided access to military weapons technology.</P>
        <P>I am not a great fan of consultants and, in light of the information the Minister of State has provided, there seems to be a vast array of expertise not only in his but in many Departments.  Why was it necessary to engage a firm of consultants to provide the benchmarking guidelines for the Forf&aacute;s report?  I welcome the fact that the interdepartmental group will continue to function and will have technical assistance as it is important, given the changing nature of the threat we face, that there are controls, not only within the Minister of State&rsquo;s own Department, which is responsible for issuing permits, but in the form of cross-departmental co-operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the Minister of State on section 3, which concerns extraterritoriality.  Not only does it address the case of an Irish citizen engaging in transfers of weapons or military hardware outside Ireland but criminal elements who use some European countries to access weaponry to threaten our own citizens.  There was such an example this week when a criminal was set free by a Dutch <Col N="518"/>court, much to the consternation and anger of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which had provided all the information it felt was necessary for a conviction.  However, the Dutch police moved too quickly and apprehended the alleged criminal entering an apartment rather than inside the apartment.  As a result, he was able to argue in court that the weaponry found in his apartment did not belong to him and was allowed to go free, despite the fact that, as reported in the newspapers, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has evidence that the man in question is responsible for murder in Ireland.  The Bill does not address just the larger military threat from al-Qaeda but from individuals who threaten the basic democratic fabric of this State.  These criminal elements attempt to bypass Irish law by exchanging arms outside the country.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a proud record in such matters.  We do not do war but peace, and we do it very well.  The overwhelming will of the Irish people is not to be involved in military alliances.  At the same time I share some of Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s views that, as a sovereign, independent, proud and confident nation which has taken its place at the European Union table, we have shared responsibilities for world peace and security and should not lose sight of that in an onward rush to protect neutrality at all costs.  There is overwhelming evidence that we must be seen to stand up in a shared heritage with our European neighbours.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for partaking in the debate.  I listened intently to the points made and questions asked.  There will be an opportunity to go into them in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan asked about monitoring and transparency.  Each year, an annual report must be laid before the Oireachtas.  We will have an opportunity to review it and Members may raise then any questions they have.</P>
        <P>End-use monitoring is important, although it is not easy to see everything that happens at the end.  Everything that can be done will be done to collate information from colleagues in Europe and further afield.  The sharing of information on end users of potential concern is a strong component of preventative action by the European Union and the international export control regimes.  Where there is any reason to doubt the bona fides of the end users, we simply deny an export licence.  We also deny export licences where we have any reason to believe there is a risk of diversion of goods to an end use or end user other than that stated on the licence application.</P>
        <P>There is a code of conduct on arms exports that accords with criterion 7 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  This code binds us to take into account such criteria as the <Col N="519"/>existence of internal conflicts, regional peace and security and respect for human rights when considering whether to permit the export of controlled goods.  There is also a responsibility on the exporting companies to ensure their products are not used for nefarious purposes.  Close co-operation exists between the EU member states and like-minded countries in the international export control regime.  We do not operate in isolation.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden asked about mines.  Most of the equipment we export is for mine clearing and mine sweeping, so even though the equipment may end up in a war zone, it is used for the good.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not in Britain.  Senator Quinn raised the issue of brokering, saying the Bill does not cover the whole remit of military goods.  This Bill covers all military and dual-use goods.  He also made a distinction between residents of the State and citizens, a point we will consider before Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris mentioned the Timoney armoured personnel carrier.  These are used for peaceful purposes, not to promote war.  He also raised the issue of dual-use goods and the need to seek assurances about civilian end use but, as I explained, that area is monitored.  He asked about a code of conduct and there is one in place.</P>
        <P>Senator White correctly pointed out Ireland&rsquo;s history.  It is right that we remind ourselves and others that we are unique in comparison with many other countries operating in this area in that our approach is quite different.  That is why we are trusted more than countries that were colonisers.  We were one of the few white colonised nations of the world.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney asked about analysis and costings.  We carried out the regulatory impact assessment referred to in my speech.  The approach taken in the Bill looks at all aspects and goes through the necessary assessments to ensure we get value for money.</P>
        <P>I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage and I thank my officials for their comprehensive briefing.  The Bill will stand up to scrutiny and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for dealing with it.  It is not the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but the Minister of State is an accountant and it was an accountant who brought this to my attention.</P>
        <P>Why is a married person working for his or her spouse who is a sole trader, in the context of equity, fairness and equity, not allowed to claim social welfare benefits, including maternity benefit, disability benefit and the State contributory pension?  This is invidious discrimination that is unacceptable and there would be a strong argument for taking a constitutional case on the issue.  It arises with sole traders, including accountants, farmers, shopkeepers and other professional people, who in order to run their businesses have spouses working with them.  I am talking about people who do a day&rsquo;s work, clock in in the morning in a recorded fashion, finish in the afternoon, take the holidays to which they are entitled and pay PRSI.  When these people come to claim social welfare benefits, the most obvious examples being maternity benefit or superannuation &mdash; contributory State pension &mdash; they are advised they have no such entitlement.  The only reason for non-entitlement is their marriage to their employer.  I had thought we had outgrown such provisions years ago.  We have discussed progressive matters such as civil partnerships and various other relationships.</P>
        <P>I will ask the Minister of State to come back to me on this matter.  For example, from my reading a woman working for her accountant husband and paying her PRSI each week could find she is not entitled to any claim on it.  If they were to get technically divorced in the morning and continued the same arrangement, would she then be entitled to claim full social welfare benefits?  Let us consider another example.  A woman might be working for a man in a normal employer-employee relationship.  They might fall in love and continue the exact same arrangement with the woman paying class A PRSI contributions.  Suddenly she would lose all her benefits, which is utterly unacceptable in this day and age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A strong argument could be made for taking a constitutional case.  I do not believe the answer the Minister of State will give will reassure me &mdash; I suspect I could have written it myself.  I believe this case needs to be taken.  I have sought legal advice on the issue.  For the layperson, <i>Kelly&rsquo;s Irish Constitution</i> updated by Gerard Hogan and Gerry Whyte is very clear.  My reading is that under Article 40.1 of the Constitution, which requires us all to be treated equally before the law, it is invidious discrimination to do this.  It has <Col N="521"/>a wide impact.  It impacts on farmers, accountants, shopkeepers, architects etc.  Something is fundamentally wrong.</P>
        <P>The provision exists because people believe that a wife may not really be working for her husband and is simply perverting the system.  I do not suggest we should allow ourselves be duped by people who do not deal with this matter on an honest basis.  However, the two cases I have looked at relate to people who clock in in the morning, work the full year, take holidays only when the office is closed and work as long as their bosses.  I would appreciate hearing the view of the Minister of State before he even reads the script.  In fact he should throw away the script and give me his own thoughts.  If he worked in such a situation, would he not regard it as being utterly wrong?  If I were to launch a constitutional case on this matter would the State be of a mind to fight it or would it simply recognise the reality and come to an honest agreement that people working and paying PRSI are entitled to their social welfare benefits?</P>
        <P>I always say to people that if they can get money easily from the Department of Finance they should not take it and should ask a second question.  People get back only two kinds of payment by return of post from the Department of Finance.  People seeking return of their pension contributions are paid immediately because it does not want to pay people a pension.  The other is this one.  A person who informs the Department that she has been working for her husband for 35 years paying class A PRSI and asks for her entitlements will receive a letter advising that she is not entitled to it but informing her that she will be sent all her payments and a little bit more in the post the following day.  This is the reason I know it is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am standing in for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and will give the official response.  The Senator could have gone further because it may also apply to a sister working for a brother who is a sole trader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have said that.  I just took the example of a husband and wife.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased the Senator has raised the matter because I have had many a battle to have it changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Minister of State is on my side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be on his side.  However, I will also give him the official reply.  Employments under a contract of service as an employee or under a contract for services as a self-employed person involve a formal agreement between two or more parties.  All contracts bring <Col N="522"/>with them rights and responsibilities that, in this instance, include compliance legislation relating to PRSI, taxes and employment rights.  Spouses of employed or self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from liability for social insurance contributions in respect of their working activity with their spouses.</P>
        <P>Social welfare provisions recognise that family members regularly support each other without having any intention of entering into formal contractual arrangements.  In domestic arrangements, the presumption is that the help and assistance provided are based on mutual affection without expectation of, or liability for, compensation.  In general, close family members must show an express agreement in order to overcome the presumption that parties did not intend to be bound in a legally bound contract.  Evidence of a partnership between spouses or the incorporation of a business will overcome this presumption.  For self-employed workers working together, evidence of a partnership will establish liability for class S PRSI contributions, providing that income is above the annual threshold of &euro;3,174.  Where couples work in a legally incorporated entity and each earns more than &euro;38 per week, both will pay social insurance contributions in their own right and accrue entitlement to benefits accordingly.  These provisions apply to all couples working together engaged in business activities, for example in retailing, providing professional services or farming.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The exception of spouses from PRSI liability in the case of a shared occupation does not preclude them from accessing the voluntary contribution scheme which will maintain a social insurance record towards pension entitlement.  Access to the voluntary PRSI contribution scheme requires a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  Where a person has been previously insured as an employee or a self-employed person, is no longer compulsorily insured and is under 66 years of age, he or she can opt to pay voluntary social insurance contributions.  Voluntary contributions will maintain social insurance cover for pensions such as transition and contributory State pension, widow and widower contributory pension, guardian contributory payment and bereavement grant, depending on the rate at which the voluntary contribution has been paid.  Alternatively, a spouse may gain social insurance coverage by working for another as an ordinary employee where she or he earns more than &euro;38 per week.  PRSI contributions paid on these earnings would accrue entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits.</P>
        <P>The question of whether these social welfare provisions are discriminatory has been previously  considered with further examination of the provisions being progressed as follows.  We have traditionally provided for both individual and derived rights for social insurance related payments.  However, a significant Bill now before the D&aacute;il provides for payment of the State pensions <Col N="523"/>qualified adult allowance directly to a qualified adult for the duration of the period of entitlement of the State pensioner.  These provisions will apply to the State contributory pension, State transition pension and State non-contributory pension, and will come into effect from September 2007.  As most qualified adults are women, this decision will be of particular benefit to them as it will, in most cases, transform the payment into what is in effect a woman&rsquo;s pension in her own right as distinct from being a dependant allowance.  These payments will be made directly to the qualified adult.</P>
        <P>The issue of whether the social insurance arrangements accord with obligations to ensure equality in the social welfare system is to be considered in the context of a wide-ranging review of the social welfare code that is now under way.  The purpose of the review is to examine the entire social welfare code, namely, the schemes and services provided for in primary and secondary legislation as well as the administrative schemes operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to identify any instances of, or potential instances of, direct or indirect discrimination on any of the nine grounds identified under the Equal Status Act 2000, as amended, which are gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, membership of the Traveller community; and ensure that any difference of treatment on any of the discriminatory grounds under the Act are justified by a legitimate social policy objective, and that the means of achieving that objective is both necessary and appropriate.</P>
        <P>Phase 1 of the review involved carrying out a scoping exercise to identify the most appropriate approach and methodology for the review.  That exercise, which was carried out by consultants following a tendering process, is now complete and arrangements are being made for the main review, phase 2, to be put out to tender.  The request for tender document will issue shortly.</P>
        <P>The access of women to social insurance coverage, including those currently excepted from liability, will be considered in the review.  This is a complex undertaking, the findings of which will be addressed when the examination is finalised.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole raises this issue at an appropriate time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer.  That people might have mutual affection for each other and should not expect to be rewarded with a salary is quite an appalling suggestion to come from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Under the nine grounds cited in the Equal Status Act, this is discrimination on the grounds of marriage.</P>
        <P>One issue with which I did not deal and which I will not discuss at length now, namely, the idea of forming a partnership which involves allocating a salary, capital and part of the business, is <Col N="524"/>completely and utterly wrong.  It is discriminatory and unacceptable and affects many people unfairly.</P>

	<P>The largest dolmen and capstone in Europe is situated in Carlow.  It is a megalithic tomb dating back to the first inhabitants of the country, making it a great deal older than any of us in this House.  I was delighted to see a new interpretative centre opened at the Cliffs of Moher recently.  While I do not seek the same in Carlow, we need to enhance considerably the facilities at the Brownshill dolmen which comprise a small pedestrian walkway and car park with craters in it.  One could lose one&rsquo;s car in them if one did not watch where one was going.</P>
        <P>We could market the dolmen more than we do.  When I was teaching, I went on a local history tour ever year with the children, who loved it.  We are blessed in Carlow to have also a beautiful Romanesque archway in Killeshin, a round tower in Castledermot and a castle in Clonegal where the witches of Isis reside.</P>

We need to follow the excellent example of the Cliffs of Moher.  I believe there are caves in the Minister of State&rsquo;s area of east Cork.</P>

	<P>In that case he will understand the attraction of these sites.  Despite the inadequate facilities, hundreds of tourists come every year to see the dolmen.  We have no idea of the exact numbers but people from Germany and elsewhere come to see it because they are so in awe of the structure.</P>
        <P>The good news is that Carlow County Council has plans to purchase compulsorily the land around the area.  I ask that it receive every assistance in that regard.  We must market it much better.  Carlow is turning into a major tourism destination which was not the case 20 years ago.  Numerous hotels have been built there.  People who opt to go on short breaks and do not want to queue for hours in airports would prefer to drive for two hours to Carlow and get away from city life for a weekend.  The area needs to be put on the map.  If we did not have it, we would look for it and now that we have it, we do not exploit it as we should.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this House on the subject of Brownshill dolmen.  I am delighted to learn about it because I was not aware of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will send the Minister of State some photographs of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nice to learn what is available in other counties and areas.</P>
        <P>The Brownshill dolmen is located in the townland of Kernanstown and is visible from the public road.  I understand it is known locally as &ldquo;pagan&rsquo;s altar&rdquo;.  It is a national monument as defined under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004.  Its national importance is, as Senator Browne rightly states, of considerable historical and archaeological interest.  Only the dolmen itself, however, and a small area around it, along with a pathway leading to a nearby public car park are in the ownership of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The car park, off the main road, is owned and managed by Carlow County Council which is responsible for its maintenance.</P>
        <P>The Minister agrees that access to this national monument is somewhat difficult.  Senator Browne suggests it is more than somewhat.  One sets off from the public car park along a field boundary to the dolmen, but one must also bear in mind that its very isolation acts as a protection for the monument.  We continually strive to balance the protection of national monuments with a reasonable level of public access and interpretation.</P>
        <P>Discussions took place recently between the Department, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and Carlow County Council on the possibility of acquiring additional lands adjacent to the dolmen and the transfer of such lands into State care.  The intention was to improve the amenity and setting of the monument and to widen and improve public access to it as well as to provide improved interpretation signage.</P>
        <P>In the interim, the OPW continues to maintain both the public access and the area in State care directly around the monument.  The OPW has informed the Minister that it is not aware of any need for major conservation work to the site.  It is aware that there can be a problem with litter in the car park from time to time but this is a matter for the county council.</P>
        <P>The Minister is also anxious to see access to, and presentation of, this highly important monument being improved and has instructed his officials, in consultation with the OPW, to reactivate discussions with Carlow County Council with a view to addressing these issues and to seek to bring forward any necessary practical measures in this regard.  The Minister is confident that, between all parties, we can provide a better showcase for this magnificent national monument of megalithic provenance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for facilitating this debate because it is a most important issue.  As a politician, I am on a mission on two issues: child care and ageing and ageism.  I am inundated with requests from people who do not want to retire at the age of 65.  That age limit was introduced when life expectancy was not much higher than that.  People in the private and public sectors must retire at 65.  It should be a matter of choice whether one stays in one&rsquo;s job.  It is discrimination against a person who is probably at a peak in his or her life.  People in their 60s and 70s are at their peak, being experienced and wise.  This discriminatory legislation should be changed so that there would not be a guillotine on people&rsquo;s jobs when they turn 65.  To prevent someone staying on in his or her job at 65 if he or she wishes to stay denies that person his or her human rights.  The Minister should consider options for flexible or phased retirement according to the person&rsquo;s choice.</P>
        <P>I have spoken on this issue on local radio in Wexford and Waterford, following which provocative discussion people telephoned in.  I tell people this is a question of choice.  I am not saying everybody must work beyond the age of 65 but that the choice should be there for them to do so.  It is a contradiction when 50,000 new entrants are needed every year to fill posts in the Civil Service and public service.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This week on Midlands 103, I cited the Taoiseach and the Minister of State as perfect examples of this.  They both work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but if they were civil or public servants, they would be told when they reach 65 years that they no longer could continue in their posts.  This age discrimination has a negative and debilitating effect on those who enjoy the challenge of work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 introduced several changes in pension arrangements in the public service.  The principal aim of the Act was to secure the long-run Exchequer position by raising the pension age by five years for new entrants.  The changes introduced in the Act, including an increase in the minimum pension age by five years and the removal of the compulsory retirement norm of 65 years, apply only to those new entrants who joined the public service after 1 April 2004.  The Act does not cover commercial State bodies since they are not part of the public service, although they are normally covered in the inclusive definition of public sector to which the Senator has referred.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s demographic profile, with one of Europe&rsquo;s youngest populations, allowed the 2004 Act to confine these changes to new entrants.  This contrasted with reform elsewhere in Europe, where the pension terms of serving public service workers were adversely affected.  The savings which the pension and retirement age changes <Col N="527"/>will produce are, therefore, timed to peak at the time of real need &mdash; towards mid-century &mdash; when Ireland will have a large number of pensioners relative to workers and a correspondingly large pensions bill.</P>
        <P>The fixing of compulsory retirement ages in each area of the public service, such as education, health and local government, is a matter for the Ministers with responsibility for these areas.  A sectoral approach for staff already serving before April 2004 makes sense because the numerous factors influencing any decision to change the <i>status quo</i>, including manpower needs, service delivery, productivity, career progression, demands of the work and management capacity to cope with change, are likely to vary across the public service.</P>
        <P>The appropriateness of case-by-case consideration has been demonstrated in practice by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who recently introduced an increase in the maximum retirement age for the Garda.  Occupational requirements may justify lower retirement ages in certain professions, as in the case of prison officers.  It might also be appropriate in certain areas of the public service to consider limited retention beyond the normal retirement age to meet specific manpower exigencies without triggering the wholesale removal of the age cap throughout the organisation.</P>
        <P>The retirement age of those working in the Civil Service comes under the responsibility of the Minister of Finance.  The changes in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 were confined to new entrants who joined the Civil Service and public service after 1 April 2004 while the mandatory retirement age of 65 years was retained for pre-2004 civil servants.  This policy is based on several factors.  Ireland&rsquo;s demographic profile, with one of the Europe&rsquo;s youngest populations, allowed the 2004 Act to confine these changes to new entrants.  In light of these favourable demographics, no financial imperative exists to introduce changes to the terms and conditions relating to the retirement age of pre-2004 civil servants.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P Just="Left">The increase in the minimum pension age and the removal of the compulsory retirement age for new entrants cannot be managed in isolation.  Other Civil Service human resource processes must be adapted and developed to reflect the changes in the retirement age which must be supported by fully developed systems for the management of performance and career progression.  The performance management system, introduced across the Civil Service, is becoming increasingly embedded and will, in time, support the gradual transition to a situation where an increasing number of civil servants will be required to work until 65 years of age before drawing a pension and will have the right to continue to work beyond that age.</P>
        <P>A significant possible adverse effect of removing the compulsory retirement age for serving civil servants, while there is no evidence of short-term pressures on labour supply, would be to limit the career opportunities for existing staff and the employment opportunities for people wishing to enter the Civil Service by reducing the number of vacancies and promotions available in the Civil Service in any year.</P>
        <P>A recent claim at general council by the Civil Service unions sought the full removal of the retirement age for civil servants that were appointed before April 2004.  The claim was rejected for several reasons.  The cost imperatives which gave rise to the decision to change the pension and retirement age arrangements for new entrants would not arise in the short and medium term.  The relevant human resource processes and practices would have to be adapted over time to address the issues that would arise from the new arrangements.  In light of these points, it is not proposed at this time to remove the existing retirement age of 65 years for those officers who joined the Civil Service before April 2004.</P>
        <P>Increased protections provided for in the Equality Act 2004 are a very positive step forward in the broader issue of the treatment of older people in employment.  Removing the exemption contained in the 1998 Act that allows employers to set retirement ages in employment contracts is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
