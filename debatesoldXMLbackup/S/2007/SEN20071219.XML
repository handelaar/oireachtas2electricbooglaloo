      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received notice from Senator Corrigan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide a report on the commencement of inspections for residential facilities for children with disabilities, adults with intellectual disabilities and special needs, and unaccompanied minors.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to update the House on the provision of a new secondary school at Kinvara, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the timetable for the design and construction of the Sarsfield Road and Bandon Road flyovers on the N25 in Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Corrigan and Cannon as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Buttimer as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter, for which the National Roads Authority is responsible.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Social Welfare Bill 2007 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, earlier signature motion on the Social Welfare Bill 2007, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1; Nos. 3 and 4, motions re appointment of chairperson and ordinary member of the Standards in Public Office Commission, to be taken without debate <Col N="290"/>at the conclusion of No. 2; No. 5, Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of Nos. 3 and 4 and, if not previously concluded, to adjourn at 5.30 p.m. and resume on the conclusion of No. 13 at 7.30 p.m., and with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and the contributions of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, and Senators may share time; and No. 13, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 33 re substance abuse, which is an all-party motion, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to adjourn at 7.30 p.m., and with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and the contributions of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael is opposing today&rsquo;s Order of Business because two of the Government&rsquo;s proposals demonstrate a lack of respect for proper democratic procedure and debate in this House.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to push through a sensitive appointment to the Standards in Public Office Commission without any consultation with the Opposition, despite the legislative requirement to do so, is a serious issue.  The T&aacute;naiste has apologised for the oversight, but I do not think that is enough.  This proposal should be withdrawn from the Order Paper to allow the Government to engage in proper discussion with the Opposition.  Given the sensitive nature of this appointment, it should ideally be the subject of all-party agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about ethics, standards and the way we do business with regard to this body.  The desire for all-party agreement on such appointments is there for a good reason.  The process should not be rushed or conducted without consultation.  The last time such an appointment was made, there was consultation.  There are also issues regarding the appointment of someone who has recently held ministerial office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to withdraw this item of business from the Order Paper so that proper procedures can be carried out and a proper approach taken to the appointments to this important body.  The Leader might reply to us on this issue.  I will oppose the Order of Business based on Fine Gael&rsquo;s concerns about the way in which this is being handled.</P>
        <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 is being introduced today, leaving very little time for debate.  This Bill has three sections.  One of these amends the Medical Practitioners Act, which was only passed last year and, it would <Col N="291"/>appear, was not handled properly.  Again, this is an example of rushed legislation which now needs to be corrected.  The Bill also provides for a transfer of powers from the Minister for Health and Children to the Health Service Executive.  We have had many discussions in which Senators on all sides have expressed concern about the balance of accountability and responsibility between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  Finally, the Bill provides for the placement of agencies on a statutory basis.  We appreciate that this must be done but we suggest that it be dealt with in a separate Bill.  We also request that the Government publish the advice of the Attorney General on why the Bill must be rushed through.  Why now?  Are other bodies affected by this?  The legislation in this area was originally passed in the 1960s.  We want to know the reason for this urgency.  Is it a cover to obtain proper legal status for co-located hospitals?  Is that what is really going on?</P>
        <P>We have many concerns about rushing this three-pronged Bill through Second Stage in the Seanad today and through Committee Stage tomorrow.  We do not think it is a proper way to do business.  There is no reason this cannot be dealt with differently and more effectively.  On these two grounds Fine Gael will oppose the Order of Business today.</P>
        <P>There have been U-turns from the Government on learner drivers, the ministerial pay debacle, the child care subvention scheme and now on water charges for schools.  We all heard the Minister speaking on this issue this morning.  Is it possible to obtain some clarity on the Government&rsquo;s approach to this issue so that schools are not left over the Christmas period and into the new year not knowing the bills they will face?  What will happen to the schools who have received bills and what will happen to those who have paid?  What exactly does the Minister mean by a transition period?  All these questions were raised this morning and the answers were unsatisfactory.  Will the Leader ensure schools are given clarity on this issue as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Leader that I raised with him last week the difficulties I anticipated with the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill before we saw it.  I accept he was not aware of some of these difficulties at the time, but it is important to note this.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note the Government has done a U-turn on water charges for schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="292"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools should be advised that rather than holding the bills for the next two years, they should send them straight to the Taoiseach and let him deal with them because he is the only one who knows what is happening at this stage.  I congratulate my colleague Senator Jim Walsh, who was the only person to get a clear view of the whole thing and managed to blame the schools for the water charges.  A man such as he shows a great sense of analysis and perceptiveness in dealing with the problem.  I look forward to this matter being dealt with later on.</P>
        <P>On the question of the appointment of a person to the Standards in Public Office Commission, I do not want this to be a debate on the former Deputy, Michael Smith, who used to be a Member of this House, although that is not the issue.  This is a simple matter.  This person represents Members of the Houses on the commission.  We need someone on it to represent us.  We have had discussions and engaged with the commission every single year and have tried to obtain clarification on issues.  This is important and it must be above and beyond party issues.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously, the process must be one of full consultation and, if possible, full consensus.  I recognise there will not always be consensus on these issues.  This is certainly one reason the Independents should be consulted.  It would be appropriate to appoint a former Independent Member, such as the former Senator, Maurice Hayes, who is someone with experience in this area.  I am not proposing this, but we need to have a consensus.  The current situation does not reflect well on anyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>We need someone with experience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to cast aspersions on Michael Smith as he is an honourable person.  That is not the issue.  The issue is the process.  I want a debate on this.  I want everyone to go on the record, including the Leader&rsquo;s colleagues who, I am sure, feel the same as me, although when it comes down to it, they will be covered by the party Whip.  There is a process that must be followed, and we must have full consultation.</P>
        <P>This is an unusual week.  Senator Norris and I, and probably the Leader, will remember that this is the anniversary of the week in which we tried to rush through the rod licence legislation many years ago.  We said then it was wrong and it turned out to be so.  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill goes to the very core of what we do here as legislators.  It is in the area between regulation and primary legislation.  It raises the question of what a Department can do with regulations given to them under primary legislation.  Nothing is more important than this.</P>
        <P>I want to know the advice given by the Attorney General.  Is there a flaw or a lack of safety in the decisions that have been taken to <Col N="293"/>date under regulations?  If so, we must also deal with the regulations and not simply correct the mistake.  If I cannot have access to the written advice of the Attorney General, I want it explained in the House and I want to understand it.  Every Member this House has the same duty.  There are many people here who do not know the difference between statutory instruments, ministerial orders, regulations and so on.  This is crucial to the way in which we do our work.  If a Department uses a regulation to overstep the mark, it is doing something that was not contemplated by this Legislature.  We need to know and understand the facts.  We give the authority to regulate every single week and therefore we need to have a full understanding of the process.  We need to be certain in our minds that we can deal with it properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the challenge to the Order of Business as referred to by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole.  Senator Fitzgerald is correct in the position she has taken on both issues raised.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, as other speakers have pointed out, must be entirely above controversy.  That is the whole point of it.  We have had enough difficulties to know that if there is even the slightest controversy, the body will be undermined.  This is not a personal issue, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly pointed out, but we do not want a body as important as the commission to be in any way undermined by controversy.  The Government at the very least should pause the process and allow us to avail of the opportunity to obtain all-party agreement on the appointment to this important commission.</P>
        <P>I also support the call for a better opportunity to debate the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I suspect the Leader will tell us that every opportunity will be given to discuss the Bill in the House and that as many hours as Senators wish can be availed of.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is learning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>However, that is not enough.  It is not just a question of the number of hours to be allowed for the debate today and tomorrow.  The Oireachtas should not be a club.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned that people do not understand the difference between statutory instruments, ministerial regulations and so on, and he is right.  If people in these Houses do not appreciate these differences, what hope does the public have?  It is not simply a question of allowing more hours in the House.  Sufficient time must be allowed between the publication of an important Bill such as this and the debate on it in the Houses of the Oireachtas, especially the final Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="294"/>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?><Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>How is the public to appreciate what is going on?  They have no hope at all.  Resolving this issue will require more than allowing the House to sit late or, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, sit all night to discuss the issue.  It is not just a question of the time taken to discuss it in this House but the period of time the public has to appreciate such an important issue.</P>
        <P>Regarding U-turns and so on, I listened carefully to what Senator Mary White said yesterday about the community childcare subvention scheme but we should consider what the Minister said.  He pointed out that this was not a U-turn because it was what he intended to do all along.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a U-turn.  The Senator did not read the detail when he made his original statement.</P>

The tiered system that has been introduced is much more satisfactory.  It will mean that low income parents will be able to continue to receive subsidised community child care even if they are not on the family income supplement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Time is being wasted and if Members continue to do that, we will name people and they will have to leave the Chamber.  When Members are speaking I would expect that they would be given the same respect as others who spoke earlier.  Members cannot continually interrupt other Members who want to make a contribution in this House.  The point Senator de B&uacute;rca was making was important to her.  Members should respect that and listen to her.  They will have an opportunity to make their own points later.  I call Senator Healy-Eames.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate in the new year on the serious underfunding and staffing of primary schools.  It came to light yesterday at the Joint Committee on Education and Science that the capitation grants being provided to primary schools is meeting approximately 50% of the running costs, not including the cost of water, which increased them greatly.  The summer works scheme has been ended, which is incredible when one considers the number of jobs, including the fixing of boilers and roofs, done under the scheme throughout the country.  I understand the devolved scheme is under threat also and the supply of qualified primary teachers is uncertain, with 13,000 new pupils coming into the system next year.  We are on the brink of primary education falling apart.  Never was a debate on this issue more urgently needed and I trust the Leader will address that question early in the new year.</P>
        <P>I want to make a cross-party call to all my colleagues in this House on the issue of drugs.  I have not spoken on this issue heretofore but I am particularly concerned about the holiday period we are facing in terms of our young teenagers.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to call on all schools in the days prior to the Christmas holidays to have one dedicated session&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should read this evening&rsquo;s business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that but it is urgent, with the end of the school year approaching, to have one dedicated session on drug abuse and substance misuse prior to the Christmas holiday period.  I am concerned about <Col N="297"/>copycat episodes and the dangers to our young people, particularly our teenagers.  Our young people lack information and knowledge in terms of identifying and recognising signs.  I ask the Leader to come back to me on the issue this afternoon or tomorrow morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, an all-party motion will be moved in the House this evening on that issue and every Member will have an opportunity to speak on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to draw attention to a report published the day before yesterday, the Varney report on the review of tax policy in Northern Ireland.  Since 1921, no issue has united politicians of all shades of Unionism, Nationalism and republicanism and the business people in the North and the South as the urgent need for a 12.5% corporation tax in the North, which is the case in the South.  We need an urgent debate in the new year to try to put pressure on the British Government in this regard.  Sir David Varney&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;produced this report and his committee was comprised of Treasury officials who live in the United Kingdom, rarely step foot in Northern Ireland and therefore do not know the position in the North.  The Northern Ireland economy is mainly dependent on public sector employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We need an urgent debate to spark an all-island economy.  In the past few years politicians on both sides took risks with their careers and their lives to consolidate and get a peace process in place.  Sir David Varney is the spokesperson for Gordon Brown.  I knew in my heart that Gordon Brown would not go for this.  Tony Blair inferred he would do so.  We need a passionate debate here on consolidating the peace process and supporting the politicians in the North to ensure they get a 12.5% corporation tax.  That will ensure that when an investor in the United States or elsewhere in the world looks to this island they will see one tax rate.  People living in the Border counties in Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan cross the Border into the North to do their work on a daily basis and, equally, there are people in the North who cross the Border into the South.

	<P Just="Left">According to yesterday&rsquo;s ComReg report on the communications market, the average Irish person pays &euro;44 per month.  People might say that we talk more than <Col N="304"/>other Europeans but the French talk more than we do and they pay &euro;100 less every year.  It is not a case of <i>c&rsquo;est la vie </i>because there are four providers in the market and there has been increased usage so we should expect to have lower costs.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources and ask him to produce an action plan to bring down the costs?</P>
        <P>The latest decision regarding water charges for schools comes on the back of U-turns regarding provisional driving licences and Ministers&rsquo; pay.  I heard the Minister for Education and Science on the radio this morning and was less than impressed.  On her watch there was a school accommodation crisis in September, a problem regarding the summer works scheme last month and now the water charges are at issue.  The Minister is no longer the star pupil and, in teaching jargon, her past performance has been less than perfect, her present performance is continuously tense and her future performance is ever more conditional.</P>

	<P>I join the call for a debate on the regulation of the mobile phone market, especially because we are paying so much more than other Europeans.  I raised this several times during the last session when I noted that there was  a duopoly and no competition in the market.  That has changed and the Government should take strong action, just as it has recently on issues of concern such as deferral of pay for the Ministers, school water charges and the provisional driving licences.  The Government has acted correctly and it won the election.  In light of all that was said about it and put before them the people decided this was the best Government. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a certain level of hypocrisy abroad today.  Senator Mary White for example will not advance her avowed aim of helping to consolidate the peace process by describing Northern Ireland as a colony.  It would be interesting to see what would happen if interest rates were reduced in the North of Ireland and we lost investment here when international business investment travelled North.  There would be about as much rejoicing as there was when the Heathrow run was relocated from Shannon to Belfast.  There was not much all-Ireland sentiment on that day. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that Senator Frances Fitzgerald has proposed to oppose the Order of Business.  If we are serious about ethics we must make sure that everything is done in a proper, transparent, above board manner.  The <Col N="305"/>message of this manoeuvre is that we can bend the rules and fudge things.  It is astonishing that this should happen in the very body that is supposed to supervise standards in public office. </P>
        <P>There are two aspects to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  There is the tidying-up operation, about which the Minister for Health and Children says she believes the position is safe but she has been advised to make sure, which is fine.  One understands that.  She has, however, added in co-location, an ideologically driven matter, which should be separate.  I call on the Government to remove that section and let us get through the Bill.</P>
        <P>The whole business is rather confused.  The explanatory memorandum is not exactly a masterpiece of clarity.  It would be useful to ask our excellent research unit in the Library to do what is done in some other Parliaments, prepare an agnostic view, without taking sides but explaining the technical points and the context of the legislation to make it easier for us to consume.</P>
        <P>I am also confused about the water charges.  I heard the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, say this was not a response to a European directive but he was equivocating.  He was not being honest because he said it was decided by politicians which I take to mean that one of our Ministers was represented at the meeting where the decision was taken.  That still leaves it coming from Europe but France got a derogation, so it is not universal in Europe.  The problem raises a question of fairness, some schools have paid and some have been charged &euro;20,000.  We need prudent water management but what is the rush?  The place is littered with European directives which we do not implement until the last minute.  We have often been reprimanded for our tardiness so why move on this because it is beginning to look like a stealth tax?</P>
        <P>Senator D&eacute;irdre De B&uacute;rca was very engaging when she said that people do not quite understand what is proposed.  Why is the Government implementing something it does not understand?  That seems absurd.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Leader schedule time for the Minister of State with special responsibility for disabilities to come into the House?  In the budget, &euro;50 million has been allocated to people with disabilities.  This House should make it a priority to discuss the allocation and expenditure of that money, having seen what happened to the moneys allocated to the mental health services in the previous budget.  It has not yet been decided how the money for services for those with disabilities will be spent.  Members of this House have identified many worthy areas where that money could do a great deal of good. </P>
        <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, discussed the new child care subvention here he said that when the returns were completed he <Col N="306"/>would evaluate and amend the subvention on the basis of the information he received.  He returned last week and said the Department had received an 80% response rate.  This reached 90% by the weekend.  We should congratulate him on doing as he said he would.</P>

	<P>I strongly support Senator Frances Fitzgerald&rsquo;s opposition to the Order of Business for all the reasons she has advanced and for all the proper reasons outlined by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White.  We must admit that the appointment of a political personage to the Standards in Public Office Commission shows no regard for due process and appears high-handed.  When the former Deputy and Minister, Liam Kavanagh, was appointed we had consultation and debate and reached agreement in both Houses.  It will be sad if that is not attempted this time. </P>
        <P>Regarding the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the question of ministerial orders, we all like to hear the advice of the Attorney General when it is considered right that it be given.  I have no doubt his advice is correct but if there is a legal flaw, as appears to be the case, can the Leader tell us how this affects boards and agencies set up in other Departments?  For example, those under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may also be at risk.</P>
        <P>The transition period on the deferment of water charges seems to be somewhat indefinite so the Leader might give an indication of how long it will be.  Are these charges retrospectively illegal?  This is a serious legal matter that affects local authorities that have already levied and issued charges to schools and so on.  Local authorities are currently debating their budgets; what position will this leave them in?  I would like the Leader to address this.</P>

	<P>I wish to reiterate my call for a debate in this House on the economy, especially the housing market and its impact on the construction industry, which hosts many small and medium enterprises.  Last week I made the point that financial institutions should participate in such a debate.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the impact the global slow down has had on the Irish economy in 2007 and the likelihood that this will continue in 2008.  The availability of funds will be very important in stimulating industry and assisting those small and medium enterprises in construction for the housing market.  Recent media coverage has exposed the sins of one or two people regarding certain financial institutions and I am afraid that the regulations that may ensue because of this may <Col N="307"/>not assist the entrepreneurs who have been so successful in this area of industry.  I ask for the participation of financial institutions in this debate to give them the confidence necessary to continue to fuel what has been so successful over the past number of years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in requesting a debate on education matters as this week saw the publication of the feeder school list and regardless of one&rsquo;s view of such lists some strong points emerged.  Almost all of the so-called free schools in Ireland now deliver better academic performance for pupils than the so-called grind schools.  This is particularly relevant to this morning&rsquo;s discussion as the schools delivering superb performances are the very schools being let down by the suspension of the summer works programme, the U-turn on water charges that we are discussing this morning and the inability of this Government to deliver the necessary capitation funding.  When we debate this we must be clear on the extent to which these schools have been let down despite the superb performances they delivered.</P>
        <P>Regarding admissions policies, the feeder school list sadly indicates that many schools continue to refuse to admit some people because of their backgrounds and the difficulties and challenges they face.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, said she will initiate an admissions policy review but, while this is welcome, we need action on this matter.  I was very fortunate in the school I attended and believe I learned as much from my fellow students as my teachers.  It is crucial that we ensure a mix of pupils exists in every school in the country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>At this time of year it is important we raise the issue of Irish emigrants in London and other parts of the United <Col N="308"/>Kingdom.  It has recently come to my attention that those returning after 30 or 40 years in the UK are experiencing difficulties with the social welfare system here because they did not make contributions while living there.  It is not good enough that those who cemented this country through their earnings in another country, who fed, clothed and educated generations of Irish families and are now returning to retire in an Ireland they know little about are facing major difficulties in receiving social welfare assistance from the State.  In some cases individuals have been refused payment because insufficient contributions were made but surely the Minister could examine this matter with an element of compassion, taking into account what they contributed to the Irish economy in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when there was no money and there were no jobs for these people.  It is not acceptable that we should refuse them an element of financial assistance in their retirements.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I wish to respond to Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Regan, Norris and Coghlan on the Standards in Public Offices Commission.  The decision was taken by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen and in my opinion there is no more qualified person than the individual proposed.  I had the opportunity to serve on two occasions in Seanad &Eacute;ireann with Mr. Michael Smith and he is exceptional in that he was a member of a county council, a Senator, a D&aacute;il Deputy, a Minister of State and a Minister.  He served in this House with great distinction and did what few could do in topping the poll in two different panels in two Seanad elections.</P>

        <P>Senators Mary M. White, Leyden and Norris called for an all-Ireland debate on the economy and I have no difficulty in this taking place.  There have been various views on the 12.5% corporation tax, which is the one factor that makes Ireland seriously attractive.  It has been a significant help to us on this part of the island.</P>

	<P>Many of my colleagues from Northern Ireland, whom I know and work with, are working and operating down here, making the south of Ireland their headquarters.  If this is so, they are obliged to pay only 12.5% corporation tax.  The same applies to the multinationals now using Ireland as a base for right across Europe.  Ireland forms the headquarters for many companies with regard to research and development, marketing and accounting.  Such companies have to pay only 12.5% in corporation tax.</P>
        <P>These Government initiatives, along with directives from Europe, help our economy significantly.  This is one of the strong points for our fellow citizens in the North when seeking to set up here in the long term.  If we all spoke from our hearts, we would love to see our island united in education, the economy and many other ways.  I know we will see that day before we pass on to our eternal reward.</P>

Those who are members of that committee might take up the issue with the chair of that committee and see if they can get an urgent debate on the matter.  The Minister and representatives from ComReg and mobile telephone operators could be all in the one room to discuss the matter, and major progress could be made.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan requested that the Minister come to the House to discuss the spending of the &euro;50 million allocation in the budget for disabilities and I hope this could happen.  This might be mentioned by the Senator on Second Stage of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, as the Minister will be present.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on the economy, particularly as it relates to the construction industry.  I read in a newspaper this morning that a bunch of apartments in Ashtown were completely sold out because the price was reduced by &euro;100,000 per apartment.  It appears, therefore, that if there is value for money, the market is still sound.  There is a serious challenge ahead for the construction industry, which was a major player in the first and second parts of the Celtic tiger.  I have no difficulty in getting the Minister to come to the House after the Christmas recess for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy called for the appropriate Minister to approach sympathetically our Irish emigrants who are now returning, particularly with regard to social welfare contributions.  This is timely because the Minister will be in the House this morning to take the Social Welfare Bill.  Perhaps this very point can be made to him at this festive time of Christmas.  We are fortunate that we were able to gain employment and have a job in Ireland in our lifetime.  I was at school in a class of 37, 31 of whom emigrated.  I believe three came home at the end of their working lives to retire in Ireland.  That has been the case in every village and town across the country up to the past 12 or 14 years.  As someone who worked in the postal service, I know what it was like to deliver the registered letters with the money from the husbands being sent home to the wives to rear the families in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  What the Senator has said today is certainly true from my experience.</P>

It is not possible to make a consolidated version on the Department&rsquo;s website for ease of reference.  The best time to consolidate them is <Col N="316"/>now when the number of amendments is relatively few.  The Pensions Board offers a consolidated version of the Pensions Act on regulation to certain clients.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also informally consolidated texts of key Acts on its website.</P>

	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  All social welfare and pensions Acts since 2001 are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Future Acts will similarly be published on the website.  Acts are also published on the Irish Statute Book website.  It would not, however, be appropriate for the Department&rsquo;s website to contain an informal consolidation of the Social Welfare Acts because of the lengthy and detailed procedure involved.  The Law Reform Commission has published a consultation paper on Statute Law restatement.  The Department participated in the public consultation process leading to the paper and will continue to participate in the Statute Law restatement programme with a view to enhancing the accessibility of social welfare legislation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Some non-national workers are experiencing difficulties when claiming benefits because of the difficulty in tracking down insurance records in their home countries.  Perhaps applicants should have a warning on their claim.  Will the Minister of State provide a report on the arrangements in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment because it is inappropriate for inclusion in legislation.  In particular, it is inappropriate for this Bill which only deals with budget increases.  All other items which are appropriate for legislation will be dealt with in a separate Bill in the new year.</P>
        <P>The Department has increased significantly the volume of information exchange in recent years with European Union countries and with countries that have bilateral agreements with Ireland <Col N="318"/>on social security.  There has been a significant increase in the number of migrant workers and the response rate to requests for information from these countries vary for different reasons, such as whether the records are centralised or regionalised in the other country or if there is a difficulty with a particular person&rsquo;s record.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Overall, the Department is not experiencing significant difficulties in obtaining such records.  If delays are encountered in a specific case and the records are required to enable payment of a basic payment such as illness benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, a person normally will be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.  The EU is preparing for the introduction of electronic exchange of information designed to simplify and speed up this process but the projected date for this to become operative is 2009.</P>
        <P>According to the information available to me I see no need for the Department to undertake an examination of the issue or for a report to be made to the House.  If the Senator has specific information regarding difficulties experienced, perhaps this information can be forwarded to the Department.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the rationale for keeping Qualified Child Allowances at a low level over the past decade.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to qualified child allowances.  Will the Minister of State provide a report on the continued justification for deliberately keeping qualified child allowances at the low rate of &euro;24 per week?  This policy appears to date back to 1996.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The qualified child increase, previously called the child dependant allowance, is paid to social welfare recipients in addition to a personal and, where appropriate, qualified adult increase.  Unlike a wage, the level of qualified child increase varies according to the number of qualified children in a family.  The result is an increased disincentive effect on larger families as their social welfare loss would be greater on transferring from welfare to work.  Owing to this disincentive effect the policy direction followed by successive Governments from 1995 to 2006 was to dedicate substantial resources to child benefit, which is employment neutral, <Col N="319"/>while maintaining the qualified child increase at 1994 levels.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;1.27 billion was invested in the child benefit scheme during the period 2001 to 2006, making the overall child income support more neutral <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the employment status of the parent, thus ensuring more parental choice on working inside or outside the home where the retention of child income supports is concerned.  The shift towards child benefit has been substantial, from a position where child benefit represented 27% of the total child benefit or qualified child increase payment to 63%.  In other words, following the child benefit increases, a family will now lose only 37% of their child income support when moving into full-time employment.</P>
        <P>In the ten years from 1998 to 2007 the lower and higher rates of child benefit increased by 300% and 266%, respectively.  This compares with the consumer price index of 43.4%.  Having achieved a significant degree of employment neutrality in the provision of child income supports and while continuing to increase child benefit rates, recent budgets have seen the concentration of additional resources on more targeted payments, specifically to families who are dependent on welfare supports, including low earning employees with children.  In addition, there has been a significant improvement in the in-work family income supplement scheme in recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In view of the above and factors such as the introduction of the national minimum wage, the disincentive effect of the qualified child increases is less compelling.  It was decided also to reduce the number of qualified child income rates from the existing three rates to one uniform amount.  Consequently, the 2007 budget provided for all three qualified child increase rates which had remained unchanged since 1994 to be increased to a single rate of &euro;22 per week.</P>
        <P>Although any improvement in the qualified child increase can still constitute by definition an increased disincentive, the effect should be set against the situation which pertained in 1994 when, for instance, the qualified child increase element represented 27% of the total jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for a family with two parents and two children.  In contrast, even after the 2007 increases, it represents less than 13%.  When the qualified child increase for a two child family is judged against the gross average industrial earnings, it represents 7% compared with 10% in 1994.  These changes continue the more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on any arrangements whereby claimants under the Social Welfare Acts are not provided with payments for the first 3 days of any claim and the continued justification for any such practice.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would like a response from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the amendment.  The waiting days have been a feature of the illness benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s payment schemes since their inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.  The application of a three-day waiting period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs involved in processing large numbers of claims for a very short duration.</P>
        <P>The waiting day rule is not applied in every case.  Where a person is subject to intermittent spells of interruption of employment, clearly it would be unreasonable to impose the three waiting days for each benefit claim.  In the case of illness benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, spells of interruption of employment are aggregated so that the waiting period is confined to the first three days of the aggregate period, subject to the rules of linking.</P>
        <P>Linking rules provide that any two periods of unemployment not separated by more than 26 weeks are treated as one claim and payment may be made from the first day of the later claim.  The linking period for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is 52 weeks instead of 26 weeks.  Linking rules apply in a variety of ways across schemes.  Where a person claims illness benefit immediately following an unemployment benefit claim, for example, a person who has no other income is not left without support during waiting days.  A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report <Col N="321"/>on the implications of excluding Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from the means test for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance, known as the BSCFA scheme, provides payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.</P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have a household income at below standard levels.  In line with other secondary benefits, a means test is applied to ensure limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  Apart from a number of exceptions, all household income, including welfare payments such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, is assessable as means under the BSCFA scheme in accordance with the normal assessment for supplementary welfare allowance.  The exceptions to these rules are that any income received in the form of family income supplement, higher education grants or the first &euro;120 of earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature is disregarded for the purposes of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Final figures for the numbers of applications received and awarded for 2007 are not yet available from the HSE.  Current indications are that 85,000 plus families with approximately 174,000 plus children will benefit from the scheme this year at a cost of &euro;40 million.  This is an increase on the figures for 2006, when some 80,000 families with 161,000 children benefited at a cost of &euro;23.5 million.  This increase can be mainly attributed to the significant level of publicity given to the scheme this year in the media and through the other information services operated by the Department.  The Department has increased its publicity in this area to ensure that as many families as possible are aware of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is a demand led scheme and statistics are no available on families who might satisfy the qualifying conditions for the allowance but who have not applied.  The rates were increased in last year&rsquo;s budget to &euro;180 for children aged two to 11 years and to &euro;285 for those aged 12 to 22 years, an increase of &euro;60 and &euro;95, respectively, on 2006 rates.  In this year&rsquo;s budget the Minister has increased the rate by &euro;20 to &euro;200 for children two <Col N="322"/>to 11 years and to &euro;305 for those aged 12 to 22 years.</P>
        <P>We consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  We are satisfied that improvement to the scheme in recent years, namely an increase in income limits and an increase in the rates of payment respectively, provide a major boast to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.  Any changes to the structure of the scheme, rates of payment, income limits or amendments to the qualifying criteria would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to the Department for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of providing Carers with a full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance for every person they care for.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will the Minister of State provide a report on providing carers with a full rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for every person they care for because currently claimants are not paid double even if they care for two people?  That is the basis for the amendment.</P>
        <P>There was never such disharmony between North and South Riding previously.  Although I understand it is not personal, I would be delighted in Christmas week if the Minister of State accepted even one of these amendments because there is a good solid basis for their introduction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Prendergast.  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 8.  The rates of payment for carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit have been increased significantly in recent budgets.  Since January 2007 the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit has been &euro;200 per week for those aged under 66.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged over 66 is currently &euro;218 per week.  As a result of improvements provided for in this year&rsquo;s budget all of these rates will increase by &euro;14 per week from January 2008.  People caring for more than one person receive a higher rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and from January 2008 a person aged under 66 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance who is caring for more than one person will receive &euro;321 per week, an increase of &euro;21 per week over 2007 rates.</P><Col N="323"/>
        <P>In June 2005 the respite care grant was extended to all carers providing full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care regardless of the person&rsquo;s means or social insurance contributions.  The grant is also paid to people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  In recognition of the particular challenges which are faced by those carers who are providing care for two or more people, since June 2005 the grant has also been paid in respect of each care recipient.</P>
        <P>The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased significantly.  In this year&rsquo;s budget the Government provided for an increase of &euro;200 in the level of the grant so that from June 2008 the grant will be &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient.  Last year&rsquo;s budget provided for significant structural reforms whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit who are also providing someone with full-time care and attention can retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Similarly, people currently in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  These new arrangements which came into force in September 2007 apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments including State contributory and non-contributory pensions, widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory or non-contributory pension, and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.  Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance also qualify for the household benefits package and the free travel scheme.</P>
        <P>The spirit of goodwill was in existence since September last, long before we reached Christmas 2007.  The Minister will keep supports for carers available from the Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of extending qualification for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to any person who provides care to such an extent that the care recipient would require nursing home care or signifi<Col N="324"/>cant professional assistance if they were not receiving assistance from the person.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is a need to relax the qualifying criteria for carer&rsquo;s allowance in the case of the onus to provide full-time care and attention so that carers satisfy this condition if, in the judgment of the deciding officer, the carer&rsquo;s work saves that person from being cared for by State nursing home care or significant professional assistance.  Approximately 15% of carers are refused the carer&rsquo;s allowance on the basis that they are not giving full-time care and attention.  In most cases in our experience this is because of the distance they are from the person for whom they are caring or because the care recipient wishes to hold on to some form of independence, for instance, he or she might not want help with dressing or cooking.</P>
        <P>There are no specific guidelines on the length apart, in distance or in time, that a person must be to quality for carer&rsquo;s allowance but the Department provides a general list of tasks that it expects each carer to carry out.  Many carers go through the long application form on which there are 69 questions, which is a little onerous, only to be turned down at this point.  While accepting that every case is different, there should be clear criteria for full-time care and attention rules so that applicants know where they stand before they apply.  I would argue that there should be a relaxation in the criteria that allow carers qualify where the carer saves the State a nursing home place, which is significantly costly as the Minister of State will probably agree.</P>
        <P>On the essential question of whether the care recipient would require nursing home care or significant professional assistance if he or she was not receiving assistance from the applicant, I ask the Minister of State to provide statistics on carer&rsquo;s allowance applications that were refused.  These might be helpful in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant is that the person is providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes was increased from ten to 15 hours per week in June 2006.  It is worth noting that the 15 hour rule represents a relaxation of the full-time care and attention requirement.  A further increase to the number of hours which a person can work and still qualify of payment would dilute the full-time care and attention requirement.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme was extended to accommodate care sharing situations.  Under these arrangements it is possible for week <Col N="325"/>on, week off care sharing arrangements to be facilitated.  This means that where two carers are providing care to the same person on alternative weeks, the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the annual respite care grant can be split between them.</P>
        <P>It would not be possible for the Department to establish the number of people currently receiving care at home who would otherwise need nursing home care.  The Minister will keep the supports for carers available from his Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure that commitments on income support are delivered.</P>
        <P>According to Census 2006 there are approximately 50,000 people providing care for more than 29 hours per week, that is, just over four hours per day.  Approximately 19,600 of these are classified by principal economic status as being at work.  At present there are over 34,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  A total of 42,000 also received a respite care grant for 2007.</P>
        <P>Census 2006 does not give information regarding the number of hours worked by people in employment.  However, a significant proportion of the 19,600 people classified as at work would be working more than 15 hours per week and, as such, they would not satisfy the full-time care and attention requirement for carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>In summary, according to the census, 15,000 people care for people for more than four hours per day.  In 2008, it is expected that approximately 39,000 people will be in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and 2,000 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Weekly payments will, therefore, be made to 41,000 people who provide full-time care and 8,000 people who do not get either the carer&rsquo;s allowance or the carer&rsquo;s benefit will get respite care grants.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to address what we see as an anomaly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  Credited PRSI contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of insured workers by covering gaps in insurance where workers are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods of unemployment, illness or caring.  In order to qualify for social insurance credits, a person must have previously worked and paid PRSI at an ordinary or modified rate of contribution, must have paid or credited contributions in the last two contribution years and must show evidence of underlying entitlement to the contingency giving rise to the credited contribution, namely, illness, unemployment, maternity, etc.</P>
        <P>Under the current statutory provisions governing the award of credited contributions, recipients of the carer&rsquo;s allowance may be awarded credits if they switch to that payment from another credit bearing payment, for example, a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  There is also provision for the award of credits to claimants of carer&rsquo;s allowance who have left insurable employment to engage in caring duties.  The award of credits is subject to certain conditions.  For example, when a person has no paid or credited contributions for a period of two years, they cannot be awarded further credits until 26 contributions are paid.  In recognition of their caring role, this rule will be waived where claimants of carer&rsquo;s allowance were eligible for homemaker&rsquo;s disregards immediately prior to claiming carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P><Col N="327"/>
        <P>Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance who are not entitled to credits may be eligible for homemaker&rsquo;s disregards, which preserve the carer&rsquo;s entitlement for contributory pension purposes.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme provides that contribution years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person will be disregarded in calculating a person&rsquo;s yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes.  The provisions apply for the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1994 and up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded.  In addition, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme provides for homemaker&rsquo;s credits to be awarded for the balance of the tax year in which the person leaves the workforce and from the beginning of the tax year to the date of re-entering employment.  It is worth noting that recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance can engage in employment or self-employment for up to 15 hours per week and still be eligible for payment.  This applies to those who do not pay PRSI contributions on the same basis as all other employed people.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 1 month of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the progress of the National Carers Strategy.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I seek this amendment because of the disregard of the Government for carers and because the promises of the Towards 2016 agreement will not be brought before the House by the end of the year.  Yesterday we were told we would have the proposed report by the summer.  The summer lasts a long time.  Will we get it in early or late summer or can the Minister of State give me a specific date?</P>
        <P>We spoke in great detail on this issue on Second Stage and I acknowledge the comprehensive answer provided.  Carers are wonderful people who save the State &euro;2.1 billion by keeping their elderly and disabled relatives out of nursing homes and hospitals.  I urge the Minister, therefore, to lay a report on the national carers&rsquo; strategy before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership <Col N="328"/>agreement, Towards 2016, is the development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy.  This commitment is reiterated in the programme for Government.  The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues, such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.</P>
        <P>Co-operation between relevant Government Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason, all relevant Departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy.  There will also be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  Department officials have been in discussions with their colleagues in other relevant Departments in order to decide on the best approach to the development of the strategy.  An inter-departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, is being established to develop the strategy.  The Minister expects the strategy will be completed by the summer of 2008.  We aim for July 2008, on the completion of the D&aacute;il and Seanad session.</P>
        <P>The recent improvements in income supports available from the Department represent major improvements in supports available to carers in the community.  Speakers here have not acknowledged the serious level of support provided to a number of carers throughout the country in their homes.  People who need that support get it from this Department and the Department of Health and Children through the HSE and home care packages.  We also aim to reduce the numbers who avail of long-term residential care in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The development of the national carers&rsquo; strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas where progress can be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the levels of support available to young carers.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I acknowledge the fact that carers did receive an increase.  However, &euro;14 is not a huge amount of money, particularly when one considers the cost of living.</P>
        <P>I note the position in respect of the respite grant but I have concerns about the latter because people are not using it for its designated purpose and, on foot of the low amount they receive each week, are instead using it as a top up.  We must ensure respite grants are used for respite pur<Col N="329"/>poses.  In other words, there must be capacity in the system to allow carers to take holidays.  We should not just provide a token amount.  Otherwise the grant will be merely seen as a once-off annual payment designed to make up for the fact that the weekly payment is so inadequate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As stated on Second Stage, I am particularly concerned about young carers.  There are 5,433 carers between the ages of 15 and 19 who were completely ignored in the budget.  Adolescents need to spend time on their education and personal development and they also must be allowed to socialise with their friends.  I am aware of many young people who have deferred college courses and decisions relating to their careers in order to care selflessly for their elderly relatives.  I call on the Minister of State to take to heart the needs of these individuals and to take action in respect of the commitment made in Towards 2016 to engage in research on young carers and provide a programme for their specific needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It is one of the merits of the respite care grant that use of it remains at discretion of carers.  The Department does not request accountability as to how the money provided is spent.  I would like that flexibility to remain within the scheme.</P>
        <P>Caring Before Their Time? &mdash; Research and Policy Perspectives on Young Carers, the report published by Barnardos and the Children&rsquo;s Research Centre in September 2004, indicated that of the estimated 3,000 carers providing care at that stage, there were more than 300 carers between 15 and 17 years of age who were providing it on a full-time basis.  The report also recommended that further research should be undertaken in respect of the numbers of young carers, the supports available to them, the nature of their needs and the impact of their caring role on their education and general development.  It further recommended that policy relating to young carers should be a matter for the Department of Health and Children and that services should be delivered by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 commits the Government to undertaking a study of the extent to which children undertake inappropriate care roles to establish the extent and degree to which this issue arises and the level of impact it has on the lives of the children concerned.  It further states that based on the outcome of this study and an analysis of the issues that come to light, a programme of in-home supports will be developed to alleviate specific problem areas identified in respect of children.  The Office of the Minister for Children intends to commission this study in 2008 following consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies.  Although my Department does not have the lead role in respect of this study, its officials will engage with it as appropriate.</P>
        <P>With regard to income supports for young carers, the respite care grant and carer&rsquo;s benefit <Col N="330"/>are payable from age 16 and carer&rsquo;s allowance is payable from age 18.  However, special help, advice and support are essential for young carers who are often caring for parents.  In particular, services must be put in place to support households and ensure that young carers remain at school.  These include the services of home helps and public health nurses and the provision of home care packages generally, which are a matter for the Department of Health and Children and the Health Services Executive.  It is through the provision of these health and education services rather than income that we can best support young carers.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the levels of support available to young carers.&rdquo;.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  The living alone increase is an additional payment of &euro;7.50 per week made to people age 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity-type schemes.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.</P>
        <P>The living alone allowance has not been increased since 1996 because for many years the policy regarding supports for pensioners has been to give priority to increasing personal rates of pensions rather than focusing on supplements such as the allowance in question.  The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible.  This approach was continued in 2008, with increases of up to &euro;14 and &euro;12 per week granted in respect of personal rates.  Since 2002, the level of the contributory State pension has increased by more than 50%.  This improvement has had a marked impact on the living standards of older people, enabling them to face the future with a greater sense of security and dignity.</P>
        <P>The Department monitors regular statistical releases such as the EU survey of income and living conditions, EU-SILC, to track the effectiveness of income policies.  The 2006 EU-SILC report, which was published recently, shows that the position of older people improved significantly from 2005 to 2006, with the at-risk-of-pov<Col N="331"/>erty rate falling from 20.1% to 13.6%.  Furthermore, the number of people aged 65 and over at risk of poverty was significantly lower than the figure for the general population, which stood at 17%.  The estimated cost of increasing the living alone allowance by &euro;1 per week is &euro;8.4 million per annum.</P>
        <P>The needs of older people will remain a priority for the Government.  Further reforms and improvements will be considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, which was published on 17 October.  A major consultation process on future pensions policy is under way.  Following its completion, the Government will develop a framework in respect of future pensions policy.</P>
        <P>The allowance is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs pensioners face when they live alone.  However, the downside is that this is lost when they need to live with someone else.  As pointed out on Second Stage, people often avail of support from their families in the context of being cared for and move in with relatives.  These people lose the living alone allowance as a result.  The Government and the Department saw fit to continue to significantly increase personal rates of pension on an annual basis rather than concentrating on increasing the living alone allowance, which has its limits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the position regarding a person who lives alone and who does not move in with his or her family?  Surely an increase should be provided in respect of his or her living alone allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision taken at the time was based on the fact that the numbers of people who live alone as they grow older tends to diminish.  The trend is that these individuals move in with their families.  Thankfully, their telephone allowance and other benefits remain in place but they lose the living alone allowance.  The amount provided through the allowance is small but personal rates of pension have increased annually.  We are very proud of our record in respect of the latter.  We are of the view that we used our best discretion at the time.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on administrative options to reform the Rent Supplement Scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a serious issue and I tabled the amendment because I am seeking support for people liv<Col N="332"/>ing in rented accommodation.  A review must be carried out in respect of the existing system.  Under the current scheme, rental supplement is paid in arrears to recipients, which places them on an uneven footing <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other tenants who are able to provide their landlords with deposits and the first month&rsquo;s rent up front.  Landlords will choose people who can pay immediately rather than those awaiting the payment of rent supplement.  If landlords are considering requests from the latter to commence tenancies with them, they should not be obliged to wait for the rent to be paid in arrears.</P>
        <P>Some tenants are forced to top up their rent with additional payments to their landlords, which is in breach of the conditions attached to the payment of rent supplement.  As we are all aware, that is going on in every part of the country.  However, tenants often have no option other than to make such payments.  If they refuse to do so, they run the risk of losing their tenancies and putting their rent supplement in jeopardy.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to reduce long-term reliance on rent supplement.  This will be done mainly by keeping the standard means test for rent supplement under review to provide enhanced financial incentives for people taking up employment, or other professional options, and providing long-term housing solutions under the rental accommodation scheme, etc.  Improvements in the means test were implemented in June 2007.  If a person has an additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income, together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75, is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those who return to work, or participate in the training schemes, are better off as a result of taking up such opportunities.  Rent supplement may continue to be paid to a person in full-time employment, as long as they satisfy the improved means testing arrangements I have outlined and have been accepted as having a long-term housing need under the rental accommodation scheme.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement and all other supplementary welfare payments are paid in arrears.  The cost to the Exchequer of paying rent supplement in advance would be approximately &euro;33 million.  Advance payment of rent is possible in exceptional circumstances, through the exceptional needs payment, at the discretion of community welfare officers.  Exceptional needs payments can be made to cover rent deposits, if necessary.  That over 59,000 people are receiving rent supplement indicates that the system is not problematic &mdash; it is not restricting those who need the assistance of rent supplement when seeking accommodation in the current rental market.  There is no evidence of tenants making complaints about refusals to <Col N="333"/>the Department or the HSE.  The current rent limits will apply to the period between January of this year and June of next year.  Data published by the Central Statistics Office indicate that rents are stable at present &mdash; they fell by 0.2% in September and were unchanged in October.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the removal of the Habitual Residence Condition from the Child Benefit payment.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment aims to assist 3,000 people whose incomes are so small that their children are being deprived of the most basic and fundamental necessities, such as food, clothing, schoolbooks and over-the-counter medicines and Christmas toys, and who do not qualify for child benefit under the habitual residence condition.  It is grossly unfair that existing Government policy excludes the children of those in receipt of direct provision from the advantages of the child benefit system.  It directly contradicts the Government&rsquo;s policy on the reduction of child poverty and is in breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Ireland in 1992.  Countries which sign up to the convention promise to protect the rights of all children within their jurisdictions without discrimination of any kind, including any prejudice based on their parents&rsquo; status.  Therefore, the Government&rsquo;s approach is somewhat contradictory.  Article 26 of the UN convention states that every child has a right to benefit from social security.  Children whose parents do not qualify for child benefit under the habitual residence condition are expected to survive on &euro;9.60 per week, which would hardly buy a bar of chocolate.  As I said yesterday, the chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council has argued that the Government&rsquo;s policy in this area is having a dehumanising effect &mdash; it is pushing people further into poverty and isolation and causing stress and heartache.  Given that the number of people affected is quite small, the Minister of State should be able to examine this matter, open her heart and take appropriate action.</P>

	<P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment, which seeks to deal with an issue I have raised on a number of occasions.  I <Col N="334"/>launched a campaign over a year ago to seek to restore universal child benefit to the children of asylum seekers who are being dealt with under the direct provision programme.  The campaign is co-ordinated by the Free Legal Advice Centres and supported by a range of non-governmental organisations involved in children&rsquo;s rights.  As Senator McFadden said, the imposition of the habitual residence condition and the subsequent denial of child benefit is seriously disadvantaging these children and their parents.</P>
        <P>When I raised this matter on the Adjournment some weeks ago, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, told me that children in direct provision are regarded as having a payment being made to them.  The Government considers that payments under the direct provision scheme are somehow equivalent to, or in substitution for, payments under the universal child benefit scheme.  When one looks at the figures, however, that simply cannot be the case.  As Senator McFadden said, the parents of children in direct provision are entitled to just &euro;9 per week whereas those who can avail of universal child benefit in respect of their children receive approximately &euro;250 per week, which is significantly more.  The denial of child benefit to this relatively contained group of children &mdash; less than 3,000 people are affected &mdash; is in breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Government&rsquo;s stated policy on the alleviation of child poverty.  It is potentially in breach of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, in which the Government pledges to allocate additional resources to help tackle child and family poverty.  This benefit is supposed to be universal &mdash; it should be made available to every child in the land, irrespective of the means or status of their parents &mdash; but it is being denied to the disadvantaged children I have mentioned.  I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes, including the child benefit scheme, with effect from 1 May 2004.  That condition was introduced to ensure that people who have not worked in Ireland, or have not established habitual residence here, should not be able to avail of assistance schemes, such as child benefit.  I am satisfied that the condition is achieving its intended purpose, which is to allow people who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence to access social welfare schemes while preventing unwarranted access by those who have little or no connection with the State.  The operation of the condition was reviewed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2006.  It is not intended to introduce any changes to the current policy in this regard, as the original reason for the policy is still valid.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the UN <Col N="335"/>Convention on the Rights of the Child was obtained before the habitual residence condition was introduced.  It was pointed out that the convention allows national law to prescribe the manner in which the needs of children are met.  The requirements of the convention in this respect are adequately met by the alternative child benefit provisions in place in Ireland for those whose <Col N="336"/>habitual residence is established.  Direct provision is made available for those in need whose habitual residence has yet to be determined.  Therefore, the application in this country of the UN convention to child benefit is consistent with the provisions of the convention.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a second-tier, employment neutral, child income support payment to target child poverty levels.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the increase of &euro;100 per year, even if it will not come into effect until April.  The early child care supplement was announced by the Government in 2005.  The intention of the <Col N="336"/>Government was to help parents with child care costs.  Will the Minister elaborate on that?  I am aware she spoke at length yesterday about it and therefore I will not repeat the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the amendment.  An unacceptable number of children remain in consistent poverty and the Government remains focused on further substantially reducing child poverty.  The level of commitment in this area was particularly prominent in the 2008 budget in which was announced a range of targeted measures and supports, costing more than &euro;147 million in a full year, specifically to benefit children in low income families and families on welfare.</P>
        <P>In the context of the overall review of targeted child income support payments, the National Economic and Social Council was asked by the Department of the Taoiseach to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with child dependant allowance, and possibly including other child supports such as the <Col N="337"/>back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, which committed to completing consideration of the issues within one year.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment on paternity leave, an issue on which I have spoken previously in this House.  There is a real need to consider introducing paternity leave.  The Minister spoke yesterday about changes to parental leave but paternity leave should be regarded as something different from parental leave because parental leave is an entitlement for both parents.  Paid paternity leave is important and if we were to introduce it, it would underline our commitment to recognising the role of fathers in the workplace, give fathers a stand-alone right, in respect of their right to parental leave, to take paid leave from the workplace, and send out an important message about gender equality.  On a day when a conference on gender equality is taking place in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham highlighting the ongoing disparities between men and women in the work<Col N="338"/>place, it is important that we consider taking steps to try to address this issue, and paid paternity leave would be a huge step towards that.</P>
        <P>We should also look to our neighbouring jurisdiction, Britain, where paid paternity leave has been introduced.  Tony Blair was one of the more high profile people who took it up.  Britain introduced paid paternity leave for a period of two weeks, which does not come anywhere near the period for paid maternity leave and benefit but is a step in the right direction, and we should examine the possibility of introducing something similar in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made regarding this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  Responsibility for matters relating to paternity leave rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The question of social insurance funded payment for paternity leave would be contingent on an underlying entitlement to statutory parental leave.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The introduction of paid parental leave or paternity leave would have significant cost implications for employers and-or the Exchequer and the social insurance fund. Any proposal to introduce such payments would have to be examined with regard to its effect on the sustainability of the social insurance fund and employers&rsquo; costs in terms of global competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Under Towards 2016, the Government and social partners are committed to a review of a level of statutory entitlements to maternity and paternity leave before the end of 2008.  A working group will be shortly established, led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to progress this commitment.  The work of the group will be informed by the commitment of the agreed programme for Government.  These include increasing paid maternity leave by five weeks over the next five years, all leave after the first 26 weeks being made available to either parent and examining the introduction of a statutory entitlement to paternity leave and shared parental leave.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the implications of extending the free travel scheme to include other services providers and improving free travel benefits for people in rural areas.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="339"/>
        <P FLI="0">Everyone aged 66 years and over, living permanently in Ireland, is entitled to free travel.  Certain people under that age are also entitled to free travel.  It is available on all State and public transport and a limited number of services operated by private bus transport companies.</P>
        <P>In many rural areas, however, the elderly are dependent on public transport but often these services are infrequent, restricting people from moving about easily.  Will the Minister extend the free travel scheme to include other service providers and that public transport in rural areas is a more reliable and efficient?  The rural transport initiative operates successfully in County Westmeath but it does not scratch the surface in providing a proper service for the needs of the elderly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The free travel scheme permits travel on most CIE public transport services, Luas and a range of services offered by a large number of private operators.  Some 19 private transport operators are involved in the scheme, providing services to free travel pass-holders.  It is open to private transport operators to apply to the Department for inclusion in the scheme.  All applications are considered providing the operator holds a valid passenger licence from the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>The Department provides funding through the rural transport scheme in recognition of the carriage of free travel pass-holders.  Funding of &euro;1.5 million was provided for the programme in 2007, with a similar amount provided for in 2008.  The scheme, managed by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Transport, encourages innovative community-based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas to address social exclusion by lack of access to transport.  It is acknowledged free travel pass-holders benefit from the programme, particularly those who had no access to public transport prior to the establishment of the scheme.  The free travel scheme benefits 64,000 customers at the cost of &euro;64 million per year.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the payment of the fuel allowance as a once-off bulk payment.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The fuel allowance is paid from the end of September to the end of April each year.  It represents a contribution to a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.  It was never <Col N="340"/>intended to meet the costs in full.  Improvements to the allowance in recent years include the easing of the means test and extending the duration of the payment from 26 to 29 weeks.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance from &euro;9 to &euro;14 and &euro;17.90 in designated smokeless fuel areas.  This year&rsquo;s budget increased the rate by &euro;4, from &euro;14 to &euro;18 and &euro;21.90 in designated smokeless fuel areas.  The primary social welfare rates were also increased to keep in line with inflation.</P>
        <P>A detailed review of the fuel allowance was carried out in 1998 and the review examined alternatives to the weekly payment method, including a single lump payment.  A survey of recipients of the allowance on a customer panel showed that a majority, 58%, preferred weekly payment; only 22% wanted the lump sum payment.  Up to 12% favoured direct debit to a supplier while 8% would rather have two lump sum payments during the fuel season.  The review recommended continuing with the current payment system.  The Minister will keep all aspects of the scheme, including the lump sum payment, under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage Senator Doherty and I referred to fuel poverty and the report from the Institute of Public Health which stated Ireland had the highest levels of winter mortality in Europe with an estimated 2,800 more deaths over the winter.  Accordingly, 44% of these excess winter deaths are directly associated with poor housing standards, people living in poor, damp and thermally inefficient houses.</P>
        <P>I feel strongly about the vulnerable in our society.  It is not acceptable that some people are living in cold and damp conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>Fuel poverty is described as the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because of the energy and efficiency of the home.  The Green Paper on Energy Policy, published in October 2006, stated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing fuel poverty.  This issue will be further addressed as the current energy policy formulation process develops through the Green Paper consultation phase and White Paper publication and implementation.</P>
        <P>Last year, it should be recalled, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, increased the units of electricity in the free electricity allowance for welfare recipients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>A detailed review of the fuel allowance was carried out in 1998.  A survey of recipients of the allowance on a customer <Col N="341"/>panel showed that a majority, 58%, preferred weekly payment while only 8% would rather have two lump sum payments during the fuel season.  As a result the Department kept the scheme as arranged.  The Minister is open to reviewing this arrangement at a later stage.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a national waste waiver system for all low-income households administered through the social welfare system.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A new report by the Combat Poverty Agency has highlighted the need for a uniform approach to the application of waiver arrangements for waste collection charges for low income and poor households.  Such waivers should be available from all refuse collection operators, both public and private.  Senator Cassidy and I are aware of the good waiver system in County Westmeath but, as it is under constant review, there is a danger it will be removed.  Several factors need to be assessed, for instance eligibility for a waiver, the proportion of the discount, the application procedure and a clear decision-making and appeals system.  There should be a national payment to the local authorities, or through the social welfare system, to allow people avail of the waiver, which is a good system and directly helps those who are worst off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Local authorities have the power necessary to operate the waiver schemes and most do so.  The introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would not be feasible given the wide range of charging arrangements, regimes and cost structures that exist for waste management throughout the country.  Charges vary across the local authorities, and within local authorities where there is more than one provider.  In addition, some local authorities and private operators also operate waiver schemes but the qualifying conditions for these schemes also vary.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before <Col N="342"/>each House of the Oireachtas, a report on improving women&rsquo;s entitlement to the full State Contributory Pension.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State said in her speech yesterday that women who are not entitled to a contributory pension would benefit from the qualified adult allowance.  These women have been hard done by because of their responsibilities in the home.  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on this if she could lay before the House a report on women&rsquo;s entitlements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  There has been a range of reforms to the social welfare system over recent decades which make it easier for people, and women in particular, to qualify for contributory pensions.  The Government has taken action to improve the position of those who do not qualify for a pension in their own right but are supported as qualified adults on the pensions of their spouses or partners.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the rate of the qualified adult payment to the level of the non-contributory State pension over three years.</P>
        <P>There are also many older women who for various reasons cannot benefit from the many changes outlined.  Their position, together with that of others not covered by the social welfare pension system, and the implications of providing for them are discussed in the Green Paper on pensions published on 17 October.  We await the outcome of the public submissions in response to the Green Paper to which everyone, Members, women in that situation and others, are welcome to make a submission.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the level of use and take up of the Family Income Supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Sadly, the family income supplement has been unsuccessful.  It attempted to support families at work on low pay but the take-up is a long-standing problem.  Recent research by the ESRI suggests that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants receive family income supplement.  This was introduced in 1984 and it is stunning that 22 years later the take-up has remained a fraction of its potential throughout that period.  There are no suggestions why 60% or more eligible families did not receive the sup<Col N="343"/>plement.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on this and hope she can outline some suggestions for improving the take-up by those who are eligible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The information reaches people through public campaigning and advertising.  The Department has publicised the scheme consistently to maximise the uptake by qualified families.  Following the significant improvements in the qualifying income limits in the 2006 budget the Department undertook a week long nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take-up of the scheme.  This, combined with the improvement in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims and, consequently, claims for renewals.</P>
        <P>The Department has received 35,945 new and renewal claims to the end of November 2007 and has decided on a total of 29,840 cases.  At 24 November 2007 there were 10,746 claims awaiting decision.  These comprised 5,100 new claims and 5,646 renewal claims.  The average time it takes to award a claim or renewal is 14 and a half weeks.  We are impressed and pleased with the uptake of those claims, showing that the awareness campaigns were successful.  The Department has commissioned a research project to examine the factors behind the level of take-up for the scheme.  This is at tender stage and is expected to be completed in July next year.</P>

    <Title>Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by thanking the Seanad for considering this Bill today.  Before going into the detail of the Bill, I will explain its urgency and I hope Senators will agree that the Bill is important and deserves positive consideration from this House.</P>
        <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 is urgent because of the need to address, without any delay, matters concerning bodies established under the Health Corporate Bodies Act 1961 and technical drafting issues identified regarding the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the 1961 Act, the Minister for Health and Children is empowered to make orders establishing bodies to carry out a range of health services and activities.  Currently, there are 19 such bodies established under the 1961 Act playing extremely important roles right across the spectrum of the Irish health system.  These include major hospitals, such as St. James&rsquo;s, Beaumont and St. Luke&rsquo;s and other bodies which deal with specific key health care areas, such as the Blood Transfusion Services Board, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Drug Treatment Centre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, will the Minister&rsquo;s speech be circulated?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="346"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be.  I apologise to the Senator.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The related public expenditure involved in the operation of these bodies is very substantial at approximately &euro;900 million. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is also one of these bodies and, when examining the adequacy of powers of the Health Service Executive to fund the new board, the Attorney General indicated that a more fundamental review of the constitutional status of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961 was required.  He commissioned external legal counsel to assist his office and wrote to me with his considered advice on 26 October indicating that the broad powers conferred on the Minister could possibly breach Article 15.2 of the Constitution, which vests power for making laws for the State in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>His strong recommendation was that, as a matter of urgency, primary legislation was needed immediately to confirm the orders establishing these bodies as if the orders were Acts of the Oireachtas.  Work commenced immediately to draft the Bill, including the Schedules.  There was no delay since the end of October.</P>
        <P>The legal advice also has implications for bodies set up under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971.  The Government considered that matter yesterday and has decided to draft similar confirming legislation to cover orders made under the 1971 Act.</P>
        <P>I should stress at this point that it is not a question of health corporate bodies currently having &ldquo;no legal basis&rdquo; as some have described it.  These bodies were properly and transparently constituted under the 1961 Act by way of Statutory Instrument.  However, given the advice and recommendations from the Attorney General, Senators will appreciate that prompt action was required.</P>
        <P>The first step is today&rsquo;s Bill to confirm the orders for existing bodies and related matters.  The Attorney General also expressed other concerns about the 1961 Act, including the retention of a power by the Minister to establish bodies to perform functions regarding the provision of health services, the circumstances in which the power may be exercised and the nature and limits of the functions which may be conferred on such bodies.  These matters will require further time and attention.</P>
        <P>Given the immediate need for certainty as to the status and powers of bodies established under the Act, the wide range of crucial and fundamental health services provided by the bodies and the very substantial public expenditure involved in their operation, it was decided to prioritise matters for the present Bill.  For that reason, the Bill before us today confirms the orders made for existing bodies and related matters, acts carried out by former bodies and provides for related matters.  The Government intends to bring forward another Bill dealing with the other matters raised by the Attorney General in 2008.</P><Col N="347"/>
        <P>Before outlining other aspects of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I will briefly put into context the 1961 Act.  It was enacted by the Oireachtas to allow transparency and oversight in regard to the establishment of health agencies while allowing flexibility to act quickly when required.  It has served the health services well over the past 45 years but the standards of legal engineering are different now from 46 years ago, when the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act was put into law.</P>
        <P>I was first in a position to brief the Opposition and to speak publicly about the Bill last Thursday.  I have been open about every aspect of the Bill then and now, and I welcome the opportunity to set out the provisions and make clear the purpose and value of each section.  The Bill is straightforward in its purpose in all respects and involves no policy change and no additional charge on the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes provisions amending the Establishment Orders for St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals to put beyond doubt the capacity of those hospitals to enter into co-location arrangements.  The technical amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 will facilitate the phased commencement of significant provisions in that Act and the moving from the old regulatory system to a new and better regulatory system.  There is also a small technical amendment to the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <P>As I have stated, provisions are also being included in the Bill to put beyond doubt the legal capacity of St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals to enter into co-location arrangements.  These provisions have attracted some attention because of co-location policy itself, and it would be useful to put the policy, as well as the provisions, into context.</P>
        <P>It was clear back in 2004 that there was a need for a comprehensive and consistent approach to the assessment of a variety of proposals for private developments on public hospital sites.  There were proposals at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont themselves, and Waterford and Limerick, for example.  Prospectus Management Consultants were engaged by the Department of Health and Children in the autumn of 2004 to advise on an appraisal framework which would both encourage private investment in the acute hospital sector and promote and protect the public interest.</P>
        <P>My colleagues and I had increasing concern over the extent to which the level of private practice in public hospitals was exceeding the ratio of 80:20 agreed with the medical organisations.  Approximately 2,500 beds in public hospitals are designated for use by private patients but the level of private elective admissions to public hospitals was running at about 35% of the total.  This was affecting the ability of public patients to access public hospitals and contributing to longer waiting times for public patients.</P><Col N="348"/>
        <P>I was not and am not prepared to allow these and other factors lead to a position where private patients receive priority access to public hospitals at the expense of public patients.  This called for innovative thinking and out of this the co-location initiative emerged.</P>
        <P>The essential idea underlying co-location is the freeing up of capacity for public patients and the delivery of new public acute beds quickly and most efficiently.  The initiative was founded on the principle that all patients ordinarily resident in the State should have access to public hospitals based on medical need and that the possession of private health insurance should influence neither timeliness of access nor treatment.</P>
        <P>A diversity of providers of hospital care is commonplace in many countries and is entirely appropriate.  We also will be capable of using the new privately-managed facilities for public patients to supplement, not to supplant, public service provision, just as we do via the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  In principle, I believe all hospital capacity that meets standards and offers value for money should be capable of being used for all patients.</P>
        <P>The Government endorsed the initiative in July 2005 and the policy directive I then issued to the HSE required the executive to undertake a rigorous value-for-money assessment of co-location proposals which would take account of the value of the public site, the cost of the tax foregone etc.  The HSE had to satisfy itself that proposals represented better value for money than building, commissioning and operating beds in the traditional way.  The HSE and the National Development Finance Agency have confirmed that the tenders received for six sites provide value for money and that the projects are in a position to move to the financial close.</P>
        <P>There are detailed and innovative features to promote the public interest which deserve particular mention.  There will be one accident and emergency department on each site and the private hospitals will facilitate medical training and research and development.  They will accept direct admissions to medical and surgical admission units from primary care centres and general practitioners on a 24 hours a day, seven day a week basis.  They will comply with physical design requirements to fit with the public hospital.  They will have joint clinical governance, shared information and records management, performance management and documented service level agreements, where these are undertaken.  They will participate in the public HIPE and case mix information systems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Provisions are included in the Bill to put beyond doubt the legal capacity of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital to enter into co-location arrangements.  There was some legal analysis suggesting these hospitals already have the necessary powers in their statutory instruments to enter into co-location arrangements.  Another view was that amending the statutory <Col N="349"/>instruments would have been a safe way to proceed.  Just to be clear, the constitutional status of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act did not form part of that legal analysis.  However, given the wider change now in the present Bill to reinforce the health corporate bodies in primary legislation, the prudent course of action now is to put the matter beyond any doubt and expressly to amend the orders relating to the two hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Bill amends certain matters regarding the transitional provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 was signed into law earlier this year.  The main objective of the Act is to provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of the medical profession, which will satisfy the public and the profession that all medical practitioners are appropriately qualified and competent to practise in a safe manner on an ongoing basis.  The advice from the Office of the Attorney General is that some technical amendments are required to strengthen the transitional provisions of the Act which will allow for the nomination and election processes provided for in the Act regarding the new medical council to take place as early as possible in the new year following which the other provisions in the Act will take effect on a phased basis.  That is what is being done in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendments are essentially technical in character.  The substantive provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, including enhanced lay membership of the Medical Council, registration processes, fitness to practise procedures, and new provisions relating to medical education and training at basic and specialist level, and regarding maintenance of professional competence, remain unchanged.  I am anxious that there should be an orderly handover from the outgoing Medical Council to the new, and that there should be an orderly, phased implementation of the Act in general.</P>
        <P>Having carefully considered the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, I am proposing that immediate action is taken at this time by way of primary legislation because of the importance of the Act for both the medical profession and the protection of the public.  It is very much in the public interest that the necessary amendments are made as a matter of urgency.  My Department has been liaising closely with the Medical Council on the implementation of the Act, the preparation of the election regulations and related matters.  It is appreciated that the need to amend the Act has placed additional responsibilities on the current council.  I have already expressed my appreciation to the president of the council regarding the co-operation of the council in this process.</P>
        <P>I will now set out the main provisions of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007.  Part 1, sections 1 to 4, are the preliminary and general sections.  Part 2, sections 5 to 9, deal with health corporate bodies.  Part 3, sections 10 to 20, amend <Col N="350"/>the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Part 4, section 21, amends section 38 of the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <P>Sections 1 and 2 are standard technical provisions stating that the Act may be cited as the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 and setting out the definitions uses.  Section 3 is a standard provision on the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 4 repeals section 70 of the Health Act 2004.  Section 70 of the Health Act 2004 allows the Minister to dissolve a health corporate body by order and transfer its functions to the Health Service Executive.  However, once a body is confirmed under the present Bill, it cannot be dissolved by order but must be dissolved by primary legislation and, on this basis, section 70 is to be repealed.</P>
        <P>Section 5, Part 2, is a key element of Part 2 of the Bill regarding health corporate bodies.  It confirms establishment orders made under the 1961 Act for current bodies and provides that these orders have statutory effect as if made in primary legislation.  One of these existing bodies is the National Social Work Qualifications Board established under the 1961 Act to carry out a range of functions regarding the validation of qualifications of social workers.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and registration boards to regulate and register members of designated health and social care professionals, including social workers.  Section 83 of that Act provides for the dissolution of the National Social Work Qualifications Board, as its functions will be carried out by the council and the relevant registration board when it is established.  Subsection (4) is therefore designed to enable the Minister to dissolve the board in line with the provisions of the 2005 Act despite the fact that the board is one of the bodies that will be confirmed under this legislation.  Subsection (5) takes account of the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 which provides for certain staff to continue in employment after the age of 65.</P>
        <P>Section 6 confirms that validity of acts carried out by former bodies in accordance with their establishment orders.  Section 7 and the associated Schedule, Schedule 1, amend the establishment orders for existing bodies which are currently funded by the Health Service Executive to reflect the actual role of the executive in its capacity under the Health Act 2004 and the health reform programme.  Some ministerial functions are therefore transferred to the executive while the executive&rsquo;s current role is given effect in other instances, subject to ministerial oversight.  Establishment orders for St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals are also amended to put beyond doubt the legal capacity of these hospitals to enter into co-location arrangements.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>Section 8 is a technical provision relating to funding of bodies by the Minister.  The section does not apply to National Haemophilia Council which is funded by the Health Service Executive and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which is currently funded by the Minister but is to be funded by the executive.</P>
        <P>Section 9 is a technical provision to take account of the provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 whereby accounts of bodies are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General who submits the audited accounts, with a report, to the Minister who in turn lays them before the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The next ten sections in Part 3 amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Section 10 explicitly provides for a phased implementation of the repeal of the Acts specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1, and the revocation of the statutory instruments specified in Part 2 of Schedule 1, on different days.  Section 11 clarifies the definitions of key terms relating to registered medical practitioners provided in the Act of 2007.  Section 12 provides for the clarification of the provisions in the 2007 Act relating to the continuance in being of the Medical Council and for the continuation of any work commenced but not completed under the 1978 Act including, in particular, fitness to practise inquiries.</P>
        <P>Section 13 provides clarification regarding specialist registration in the context of the first election process; provides explicitly for the termination of the membership of the current Medical Council by providing that a person who was a council member immediately before the first appointment of the new council will cease to be a member unless he or she is one of the persons so appointed; and allows for the council to perform any functions assigned to it by the Act of 1978.</P>
        <P>Section 14 clarifies that the Medical Council may charge fees for the retention of a medical practitioner&rsquo;s registration.  Section 15 is a transitional provision which clarifies which medical practitioners should be registered in which division of the new register including those medical practitioners who, immediately before register establishment day, were already registered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners.</P>
        <P>Section 16 provides that medical practitioners are deemed to be registered on the register if their names are entered on the General Register of Medical Practitioners immediately before the register establishment day.  Section 17 provides that a medical practitioner who is subject to disciplinary proceedings under Part V of the Act of 1978 may not seek, during the transitional period, to evade sanction being imposed on him or her by the Medical Council by applying to have his or her registration removed under section 52 of the Act of 2007.  Section 18 provides for the clarification of the provisions in the Act of 2007 regarding the consideration of complaints by the <Col N="352"/>preliminary proceedings committee.  Section 19 provides that a Medical Council member may not hold office for more than two consecutive terms and membership of the existing council will count towards reckoning the membership period.  Section 20 refers to the consequential amendments set out in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>Section 21 in Part 4 is a technical amendment to section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  Schedule 1 sets out the details of the amendments to the health corporate body establishment orders amended in accordance with section 7.  Schedule 2 sets out consequential amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act, referred to in section 20, relating to when each of the relevant sections becomes effective.</P>
        <P>I thank the Seanad for giving its time to this urgent Bill the purpose of which is straightforward.  In the case of the provisions concerning bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, it is better to be safe than sorry.  This Bill will safeguard and ensure the lawful status of key bodies operating in our health system.  The amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act will result in the smooth transition we are seeking to the new system under the Act by strengthening the transitional arrangements which will apply to the regulation of medical practitioners.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time in the past year and also in the run-up to the general election when the subject of co-location was discussed, the Minister and her colleagues said on a number of occasions it was not the intention to dispose of the land in public ownership within the sites of public hospitals and where co-location was being considered.  For all this, the Bill as initiated states that a new article is being inserted to amend Article 4 as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The following article shall be inserted after Article 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;4A.(1) The Board may, with the consent of the Health Service Executive, enter into an agreement with one or more persons for the provision by any person (in this section referred to as the &lsquo;private undertaking&rsquo;) specified in the agreement, on land vested in the Board, of hospital services that are not paid for primarily out of public moneys.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) An agreement to which paragraph (1) applies may include provision for&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(a) the construction of buildings and facilities on land vested in the Board for the purpose of the provision of services referred to in that paragraph,</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) the disposal of land or an interest in land by the Board or the Health Service Executive for the purposes of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) the said construction, and</P><Col N="353"/>
        <P LI="3">(ii) the provision of those services by the private undertaking[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">This seems to be a contradiction of the commitment made by the Minister.  She seems to disagree but it appears to me to be a contradiction that private land will now be up for public sale.  I refer to the bodies involved in co-location which include the Mount Carmel Group, the Beacon Medical Group, operated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre, which is to be in co-location with Beaumont Hospital, and Synchrony Healthcare, operated by Ramsay Health Care Limited, which is to be in co-location with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  If this Bill is not giving permission to sell those lands, what is it doing?  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation as this is what the Bill&rsquo;s provisions seem to be doing.</P>
        <P>A number of issues arise with co-location but one of the concerns at the time of the introduction of this concept by the Minister was the disposal of public lands and this legislation appears to copperfasten that possibility despite the promises made.  This is a serious issue regarding co-location.</P>
        <P>I regret this legislation is being rushed through the House at the end of the term.  There is very little time for real debate to take place on the issues raised by the Bill.  While the Minister has assured the House that advice has been sought from the Attorney General, this legal advice has not been published.  I call on the Minister to publish the advice because the question arises why this has come to light now.  Has it come to light as a result of the co-location issues as opposed to some of the other issues which the Minister raises in the Bill?  This is an umbrella-type Bill which deals with the medical practitioners legislation which was only brought to the House a year ago and is already coming back.  If this is an example of rushed legislation, it is quite possible that the Bill before us today will also return to both Houses because of the hurried nature of its passage.</P>
        <P>The Minister said the Bill is being introduced to deal with a legal anomaly which could result in the 1961 Bill being constitutionally challenged.  Is the Minister aware of any possible challenges to any of these 19 bodies named in the legislation and as a result of this constitutional query?  Is this the reason for bringing this legislation to the House?  We should be provided with adequate explanations for the rushed nature of this Bill as this legislation has been in place since 1961.</P>
        <P>I support the need to put on a statutory footing the various bodies associated with the health service.  If the need for this emergency legislation is to afford such bodies a statutory basis, however, why not introduce a separate Bill specifically addressing this matter, instead of having it piggy-back, so to speak, on a number of other measures?  Why is it necessary to include co-location in this Bill?  My colleagues in the other House pursued this issue yesterday and we <Col N="354"/>are still not convinced of any compelling reason this should be dealt with in this legislation.</P>
        <P>The departmental note on the matter was somewhat misleading as it outlined that the reference to co-location is merely to put beyond doubt the legal capacity of Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s hospitals to enter into co-location agreements.  The legislation goes well beyond this, however, by establishing the legal capacity for hospitals to enter into co-location agreements and goes further by enabling the sale of public land to private health care operators, many of whom are international operators.  This is a shift in Government policy.  I question the need for legislation in this regard if legislation was not required in the case of the sale of land at St. Loman&rsquo;s.  Why does this legislation need to be brought before the House now when public lands have been sold before in different circumstances which did not require legislation?  Is there a difference in the composition of the boards of St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals?  I ask the Minister to give a clear response on this issue to clear up a number of concerns on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>The co-location policy brings us much closer to Boston than to Berlin in our approach to the health service.  I know this is the Minister&rsquo;s philosophy and it is another step towards the Americanisation of the Irish public health system.  She has not addressed the significant concerns about the impact of co-location on the financing of the public hospital system.  There are concerns about training and about how professional teams will move between the two systems.  People on the front line have many questions which have not been answered.</P>
        <P>I refer to the VHI annual report for 2006 which explicitly stated there was no need for further private beds.  The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il yesterday that the new privately managed facilities will be used for public patients to supplement rather than supplant public service provision.  In many ways, the Minister&rsquo;s plans in this area will supplant rather than supplement the public service provision and could lead in the longer term to a real undermining of public service provision in the health service.  The Minister might be better off providing the 3,000 extra public acute beds which were promised more than six years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have referred to the Medical Practitioners Act which was rushed through the Oireachtas in 2007.  Why was this issue not dealt with at the time?  What new information has come to light with regard to the Medical Practitioners Act?  Have concerns about the Act been expressed by the Medical Council?  Why is there a need to address it one year later?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This legislation proposes a different arrangement for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I reiterate the concerns expressed by many about the site chosen by the Minister.This issue was recently raised at the Joint Committee on Health and Children where <Col N="355"/>Professor Drumm discussed the transport issues but was far from reassuring to the people of west Dublin and beyond who currently use Tallaght and Crumlin hospitals, both of which are going to close as a result of the decision that was made to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the Mater Hospital site.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my concerns about the golden hour, which is a well established principle which states that some children in emergency situations need to get to hospital within an hour in order to have their lives saved.  Children&rsquo;s lives are put at risk by the proposal to leave the south west and west side of Dublin and patients from Kildare without an overnight paediatric bed.  If the Minister is intent on going ahead with the proposal to open a facility in Tallaght it should be a 24-hour facility, not one that is open from 9 a.m. to 5 a.m. or 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also attempts to address issues within the Health Act 2004.  Again, that Act was presided over by the Minister when she established the HSE.  In many cases the Minister is replacing the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; with &ldquo;HSE&rdquo;.  It would have been appropriate to have a discussion about the relationship between the Minister and the HSE in terms of accountability and responsibility.  When it emerged that many women were being recalled by the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise it was evident that there was no line of accountability between the Minister and the HSE.  It was very unclear as to who was responsible.</P>
        <P>Effectively, what we had in the committee was two groups of personnel, the Minister and her staff from the Department of Health and Children and senior staff members from the HSE.  One side clearly did not know what the other was doing.  There was no line of accountability or responsibility.  It is proposed to make the roles interchangeable in the Bill even though we have not had a debate about who is responsible.  That is the key issue.  We need more accountability, responsibility and clarity about who is in charge.</P>
        <P>It will be difficult to regain the confidence that has been lost, especially in regard to breast cancer facilities.  That is not something which is possible to recover easily.  A concerted effort is required to build up confidence in the system in order that women feel they can rely on the assessment and diagnosis they receive.  One of the key aspects of handling this matter is to answer the question of who is in charge of what issues and where the responsibility lies.</P>
        <P>I regret the fact that three different areas are being addressed in the Bill.  I also regret the lack of time.  As Senator Alex White indicated this morning, it is not just a case of more time in this House, it is also necessary to provide more time in order to allow the media report what is being done so that there can be reaction to it and that those who are interested in this area can have an opportunity to talk to parliamentarians and give <Col N="356"/>their response to the legislation.  All of that is being denied by the way the Minister has chosen to introduce the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister called for a Tallaght strategy-type approach to the health service in certain areas.  She has been in a position to introduce the kind of changes she wanted without any Tallaght strategy and that has not been done.  Introducing legislation in this manner, without publishing the legal advice and without giving adequate time between the different Stages of the Bill is not treating the Houses of the Oireachtas in the way they should be treated.  This is not the way to introduce legislation and expect support for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House once again and I am pleased to contribute to the Bill.  As the Minister pointed out, various bodies associated with the health service are governed by the 1961 Act.  Legal advice now suggests that this legislation is faulty and could be unconstitutional.  The Bill is sensible and seeks to put right and prevent problems in the future.  As the Minister indicated in the other House yesterday, it is comforting to know that all the bodies being dealt with in the Bill were properly and transparently constituted under the 1961 Act and they have operated well to date.  However, the Government cannot ignore the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, which was given last October that a more fundamental review of the 1961 Act was required.  No pragmatic or capable Government could ignore legal advice of that nature.</P>
        <P>Unlike the Opposition spokesperson who is condemning the Minister, I compliment her and her officials for the speed in which they got the Bill to the Houses, given that the legal advice from the Attorney General was only received six or seven weeks ago.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to the need for more time.  It is no wonder her party is in Opposition because if it were given all the time it has sought, it would get nothing done.  I dread to think in what kind of state the country would be if her party were in power.</P>
        <P>The main gripe of the Opposition parties with the Bill is the inclusion of co-location.  It is nauseating to hear them griping in this manner all the time.  I do not know what the hysteria is about.  A general election was held only six months ago.  The outgoing Government of the Progressive Democrats and my own party, Fianna F&aacute;il, supported the co-location of hospital facilities.  The main Opposition parties opposed it.  The people spoke and the Government parties won a resounding victory and we are back in Government.  The issue has been dealt with in that co-location has been given the green light by both the Government and the people who voted for it.  We should move on.</P>
        <P>It is important to refer to the merits of co-location.  As the Minister indicated, it will result in the freeing up of 2,500 beds in public hospitals, 20% of the total public hospital bed capacity. <Col N="357"/> However, it is worrying that private elective admissions take up 35% of the total capacity.  The Minister is correct and very brave in saying she is not prepared to let these factors lead to a situation where private patients receive priority over public patients.  That is not fair and it should not be allowed.  Co-location is a wonderful idea.  The main Opposition parties are mad not to buy into it and support it.  The Minister referred to direct admission to surgical and medical units.  One of the best aspects of co-location will be the location of general practitioners on site on a 24-7 basis.  These are the kind of measures we have to move towards introducing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the legal disposal of sites to allow for the construction of private hospitals.  Senator Fitzgerald can rest assured the Minister is not going back on her word and she may get some comfort from this information.  I have been told that to dispose legally of an entity means to lease.  My understanding of the matter is the lands are not being sold off; they will be leased.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out, the amendments to the Medical Practitioner Bills are essentially technical.  According to the advice of the Attorney General they are necessary.  In the main they relate to the transition period.  This will ensure an orderly transfer from the existing council to the new one that will come into force.</P>
        <P>It is only nine months since we enacted the Medical Practitioners Act.  Senator Fitzgerald is correct that it was introduced in the past year but I disagree that it was rushed through the Houses.  That is far from being the case.  The Act, which is still in existence, is almost 30 years old and needed changing.  Every medical practitioner in the country was screaming out for change.  I was a member of the previous Medical Council, on which I sat for five years, and everybody was crying out for a change in this.</P>
        <P>I repeat that the Minister was brave.  Many of her predecessors would have kicked to touch on it.  Nobody wanted to touch it and it was let continue.  We are worse the wear for that because cases like the Dr. Michael Neary case, which blew us all apart, made people sit up.  The Minister was brave for introducing this amendment to the House and I commend her for that as well.  It was in need of reform and it will be changed.  I am pleased the Minister expressed her appreciation to the president of the Medical Council for the board remaining in office for a few extra months to facilitate the orderly transfer of powers from the current council to the new one.</P>
        <P>The Minister has gone through the main points of the Bill.  I will not rehearse them but I look forward to contributing to Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the concerns expressed by Senator Fitzgerald about the lack of time we have had to review and scrutinise the provisions of the Bill.  There has been undue haste with the way in which it has been brought before us, in particular, because there is such a raft of amendments that the Bill purports to make, not just in the sections but also in the Schedules, and particularly in Schedule 1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Schedule 1 contains a host of retrospective amendments to different statutory instruments some 30 or more years old.  Therefore, to consider the Bill as amending legislation one also needs to look at the amendments that are being introduced in this way through a raft of statutory instruments.  That involves procedural difficulties and I would like to have had more time to look through those statutory instruments than the way in which this is being done.</P>
        <P>On the wording of the statutory instrument, Senator Feeney referred to the issue of disposal, but &ldquo;the disposal of land or an interest in land&rdquo;, which is the wording used in Schedule 1 referring to the powers of the boards of St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals, could clearly be either by lease or by sale, and Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s concerns are well founded in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wanted to focus my remarks on the implications of the Bill for co-location, about which the Minister has spoken.  Clearly, there was a concern that the board of St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals would need a more solid legal basis in order to back up the decisions on co-location that the Minister has favoured.  It would be of considerable value to us to see the legal opinions on which the Bill, and especially section 7, has been based.</P>
        <P>We have not seen the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice.  We do not have an outline of it, nor do we have senior counsel&rsquo;s opinion, which I understand was also given in respect of this.  It seems that section 7, if passed, would purport to amend a raft of statutory instruments retrospectively, including SI 187 of 1971 relating to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital board and SI 258 of 1977 relating to Beaumont Hospital board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Leaving aside for a moment this dubious procedure of engaging in such a substantive series of retrospective amendments of statutory instruments, I want to look at the merits of the co-location idea in itself.  In her speech, the Minister indicated that co-location is based on what I would describe as a fundamentally flawed premise, that is, first, the Department of Health and Children was looking originally in 2004, as the Minister stated, &ldquo;to advise on an appraisal framework which would both encourage private investment in the acute hospital sector...&rdquo;.  I would suggest that it is driven, first, by an ideological interest in encouraging private investment in health care.</P><Col N="359"/>
        <P>Second, the Minister stated that there was a concern that the level of private practice in public hospitals was exceeding the ratio of 80:20 which has been previously agreed and that more beds were being given to private patients in public hospitals than had been intended.  However, the solution to this is to tackle the two-tier health system itself rather than to reinforce it through co-location.  It is clear &mdash; this is a view shared by many in the health sector &mdash; that co-location will only reinforce the two-tier system and will encourage private investment.  I would refer the House to an article in the current issue of the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> which describes the co-location initiative as a plan that allows the private health care sector which dominates the American system to get a stronger foothold in Ireland.  Clearly, what we will see is private British and US health care providers moving in here and taking over the running of health care services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> has also correctly stated that although most people were seemingly against the idea of co-location last year, the process began under the HSE directed by the Minister to seek out which hospitals would move towards co-location and would have private buildings on site. St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals are two of the six hospitals to which co-location is intended to apply.</P>
        <P>The cost of co-location has been one big issue and a major area of controversy.  It has been suggested that the cost to the State will be close to &euro;70 million a year over seven years, amounting to &euro;490 million, and that the same amount of money, if spent differently in the health system, could provide more public beds at a lesser cost to this principle of equity of access within the health care system.</P>
        <P>According to the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, co-location opponents, of whom I am one, agree it will result in a two-tier system of health care even more reinforced and substantive than exists at present, it will cost the taxpayer more and it will lead to cherry-picking of easier and simpler services from public hospitals and into private hospitals.  There is a concern that no widespread informed analysis of the plan has taken place but most patient and doctor representative groups are against co-location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Important research has been done which shows that patients tend to receive poorer treatment in for-profit hospitals.  Clearly, this is a big feature of the US health care system, but I hope none of us wants to see that emulated or put in place here.  Research done in the US, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that for-profit hospitals deliver inferior care at inflated prices, and that for-profit hospitals deliver care that is lower in quality than that provided in not-for-profit ones and yet is more expensive.</P>
        <P>In terms of quality of care, in terms of value for money and in terms of undermining the prin<Col N="360"/>ciple of equity of access to health care, we must ask whether co-location can really deliver.  The clear evidence is that it cannot deliver equity, it cannot deliver value for money and it cannot deliver quality of care for patients.  Section 7 should be opposed on the basis that it facilitates co-location going ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I listened carefully to her speech.  I will not use this legislation to articulate my views on co-location.  I have done that previously and I am sure I can do it again.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether I should support or oppose this Bill, and when in doubt, &ldquo;Vote No&rdquo; quickly comes to mind.  On the Order of Business this morning I stated that this is the anniversary of the week of the rod licence debacle and to me this has all the sense of that, and I will explain why.</P>
        <P>Only a month ago in this House I went to the trouble of going through the Health Act 2004.  I extracted from that Act a document, which I put together myself, listing the functions of the chief executive, the responsibility of the Minister, the reporting structure in each and what each was supposed to do.  I pointed out to Members, and particularly those on the Minister&rsquo;s side of the House, why they should not be critical of the Government in certain situations and why they should in others, which is the principle from which I work.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects of the Minister&rsquo;s speech which seriously concern me.  The first is her statement that there are technical drafting issues identified regarding the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  I would like to know how that came to be.</P>
        <P>More importantly, I have spent a lifetime in this House trying to understand and get a good feel for the difference between statutory instruments, ministerial orders, secondary legislation, regulation, etc.  The Minister suggests we could be in breach of Article 15.2 of the Constitution, which gives the right to legislate to the Oireachtas.  How did this happen?  Senator Fitzgerald said that she would like to see the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice.  I would too, but I know there is not the remotest chance of seeing it.</P>
        <P>Let me give the Minister the other side of the argument.  I do not trust lawyers in this regard.  I do not trust lawyers who tell me that we cannot do something by secondary legislation or by regulation.  Neither do I trust them when they say we should not have done something by secondary legislation.  I have been dealing with legislation for 20 years and like to put my hands in the wounds myself.  It is right for the Minister to do what she is trying to do to ensure that matters are brought beyond doubt.  She knows that and has the information to come to that conclusion, but I do not.  I do not trust lawyers in that regard.</P>
        <P>When I say I do not trust lawyers, I am not being dismissive of the profession.  I feel they are <Col N="361"/>used to taking one side or the other and are not much good in the middle.  Their whole life is either win or lose, but the rest of us have a different role to play as we live in a grey world.  I would like to hear what the advice was, to hear the opposing argument and to come to a conclusion.  We are entitled to that in this situation.  For example, the Minister states clearly with regard to the establishment powers and immediate needs:  &ldquo;The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is also one of these bodies and, when examining the adequacy of powers of the Health Service Executive to fund the new board ... it was felt there were difficulties&rdquo;.  I have looked at the powers of the Health Service Executive under the 2004 Act and see no difficulty whatever.  It was given widespread powers to spend money and fund bodies, as long as it was doing so in the interest of improving, promoting and protecting the health and welfare of the public.  I cannot imagine anything broader than that.</P>
        <P>I recall the legislation going through and I indicated then that the HSE could take on the whole country and nobody could oppose it.  I would like to see the legal advice that second guesses that.  I do not believe it exists.  I know the hardest thing for a Minister for Health to do.  I remember saying to one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, Deputy Michael Noonan, whom I defended in the House previously, that he should not have taken legal advice in the Mrs. McCole case.  This situation is not parallel, but that was a good example of where a politician should strenuously overrule legal advice when not convinced it is necessary.</P>
        <P>I am arguing in a vacuum because I have not seen the arguments of either side.  Therefore, I cannot come to a conclusion on the issue.  If the same people are advising us on this as advised the Parliamentary Counsel on the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the previous Act, who is to know whether they were right the first or second time?  I do not feel we have clarity on the issue.</P>
        <P>I do not have any difficulty with the Minister&rsquo;s argument.  I listened carefully to her.  Her objective is laudable and if the bases on which she came to her conclusions are correct, convincing and plausible, I would have to support them.  However, I do not know that to be the case, but she is the Minister and I am not.  I must make my judgment on the information available to me, but the information is not available to me and I am not convinced by legal advice.</P>
        <P>The Minister has spent as much of her life as I have of mine looking at legal advice and being prepared to throw it in the bin if it seemed incorrect or did not fit the need at the particular time.  I am not sure this is not one of those cases.  The distinction between secondary legislation such as regulation, statutory instrument, order or whatever is sometimes very fine.  If it goes over the line, I like to know why.  If it went over the line, somebody in the Department, it is probable that <Col N="362"/>whoever drew up the statutory instrument, not the Attorney General, went beyond his or her authority.</P>
        <P>What we are doing here is enacting primary legislation to amend a regulation.  Primary legislation gave the right to regulate.  The regulation was written and now we are returning to primary legislation, not for new primary legislation, but to amend a regulation.  I am uncomfortable with that because I do not understand how we find ourselves in that position.  More importantly, how am I to know we will not find ourselves in a similar position next month or next year?  Could there be other measures we need to look at on this issue?</P>
        <P>I do not envy the Minister her job.  My comments are heartfelt from the perspective of a legislator, but there are issues here that cause grave discomfort to anybody who worries about the process of legislation and regulation and their relationship with the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As the Minister has outlined, the main purpose of the Bill is to put beyond doubt the <i>vires</i> of bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961.  It also amends the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and provides for a technical amendment to the Health Act 2004.  The provisions in the Bill in regard to the health corporate bodies are required on foot of legal advice from the Attorney General that the constitutionality of the 1961 Act could be open to challenge.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that it is not a question of any of these bodies having &ldquo;no legal basis&rdquo;, but that given their importance no shadow of doubt can be allowed to exist in the matter.  Thus, urgent action, as recommended by the Attorney General, is needed to confirm these bodies.  I congratulate the Minister on her speedy response.</P>
        <P>This Bill has implications for a number of bodies established under the previous legislation.  While 40 bodies were established, 19 remain in existence.  These include St James&rsquo;s Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, the Drug Treatment Centre, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and the National Cancer Screening Service.  Another of these existing bodies is the National Social Work Qualifications Board, established under the 1961 Act to carry out a range of functions, including the validation of qualifications of social workers.   The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and registration boards to regulate and register members of designated health and social care professionals, including social workers.  Section 83 of that Act provides for the dissolution of the National Social Work Qualifications Board, as its functions will be carried out by the council and the relevant registration board.  The new Bill will enable the Minister to dissolve the board, in line with the <Col N="363"/>provisions of the 2005 Act, despite the fact that the board is one of the bodies that will be confirmed under this legislation.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Health and Social Care Professionals Act and the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and registration boards.  I congratulate the Minister on the work in this area to date.  This was an essential measure to provide safeguards for the public and to support competent professionals.  I take the opportunity to suggest to the Minister that she should also look to the area of counselling, which remains unregulated and without registration boards.  Currently, any individual can hang a sign proclaiming himself or herself to be a counsellor and be available to people in need.  There is potential, therefore, for harm to members of the public who are particularly vulnerable at a time when they are seeking such assistance.  This remains an area of considerable concern that would benefit from the Minister&rsquo;s input.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that legal advice also indicated that further legislation be drafted to address a wide range of issues identified with regard to the Act, including the retention of the power of the Minister to establish bodies under the Act, the circumstances in which that power should be exercised, the nature and limits of the functions which may be conferred on such bodies, the relationship of such bodies to the Minister, the Health Service Executive and other statutory agencies and the funding of such bodies.  The Minister indicated that given the complexity of these issues, the Government will introduce another Bill to deal with them.</P>
        <P>I also note that the Bill will allow for the amendment of the function of corporate bodies.  In some instances, this will see some functions being transferred to the HSE and others being retained by the Minister.  I understand that the functions being transferred are largely those to do with approving budgets and reporting on operational matters.  While I understand the desire to ensure the HSE has sufficient capacity and authority to undertake the work it is charged with, I take this opportunity to indicate strongly my concern regarding the HSE&rsquo;s accountability regarding specific expenditure.</P>
        <P>A number of recent incidents have increased my concerns in this regard.  I understand from organisations that operate in the areas of mental health and disabilities that moneys allocated in Budget 2007 by the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children to these areas were later redirected by the HSE to other areas, including offsetting the overspend.  I would appreciate, as a matter of urgency, clarification concerning this and also consideration of the need for the HSE to be held accountable for its expenditure, particularly where specific projects have been identified and are considered of sufficient priority for moneys to be allocated in respect of them.</P><Col N="364"/>
        <P>I welcome the allocation of &euro;50 million in respect of disabilities in the 2008 budget.  I seek assurances, however, that every penny of this money will be spent in this area.  I would also like assurances that it will be spent in an intelligent and purposeful way and that quality outcomes for the individual will be seen as an essential component of achieving value for money.</P>
        <P>Excellent progress has been made in the context of the introduction of the Disability Act and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and also the agreement of the national disability strategy and its incorporation as one of the components of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  I am concerned, however, that as I consider developments in other countries in the context of quality service innovations that are person-led, we are not making the progress in the practical delivery of services that would ensure the best quality outcomes for individuals with disabilities.  Achievement of this requires the HSE&rsquo;s full delivery of moneys allocated but also a mindset shift on its part that would allow new boxes to be included on service funding application forms.  It is not just about spending the money, rather it is about meeting the needs of individuals in a way that ensures the best possible improvement of their quality of life and provides them with opportunities to realise their full potential in a way that maximises the limited financial resources available.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, the approval of the HSE will also be required in respect of certain functions such as those relating to the recruitment of staff and pay and remuneration.  However, this approval can only be given with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  While I would not request and do not expect the Minister to become involved in micromanagement, I am strongly of the view that we must consider the introduction of some mechanism to ensure the accountability of the HSE regarding funding designated for specific purposes and not just that relating to its overall Vote.</P>
        <P>I welcome technical amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 because these will facilitate the phased commencement of significant provisions in that Act and the move from the old regulatory system to a new improved one.  In light of the progress made in providing for a modern, efficient and transparent system for the regulation of the medical profession which will benefit members of the public and the profession and ensure also all medical practitioners are appropriately qualified and competent, it is essential that the transition to the new Medical Council should take place on a phased basis to ensure the objectives of the Act are realised.  I wish all involved well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The Labour Party accepts that, in light of the reported advice from the Attorney General, <Col N="365"/>it was necessary legally and constitutionally to introduce primary legislation to confirm the 19 bodies purportedly created under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961.  We also realise the Oireachtas had to move quickly to close off the existing loophole.  However, questions arise whether doubts exist regarding the legal status of similar bodies.</P>
        <P>Section 3(1) of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961 states: &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time by order (in this Act referred to as an establishment order) establish a body to perform functions in, or in relation to, the provision of a health service or two or more health services.&rdquo;  Similarly, section 3(1) of the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971 states that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may &ldquo;whenever with the agreement of the Minister for Finance he determines that it is expedient to do so, by order (in this Act referred to as an establishment order) establish a body to provide for the Minister, the authorities therein specified, being authorities to which this Act applies, or the Minister and the authorities so specified, as the case may be, such services as may be specified in the establishment order&rdquo;.  The bodies established under this legislation include the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Fire Services Council, the Dublin Transportation Council, the Irish Water Safety Association, the National Safety Council, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Environmental Research Unit.  Is it possible to make the same interpretation in respect of those bodies as that which gave rise to the need for the Bill?  I would like to see the advice of the Attorney General in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty with and object to the inclusion in the Bill of measures to facilitate the development of co-located private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals.  The Labour Party is fundamentally opposed to this measure, which seeks to take the health service further along the road of dividing public and private patients so that soon sick people who arrive at the hospital campus could be directed left or right, some to a spanking new facility, supported by tax breaks to its wealthy developers, and others to the older public hospital.  I do not believe that the separation of the sick into rich and poor hospitals is anything other than ideologically based.  This aspect should not form any part of emergency legislation.  Such legislation should be confined to matters that constitute a genuine emergency and should not be used by the Government as a vehicle of legislative convenience.</P>
        <P>I also have a difficulty regarding the restricted time we have been given to debate this issue.  My concerns have been echoed by many other colleagues in the Houses.  While it is necessary to introduce legislation to ensure we make the position politically sound, I do not understand the need for the provisions relating to co-location.  I <Col N="366"/>have a serious problem with the latter and I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I intend to make only a brief statement regarding the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007, particularly because a great deal has already been said and owing to the fact that the legislation is technical in nature.  I accept, and the Minister acknowledged earlier, that there is a sense of urgency regarding the introduction of the Bill which is, in a sense, emergency legislation.  It is far from ideal that we are rushing the Bill through in this way but there is a strong rationale behind the need to do so.</P>
        <P>In future, legislation should be drafted in such a way that there will not be a need to revisit it.  Difficulties arise from time to time, however, and the advice from the Attorney General is that primary legislation is needed to confirm the orders which established 19 bodies under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961.  If the Bill were not introduced, those bodies could be vulnerable to legal challenge.  It is important for that reason to support the legislation.  The 19 bodies established under the 1961 Act include the former Blood Transfusion Services Board, now the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, the Health Research Board, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and the boards of St. James&rsquo;s, Beaumont and St. Luke&rsquo;s hospitals.</P>
        <P>Another major reason for supporting the legislation is because it will address what have been perceived as inadequacies or shortcomings in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Health Act 2004.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 was welcomed by all parties because the intent behind it was to improve patient safety through improved regulation of the medical profession.  The Act introduced welcome new measures such as a lay majority on the Medical Council and also new measures to assess doctors&rsquo; competence on an ongoing basis.  There is, however, as others stated, a need to implement the provisions of this Act on a phased basis.  The Bill will enable such a phased implementation to be carried out.</P>
        <P>For the reasons I have outlined, the Green Party supports the Bill.  Claims have been made with regard to what the Bill involves.  The legislation is not concerned with ushering in any other policy, it is largely technical in nature and the Green Party supports it.</P>

	<P>It is a major change in policy for the Green Party to support co-location in such clear terms.  If one strips away the issue of co-location and the changes to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the legislation contains very little.  A constitutional issue arose and the Minister was obliged to introduce the Bill to deal with it.  I would love to know what happened between the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital development group and the HSE that necessitated the intervention of the Attorney General, <Col N="367"/>especially as said intervention led him to discover a problem with legislation introduced 46 years ago.  The background to this matter would certainly be interesting and I ask the Minister to impart it to us.</P>
        <P>The Government has a fairly healthy disregard for the Constitution and our democracy.  That is why we end up going back and forth to the Supreme Court.  Senator Feeney made the rather simplistic remark that Fianna F&aacute;il won the election because it supports co-location.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe grassroots Fianna F&aacute;il supporters want the health care system to be based on the making of a distinction between those who have money and those who do not.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always prided itself on the idea that all people should be treated equally.  It has never before subscribed to an ethos of discriminating between poor people with low incomes and wealthy people.  It has been enlightening to observe the change in the way Fianna F&aacute;il considers the general public.  It is no longer the democratic and republican party of old.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children has not yet signed the commencement order for the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, which was rushed through the Oireachtas in April.  She has argued that the substance of the Bill remains unchanged, but it has not been implemented.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the existence of a lay majority on the Medical Council will not protect patients in our hospitals.  While such a majority is good for the general ethos of the health service, it is of no consequence unless it is accompanied by the other changes we supported in the Act.  I have asked the Minister on many occasions when she intends to make medical competence assurance, which is to be put in place on a phased basis, part of the ethos of the health care services.  She has done nothing about it, to be quite honest.  All we have is a voluntary process whereby doctors can ask 25 of their patients to write to the Medical Council stating whether they think the doctor is good or bad.  As a doctor, I am in a position to participate in that process.  I do not believe that is transparent, given that doctors are unlikely to choose patients who do not get on with them.</P>

	<P>The most important aspect of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 is the provision relating to competence assurance, as it will change the way doctors and patients interact within the Irish health service.  That is what the Minister should be talking about.  It is rubbish to talk about introducing competence assurance on a phased basis because it will not protect patients.</P>
        <P>I will speak about co-location, which was raised by the Minister.  We have had more than enough rows on this issue.  I do not like co-location because I think it signifies the Government&rsquo;s failure to implement the reform of the health care service.  The public health care system, which is costing the taxpayer &euro;15 billion per year, is not working.  The Government&rsquo;s solution is to establish a private health service alongside the public health service, to be paid for by taxpayers and private patients.  Patients are not getting the benefits the Minister should be achieving.  She should forget about co-location because it is a very bad policy that discriminates against patients.  The Government has decided to establish separate hospitals for rich people and for paupers, and to wash its hands of the consequences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all.  Approximately half of Irish people have private health insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government is serious about this, it should focus on reforming the public service and making it work.  The Minister and I had many discussions on the consultants&rsquo; contract.  I got a lot of grief from some of my colleagues in the medical profession, as long ago as January 2006, when I backed the Minister&rsquo;s approach to this issue.  I suggested to her that if agreement could not be reached on the contract, she should bring in her own contract.  I proposed at that time that a deadline of Easter 2006 should be put on it.  Negotiations on the contract have not yet been concluded as we approach 2008, as a consequence of the Minister&rsquo;s failure to do anything about it.  The Minister needs to reform the public health care system by making changes which will ensure that porters no longer refuse to take patients to X-ray departments, for <Col N="369"/>example.  We need to ensure that nurses cannot refuse to treat a patient because he or she is not in the ward to which they have been designated.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows in her heart that the administration of the health service is a disaster.  These problems are caused by the Government&rsquo;s failure to implement the necessary changes to the manner in which the &euro;15 billion is spent.  The Minister has opted out of the reform process, preferring instead to get taxpayers to pay for the establishment of private hospitals on the lands of public hospitals.  Everyone knows that is not the correct policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers seem to have a huge difficulty with this.  Senator Feeney seems to have conveniently forgotten that two days before this year&rsquo;s general election, most Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers had no idea how much co-location was going to cost.  That is the problem.</P>
        <P>Some of the Government&rsquo;s health policies are contradictory.  It intends to build private hospitals next door to public hospitals.  I do not want Senators to think I have something against private hospitals, because that is not the case.  I am happy to refer my patients to private hospitals, as long as I am satisfied that the standards in those hospitals are acceptable.  I have a problem with the private and public sectors being mixed so closely together, because I know what will happen in the long term.  It will not be good for patients or those who pay for the health service.  I will spell out the contradiction to which I referred.  One of the major Bills to be debated in the D&aacute;il before this year&rsquo;s general election was the legislation that established the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The staff of the authority are not allowed to go into private hospitals.  When things go wrong in the private hospitals which are to be built next door to public hospitals, the authority will not be able to investigate.  It will be able to go into public hospitals but not private hospitals.  The Minister has said that public and private consultants will serve both types of hospital, although those of us who know what really happens in the health service think they will spend most of their time in the private hospitals.  The Health Information and Quality Authority will not be allowed to go into private hospitals to find out what is going on there.  There is a complete lack of clarity in relation to how the health service is supposed to work.</P>
        <P>If Fianna F&aacute;il Senators want to examine these matters some more, they should consider the Government&rsquo;s failure to put in place a consultants&rsquo; contract that serves the Irish people.  They should ask why the Health Information and Quality Authority, which is supposed to be able to protect patients in health institutions, is not able to go into private hospitals.  They should try to explain why they accepted such a daft notion in the first place, instead of reforming the public health system in a way that will ensure it works for patients.  The Minister has brought in Professor Drumm and Professor Keane for a few nice press conferences.  A few media commentators <Col N="370"/>have said she is a &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; Minister.  I hope that is the case, but the time for dealing with these big issues is running out quickly.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot just pay the consultants what they want &mdash; she must make reforms to the public hospitals so they work for patients.  Too much money is at stake to do otherwise.  More importantly, lives are at stake.  I ask the Minister not to blame the HSE simplistically for the problems which have been encountered over recent months.  Many of the problems have been built into the system by the way the reform process has gone so far.  I am afraid that process will not be successful in the future unless we are quite serious about what we must do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is a testament to the thorough and prudent approach of the Minister for Health and Children, the Government as a whole and the Office of the Attorney General.  The normal work of government involves ongoing legal analysis of how current primary and secondary legislation is being used to implement policy on a wide range of issues.  As the Minister has said, the primary legislative basis for funding the new national paediatric hospital, which is to be developed by the HSE, was analysed in the normal way.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has confirmed that arising from those considerations, the Office of the Attorney General decided in mid-October that a more fundamental review of the constitutional status of the health Acts needed to be undertaken.  The Minister was advised on 26 October that the legislation being considered today was needed.  I do not accept that there has been a delay since then.  Any fair-minded person who examines this legislation will see that considerable work has been done quickly to produce a Bill that will make technical amendments in a number of areas.  This Bill will set a proper modern standard for the legal underpinning of various health bodies.  I congratulate the Minister, the Office of the Attorney General and their officials on the work they did to address this issue as soon as it was identified.</P>
        <P>Most of those who have spoken during the debate on this Bill today and yesterday have glossed over the considerable and valuable work that has been done.  Some Senators have preferred to focus on the issue of co-location.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to remind Senators of the benefits of this policy initiative.  I have the utmost confidence that co-location will be proven to be in the public interest in every respect.  Public representatives have been asking for years for new acute hospital beds to be provided more quickly.  It has taken many years to complete certain major hospital projects, at a time when great progress was made with other construction projects in the private and public sectors.  The co-location initiative will free up 1,000 new public beds over the next three or four years in a cost-effective and efficient manner.  It <Col N="371"/>has been scrutinised and tested by numerous legal and financial advisers, including officials in the National Treasury Management Agency and the Departments of Finance and Health and Children.  We already have public and private health care providers in this country, including within our hospitals.  There are 2,500 private beds in public hospitals.  These are not available routinely to public patients in the same way as to private patients, despite that taxpayers&rsquo; money built them and continues to fund them.  Is it not time we changed this?  It is time at least we made a start.  I cannot believe people would still argue it would be best to leave things as they are with no reform whatever.  Co-location will free up 1,000 of these beds.  This means a massive and, more importantly, rapid increase in hospital bed capacity for public patients.  It is a significant step towards ensuring our publicly funded hospital capacity will be used solely on the basis of medical need.</P>
        <P>We already have a public and a private system.  That will not change.  Neither is there much demand for a monopoly of public health sector provision.  There is no case for that.  All the trends internationally are towards using a diversity of health care providers, public, private and voluntary.  The real task ahead is to make public and private work together in new ways to provide more capacity and better health services.  That is exactly what co-location will do.  Public and private health care providers will work together as never before.  As the Minister has said, we will be able to use the new privately managed facilities for public patients to supplement, rather than supplant, public services.  We already do this with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which has systematically opened up the gates of private hospitals to public patients.  It gets on with the job of buying treatment for patients.</P>
        <P>Let us be honest.  Patients do not care who runs or finances a hospital as long as the care is good and they are treated without long delays.  The Minister is right, and in agreement with most patients, in saying that all hospital capacity that meets standards and offers value for money should be usable by all patients.  She is also right to insist that under this policy and the new consultants&rsquo; contract, access to publicly funded care must be based on medical need alone.  She is passionately committed to this and, as we all can see, she has the full backing of the Government side in this House.</P>
        <P>There are, none the less, constant and sometimes vicious distortions of her motives and commitment to equity in the health services.  Some people wilfully ignore her spoken words, repeated many times on the record, and claim to know better than she does herself what is in her mind.  It is happening again today.  This cannot be explained away as normal politics or fair commentary.  It goes well beyond that.  The Minister is a better woman to ignore it, as she does.  I am <Col N="372"/>confident, as is the public, that she is totally focused on achieving what is fair and best for all patients.  Anyone who knows Deputy Harney knows that.</P>
        <P>There are Members of this House and others who accept the Minister&rsquo;s motivation but still query the co-location policy.  I invite them to examine it again in detail and consider the real protections of public interest set out by the Minister yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  She stated, for example, that there would be only one accident and emergency department on each site.  She also stated that the co-located private hospitals would facilitate medical training and research and development, accept direct admissions to medical and surgical units from primary care centres and general practitioners on a 24-hour, seven-day basis, comply with physical design requirements to fit in with the existing public hospitals, and share clinical governance, information, records management, performance management provisions and documented service level agreements with the existing public hospitals where these are undertaken.  They will participate in the public-hospital inpatient inquiry scheme and case mix information systems.  These are all new developments and new ways of ensuring public and private hospitals work together.  For all these reasons and others, the co-location policy will deliver real benefits to our health services and, for many years to come, provide a platform for further ways in which the public and private sector can work together for the benefit of all patients.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I join others in welcoming the Minister to the House.  I will focus on two different areas.  The first is, as others have mentioned, the time we were given to consider this legislation, and the second is the nature of the co-location proposals before us, which has been mentioned by all previous speakers.  However, I will first respond to some of the points made by Government speakers, particularly Senator Feeney.  Since I joined the Seanad only a number of months ago, I have been struck by the consistently high quality of contributions from Senators on all sides of the House.  If the repetition of sincere views by people on this side of the House is found to be nauseating by the Senator, that is the kind of attitude that makes me even more suspicious of the legislation before us.</P>

	<P>Although I welcome some of the points being made in the interruptions, I will go on.  I tried to take some time, as did everyone else, to read the Bill, but I did not have enough time so I put more attention into the explanatory memorandum.  This Bill is designed to correct another law that has been in existence for 46 years.  Correction of the legislation has suddenly become urgent, apparently, but the advice that necessitated this has not been made available to people on this side of the House.  If we consider the bodies that will be affected by this change and their importance to Irish life, to patients and to the people who work within them, we must agree it is vital that people on this side of the House demand to see the advice available to the Minister.</P>
        <P>We must demand time to consult people outside the Houses to understand their views so that we can better do our job and articulate a range of views on this legislation.  We have not had the time nor the capacity to do this.  I agree with the point made by Senator Alex White earlier.  It is not a matter of getting additional speaking time; it is about having the time and ability to prepare so that we may make good use of that speaking time.  That has been denied to us up to this point.</P>
        <P>I have no qualms about raising the issue of co-location as every speaker on the Government side has already mentioned it.  During the hurly burly of the general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it was difficult for people to get their minds around and understand this issue.  This summer I was delighted to see a book review in <i>The Irish Times</i>, written by the Minister, of <i>The Other Invisible Hand</i> by Julian Le Grand.  This book sets out the theoretical and policy foundations upon which the idea of co-location is based.  Professor Le Grand published another book called <i>Motivation, Agency, and <Col N="374"/>Public Policy: Of Knights and Knaves, Pawns and Queens</i>, which expounded these views in more depth.  I took some time to read these books to understand the policy framework of the co-location concept.  The idea is that a diversity of providers can come together within a policy framework to deliver a better outcome for citizens, whether they be patients, pupils or elderly people.</P>
        <P>Professor Le Grand lays out four criteria required for this to work, which are missing from the current co-location framework.  The first is that the State, rather than the person accessing the care, must bear the cost of this care.  In the case of health care provision within the UK and elsewhere, this is happening within a general health insurance model.  If a patient in the UK accesses a foundation hospital, for example, which is the equivalent of a co-located hospital, he or she does not pay because it is paid for out of his or her tax contributions.  There is a general health insurance model within which the idea of providing diversity of service is embedded.  If a private patient uses a co-located hospital in Ireland, his or her health insurance premiums will increase over time because he or she will eventually be charged the full economic cost of the care. This is in opposition to the idea of ensuring service provision is free at the point of use.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Regulation is strongly advocated in this system.  It will ensure that everybody operating within the service is adhering to the standards and protocol set out by the Government but as my colleague, Senator Twomey, said earlier the very organisation charged with doing that in the health service, the Health Information and Quality Authority &mdash; the Minister must be congratulated on setting up that organisation and it must be congratulated on the quality of its recent report &mdash; will be unable to go into these new hospitals.  How will we ensure the quality of care is maintained in respect of all people using these services?</P>
        <P>Professor Le Grand emphasises the importance of avoiding cherry-picking to ensure hospital services or skills are not only available to wealthy people or to those already in fairly good health and to avoid the need for institutions having to deal with the very sick or those unable to afford care.  As everybody on this side of the House has pointed out, that will not be the case with co-located hospitals because the majority of those who will use them will have private health insurance, which I welcome &mdash; I have private health insurance, as does nearly half the population &mdash; as opposed to those who do not.</P>
        <P>Professor Le Grand stresses the importance of ensuring that citizens have all the necessary information on the services they use and that they can use that information to pick the service.  I had to make a choice regarding a hospital I had to use recently and the only information I had to go on was one or two reports from HIQA and local information, rumours and feedback from my <Col N="375"/>neighbours.  That is not good enough when one is deciding which hospital to use.  We are talking about hospitals which are using &euro;15 billion in funding.</P>
        <P>Those of us on this side of the House are right to oppose the Bill because we do not have enough time to do our job properly.  The co-location idea, which will be brought in under this Bill, will drive a nail through the proposal to bring in a diversity of people to provide policy services to people here.  The co-location model does not meet the criteria other countries use to make a policy like this one successful.  These views have not been generated in an insincere manner to curry favour with the electorate or whoever.  We have taken the time to examine the idea and to articulate these views here and elsewhere, which is our job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has eight minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Nothing Senator Donohoe has just said could be remotely interpreted as being vicious or anything other than a thoughtful analysis of the issue.</P>
        <P>I am a little perplexed about the urgent nature of this legislation.  I want to tease out that aspect and perhaps the Minister will respond on it.  The Minister indicated that it arose when the powers of the Health Service Executive to fund the new national paediatric hospital development board were being examined and that when the Attorney General was examining the various orders that have been made under the 1961 Act the issue arose as to whether they might be in breach of Article 15 of the Constitution, which essentially states that sole legislative power rests with the Oireachtas.  I am surprised by that because we are all familiar with primary legislation but we are also familiar with secondary legislation, and Ministers make orders every month of the year, some of considerable substance.  Although I have seen statutory instruments and regulations being challenged on different occasions, this is a serious statement by the Attorney General and the Government, drawing into question decades of orders made under the 1961 legislation.  If they are so infirm, and the Minister indicated earlier today that the Government discussed the issue of the local government orders yesterday and will come back to that in the new year, where does that leave the powers of the Minister for Education and Science to set up bodies?  What about the range of delegated powers of considerable substance that Ministers exercise every day of the week and month of the year?  Are they all open to question?  If they are, that is a very serious issue for these Houses and for the public.</P>
        <P>If it is urgent to resolve the issue in the context of the 1961 Health (Corporate Bodies) Act with which we are dealing with here, and if there is <Col N="376"/>now a question mark over the orders relating to local government bodies, why would the resolution of that issue not be urgent also?  Why can that wait until 2008 whereas this one must be done now?  I am genuinely perplexed about the urgency of this issue, not in a vicious sense &mdash; I say that to Senator Cannon or anybody else &mdash; but in a genuinely inquiring sense.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to consider giving us more information and publishing the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion as to the basis upon which it has now been concluded that questions arise about the constitutional status of all these orders because it has wider implications.  Did the legal advice the Attorney General got from the counsel he instructed also range into the other areas of local government bodies, and possibly education bodies?  How were the wider implications of this very serious issue treated by whoever gave the advice to the Attorney General?  It is clear that advice, and the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion, should be published on a matter of such huge import.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Senator de B&uacute;rca and others who said this is simply a technical Bill.  There are technical aspects to it but it is not technical if the Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to take a view that a range of orders extending back almost 50 years have questionable constitutional validity and to put that right.  That is not simply a technical question; it is a matter of huge import and one we must take seriously.  It relates to the issue of time being afforded to the debate on this Bill, a point made earlier by a number of colleagues.  It is not just a question of whether the Houses will sit all night.  That is reducing the issue to a question of time on the floor.  This is a matter of interest to the public.  We are here on the trust of the public.  It is not just a question of the time I, Senator Twomey or anybody else has to analyse a Bill.  It is a question of the constitutional job we are doing on the part of the public and one week is not enough time between the publication of this Bill and the final Stages being reached in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That undermines the trust the public is entitled to have in these institutions.  I think twice about using the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; but it is an abuse of the system we have set out in the Constitution for dealing with issues such as this.</P>
        <P>The Bill is also about co-location, at least in part, and perhaps that explains the urgency issue.</P>

	<P>I want to endorse what Senator Donohoe said.  I accept the Minister has <Col N="377"/>been in the House previously and always has been prepared to debate the issue of co-location but that does not mean I agree with her.  We are consolidating a two tier system in this principle of co-location.  In terms of the direction people take when they come into a hospital we are saying that people with resources will turn left while those without resources will turn right.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney made the point earlier that we had the election and that is over and done with, as if we cannot have any further debate now.  I do not wish to offend members of the Progressive Democrats but I will quote from a statement which refers to them and they will have to live with it.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Progressive Democrats and their ideologically flexible allies in Fianna F&aacute;il are intent on intrenching inequality.  We do not agree on the promotion of a two-tiered health system where treatment is given on the basis of ability to pay rather than medical need.  Fianna F&aacute;il, in the past, has committed itself to equal access of all patients.  This latest move by the PDs runs in the face of that.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I draw attention to this final sentence, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">If Fianna F&aacute;il continues to support the PDs in these moves then it can no longer say it is committed to social justice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Who said that and when?  It was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, on 20 March 2007, only a few months ago.  If the Green Party continues to support the Progressive Democrats in these moves, I can no longer say it is committed to social justice.</P>

	<P>Following the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice to the Government that primary legislation must be enacted as a matter of urgency to protect the 19 existing bodies established by Ministers by statutory instrument under the 1961 Act, we need to give some leeway.  If the legal advice, which should be made available to the Opposition, is correct, then to ensure the continuation of the work of these bodies this legislation is necessary and should be supported.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, several unanswered questions must be addressed.  One major element of the Bill that cannot be supported by Sinn F&eacute;in is the extension of the powers to the boards of St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals to facilitate the Government&rsquo;s infamous private for-profit hospital co-location plan.  It is ironic that the first reference <Col N="378"/>in legislation to co-location should come in a Bill designed to protect the State from a constitutional challenge on the grounds that an Act gives too wide-ranging powers to the Minister.  There has been neither a thorough debate or legislation on co-location.  It will lead to a significant change in our health care and hospital system that will reinforce the system&rsquo;s two-tier nature and swing State policy towards privatisation.  For all this, no Oireachtas approval has been sought for co-location.</P>
        <P>The lesson from the Bill&rsquo;s introduction is the danger that arises when the power of Ministers and the Cabinet is taken too far.  On many occasions concerns have been raised about Bills which give extensive powers to Ministers through ministerial orders.  The role of the Oireachtas in democratic decision-making and scrutiny of legislation has been weakened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When important bodies are established and funded to the tune of many millions of euro by the State, they must be established by legislation with the entailing checks and balances and democratic accountability.  The record of the Government, and the Minister, on accountability is lamentable, however.  The Government established the Health Service Executive, HSE, as a buffer against accountability in two directions &mdash; from Oireachtas Members and communities.</P>
        <P>The Government has signalled its refusal to remove the sections it inserted in the Bill designed to facilitate co-location.  The Schedule proposes to amend ministerial orders and give them legislative force.  This will mean giving powers to the boards of St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont to proceed with co-location.  Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in cannot support the Bill.</P>
        <P>Only one word applies to the minds who came up with the private for-profit hospital co-location scheme &mdash; the title of Michael Moore&rsquo;s latest film, &ldquo;Sicko&rdquo;.  These are the people who set the agenda for health care policy in the State.  They are the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her advisers, fully backed by their Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party colleagues in the Government.</P>
        <P>Protestant and Catholic organisations &mdash; the Adelaide Hospital Society and the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice &mdash; joined forces in June 2007 to warn against the trend in health care policy that co-location represents.  Their jointly published report stated co-location &ldquo;sends out a powerful message about Government backing and support for the existing two-tier hospital system&rdquo;.  It continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">[It] represents a significant threat to the fundamental values of care and justice, which require that health provision is seen first and foremost an essential service, which should be available on the basis of need.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A Government which sponsors such a scheme can never be relied upon to deal with the underlying <Col N="379"/>inequalities which contribute significantly to ill health in society.</P>
        <P>Authoritative opinion in the front line of hospital care claims 3,000 additional hospital beds are needed to replace beds taken out of the system in the 1980s and to cater for the 25% population increase since then.  The Government claims it will increase bed numbers by 1,500 but no fewer than 1,000 of these are to come from the co-location scheme facilitated by this Bill.  The Minister claims 1,000 private beds will be transferred from public hospitals to the private co-located hospitals, thus freeing up that number of public beds.  She has never answered the parliamentary question of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, on how many beds will be transferred at each hospital site.  Co-location cannot provide the additional beds required.</P>
        <P>The Doctors Alliance for Better Public Healthcare has stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[I]n general, private medicine does not provide emergency or urgent care which makes up the overwhelming majority of cases treated as in-patients in public hospitals ... Most patients admitted as in-patients to public hospitals are not suitable for care in a private hospital, including most patients admitted via A&amp;E.  That is why there are patients with top level health insurance on trolleys in public A&amp;E departments while there are beds empty in nearby private facilities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Co-location has been opposed across the political spectrum and the health services.  It is driven not by patient need but by private profit, reinforcing the public-private apartheid in our two-tier health care system.  It introduces corporate medicine on a large scale into the State and will have profound and damaging long-term consequences for the health system.</P>
        <P>The Government is abusing the good will of the Opposition by introducing these measures to facilitate co-location.  Sinn F&eacute;in therefore cannot support the Bill as it stands unless the Government removes the offending sections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad for its consideration of the Bill.  People are often suspicious of that which is regarded as urgent.</P>
        <P>On 27 May 2006, a senior departmental official, Mr. Barron, sent me a detailed note on the proposed national paediatric hospital which I will synopsise for the House.  In it, he stated it has been and remains our intention that the hospital&rsquo;s board will be funded by the Health Service Executive rather than directly by the Department of Health and Children.  His note continued that the legal adviser queried this and pointed out there are no provisions in the 1961 Act to enable the Minister, by regulation, to confer powers or impose duties on the HSE that it does not already have under primary legislation.</P><Col N="380"/>
        <P>The note stated the Health Act 2004 contains two sections which enable the HSE to fund third parties.  Section 38 allows the HSE to enter into a funding arrangement with a person or body for the provision of health or personal social services by that person or body on behalf of the executive.  The legal adviser pointed out that as the new board will be building the new hospital under its statutory remit, there is a difficulty in regarding it as doing so on behalf of the executive.  Section 39 allows the HSE to give assistance to a body that provides a service, similar or ancillary, to a service the HSE may provide.  While at first sight this would appear to cover the new board, the legal adviser considered it was not clear it could be relied upon in this instance.  The language of the section would not seem to have envisaged it being used by the HSE to fund the building of a hospital.  The section refers to the HSE contributing to the expenses incurred by a body rather than, as in this case, meeting all the expenses of that body.  In the final analysis, the note concluded, it would be a matter for the HSE to be satisfied in this regard.</P>
        <P>It was on foot of that advice that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office became involved.  Subsequently, his office believed the HSE had the power to fund the children&rsquo;s hospital but that there was a much larger issue.  It is somewhat similar to an old bridge requiring its steel to be reinforced.  The legal test is different today than the one applied in 1961.  The powers of the Minister under section 3 of the 1961 Act are regarded as so sweeping and significant, one could create any body by way of statutory instrument.  The Attorney General believed if this provision were constitutionally challenged, there was a doubt it would survive.  He took outside advice from Mr. Maurice Collins Senior Counsel and his advice was confirmed.</P>
        <P>There is case law in this area which the lawyers in this Chamber will find interesting.  A decision in the Cityview Press case in 1979 is particularly significant.  It set out the principles and policies test in regard to the validity of statutory instruments and according to the then Chief Justice, Mr. O&rsquo;Higgins:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">[T]he test is whether that which is challenged as an unauthorised delegation of parliamentary power is more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself.  If it be, then it is not authorised; for such would constitute a purported exercise of legislative power by an authority which is not permitted to do so under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>We obtained the advice because the bodies spend more than &euro;900 million a year and employ thousands of people.  Between the two hospitals alone they would employ between 6,000 and 7,000 people if not more.  The amount of money, the numbers of people employed and the number of contracts these bodies have is so significant we had to act urgently.  Furthermore, the Attorney General advised we could not give public notice <Col N="381"/>because although we are not aware of any litigation pending against any of these bodies, if we gave notice, one body, person or entity could litigate which would damage the public interest.  That is why we set about amending this legislation as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>We considered marrying the implications of the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971 to this legislation in an omnibus Bill but that would have delayed this legislation.  Although I am not running down the bodies under the 1971 Act, they are not as significant in terms of their powers, the extent of their remit, the public moneys they spend, the number of people they employ or the contracts they have.  They are important bodies but not as significant financially or legally as the other bodies.  Through my officials&rsquo; great work we were able to prepare this legislation.  None of the statutory instruments can be interfered with once the legislation is passed.  They will be legally frozen.  We will need another Bill next year giving the Minister powers to establish bodies of whatever kind.  We must do a great deal of work on that, take legal advice and be specific.  From here on the existing bodies are frozen and none can be given new powers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that lack of flexibility not equally bad? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We must have a new Bill which will specify the kind of principles needed to guide the establishment of statutory instruments.  We cannot give ourselves these broad, extensive powers to establish almost anything by way of a statutory instrument.  The law develops and the legal test today is very different from that which obtained 46 years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Frances Fitzgerald made a valid point about disposal and lease.  It was the first matter I raised when I saw the word &ldquo;disposal&rdquo;.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office advises me that in a legal context disposal is to facilitate lease or whatever.  None of these lands will be sold.  They will all be leased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Co-location will proceed at eight hospitals.  There is no issue with the other six proceeding because either the HSE owns the land or their boards are not established under the 1961 Acts, such as St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals&rsquo; boards are.  Those two have been advised that there is no issue.  Beaumont Hospital wrote seeking my permission to proceed with co-location.  It did not need my permission because this was a policy we had initiated but we believed the hospitals needed permission to lease land which we were going to give them by way of amending the statutory instrument.  Given the doubt about everything under the 1961 Act, we could not do that either.  We are facilitating this legislation to remove any doubt.</P>
        <P>The Medical Council brought to our attention a problem in the Medical Practitioners Act that it is necessary under the Act to have a new regis<Col N="382"/>ter to elect a new council but to have a new register the new council must consult.  The council&rsquo;s lawyers identified that loophole and we are availing of this Bill to close that off as quickly as possible.  I agree with Senator Twomey that we should put the new regulatory regime in place which facilitates a lay majority.  While this is not the be all and the end all, it is an important signal to inspire public confidence and confidence in the profession that we will not self-regulate.  This is the first country in the world to do so and two others are following suit since we did it a few months ago.  It will facilitate fitness to practise inquiries being held in public in normal circumstances.  It will provide competence assurance for which we are providing money.</P>
        <P>This is not a question of patients deciding whether someone is a nice or good doctor but a question of peer review.  Senator Twomey was perhaps talking about the College of General Practitioners&rsquo; pilot project.  Dr. Neary could have selected a couple of hundred of his patients&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I still meet his former patients.  The man did much good, the story is not all bad but there is no doubt that is not the way to decide on somebody&rsquo;s competence to practise.  We pay a heavy price for not having competence assurance.  I do not wish to speak about inquiries except to say that in the past we never inquired.  People knew for 25 years that something was wrong in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda but nobody did anything about it.  The director of nursing in Portlaoise last August drew the attention of the HSE to what was happening there.  The HSE acted urgently and immediately when it was brought to its attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the surgeon there not also write to the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The surgeon wrote to me about the need for consultants, which was acted upon, but the consultant there never wrote to the HSE to say there was something wrong with the false positives.  The director of nursing did and that led to the suspension of the mammography service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The health system over which I preside has been in place for a considerable time.  It is a public hospital system in which 20% of the beds, funded 100% by the taxpayer are available only to private patients.  It is fundamentally wrong that there are 2,500 beds in our public hospitals which only some people can access.  Contracts of employment, however, have been signed with consultants on that basis which I cannot break without generously compensating people.  Insurers have been involved in contracts with the hospitals for resources based on that fact.  I want to convert those beds and make them available to every citizen on the basis of medical need.  I <Col N="383"/>prefer the term patients who access services on the basis of medical need to the terms &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo;.  That has been the cornerstone of our approach to the consultants&rsquo; contract.  If we were prepared to allow unfettered access to private activity in our public hospitals, we would have had a contract of employment two years ago.</P>
        <P>Almost half the elective procedures two years ago in one of the hospitals in this city were for private patients even though that bears no resemblance to the catchment area of the hospital.  Only 24% of the accident and emergency activity was regarded as insured patients, yet the elective work was almost 50%.  That is wrong and to deal with it we established the National Treatment Purchase Fund to take the patients who could not access these beds to be treated in private hospitals.  That is crazy.  It costs &euro;300 million a year in salaries to staff these beds of which the insurers pay &euro;74 million, so the State subsidises those beds every year to the tune of &euro;226 million, yet only some people can access them.</P>
        <P>The co-location initiative was put forward not because of the book referred to by Senator Donohoe, which I read only last summer, but because several doctors in Waterford, Beaumont, St. James&rsquo;s and other hospitals wanted to build private hospitals on the grounds.  Several private hospital projects were being initiated and some private hospitals were being built away from public hospitals.  I believe that having the two together, with doctors on site, is preferable to the situation that prevails in the city at the moment that can see doctors working in three, four or five hospitals.</P>
        <P>One third of consultants have category 2 contracts; that amounts to about 700 doctors and 650 of them are in Dublin.  It is not unusual for many of these consultants to work in three or more hospitals; some work in four or five.  The contract allows them to do this, although it is good in terms of time management or patient management.  Hospital management has informed me it may receive a call in the afternoon from a consultant saying he or she will do his or her round at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.  This means the patient will be kept in the hospital all day and junior doctors will be paid overtime to carry out the round with the doctor.  These are crazy practices that are not in the public interest and not in patients&rsquo; interests.  I want to keep doctors on the site rather than have them driving all over the city, which seems to be the Opposition&rsquo;s policy.</P>

	<P>These facilities will be funded at no cost to the taxpayer, except for tax forgone, which is about 41% of the investment plus pay related social insurance, PRSI, and come to less than half the traditional cost of such facilities.  They must make their services available to the public hospital at discounted prices.  There will be a single clinical governance, training and research and development, which do not occur in the private health care system at the moment.  In addition to the lease of the land, in some cases there will be profit sharing arrangements to the benefit of the public hospital</P>
        <P>I did not foist this policy on anyone but we initiated it and the option existed for hospitals to avail of it if they so wished.

        <P>There are no inspection processes for the public and private health care systems at the moment, though I would love to have given the Health Information and Quality Authority a role with regard to the private sector.  It has a role when the State procures public services.  I cannot legally do this until there is a licensing or accreditation regime.  If there are no rules by which one establishes a service one cannot send in a person to inspect it; what criteria would they apply to it?  This is why we established a patient safety commission, with many patient representatives, and others, chaired by Dr. Deirdre Madden, that is due to report in June 2008.  After that report I envisage legislation to establish in Ireland a long overdue licensing or accreditation regime for health provision.  Anybody can build and run a hospital in this country and that is not satisfactory.</P>
        <P>For the first time HIQA will inspect the private and public nursing home sectors.  Heretofore we only inspected private nursing home facilities but not public facilities.  There must be a one for all policy whether it applies to admission to the public hospital system or standards of care.  There should be only one system in place and patients are entitled to expect that the Minister for Health and Children and her Department will set up a <Col N="386"/>regime that guarantees quality and safety will drive service provision.  They must trust that, regardless of who funds provisions, it will be monitored and enforced on the same basis.</P>
        <P>I regret that we have rushed this legislation and admit this is never a good idea.  As a legislator, I like to give a good deal of time to legislation and we rarely see guillotined motions relating to health provisions, although it has happened occasionally when it was important to establish organisations.  However, this Bill has only been prepared since 26 October and went before Cabinet for approval on 4 December.  This was the timeframe facing me and it would have been irresponsible of me to ignore the Attorney General&rsquo;s legal advice, putting at risk &euro;900 million of expenditure, thousands of jobs for people employed in these organisations and many contracts that these organisations have.  Only on the day we published the legislation, when I briefed the Opposition, did we inform the relevant organisations because we knew if we had informed them 24 or 48 hours earlier many people would have been worried.  Staff would have worried about the status of their employment and contractors and patients would also have worried.  Sometimes it is necessary to do things this way, as longstanding Members of this House will understand.  It is not desirable but sometimes things must be done quickly to protect the public interest.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann recognises the epidemic in our society of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use, in particular cocaine and related substances, and acknowledges the need for a coordinated cross Departmental approach to this problem.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to thank Members of the Seanad for the opportunity to discuss this important issue which has been in the public domain at a very high level for some weeks.  We are discussing the need for a co-ordinated cross-departmental approach to the problem of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use, in particular cocaine and related substances.  I commend the House for linking the two issues.  I will try to argue why I believe there is potential for more synergies between both.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect to the use of the term epidemic, it is important to maintain perspective around this in the context of cocaine.  I accept we have a growing problem with respect to cocaine use and, equally, while I accept it is across all strata of society, it is primarily an urban phenomenon and is predominantly a problem with young or younger adults in the 15-34 age group.  The last prevalence study in 2002-03 indicated that while 3% of respondents aged 15 to 64 reported that they had taken some form of cocaine at some stage in their lives, 1.1% used it in the last year and 0.3% used it in the last month.  Results of the 2006-07 prevalence survey, which will be launched at the end of January, will reflect the findings of the joint national advisory committee on drugs and national drug strategy team report, completed in 2006.  It concluded that based on all secondary indicators, there was a significant increase in cocaine use albeit from a low base.</P>
        <P>With respect to alcohol, in contrast, prevalence figures in the 2002-03 survey showed that more than 75% had a drink in the last month and in 2006 the average consumption per person in Ireland aged 15 years or over was 13.36 litres of alcohol, which is a decrease from the peak of 14.3 litres in 2001.  There are signs that its misuse is creating significant health problems for individuals and is contributing to public order offences in our towns and cities.  With respect to alcohol use, key concerns relate to under-age drinking, binge drinking among young adults leading to potential public order problems and the levels of <Col N="388"/>excessive drinking that can give rise to significant health problems for the individuals involved.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children, which has responsibility for alcohol, published the two reports of the strategic task force on alcohol that together provided approximately 100 recommendations across a wide range of sectors and involved policies, such as regulating and restricting alcohol availability; reducing the demand for alcohol through taxation and pricing mechanisms; regulating the marketing of alcoholic beverages, in particular those practices that influence younger people &mdash; in other words promotions; implementing appropriate drink-driving policies; implementing screening programmes and brief interventions against hazardous and harmful use of alcohol; and providing easily accessible and affordable treatment services for people with alcohol use disorders.  While the first three are not an option with respect to illegal drugs, there are potential synergies that may be achieved with the remainder.</P>
        <P>In the last D&aacute;il, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in its ninth report in 2006, reached the conclusion that alcohol should be included in a new national substance misuse strategy and that there should be a co-ordinated response along the lines of the national drug strategy.  My predecessor indicated, when he appeared before the committee, that he had an open mind on the issue and was supportive of bringing together any potential synergies that can be identified.  From the time of my appointment as Minister of State I have indicated that I support this view.</P>
        <P>The committee was aware, as Senators will be aware, that this suggestion of a single national substance misuse strategy has been mooted for a considerable time.  The Department of Health and Children, which has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of alcohol policy, is currently investigating this issue and established a working group in December 2006 to examine the issues and the potential synergies involved.  This group, which in part arises from action 80 of the national drugs strategy, consists of representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the HSE, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the national drugs strategy team, my own Department and representatives from the community and voluntary sectors and the industry.  It is expected to report early in the new year.</P>
        <P>The steering group appointed to oversee the mid-term review of the national drug strategy, which was completed in 2005, was struck by the number of times the issue of alcohol, particularly binge and teenage drinking, was brought up during the consultation process and the confusion that was felt by some that there were separate strategies to deal with the issue of illegal drugs and drinking.  A number of contributors to the process felt, as the Oireachtas committee con<Col N="389"/>cluded, that alcohol and illicit drugs could be addressed through one overall policy.</P>
        <P>While the steering group dealing with the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy considered that the question of a combined alcohol and drugs strategy was beyond its remit, it pointed out that although separate policies are involved, in many cases services addressing issues of substance misuse on the ground are not separate.  With respect to the key areas of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and supply reduction, the steering group was of the view that there was potential for synergies between the two strategies, but that there were also areas of divergence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For example, with respect to education, most educational activities focused on prevention adopt a skills-based approach and cover substance misuse in general, rather than any specific substance, or group of substances.  However, in public awareness campaigns, messages need to be credible and effective and the steering group was of the opinion, with which I agree, that addressing alcohol and illicit drugs together can be problematic, given that the messages communicated on alcohol are not necessarily appropriate to illegal drugs.  Generally, a zero tolerance approach is warranted for illegal drugs whereas with respect to alcohol it is more about alerting people to the dangers involved and getting across the message of people developing a responsible attitude to drinking.</P>
        <P>The health promotion unit of the HSE has responsibility for developing public awareness campaigns about both alcohol and illegal drugs.  Evidence identified by the national advisory committee on drugs suggests that maximising the impact of national campaigns is best realised by having co-ordinated local campaigns in tandem with national campaigns.  There is therefore significant scope for greater co-ordination in raising awareness in society about the dangers of illegal drug use and problem alcohol use.</P>
        <P>The greatest opportunity for synergies may lie in the area of treatment for substance misuse.  Clients have different needs and the Government is seeking to put drug related treatment in place that is client centred, thus addressing all the issues personal to the individual problem drug user, including alcohol-related treatment where necessary.  Many of the people now presenting exhibit problems related to polydrug use, including alcohol, and it makes sense to adopt an holistic approach.  This more holistic and integrated approach is reflected by the work of the HSE&rsquo;s working group on residential rehabilitation on substance use which reported in the summer to the HSE.  The HSE&rsquo;s working group on drugs and alcohol is currently considering the report.  The residential rehabilitation working group, on which my Department was represented, considered the residential rehabilitation needs of misusers of all substances, including alcohol.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>With respect to cocaine, the joint report by the national advisory committee on drugs and the national drugs strategy team, to which I alluded earlier, while recommending, in the short term, the need to consider the provision of cocaine-specific clinics recommended that in the medium to longer term there is a need to move to the provision of a comprehensive substance treatment service tailored to the individual. This is recognised by the HSE and in its report last week to the interdepartmental groups on drugs, of which I am chairman, identified that many approaches already in use work well with cocaine misusers and that it intends to build on this approach and re-engineer existing services to meet emerging needs such as cocaine.  Further evidence of this enhanced co-ordinated approach by the HSE is the associated training programme, which is currently being rolled out.  This training is available not only to HSE staff but also to workers from the community and voluntary sectors and will cover a number of themes including drug and alcohol misuse in both acute care settings and non-specialist settings and evidence-based practice with substance misuse.</P>
        <P>In the context of supply reduction, the legal status of alcohol, as against that of illicit drugs makes closer linkages between policies difficult to achieve.  However, under-age drinking is, of course, illegal and I strongly agree that the laws relating to the sale and supply of alcohol to those under age should be rigorously enforced and that concerns expressed about easier availability need to be considered, particularly in the context of under-age drinking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of a combined national substance misuse strategy, historically, drugs task forces have tended to have varying views, with regional drugs task forces tending to be more open to the idea. In the past, local drugs task forces generally would be more of the view that the policies should be kept separate.  The LDTF view probably related to the nature of the illicit drugs problem and the need for a focused response.  Some people are still of the view that robust structures are in place to deal with illicit drugs and that their effectiveness in that regard might be blunted by trying to address the much broader and pervasive alcohol issue in the same way.  From my interactions with drugs task forces and from the work of the NDST in canvassing the views of task forces earlier this year, I perceive that while there are concerns about ensuring that services to existing clients are not diluted, there is greater willingness for and acceptance of a single strategy, particularly in view of increasing polydrug use and the role of alcohol in the take-up and continued use of illicit drugs.</P>
        <P>At an international level there is no single approach to the issue, though the 2006 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction reports, &ldquo;signs of a broadening of the scope of strategies to encompass licit addictive substances (alcohol, <Col N="391"/>tobacco, medicines) as well as illicit drugs&rdquo;.  As chairperson of the British-Irish Council sectoral group on the misuse of drugs, I note that Ireland, England and Scotland have separate polices, with the other five jurisdictions adopting a combined approach.  To an extent the policy approach may be driven by whether jurisdictions view their response to substance misuse as primarily a health issue or a legal issue.  Irrespective of this, to the extent that there is scope for greater co-ordination of our responses to the problems involved, we should pursue it.</P>
        <P>I agree with the overall thrust of the motion.  The important thing is that any co-ordinated cross-departmental approach would retain and build upon the successful aspects of the national drugs strategy while simultaneously addressing the alcohol issue in a more co-ordinated and effective way.  Meanwhile, I await the outcome of the deliberations of the working group led by the Department of Health and Children which should significantly facilitate decision-making on the appropriate way forward and should facilitate the development of the most appropriate co-ordinated approach to the twin concerns of illegal drug use and problematic alcohol use.</P>
        <P>I look forward to this debate particularly as the steering group on the new national drugs strategy will be meeting just after Christmas.  The terms of reference have been outlined to the group and it will engage in wide consultation, which in my view, starts here.  It is appropriate that the elected Members of both Houses should be among the first to give their views.  I look forward to this opportunity to engage with the Members and I welcome any proposals.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, indicated that the strength of the strategy to date has been the broad cross-party support and I hope this will continue.  I am under no illusions about the challenges which face us but significant progress has been made in a wide range of areas.  We have more and very important work to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  I wish to share my time with Senator Coffey.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to the House.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the escalating drug issue and the consumption of alcohol.  I commend the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution and I assure him of cross-party consensus on this motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Government is serious about tackling the serious drug and alcohol issues, we need to see some positive action regarding high-profile prosecutions, strong sentencing, resourcing of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na drug units, Garda raids on pubs and clubs and mandatory drug testing in schools.  I hope the Minister of State will include alcohol as part of the new national drugs strategy.  If we think the sudden and tragic death of Katy French will expose the dangers of drug use to young people, we are mistaken.  The lives and deaths of <Col N="392"/>those who have died too young, from James Dean to Kurt Cobain, have always been tinged with romance.  It is not until young people meet and hear the heartbreak of a family member or of a friend of one whose life has been devastated by drug use or until they meet a doctor or a paramedic who can demonstrate to them how drugs devastate the body, or until they meet a drug user and see the real pain, will the dangers of drugs be finally exposed.</P>
        <P>Drugs must be demystified and the medical and psychological ramifications of drug use must be exposed, along with the tabloid gloss that has been allowed to cover over the problem.  The Minister of State made reference in some interviews that snorting a line of cocaine is as socially unacceptable as somebody who stumbles out of a pub and drives a car.  We should not fool ourselves for one moment.  Most people in society and all of us in politics recognise that many people do not equate drug-taking with illegality or with causing damage.  The message should be that cocaine use must be highlighted and stopped.  I refer to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and the review of the national drugs strategy.  I ask him to convene a national drugs forum, similar to what was done with the issue of Northern Ireland.  This will give impetus and status to the national drugs strategy.  A national forum on drugs would bring together a wide range of Departments and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, local drugs task forces, community activists, young people, professional groups and all interested parties, to discuss how best to tackle this issue at both a local and a national level.</P>
        <P>I am a school teacher and I believe a radical overhaul of the drugs education programme is required.  There is an urgent need for a comprehensive drugs and alcohol education programme in schools.  The message must be that drugs kill, that there is no quality control on drugs, that drug dealers care only about money and their profits and do not care a whit for the person to whom they sell the drugs.  We must sell this message to the public.</P>
        <P>Cocaine use is rampant and has become a leading killer in Ireland.  Yesterday a Dublin coroner revealed that of the 47 inquests into drug-related deaths, 26 were cocaine-related, 16 heroin-related and five involved ecstasy.  This is a serious indictment of all of us.</P>
        <P>The national drug-related index survey will be published soon and this is to be welcomed.  It is important to have comparative figures.  My one regret is that this debate, the Minister of State&rsquo;s appearance on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and coverage in the newspapers, is not reaching the target audience because this audience does not watch television news programmes or read newspapers.  I welcome the initiative regarding Facebook and Bebo.  I also urge the Minister of State to examine the possibility of putting videos on YouTube.</P>
        <P>Simply telling young people that drugs are bad and that they should say &ldquo;No&rdquo; is not working.  We <Col N="393"/>need to think outside the box.  The Minister of State will receive my support for every effort he makes to reach young people.  It is imperative that we do something.  Education is a most important element in the fight against drugs.  We should not forget that drugs kill and affect families and society.  We must get that message across.</P>
        <P>Drugs task forces need to be strengthened in order that we can tackle the misuse of drugs in local communities by providing the essential resources to implement the national drugs strategy.  There may be an element of empire building in some drugs task force areas.  I do not wish to be specific as much good work is being done but some drugs task forces do not appear to be properly focused.  In his review of the drugs strategy I urge the Minister of State to examine the operation of local drugs task forces.</P>
        <P>The Government has let people down in the area of drug treatment in terms of the investment that is required.  Only 28 detox beds are available to help 14,500 heroin addicts.  We must recognise that most drug users consume more than one type of drug.  A survey revealed that approximately 92% of people who began using drugs after 1998 are now polydrug users.  It is important that we examine drug treatment programmes.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reference to synergies.  As we know, alcohol is a gateway drug.  It is therefore important that we include binge drinking by teenagers as part of the next national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>It must be brought to the attention of the Judiciary the message it gives out through its sentences.  There is too much inconsistency in sentencing policy.  I accept that mandatory sentencing has its drawbacks but we need to send a strong message through the Judiciary.  I urge that guidelines on sentencing would be made available to judges.  It is important that we would send a hardline message regarding sentencing.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, for attending the debate.  I assure him that on this side of the House we will be positive where it is necessary to assist him in reaching a consensus regarding the elimination of this sad epidemic that is part of society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, for attending this important debate.  I welcome this all-party motion.  No doubt all Senators would agree that all sectors have a role and responsibility to play in the fight against drugs.  As politicians, we have to lead that fight.  The Government must also take the lead.  Communities, citizens and society in general have a big role to play in how we tackle this scourge.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on his efforts to date.  I am sure he is happy to hear that from a member of the Opposition.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="394"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe he genuinely wants to deal with this problem.  I saw the Minister of State on a television debate with what I can only describe as celebrity half-wits before the recent high profile tragedies.  These persons were promoting the legalisation of drugs.  One can ask where these celebrities are now.  They have gone to ground because the same media is publicising these high profile tragedies and the loss of life of two young men due to cocaine in my home area.  We are led to believe that one never had any involvement in drugs but just happened to get involved with the wrong crowd on the wrong night.</P>
        <P>It is important that we resist the legalisation of drugs at every opportunity.  I commend the Minister of State on his efforts in this regard.  However, in speaking about drugs we must not neglect the serious issue of alcohol abuse.  We should acknowledge this problem at all levels, especially under-age drinking and binge drinking.  Currently, there is easy availability of alcohol to under age persons.  If we are serious about tackling drugs we should examine the operation of off-licences and supermarkets, as significant amounts of alcohol are being purchased by teenagers or others to give to them.  Alcohol abuse paves the way for the abuse of other drugs.  It can generate an acceptability in society for such behaviour.</P>
        <P>We must tackle this issue on many levels.  If we tackle the issue of supply then we will make progress.  We must also promote a more holistic approach in terms of providing facilities for young people.  Providing an alternative is important, in addition to education and training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently the Garda has localised drug units but my information is that many of them are not solely dedicated to tackling drugs and that they are being diverted from drug problems to carry out other Garda activities.  That is not good enough, given the serious nature of the drug problem in society.  A more regionalised approach is required to take on the drug barons who are currently one step ahead of the Garda.  They are moving from one area to another and they are aware of where the Garda is under-resourced.  We need more manpower in the Garda and more intelligence.  A regional approach would allow for the pooling of intelligence in order to take on drug barons more effectively.  We should start with the top ten drug barons who are well known to the Garda, target them and take them out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A survey produced by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors this year identified that nationally we should have 53 sergeants and 390 garda&iacute;, including detectives, tackling drugs.  These garda&iacute; would be dedicated to the problem of tackling drugs and associated crimes.  Unfortunately, the current complement is only 39 sergeants and 239 garda&iacute;, which is a case of serious under-resourcing.  Surveillance equipment is required, in addition to vehicles and top class <Col N="395"/>technology to take on the drug barons as the best of equipment is available to them.  They know exactly what moves the Garda makes.  We need to properly resource the Garda to tackle this serious issue.</P>
        <P>The phrase &ldquo;personal choice&rdquo; has been bandied about lately in regard to drug use.  We need to be very careful in our language.  This does not take into account the impact the personal choice, <i>per se</i>, has on the individual, families, communities and society.  Drug taking is much more than just a case of personal choice as it has a wider impact.  We all need to work together to beat this scourge.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>RTE has highlighted the widespread use of cocaine.  I thank the Minister of State for the high profile manner in which he has gone about explaining the situation on RTE and the various programmes on which he has appeared.  I commend his approach.  He did not get over-excited about the problems that have been exposed recently.  The situation is disastrous for those families who have been affected by recent cocaine-induced deaths.  I extend my sympathy to them.  We must take on board that behind every statistic lies a family.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">The Medical Bureau of Road Safety analysed blood and urine samples in 2005. Some 747 specimens were tested, of which 480 were positive and 262 were negative.  This shows that there is a need for on-the-spot testing of this kind in conjunction with breathalysing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was highlighted last year with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>That is essential.  If we are serious about allowing people onto the roads, the issue of health and safety must come into play.  That is one of the difficulties the Minister of State should tackle.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has stated that there is no quick fix to this problem.  This is why we are discussing the matter this evening.  We must be flexible in attitudes and policies, awaiting the second national drugs prevalence survey, which was to be completed in November 2007, for an up-to-date picture of usage of cocaine.  The Government takes a proactive, decisive and co-ordinated approach towards that matter.</P><Col N="396"/>
        <P>The &euro;50 million allocated in the 2007 budget, an increase of 16%, shows a clear continued Government commitment.  That is a significant rise over 2006 and is 87% more than the 2004 figure.  The commitment to what the Minister of State is doing is evident.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some &euro;200 million was spent across the various Departments in 2006.  The new programme for the period 2009-16 is being prepared, plus the drafting of the new national drugs strategy will involve an approximate spend of &euro;52 million during 2008.  This will see a substantially increased focus on rehabilitation and ensure we go that extra mile to help people regain their capacity for daily life following the impact of a drug problem.</P>
        <P>Since the pre-budget outlook, the Minister of State has added &euro;12.5 million to fund the implementation of the recommendations of the national drug strategy rehabilitation report.  This additional funding will allow for the development and strengthening of the local drugs task forces and for the roll-out of services to new commuter-belt towns.</P>
        <P>There is also a commitment to spend an extra &euro;64.3 million on the global drugs initiative and young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, an increase of 29% over 2007 levels of spending.  All Senators would agree that is a significant amount of funding and shows the commitment of the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Capital funding under what is known as the &ldquo;Premises Initiative&rdquo; is open to applications for community-based accommodation needs.  The national drugs strategy team-prepared joint briefing paper on cocaine use in 2006 brought together all data on cocaine use in Ireland detailing an increased usage albeit from a low base.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Archbishop Diarmuid Martin points out it is the personal responsibility of the individual to consider the negative implications of his or her behaviour on other people when taking so-called recreational drugs.  That spells out clearly that one must take responsibility for what one does.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know how he is regarded by many young people who he taught in his area and how he inspired them to go on to achieve an education and improve their prospects.  They were able to cut through the class barrier.</P>
        <P>The issue of alcohol interests me.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and when I was appointed to the committee, I studied its documents.  I have taken up the issue of suicide awareness and prevention.  The committee, in its 2006 report, was scathing about the Government&rsquo;s failure.  It stated that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with accidental deaths, including death by suicide, but the Government has failed to implement its own alcohol policy, the report of the National Strategic Task Force on Alcohol, which could curb alcohol abuse.  If I dared give the Minister of State advice, the task force report contains ten recommendations and further study and reports are unnecessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister of State will be aware, I produced a policy document on children and another on aging and ageism.  In both areas there were shelves of reports and there was very little action.  In the case of alcohol, there is no mystery and it is all spelt out in the report.  There is conclusive evidence from the UK that consumption falls if the price of alcohol is increased.</P>
        <P>There is a significant problem in Ireland in that alcohol consumption is now based at home rather than in the pub.  In that regard there is an issue to deal with in that we do not have a notion of how much is being consumed.</P>
        <P>The abuse of alcohol is a serious factor in suicide.  Why has Ireland the fifth highest rate of death by suicide of young men among the EU countries?  It is incredible.  Alcohol has consistently been shown to be a factor.  People get false courage when they drink alcohol.</P>
        <P>There are more deaths due to suicide than to road accidents.  Last year there were 409 suicides and 360 road deaths.  All of us are aware of the campaigns for road safety, but what public awareness is there of death by suicide?  There are far more deaths by suicide.</P>
        <P>On average, 10,500 young people turn up at accident and emergency departments having threatened to commit suicide.  This issue of suicide must be lanced, put on the political radar and dealt with.</P>
        <P>It is wrong that we are unnecessarily letting people die by suicide.  I am a woman of action.  I am not interested in excessive studying and reporting.  The strategic task force on alcohol <Col N="398"/>report of September 2004 was a Government report and it is time to move on it and implement it.  I will push for that, as I did in the case of child care and in my push for a new entrance to the Oireachtas 2000 building.  The Chair knows how much work I put into those achievements.  I will drive the issue of suicide prevention and awareness at the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting.</P>
        <P>I compliment our Cathaoirleach, Senator Moylan, and Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the example they set as pioneers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome his measured approach and the fact he recognises the important need for a cross-departmental approach, which is recognised in the national drugs strategy.  This is not just a matter of criminal justice or law enforcement issue.  To see it in <Col N="399"/>that light is to miss the point and not the way to go about changing the damage done by drugs.</P>
        <P>We must be careful of our language when talking about drugs and take a rational approach.  As the Minister of State said, it is important to maintain perspective when using the word &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo;.  There is certainly an epidemic of alcohol abuse and we would all agree with Senator White when she links that with suicide.  We must be careful, however, about suggesting there is a drugs epidemic, because that suggests the need for a crisis response and short term measures.  It also tends to lead to slogans and the introduction of measures such as minimum sentences, and to the sort of attack made on me the last time I spoke on this topic when certain Members on the Government side referred to me as being soft on drugs.  That is a shame.  It behoves us all to look rationally at the issue of drugs and seek credible measures to reduce the harm associated with drug abuse and, in particular, to reduce and prevent the tragic deaths arising from drug abuse.</P>
        <P>Scaremongering will simply not work.  As Senator Buttimer said, the people who put themselves at risk by taking drugs are not the people who listen to the slogans and messages.  To tell people to just say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, is not an effective way to prevent drug use.  That is similar to asking people to abstain from sex in order to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases or HIV.  That approach does not work.  We need to look at a more rational approach, based on harm reduction and death prevention.  This requires a credible message.</P>
        <P>We need to treat addiction as a medical problem.  In that regard, the HSE methadone programme is welcome, as is the greater commitment to drug rehabilitation.  We do not yet have enough places available for drug rehabilitation, but we are slowly changing.  One area in need of more resources is the drugs court.  As somebody who has worked for some years in the criminal justice system, where I have been in the front line of defending offenders with serious opiate addiction problems, I have seen the terrible damage heroin addiction can do, not just to communities, but to individuals and their families.  The drugs court could play an important role in encouraging and providing an incentive for rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>I have also been associated for some time with the drug policy action group, which is a group of people who work in the area of drug rehabilitation and criminal justice and who have come together to try and promote a rational debate around drug policy and to explore alternative policy means to reduce the harm associated with drug abuse.  The drug policy action group has stated that many of our existing drugs laws, particularly our criminal laws, tend to increase rather than reduce the harm associated with drug use, for drug users themselves and for the wider community.  It suggests that the introduction of the criminal justice legislation, such as we have <Col N="400"/>seen in recent years, and the increasing sentences and so on have not had any effective impact on reducing the supply of drugs.</P>
        <P>A strong argument has been made by the policy action group which suggests that the over reliance on criminalisation has done great damage to the social fabric by creating a highly organised, profitable and tragically violence driven criminal black market in drugs.  We have seen increasingly negative outcomes from the imprisonment of drug users and their criminalisation.  I know of people who have become addicted to drugs while in prison, because of drug problems in our prisons.</P>
        <P>We need to take a more rational approach to this issue.  We need to look at measures that have been adopted elsewhere which are seen to have a more effective impact, for example, the issuing of leaflets outside nightclubs about the dangers associated with using ecstasy without drinking enough water.  The Minister of State may remember that a number of years ago there were significant numbers of ecstasy related deaths, not just in Ireland.  We should also look at the harm reduction measures used in other countries, including imaginative targeting of the people more at risk.  This is a much more effective way to try and tackle the problem rather than creating longer sentences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Minister of State to continue the work he is doing in terms of his cross-departmental approach and to take on board some of the suggestions of the drug policy action group.  He should look again at the continued criminalisation of all the drugs currently illegal.  There are arguments in favour of taking a different approach, in particular to cannabis.  Already in our laws the penalties provided for possession and supply of cannabis are different from and less serious than those provided for other types of drugs.  Perhaps we could consider taking a step further, as has been done in Britain, and downgrading cannabis.  There is less harm associated with cannabis use than with opiate use.</P>
        <P>The tragic deaths from cocaine should not obscure the fact that the greatest damage being done in our society by drug abuse is done from opiate addiction, which is associated with disadvantage in certain communities.  Those are the communities that have suffered the most.  It is also the tragic deaths in those families that have caused the most suffering.  We owe it to these people to take a rational approach to drug abuse and to look again in a credible way at how to reduce the damage and risks associated with drug abuse.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an tSeanad&oacute;ir Bacik as ucht a cuid ama a roinnt liom le labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Ba mhaith liom an tSeanad&oacute;ir Cassidy a mholadh as ucht an deis a thabhairt d&uacute;inn an r&uacute;n seo a phl&eacute; sa Seanad agus as an d&oacute;igh ar &eacute;irigh leis deis a <Col N="401"/>thabhairt do na p&aacute;irtithe uilig taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n.  Tugann mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; l&aacute;n-taca&iacute;ocht don r&uacute;n agus molaim &eacute; don tSeanad.</P>
        <P>The number of deaths as a result of drugs overdoses has increased markedly since 2001.  According to figures provided by the Taoiseach to my colleague, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, such deaths increased by 32% between 2004 and 2005 alone.  The most recent figures show that more than one such drug-related death occurs every three days.</P>
        <P>Cocaine-related deaths are also on the increase.  During the summer, the Dublin County Coroner, Dr. Kieran Geraghty, having dealt with five cocaine-related deaths in one day, issued a stark warning regarding the lethal nature of even small quantities of cocaine.  In recent weeks, increased media coverage has underlined the lethal potential of the drug.  In this regard, I refer to the unfortunate deaths of two young men in Waterford, following a 21st birthday party, and the model Katy French.  Media reports indicate that cocaine may have played a part in the death of a young man in Bray, County Wicklow.  Therefore, a total of four deaths took place in one week and a number of young people were hospitalised during the same period.</P>
        <P>Drugs carry the highest human toll, namely, that of life itself.  The effects of drug addiction on communities and families are unquantifiable.  Drug addiction causes great heartache.  Those who live with family members who are addicted to drugs hope that they can come off them by means of enrolling in an addiction programme.  However, their hopes are often dashed when their loved ones relapse or when treatment is simply not available.  The problem of drugs also imposes a great cost on communities, particularly in the context of the intimidation of neighbours and the threat or reality of violence from drug dealers.  There is an urgent need to deal with this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from the human cost involved, there is also a large financial cost, namely, the cost to the economy of illegal drugs.  Let us take, for example, the cost of the number of drug addicts who present at accident and emergency departments on foot of complications caused by their drug taking.  There is also the cost of drug users who have contracted hepatitis C, HIV-AIDS or other diseases.  We must also take into account the number of days lost at work as a result of the effects of drugs.  There is also the cost of unemployment and disability benefits paid to those who cannot work because of their drug dependency.  In addition, there is the cost of guardian payments &mdash; these are not high enough at present &mdash; to grandparents who must rear children because their parents either died from drugs or are incapable of caring for their offspring.  Finally, there is the cost of drug related crime.</P>
        <P>Investment in prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and reducing the supply of illegal drugs makes social and economic sense.  However, it is <Col N="402"/>also time the Government got its priorities in order.  Budget 2008 is indicative of where those priorities currently lie and the position in respect of them must be reversed.  In the budget, the Government allocated &euro;76 million to the horse and greyhound racing fund.  However, it allocated only &euro;64 million to the drugs initiatives and the young people&rsquo;s facilities fund.  I call on the Government to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to ensure that spending on anti-drug initiatives matches the priority and urgency involved.  If the Government were to reallocate taxpayers&rsquo; money from the horse and greyhound racing fund, then resources to the drugs initiatives and the young people&rsquo;s facilities fund would be more than doubled.</P>
        <P>The Government must also recognise that the drugs crisis is no longer confined to Dublin and other centres throughout the State.  Cocaine is rampant in every community and county, rural and urban.  Not only must the Government recognise that fact, it must put in place strategies to deal with this reality.  At present, drug task forces only operate in urban centres.  The Government must devise similar bodies to deal with the drug crisis in rural settings.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly welcome this debate and I sincerely hope it represents the contribution of the Seanad to a process aimed at tackling and reducing the scourge of drug abuse.  We cannot allow this opportunity to pass, particularly in light of recent events, but we must not engage in a knee-jerk reaction to the issue of drug abuse.</P>
        <P>I am one of the younger Senators in the House and from discussing the prevalence of drug use with members of my generation, and with people who are younger and older than I am, I have come to the conclusion that each generation has its own demons.  Cocaine and recreational drug use are the demons of mine and younger generations and we must accept this as a reality.  We must then deal with that reality rather than tying to wish it away.</P>
        <P>A short amount of time spent in clubs and pubs throughout the country would make one very aware of the depth and prevalence of cocaine use in our society.  Queues outside toilet cubicles in nightclubs and the erratic behaviour of many partygoers provide dramatic insight into the vast numbers of young people getting high on cocaine on an average night out.  Such is the normality surrounding its presence, it is common for young people who do not use drugs to be offered cocaine.  This has created pressure on young people because most of them want to fit in with their peers.  It is as though cocaine is part and parcel of the social scene and that if one refuses to take it or to participate, one is seen as a square.  The term &ldquo;recreational drug&rdquo; suggests that something is being taken at weekends or on a part-<Col N="403"/>time basis and that there is enjoyment, a lack of harm and zero responsibility involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Media stories reflect what is happening on the streets and it is our responsibility as legislators to reflect on the type of lifestyle to which I refer and strengthen the law where required.  Only yesterday, the Society of Coroners in Ireland said that an increase in cocaine related deaths is being recorded by coroners courts throughout the country.  The head of the society, Professor Denis Cusack, stated that in 2000 and 2001 its members began to see a small number of deaths relating to cocaine but that since 2005 there has been a dramatic increase in such deaths.  In the light of these statistics, my thoughts are focused on the need for us to offer something other than outrage or hand-wringing.</P>
        <P>Now that Ireland has endured high-profile tragedies, such as the death of model Katy French, as a result of cocaine use, it will be interesting to see, in five or ten years&rsquo; time, whether the current panic had any long-term repercussions or if we took the correct measures to combat this evil and protect and educate young people.  At present, there are enough people who want to use drugs and there is a sufficient number of dealers who want to sell them.  Cocaine knows no class boundaries and is the play drug of the rich. Unless there is some sudden societal shift away from drug use in general &mdash; I include alcohol in this regard &mdash; then it is difficult to see how outrage and policing are going to change anything.  It is noticeable that there has been a shift in attitude, for the better, towards drinking and driving.  It took time for this to be achieved.  I am of the view that we can induce a similar cultural change with regard to illegal drug use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although I do not have a settled view on the legalisation or downgrading of some drugs, I believe there is a need to engage in a debate on this matter, particularly in the current context.  Such a debate might lead, if necessary, to the introduction of a Green Paper on the subject.  I also am aware of the concern that exists regarding alcohol addiction.  Alcoholism and its consequences have for too long been accepted in Ireland.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State intends to include the need to combat alcohol and its abuse in the national drugs strategy.  I also welcome his comments to the effect that he does not intend to confuse the consumption of alcohol with illegal drug use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">New thinking is required in respect of treatment services because the evidence shows that abstinence in opiate drug addiction treatment does not work.  There is a need for better links between addiction services and local services.  There is a particular need for inpatient treatment facilities for extreme cases, particularly those with severe drug and alcohol dependencies.  At present, the only inpatient facility in the addiction services takes patients who are either pregnant or HIV positive.  While these patients deserve <Col N="404"/>priority treatment, there are a number of others who would benefit from some form of respite care.  Judging and punishing addicts does not solve the problem.  Treatment and rehabilitation can work and the Government must invest hard cash in rolling out treatment programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The courts must take a stronger line in imposing mandatory sentences.  It is shocking that of 57 convictions in 2006, only three individuals received the full mandatory sentence of ten years.  One judge who presided over 30 of these cases imposed an average sentence of three years and three months.  If one takes remission into account, this represents a standard term of two years and five months, which is not appropriate, particularly when one considers the consequences of drug addiction and the lavish life styles enjoyed by those who peddle drugs.  Judges are imposing the minimum sentence as the exception rather than the rule, whereas, as the legislation indicates, the reverse should be the case.</P>
        <P>It is clear that our coastlines are becoming increasingly vulnerable to drug trafficking and recent seizures indicate that remote inlets are a target for smugglers.  I come from a coastal community and I am of the view that people living in such places must be vigilant and must assist the Garda and Customs and Excise in tackling drug smuggling.  However, we must also ensure that the enforcement organs of the State are well resourced in order that they can carry out operations in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is not adequate to expect an eight-vessel Naval Service to protect our 2,700 miles of coastline.  We could use satellites and helicopters to assist the Naval Service in its operations.  There are many modern technologies that could be used to assist in tracking those who smuggle drugs by sea.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Despite his baptism of fire he has performed very well since taking up office.  I congratulate him on the poise and intelligence he has displayed in dealing with his brief in recent weeks.  The Minister of State has not been pressured into adopting the panic measures suggested by some commentators and Opposition politicians.  This will stand him in good stead in the context of fulfilling an increasingly difficult role in the years ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s decision to devote &euro;5 million next year to educate young people about the dangers of drugs.  I hope this important programme is grounded in the real world.  It should employ language, images, connotations and spokespersons who can communicate to young people.  Our young population is well educated and intelligent.  We can get the message across if we put thought-provoking and dramatic images and messages into their daily lives.  Every channel of communication, including the Internet, print media, television, radio, cinema, billboards, bus stops, nightclubs, colleges and universities, must be used.</P><Col N="405"/>
        <P>The Minister of State intends to continue in 2008 the digital campaign he commenced this year, involving local radio stations like 98 FM.  The campaign, which has got off to an excellent start, needs to be continued.  The success of the stark and shocking road safety advertisements demonstrates that media campaigns can change the behaviour of the public.  Something along those lines needs to be adopted.  We need to use role models like sports stars and celebrities as part of this campaign.  The experiences of recovering drug addicts can be used to facilitate debate in classrooms and colleges.  An approach of this nature is essential if Government awareness campaigns are to bear fruit.</P>
        <P>The main problem with Irish society today is that everything seems to be done to excess.  We need to get people to take responsibility for their actions, which might not be popular.  As I do not intend to shirk my responsibility as a legislator, I have outlined the responses which I think are required.  People are very quick to say they have rights, but they are not so quick to accept they have responsibilities.  The excessive nature of many aspects of Irish society is clear when one reflects on phenomena like over-eating, drug use and boy racing.  Our excesses are preventing us from reaching our true potential as individuals and as a society.  We need to examine how other jurisdictions have reduced the levels of harm associated with drug use.  I will conclude by telling the House about a quote I found when I was doing some research today.  When the American civil rights campaigner, Jesse Jackson, was addressing a meeting in a college, he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Today&rsquo;s students can put dope in their veins or hope in their brains &mdash; if they can conceive it and believe it, they can achieve it.  They must know it is not their aptitude but their attitude that will determine their altitude.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I agree with the suggestion that personal responsibility is central to this issue.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, to the House.  I am pleased to have a chance to debate this issue.  Many Senators have concentrated on the supply of drugs but I want to focus on demand.  We can make a fundamental difference by working to reduce the demand for drugs.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State was in the House a few weeks ago, on 17 October, for a debate on the national drugs strategy.  I was one of nine Senators who contributed to the discussion.  I spoke about drug abuse and the increasing number of hard drug users in this country.  I high<Col N="406"/>lighted the dangers of not implementing the national drugs strategy sooner rather than later.  Some Senators on the other side of the House lauded the Government&rsquo;s achievements in this area, which may have been somewhat premature in light of recent events.  During the debate, I also mentioned the wide availability of cocaine in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am pleased we have an opportunity this evening to talk about alcohol abuse, which is increasing among adults and younger people.  It is not uncommon to see very young teenagers going around with beer in their hands.  We need better education about drug abuse and the effects of alcohol abuse.  We need better treatment of drug and alcohol abusers.  More resources need to be used to prevent drug abuse.  We should provide additional community facilities, for example.  If people have more options, they will be less likely to start taking drugs.</P>
        <P>Cocaine is not a new drug.  It has been around for generations.  It has been glamorised by many people.  Some Senators will be familiar with the Eric Clapton song, &ldquo;Cocaine&rdquo;, from the 1970s.  While people have recently started to understand the impact cocaine abuse can have, we need to do more to inform people about its dangers.  We need to talk about the side-effects of cocaine use.  We do not hear much about the downside of excessive cocaine use such as nosebleeds, hangovers and paranoia.  It is expensive to maintain a cocaine habit.  These are just some of the impacts felt by cocaine abusers.  Other Senators have spoken about the impact of cocaine on society as a whole.</P>
        <P>We need to explode the myth that cocaine is a sexy drug, because it is not.  It should not be glamorised.  We need better education.  Information should be made available outside nightclubs and in schools.  We should talk about the dangerous effects of dodgy ecstasy tablets and the drug known as &ldquo;special k&rdquo;.  These recreational drugs have had a serious impact on the lives of people I know.  We need to raise awareness of the dangers and downsides of drugs.  If we ensure education is at the core of our drugs policy, we will help to reduce peer pressure.</P>
        <P>Better treatment facilities are needed.  It is a disgrace that many drug addicts use drugs like heroin for the first time when they go to prison.  I recently heard that 50% of heroin users in our prisons had not taken heroin before they were sent to jail.  A review of the Whitaker report on the reform of prisons, which was published more than 20 years ago, was undertaken recently.  We need to implement the recommendations of the report so that people are sent to prison to be rehabilitated rather than to get addicted to drugs.</P>
        <P>As a society, we need to provide people with alternatives to getting stoned or drunk at weekends.  More facilities are needed locally so that people who are growing up can choose from a broader range of activities.  There has been substantial growth over the past ten years in many <Col N="407"/>towns and villages in the peri-urban areas of the Dublin region.  Very few facilities have been developed in these new estates.  I am sure the Minister of State has personal experience of seeing young people hanging around late on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights with nothing to do except drink or take drugs.  No facilities are in place to offer alternative activities to such people.  There are more golf clubs than playgrounds in Ireland.  We need to put facilities in place to give children and young people an alternative to taking drugs in the first instance.  There are no community centres or young people&rsquo;s facilities in many areas.  There are no outlets where youth activities can be organised.  In the absence of such facilities, is it any wonder that we have ended up with a drug problem?</P>
        <P>I support the motion before the House.  We need to direct more resources to educating people about the impact of the misuse of drugs on drug users, their families and society as a whole.  Better treatment facilities are needed, as I have said.  More social facilities need to be provided in communities to offer people an alternative to getting involved in drugs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, to the House.  I thank Senator Hannigan for sharing his time with me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish drinking habits have changed over recent times.  People have become more likely to drink at home than in the pub.  That shift has been caused by the significant increase in the availability of alcohol in many outlets, including supermarkets.  It is not healthy that such outlets sell alcohol at cheap prices, often below cost.  We do not send the right message to young people when we tell them they can get three cans for the price of one, or buy 12 cans and get 12 cans free.  I agree with the recent comments of Mr. Padraig Cribben, the chief executive officer designate of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, who said that a great deal of alcohol is now being consumed outside controlled areas such as pubs.  The one thing to be said about a pub, I suppose, is one can only drink so much and one will fall down.  The amount of alcohol, like other drugs, one can take before one exceeds the stated safe amount varies from person to person.  It depends on one&rsquo;s tolerance of the build-up of alcohol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Drinks consumed at home are generally not measured, which is dangerous.  It is very easy to erode safe standards.  I refer to the accepted measures which would be safe, such as 14 units a week for a woman and 21 units for a man.  The stated units are not necessarily safe.  I do not know how the standard was arrived at, but it could also do with a review.  One small glass of wine or half a glass of beer represents one unit.  We could do with restating safe levels and deciding who measures such things.  There is also a <Col N="408"/>problem with supermarkets using alcohol products as loss leaders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the designated driver initiative by Coca-Cola.  There should be more such initiatives.  It is terrible to sit in a pub and drink water all night &mdash; as I have done often enough, although I cannot say I do it regularly &mdash; while being charged exorbitant prices for doing so.  I do not think this is right.  From the point of view of value for money, people may conclude that they might as well have the buzz from alcohol and take their chances.  I must point out that I am not advocating this, lest I be misrepresented in my remarks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of drug use has been well covered this evening.  It is now so serious that we must tackle the causes.  It is difficult to assess whether someone is driving under the influence of drugs because there is no means of testing for this.  If we could introduce something similar to breath testing it would be helpful.  There are prescribed drugs which may impair driving or interact with and potentiate the action of other prescribed drugs.  We need to be careful because there may be genuine cases in which people take drugs prescribed by their doctor which impair their abilities in some way.  This could happen with painkillers or over-the-counter flu remedies.  For this reason, tackling the problem will be difficult.  I do not know whether there is an easy answer but I am sure, in view of the number of innovative people available, there is some means of assessing whether someone is under the influence of drugs and determining whether the drug is controlled or prescribed or being misused for some purpose.</P>
        <P>There are problems with the importation of large amounts of drugs, the recent tragic deaths associated with drugs and under-reporting of drug related deaths.  When a person dies of cardiac arrest due to drug taking, the association may not be noted.  The answer may be to conduct toxicology screening on everyone who is admitted to hospital or dies suddenly, perhaps of sudden adult death syndrome, although I am not implying in any way that this is associated with drug taking.  This is an area that must be dealt with sensitively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Gangland killings are also associated with drugs.  A total of 92% of venues tested in a recent survey were found to show evidence of cocaine use, but that could mean that 92 people in each of these 92 venues were taking drugs, although I am being facetious.  The daily reports of drug seizures show the level of drug use.  I give credit to the authorities for their success in tackling the drugs crisis.  How do we measure success?  Do we measure it based on the number of people arrested or jailed for drugs offences, or on the level of misuse?  If a small amount of drugs are seized, is this less dangerous than a larger amount?  One child or young person taking too much of a drug, no matter how small an amount is in the possession of the supplier, can still result in death.  My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the <Col N="409"/>families who are dealing with such deaths this Christmas.</P>
        <P>I do not know if my information is factually correct, but I have heard of a machine that can scan trucks or refrigerated trucks moving around the country.  I believe this scanner costs &euro;3 million.  In the context of the havoc wreaked by drugs on families and individuals and in terms of self-esteem, body image and so on, &euro;3 million is not a lot.  It would be helpful to invest in such machines with the aim of having every airport and port covered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to the House and thank him for his response to the all-party motion which demonstrates the serious concern among all Members about the epidemic of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use in society.  The Minister of State warned against exaggeration of the problem, and perhaps &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; is a strong word to use, but when we examine society today and compare it with that of a generation or two ago &mdash; although everything is relative &mdash; the level of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use does appear to be of epidemic proportions.  There were always subsections of the population, especially its younger members, who experimented with drugs or over-indulged in alcohol, but now it appears that binge drinking and the regular use of recreational drugs such as cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy are fairly standard practice for many young people, which is the real issue of concern.</P>
        <P>I will start by concentrating on alcohol misuse because alcohol is the drug of choice for Irish people and it is one about which we have a blind spot, perhaps because we have always tolerated high levels of use.  The starting point is the culture of alcohol use and misuse in this country.  We have a lenient and tolerant attitude towards excessive consumption of alcohol.  This needs to change.  It is almost a rite of passage nowadays for young people anywhere between the ages of 12 and 16 to binge drink, get drunk and almost throw up.  That is the initiation into the world of alcohol consumption.  From then on it becomes an habitual behaviour.  Young people go out and engage in binge drinking, sometimes combining this with poly-drug use in which they experiment with different forms of recreational drugs.  We can see from recent incidents, as mentioned by other Senators, how dangerous these mixtures of alcohol and drugs can be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must start by tackling the culture of tolerance towards the excessive consumption of alcohol.  That is where the education and public awareness campaigns come in.  I agree with other Senators that we need to make them relevant and credible for young people by using language and role models with which they can identify.  We must start to change attitudes towards alcohol misuse.</P>
        <P>The culture of smoking that used to prevail in this country has undergone a major change. <Col N="410"/> Smoking was widespread and highly accepted, but now smoking in public places is often frowned upon.  We have revolutionised attitudes towards smoking in the space of about 20 years.  We can do the same in the area of alcohol misuse and drug use if we adopt the same approach and encourage a different set of attitudes towards the use of these substances.</P>
        <P>I will mention a few shocking statistics on both alcohol misuse and substance abuse in our society.  One in four patients attending accident and emergency units in hospitals present with alcohol related problems.  Public order offences have increased by 247% and assaults have increased by 82% since 1996, which has been linked to increasing alcohol consumption.  Alcohol was a factor in 36.5% of all fatal vehicle crashes in 2003, and in 38% of fatal pedestrian accidents in the same year pedestrian alcohol use was a factor.  Men binge drink on 58 drinking occasions out of every 100, while women binge drink on 30 occasions out of every 100.  In 2005, 83% of 14 to 17 year olds drank alcohol, and the average age at which people started to drink was 12.  Almost one third of 15 to 16 year old students had binged three or more times in the previous 30 days.  Under age Irish girls have the highest rate of binge drinking in Europe.  There has been a 390% increase since 1996 in intoxication among under age drinkers in public places.  This is why we use strong words such as &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; when describing this problem.  When we consider the combined impact of all these different statistics, we can see we have a serious problem on our hands.</P>
        <P>Other Senators have suggested policy measures that would go some way towards tackling these problems.   An education programme and raising awareness is one of the starting points in addressing our cultural attitudes towards alcohol misuse and drug abuse but we also must take other action.  The proposed reduction in the levels of alcohol permitted for drivers is welcome and perhaps in time we would introduce a zero tolerance policy for alcohol and the combination of drinking and driving.</P>
        <P>An issue raised frequently this year, particularly in the run-up to the general election, is the need for facilities for young people such as youth cafes that would be alcohol free but allow young people an opportunity to socialise together in safe, fun places but without the presence of alcohol.  That would be an essential step in trying to address the culture of alcohol abuse among young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need a code of practice on the sale of alcohol in off-licences and much higher penalties for the sale of alcohol to or the purchase of it for young people.  The penalties under the public order Act must be increased for alcohol related disorders because there has been an alarming increase in alcohol related public order offences, particularly in recent years.</P><Col N="411"/>
        <P>As far as drug abuse is concerned, we must introduce roadside testing for drugs that are commonly abused.  When drivers are stopped they are tested for alcohol abuse but we are not examining the possibility that some drivers may have been abusing recreational drugs or even some of the harder drugs.  We must introduce a system of roadside testing for those substances.  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has been involved in promoting drug-related information sites for young people where they can educate and inform themselves about many of the substances available and the dangers attached to using them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There should be much greater availability of polydrug clinics.  Attempts were made to introduce cocaine clinics but they were not very successful.  People might not feel there is a specific need for cocaine related clinics but when they begin to abuse drugs like cocaine they are often experimenting with and abusing other drugs also.  It is hoped the polydrug clinics will be able to deal with alcohol abuse also because we are seeing more of the combination of alcohol abuse with drug abuse.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, made in his contribution about a national strategy on substance abuse that would incorporate alcohol because that is something that has been missing.  Having been a member of a drugs task force in Bray I am aware of the excellent work it carried out regarding drug abuse generally but in recent years there has been much more discussion about the need to tackle the alcohol abuse problem, although it needs to be approached in a different way from the traditional approach to drug abuse.  Alcohol is a drug that is widely abused in our society and the Green Party would welcome seeing it incorporated into a national strategy on substance abuse.  I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of speakers outlined worthwhile ways of moving this issue forward.  I will not repeat those but instead focus on a number of areas that have not been touched on this evening.</P>
        <P>The legalisation of drugs is not a policy we should develop or implement at any point.  I feel strongly about that issue because it goes back to my idea of what politics is all about.  Politics is about freedom and helping people be free from negative forces, whether it be hunger, deprivation or coercion.  It is also about giving people the freedom to do something with their life through education, the provision of safe neighbourhoods and ensuring they have a decent health service. <Col N="412"/> Drugs are anti-freedom.  They give people an illusion in terms of who they are.  They reduce their ability to make use of the capabilities and gifts they have and that society tries to nurture and anything that does that is not something we should sustain or recognise.</P>
        <P>I understand the informed points made by people who propose the legalisation of drugs.  They talk about the difficulty of winning this war by reducing the supply of drugs and dealing with the issue of demand but just because the battle is ferociously difficult does not mean we should give up trying to win it.  Our State should not recognise anything that reduces the ability of any citizen to take advantage of the gifts God, nature and society has given to them.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred earlier to his Department&rsquo;s response regarding the inclusion of alcohol in the national substance misuse strategy.  He said he had an open mind in that regard.  Alcohol should be included in that strategy because there is no doubt that the excessive use of alcohol leads to the difficulties to which I referred.  It reduces people&rsquo;s ability to be who they can and should be and if the inclusion of alcohol in the strategy creates challenges for the drinks industry, people who supply drink and so on, as I have no doubt it will, that is a price we must pay.  The points made about the link between alcohol, the presentation of people in accident and emergency departments and suicide demand that alcohol be included in the strategy and people who have a legitimate interest in the supply and sale of alcohol will have to deal with that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of responsibility, that is something I have struggled with during this debate and in recent weeks.  Like most people my age, I have been very lucky.  I benefited from a good education, growing up in a safe home and the ability to get a job and take advantage of the gifts I was given.  With all the life chances and choices that were available to me, if I then decided to use a drug I knew could end my life or severely restrict my ability to act responsibly in the future, at what point would our responsibility as a Legislature and the Minister of State&rsquo;s responsibility on behalf of the Government end?  At what point do we say we have done all we can as a Legislature to deal with this issue and when should personal responsibility for one&rsquo;s actions kick in?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I am not saying we should wash our hands of people; nobody is suggesting that.  I raise it to bring into sharp focus the people who did not have the chances available to me.  I speak about those who have grown up with deprivation and disadvantage and who did not have the role models and the positive experiences I had and for whom drug use is part of their daily life.  For those people the supply and use of drugs in their community is far more prevalent than should be the case.  It is the whole point of social and educational disadvantage.</P><Col N="413"/>
      
        <P>An element missing in the debate is that regarding the use of cocaine by people with more money than sense.  For many people who do not have money and because of the environment in which they have grown up,  drug use is more the norm than we should accept.  Schools in disadvantaged areas should be given additional resources and programmes to tackle this.  These will have to be accelerated and used in future to ensure in 15 years&rsquo; time we are not having the same debate.  Families and partners about to bring children into the world must be proficient at educating their young on drugs to ensure the mistakes of this generation are not repeated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Donohoe for sharing his time and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, for staying the distance in the debate.  My focus is on education and the law, both of which need to be strengthened in the fight against the epidemic of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use.  Neither issue is simplistic.  They must be tackled through a cross-party, cross-departmental and multifaceted approach.</P>
        <P>My main concern is for the safety of young people at the gateway age, which is 9 years to 11 years for smoking and 11 years to 13 years for alcohol and drugs.  I have less sympathy for young adults who should know the risks and take personal responsibility.  I have great concerns for those young people who do not know the risks involved.  This is where a serious job in educating them must be done.</P>
        <P>In the past few weeks I have become worried that drugs, particularly cocaine, are now an accepted part of a social scene.  If that is the case, we are in serious trouble.  It suggests drugs are part of our culture which is what happened with alcohol.  Everything must be done to prevent drugs becoming an accepted part of our culture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Young people, particularly teenagers, do not have accurate information on drugs.  They may not understand that a drug changes the chemical reaction of the brain which in the process takes away personal power to act responsibly.  Instead, drugs create an illusion of personal power which is mistaken.  I am concerned young people respond to drugs as something sensational and often feel under pressure to experiment so as to be accepted as part of the group.  For teenagers, to be part of the group is paramount.</P>
        <P>Other Members referred to the shock of recent deaths from drugs but we know shock does not bring about behavioural change.  It only highlights the issue.  It is how it is built upon that we will bring about behavioural change.  To be able to make responsible decisions, young people need accurate information.  They do not necessarily recognise the dangers of drugs or have the wherewithal or personal power to say no.  It takes much courage and personal responsibility which is not easy to achieve.  It can only be arrived at over a sustained period in education and, more than likely, personal tests in life situations.</P><Col N="414"/>
        <P>On this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business, I asked that each school give one dedicated SPHE class or assembly session on alcohol and drug misuse before the Christmas holidays.  With recent publicity, a danger exists of copycat experimenting with alcohol and drugs over the holidays.  Of course, education in this must be for the long term.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State inform the House if all schools have a substance misuse policy in place?  Are all schools addressing drug and alcohol abuse and misuse in SPHE classes?  How many are using the On Your Own Two Feet programme?  I was trained facilitator when we developed the SPHE programme with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  At the time I recall there were only some trained facilitators in the On Your Own Two Feet programme.  Since then, how widespread has the programme become?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the tributes paid to the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey.  His performance on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; was a watershed in the changing of attitudes to drug abuse.  He could easily have succumbed to the flippancy of the occasion, striking a deadly blow for the national drugs strategy in the process.  Instead, he adopted a measured approach of both horror and hope.  Both words must be kept in mind in this debate.</P>
        <P>After the recent terrible tragedies caused by drug abuse, the programme indicated the difficulties in fighting it.  There is a flippant approach and cultural attitude from celebrities and others on radio, television and columns in particular newspapers that forget how serious is the situation.  The reason we have an alcohol-abuse epidemic is because we did not recognise or admit to it being an evolving crisis.  When a survey shows that 70% of young people have used alcohol, it is a serious situation.  That is the beginning for more levels of abuse.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago, I would have been uncomfortable raising alcohol abuse in the Seanad because it was not fashionable.  When Senator Mary M. White earlier praised the Cathaoirleach and me for not taking alcohol, I felt we were being outed.  At least, however, there is a changing attitude.  I never felt when I wore my pioneer pin that I was telling anyone else what they should do.  I was very often the butt of jokes for wearing it.  Members will recall comedians using alcoholics as a subject but they never stopped to think of the <Col N="415"/>results of alcoholism.  If they encountered alcoholics on the side of the street, experienced broken homes and the violence and depression that went with this, they would not make jokes about it, no more than one would make fun of somebody with a stutter.  It is not politically correct.  There is change coming in that regard but not quickly enough.  We need to change attitudes.</P>
        <P>I have heard all the statistics, read the strategies and know how much money has been provided but they are not the issue.  The small steps taken in the Seanad in the past week indicate that this is a crisis.  I laud the Leader for setting up a sub-committee of Senators and the political parties of every hue who have agreed to tabling this motion.  If we do not take these first steps we will not succeed.</P>
        <P>When I spoke recently on the Order of Business I did not accuse anyone of being soft on drugs but I questioned arguments being put forward that we could somehow impose on the rights of an individual by overreacting to this crisis.  An ordered society will always require constraints on the rights of an individual: one cannot park one&rsquo;s car where one likes, one must give a portion of one&rsquo;s salary to the Government, one cannot drink and drive.  They are constraints.  Why do we think we are imposing on the rights of the individual by trying to put an end to the terrible torture being inflicted on some people?  There are old people who are terrified because they are the victims of drug related crimes, people in some communities feel completely under siege, some parents are at their wits&rsquo; end because the children whom they have brought up well, with a particular ethos, have been gathered into the net of drug abuse.  That is what we must consider.</P>
        <P>We were asked today to have a rational debate as if we are dealing with a rational issue.  We are dealing with irrationality.  Every time we soften our language we send out the wrong message again.  Zero tolerance is the only acceptable approach to drug abuse.  If the number of young people who have died recently from drug abuse had died as a result of violence, there would be an outcry but we seem to be immune to this problem.  If an invader attacked us the country would unite to protect its sovereignty, ethos and quality of life.  That is what we face.  This is an emergency.  When the State was under siege the Government called representatives of the media into private session and asked them to demonstrate a sense of responsibility.  The media does not show this level of responsibility now.  The Minister of State has the stature to talk to the media and ask it to come into partnership to tackle this problem.</P>
        <P>I recall the murder of Veronica Guerin, ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a h-anam, and the outrage felt when civilised society was confronted in such a dastardly manner by criminality.  We were able then to take strong action.  We need the same reaction now.  Zero tolerance must be the engine that will drive any strategy we devise.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>Responsibility is shared by all those who benefit from our community and it begins in the home.  We have reached a point almost where one cannot discipline children or say a word to them in school because the parents will tackle the teachers.  One cannot speak about this in public because one will be regarded as not politically correct.  We must get back to basics.  Parents must demonstrate parental control.  Schools have a role but we often expect them to do the work of the home as well.</P>
        <P>Society must focus on the measures required.  People always have information and they should provide it.  Communities should not allow themselves to be intimidated.  We should not take a soft approach to drug taking or to those who make money out of it.  Nobody could have anticipated the type of gang related deaths occurring now, whereby if someone has withheld money a person can shoot him or her in the head.  I am delighted that the Minister of State has put down a marker, and under his leadership we can make progress.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Chomh maith le daoine eile anseo, ba bhre&aacute; liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; aige faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; druga&iacute; agus alc&oacute;lachas.  Molaim a chur chuige agus a mhodh m&uacute;inte freisin.</P>
        <P>While I welcome this debate there are aspects of it I do not welcome.  I worry about our tendency to discuss these matters in a frenzied moment when events occur in which the media is interested.  Anything that touches on human life or death, happiness and fulfilment, or despair and destruction is deeply important.  Certain things provoke debate and outrage for a while but then the circus moves on, which raises questions about our attitude to human life and its meaning and how sacred or otherwise it is.  It took the tragic death of a young celebrity, for example, to get us into a new mode of discussing this issue.  Although it was a discretionary decision to send the Taoiseach&rsquo;s aide-de-camp to the funeral, and I would always welcome such gestures of charity and solidarity, other funerals caused by a similar problem took place without the same high profile intervention.  That suggests that even Government and legislators are not immune to the media frenzy but that should not be so.</P>
        <P>By contrast I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s measured approach.  He resisted the tendency to overstate the problem or to make right wing, irrational, rabid statements of the kind that can go down well.  I have reservations, however, about the way we turn to mantras at a time like this, such as, &ldquo;cross-departmental approaches&rdquo; or the &ldquo;importance of education&rdquo; or the &ldquo;need for investment&rdquo;.  Money, education and joined-up thinking are necessary but we need something deeper.</P>
        <P>We must examine ways to tackle the demand side of the drug problem but before we do so we must ask ourselves why this demand exists.  This <Col N="417"/>is where people become uncomfortable because we have to acknowledge that there is a deep social and cultural malaise at the heart of this issue.  Alcohol abuse, drug abuse and suicide are sad symptoms of how cheap life has become in Irish society.</P>
        <P>Alcohol has been a problem in Ireland for a long time and it is worth reflecting on how it was counteracted in the past.  Those with an interest in history will remember the etchings of Hogarth depicting Gin Lane and the horrible destruction wreaked by addiction.  He managed to begin the process of raising people&rsquo;s awareness of the misery associated with alcohol addiction.  Fr. Theobald Matthew&rsquo;s temperance movement in Ireland was driven by the moral certainty that alcoholism was wreaking an evil on society and the need for people to become united around moral values of self restraint for the sake of themselves and others.  This is the kind of movement that could not exist today because people are scared of the concept of morality and that they might be seen as judgmental.  Therein lies the problem.  Many people are profoundly lost on a spiritual and philosophical level and this is illustrated by the problems of suicide, alcoholism and drug abuse.  It is not surprising that some people lost on a spiritual, psychological or philosophical level might seek comfort from pain in temporary highs offered by alcohol and drugs.  If this is the case then telling people to &ldquo;just say no&rdquo; will not work.</P>
        <P>In the past the church was good at telling people what to believe but was not so good at telling them why to believe what was proposed.  It is not surprising that over time, with greater freedom, many people rejected what was proposed.  The State risks making the same mistake.  Liberal voices focusing on harm-reduction strategies will not work and will simply contribute to the ambivalence surrounding drug taking.  We must move away from talk of tough sentencing and targeting drug pushers.  We must also move away from talk of investment, education and cross-departmental approaches because, ultimately, the State and its systems cannot solve this problem.  The solution must come from people&rsquo;s hearts and it must be a deeply felt community response, perhaps similar to the response in the North to the killing of Paul Quinn.  Communities there have come together in a deep sense of outrage and are united in the need to confront the issue.  There is no suggestion that some people may choose to kill and that it is an individual choice.  There is no room for individual choice when dealing with crises and when addressing issues that may cost lives.</P>
        <P>We must move towards a unified, consistent discourse that does not shy from talking about morality.  I do not mean this in a narrow religious sense but in a shared social sense, in which religious organisations will be willing and welcome partners in dialogue.  Rather than tell people that they should not take drugs the State must convince people why they should not take <Col N="418"/>drugs.  Life is sacred; this must be the starting point in this matter and the wider message is that we owe a deep debt of responsibility to others.</P>
        <P>These days there is a politically correct emphasis on self-actualisation but this causes confusion rather than strengthening people&rsquo;s sense of responsibility to each other.  I agreed with some of the comments of my colleague, Senator Bacik, but I was not clear how she felt about legalising harder drugs as she confined her comments to cannabis.  The notion of handing out leaflets at night clubs informing people of the danger of taking ecstasy without water suggests to me that there is a disastrous defeatism in the air.  The comparison made with the ineffectual nature of telling people to abstain from sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases illustrates just how defeatist some people are about people&rsquo;s capacity to amend their behaviour and live more healthy lives.  One could argue that this is the pro-choice mentality gone mad.</P>
        <P>We must ask ourselves some fundamental questions.  Do we believe in people&rsquo;s power to transform their behaviour?  If not, why do we emphasis the importance of education?  Things are actually the other way round; people can change their behaviour but to do so need leadership through education with a strong moral message at its core.  There is no room for ambivalence, with some people discussing drugs as though they were a matter of personal choice about which one must simply be careful.  While this attitude is responsible one cannot hope to use it to get the message through to young people at a formative stage in their lives that drugs are not the way to go.</P>
        <P>We need a discourse on the meaning of human life and the capacity of people to change.  It is ironic that this discussion is taking place while denominational schooling is being attacked because I would have thought the ideal of such organisations is to teach self-belief and an ability to value one&rsquo;s own life and that we could learn from them.</P>
        <P>The State must get off the pulpit and stop discussing bland elements of this issue such as money and education.  It must stop giving mixed messages on drugs and particularly alcoholism.  Regarding alcoholism, we must begin to tackle the use of alcoholic drinks in the sponsorship of sporting events and drink advertising in general.  This may hurt and vested interests are involved but if we really believe life is sacred and alcohol ruins lives and damages communities we should not be afraid to make hard choices, even when they cost the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>We must move away from the illusion that free education has made us all capable of making responsible choices.  This is only the beginning as many people are deeply incurious about the meaning of their lives and their potential.  The State must participate, and encourage voluntary groups, in spreading the message to people that life is sacred and that responsible choices are <Col N="419"/>essential for the sake of the human community.  This involves a little known and little respected concept known as self-denial.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to avail of this motion to make what I hope are comments of a fundamental nature on the epidemic of substance abuse in our society.  The time has clearly come for a major redirection of resources relating to the treatment and prevention of substance abuse.  Irish society shares with the rest of the developed world many of the social problems that arise out of wealth and substance abuse is one such problem.  While we must treat the individuals who are caught up in these problems in a humane and civilised way, above all we must concentrate on removing to the greatest possible extent the root causes of the problem.  For example, a society in which binge drinking is the perceived norm is in a poor position to deal with the epidemic of cocaine.  </P>
        <P>Young people are the most vulnerable to drug and alcohol misuse and we must acknowledge that they have a crucial role to play with their keen perceptions and their ability to criticise the inconsistencies and inadequacies of a society which we all share.  They have a right to be heard and it is our duty here, in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to take account of their views.  We must have the energy, enthusiasm, idealism and commitment to deal with the issue of substance abuse and, most importantly, the current crises we are facing regarding cocaine abuse.</P>
        <P>At this time of economic good fortune we have been provided with the possibility to build and maintain a social structure that rejects the notion that drug taking in any walk of life is acceptable, be it in a nightclub, at a dinner party, at a sports event or in the workplace, Leinster House or elsewhere.  A person who recreationally, routinely or passively observes such use may note that all cases have a common dominator in that they fuel the drug lord and his criminal activities.  Where does collective responsibility begin?</P>
        <P>The Dublin County Coroner stated yesterday that cocaine was the commonest cause of death in more than half of all inquests.  The year 2007 has seen a large number of inquests into drug related deaths and nearly all deaths involved young people.  Ireland has the third highest cocaine use in Europe and seizures of the drug have risen 800% in the past five years.  We cannot ignore these statistics.</P>
        <P>Substance abuse is not just a matter for the police as health and education play their part too.  Each and every one of us has a crucial role to play in the eradication and erosion through education of this scourge in society.</P>
        <P>Cocaine has been glamorised and romanticised but the public must understand the opposite is the truth.  Cocaine in Ireland mainly comes from Colombia and is produced from a leaf which is stamped into the ground, made into a paste and <Col N="420"/>then mixed with kerosene, sulphuric acid, calcium and a range of other chemicals.  Where is the glamour in that?  The drug is then smuggled here, a journey which may easily involve transportation in somebody&rsquo;s stomach or rectum.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this very important matter.  I request the Minister for Health and Children to provide a report on the progress of inspections of facilities and residential services for children with disabilities, residential services for adults with disabilities and such services for unaccompanied minors.</P>
        <P>It has long been a requirement for residential services for children to be inspected.  An anomaly has existed, however, whereby if a residential service provides accommodation for children with disabilities, there was an exemption from inspection.  All children are vulnerable and are entitled to a commitment from the State to protect them and ensure their safety.  By their nature, children with disabilities have a heightened vulnerability.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the commitment given to develop guidelines and standards for residential services but I am concerned the inspectorate has not yet commenced its work in inspecting these residential facilities.  These facilities are funded in many cases by the State and yet we have no means to validate independently the safety of the children in the centres or the quality of service we are paying for to be delivered to the children.</P>
        <P>Recent experiences which have highlighted physical and sexual abuse as well as the conditions in some premises have indicated a need to have an inspection system in place.  There is also a need to ensure, when we seek value for money from services, it is represented in the quality of care provided to the children who are essentially in our care.</P>
        <P>Residential facilities for adults with intellectual disability are not under the ambit of an inspectorate.  I welcome the commitment to standards, developing guidelines and commencing inspections but I would appreciate a timeframe for this work.  It had been hoped the inspections might have commenced earlier this year.</P>
        <P>A number of residential facilities are provided by the State for unaccompanied minors.  I have made statements before on their right to protection and a quality of service, and I insist this group also be included in the work of the inspec<Col N="421"/>torate.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could provide details whether that will be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be asked to take this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children and I thank Senator Corrigan for raising this important issue.  The way in which society acts to protect those with a disability is a true test of how we support the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
        <P>The recent report into the Brothers of Charity services in Galway illustrates how vital it is to ensure proper protections are in place for all.  The accounts by service users of the type of abuse suffered by them in the late 1960s, up to the early 1990s, is a truly sobering lesson for us all.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring all residential facilities for people with a disability are independently monitored and inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  This is provided for in the Health Act 2007 and it gives the HIQA the necessary powers to examine the nature and quality of services and to determine whether they are of the standard to which all people with a disability are entitled as of right.</P>
        <P>The HIQA has commenced work on standards for designated residential centres for people with a disability and these will form the basis for statutory regulations and inspections.  The HIQA is determined to get these standards right, however, so that it is inspecting all residential facilities against an appropriate benchmark.  This cannot happen overnight but we will work with the HIQA to ensure it can be achieved as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The HIQA&rsquo;s aim is to finalise formal standards in 2008 and commence formal inspections in 2009.  It is important to stress that other means of protecting service users will be used in the meantime.  The Health Service Executive has been asked to take all possible action to ensure the quality and safety of services, and the executive recently published a formal guidance document on residential facilities for children and will do so in respect of adults early in 2008.</P>
        <P>The HSE will make it a condition of funding under its service level agreements that the contractual arrangements between the HSE and agencies that provide disability services will include, for the first time, quality and safety measures to ensure the users of a service can enjoy the rewarding and safe experience to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>The immediate and the ongoing needs of unaccompanied minor asylum seekers relating to accommodation, medical and social needs, as well as their application for refugee status, are the responsibility of the HSE in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, and the Child Care Act 1991.  The majority of unaccompanied <Col N="422"/>minors and separated children seeking asylum are placed in residential care such as a hostel or registered children&rsquo;s centre, and others are placed in foster care and supported lodgings.  The hostels accommodating unaccompanied minors are subject to inspection by the social services inspectorate and the registration and inspection unit of the Health Service Executive.  On commencement of the Health Act 2007, the Health Information and Quality Authority will have responsibility for inspecting all hostels, whether statutory or non-statutory.</P>
        <P>Accommodation for unaccompanied minors and separated children seeking asylum is covered by the national standards for residential centres.  It was agreed between the social services inspectorate, the registration and inspection unit and the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children that guidance notes for the provision of residential care to unaccompanied minors and separated children seeking asylum and who are aged 17 and over would be drawn up by the social services inspectorate in consultation with the Health Service Executive to accompany the national standards for residential centres.  These guidelines have been finalised and approved by the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and are with the Health Service Executive for implementation.  I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the very positive response.  Will he convey to the Minister that a requirement for all services in receipt of funding to implement guidelines for the investigations of allegation of non-accidental injury and sexual abuse should be included in the contractual agreement between the HSE and these services?  There is no requirement for any service to do that.  The inspection process should also include participation or a contribution from the individuals in receipt of service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, for agreeing to take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  I will dispense with the usual preamble because the Minister is more than aware of the issues surrounding Seamount College in Kinvara.  I thank her for her commitment in May to provide a second co-educational school in Kinvara with the proviso that this would take place only if the Sisters of Mercy agreed to take an intake of students in September 2007.  The sisters very kindly did so.  The sisters may continue to do so if they see serious progress in the development of a new school.  My concern and that of others is that unless the sisters see tangible progress on the provision of a new school in the very near future <Col N="423"/>they may not be willing to take an intake of students next September.</P>
        <P>I understand comprehensive and in-depth research carried out both by a local group and by departmental officials concludes there is a very real need for a new second level facility to serve south Galway in the near future.  Kinvara has a long tradition of providing a very high standard of second level education.  Geographically it is very well placed to serve the south Galway region.  A site has been identified by the local community and preliminary agreement has been reached on its acquisition.  I respectfully ask the Minister to liaise with her officials to begin immediately the process of providing a new school so that it will be patently obvious to all, including the Sisters of Mercy, that a new second level school will be in place in Kinvara by 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  I welcome this opportunity to outline the position.  Even I know the circumstances of Kinvara at this stage.</P>
        <P>On the 16 May 2007, the Minister for Education and Science announced the provision of a <Col N="424"/>new second level school for the Kinvara area.  This decision was and remains predicated on the Mercy Order, as trustees of Seamount College, accepting first year students each year until the end of the 2011-12 school year.  I wish to acknowledge that the trustees accepted first year students this September and they have also decided to accept first year students in 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>The commission on school accommodation conducted a survey on the identification of accommodation needs in the south Galway area, including the position relating to provision in Kinvara.  This survey has recently been completed and the Minister will receive a copy by the end of this week.  However, the Senator will appreciate planning for a new school involves a number of processes which can take some time to complete, most notably the acquisition of a suitable site, the design of a building, the grant of planning permission, the seeking of tenders and construction.  Many of these factors are outside the direct control of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senator Cannon for raising the matter and I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister.</P>
