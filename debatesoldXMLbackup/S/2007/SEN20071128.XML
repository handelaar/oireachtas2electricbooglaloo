	<P>I have notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the situation regarding the playing field beside the church (details supplied) which was previously used by Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in, Rathcoole, County Dublin, but cannot be utilised currently owing to the state it has been left in following upgrade works to the N7, if her Department owns this field and if so, if she has any intention of selling it for development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide a progress report on the provision of the much needed permanent school building for the Holy Trinity national school, Leopardstown.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to encourage alcohol labelling in respect of calorie content on all products.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene to secure the well-being of a person (details supplied) who is threatened with deportation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to introduce measures to reduce the exorbitant cost of motor insurance in this State, especially for young drivers.</P><Col N="1718"/>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appoint a second permanent District Court judge and the allocation of a second permanent judge in County Donegal to reduce the large backlog in the Circuit and District courts services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify when the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 will be presented before either House of the Oireachtas and when it will be enacted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Frances Fitzgerald, Maria Corrigan, Cecilia Keaveney, David Norris, Pearse Doherty and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Frances Fitzgerald, Maria Corrigan and Cecilia Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators David Norris, Pearse Doherty and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Donohoe as the enactment of the legislation is now a matter for the Houses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the third programme of law reform, referral to committee without debate, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements on realising equality and the Traveller community, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude no later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be given five minutes to conclude at 4.55 p.m.; and No. 13, motion 32 re Seanad reform, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to a very robust debate on Seanad reform.  We look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s arrival in the House.</P>
        <P>In respect of what has been said in the Lower House about cancer services and the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, one of the comments the Minister made last night related to the Opposition parties working with the Government on cancer care services.  I take this opportunity to inform the Minister that most of the Opposition parties agree fully with the cancer strategy and that all through 2006 and the beginning of 2007, when I was Fine Gael spokesperson on health, we fully supported her.  What we were looking for was an implementation <Col N="1719"/>policy.  I wish to put on the record of this House that the Opposition supports the Minister in respect of cancer services.</P>
        <P>The Minister has received incredible support over recent years from the Opposition in respect of some major issues in the health service.  I backed her in respect of getting a consultants&rsquo; contract because this is the basis of all the problems we are seeing.</P>

	<P>We still have not seen this new consultants&rsquo; contract.  I would like the Minister to know that she has received incredible support from the Opposition but for some reason, her ears are blocked to that support.  Perhaps that is part of the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Perhaps we need another debate on cancer services to inform fully any Member of this House who seems to be misled by the spin he or she is getting from the Departments about what we are promoting and supporting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we need another debate on this issue because what this side of the House supports is obviously not getting through to people.</P>
        <P>We need to revisit the issue of road safety after the terrible tragedies that recently took place.  It was only four years ago that I came upon an accident where two young children died at the scene.  It is the most stressful situation for medical workers to be involved in but nobody will ever comprehend the sadness and grief that families who see young children die will experience for the rest of their lives.  It is horrifying and we need another debate on road safety to find out what is going on.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised that the proposal to lower the blood-alcohol limits from 80 mg to 50 mg was included in the first draft report on road safety by the Road Safety Authority but was dropped from the final report.  We all know that alcohol and drugs are a major cause of road accidents.  We do not see the leadership we expected in reducing road deaths.  That is not connected to this terrible tragedy but we must reduce the number of deaths on our roads.  It will be a terrible year for so many families across the country and it is time we revisited the debate.</P>
        <P>Another matter on which I ask the Leader to seek clarification is the crisis in Portlaoise.  It is well known that Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty interviewed the doctor at the centre of the crisis at Portlaoise Hospital.  Can the Minister confirm that Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty raised concerns about the ability of the doctor to run the service in Portlaoise during the interview and that she was overruled by the HSE, which continued with the appointment?  If true, it means the expert opinion of Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty on the doctor&rsquo;s capability was ignored.  The House must find out if that is true.  Concerns have been raised about locums in Cork and we must examine what has gone wrong with medical manpower in the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week and the week before I suggested a debate on legislation that established the HSE, the Health Act 2004.  This would allow an informed debate on the different roles of people.  It is crucifying to hear views in the public debate and the D&aacute;il debate as if people never read or debated the legislation previously.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it is the trade unionist in me but I tend to react strongly when I hear calls for people to <Col N="1721"/>be sacked.  I examine matters such as due process and I regret that we cannot have another debate on it.  I would not support a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  It does not achieve anything and brings us back to what has happened in the House for 20 years.  This does not deal with accountability, responsibility and the difference between the two.  I pleaded in the House for the past two weeks, anticipating the current position.  People do not know who should be held responsible.  It is like saying there is a teacher in the west abusing children so we should sack the Minister for Education and Science.  That is the level of logic prevailing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe in holding the Minister to account and disagree fundamentally with many of her views.  I will continue to debate them.  There must be proper due process and a clear understanding of accountability so that when there is a change of Government, the next Minister with responsibility for health, if he or she comes from this side of the House, will not have to put up with the same attitude from the Members who are then in Opposition.  It happens all the time.  There must be accountability and responsibility and the difference between the two should be understood.</P>
        <P>If I could see the risk register for Portlaoise Hospital and the risk register at various levels of the health service I could find out who needs to be brought to book in 20 minutes.  If the Minister has not set up structures it is her fault.  If she has, and other people are not operating them correctly as seems to be the case, it is the fault of others.  If it is not the person at the top, and it need not be, we must find out where are the problems and single this area out for action.</P>
        <P>The worst thing would be for Professor Drumm to leave the HSE.  I remember how hard it was to get someone to take up the job.  We must keep that in mind.  I seek a debate where people could put their finger on the issue.  We know how the women have suffered and there is consensus on the matter.  Let nobody say it again.  We know the Minister oversaw the legislation.  Did she apply the legislation correctly?  If it did not work whose fault is it?  This is not a political issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and a number of other speakers raised the old chestnut of people with holiday homes in the west objecting to housing for people in the west.  The situation is chaotic.  The type of behaviour to which I refer to is happening everywhere.  There should be some connection between objectors and the areas in which they are objecting to developments.  We introduced legislation to stop councillors approving breaches of planning in places to which they are not connected.  We should introduce a similar system in respect of ordinary objectors.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1722"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Before dealing with the matter I wish to raise, I must respectfully disagree with what the leader of the Independent group said regarding political accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not the leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone very like him attends leaders&rsquo; meetings.  Perhaps he has a double.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Alex White will learn eventually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of political accountability does not extend to holding a Minister responsible for a failing that happens in a hospital.  That would be nonsensical.  The analogy given by Senator O&rsquo;Toole is wrong.  Where the system is not working &mdash; as the Senator stated, the Minister established that system &mdash; there must be political accountability.  Is the Opposition supposed to just sit back and wait?  Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated that this is not a political issue at present.  When will it become a political issue?  Of course it is such an issue.  There could not be a more political issue than the crisis in the health service.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance, when he deals with the matter with which he will be preoccupied next week, to come before the House to engage in a debate on public services and on any reforms he envisages, particularly in light of the interesting speech on public service reform he delivered at last week&rsquo;s Indecon conference?  Will the Minister come to the House and indicate any proposals he may have in this area, particularly in light of the comments he made last week and in view of the less thoughtful and ill-considered remarks made by the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy McGuinness?  The latter was the beneficiary of what must count as the most remarkable employment expansion scheme in the public service.  I refer here to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s appointment of additional Ministers of State in recent months.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister for Finance agree with the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, to the effect that the public service and its systems are a joke?  If that is the level of debate we can expect from Ministers, what hope is there for this House to debate serious issues such as value for money and the important role the public service has to play in our society and its economy?  The public service will lie at the heart of the economy&rsquo;s future and remarks such as those to which I refer will not help promote debate here or in the Lower House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the fact that there appear to have been positive developments in respect of pharmacists and that changes relating to the leaving certificate were <Col N="1723"/>announced earlier this week, will the Leader indicate the position regarding a matter to which I referred previously, namely, the animal welfare Bill?  Would it be possible to arrange a debate on what will be the content of that legislation in order that we might deal with it before it becomes a <i>fait accompli</i>.</P>
        <P>I echo the sympathetic and empathic comments already made in respect of those who were involved in recent fatal road accidents.  We already had a debate on the overall position regarding road safety.  Would it be possible for the Leader to discover whether it is a matter for a Minister or the National Roads Authority to examine whether it would be possible for fluorescent strips or cats eyes to be placed on the cement bases of all traffic islands?  When I raised this issue at council level, I was informed that it was the responsibility of the NRA, and when I raised it with the latter, those with whom I spoke indicated their belief that it was not proper to the authority.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader indicate whether this matter is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or whether it is a devolved function of the NRA?  Many of the roads affected would not fall under the remit of the NRA.  Everyone who travels by car is aware that on many traffic islands, the lights either do not work or are dirty.  The part of these islands that one cannot see is the large cement base.  The inclusion of fluorescent strips at the bottom of these structures might help reduce the number of accidents.  I do not refer in this regard to the most recent accidents that have occurred but to those what might happen in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It would be an immensely retrograde step if, as proposals from the Minister for Transport seem to indicate, the two longest established coast guard stations in the country at Valentia and Malin were to lose their rescue co-ordination functions.  Apart from the difficulties for the staff involved, this smacks of centralisation as opposed to what the Government has been preaching &mdash; we supported it in this regard &mdash; in respect of decentralisation.  Fine buildings exist in these locations and presumably a staff guarantee is in place.  However, the Minister is creating doubt about their future.  Most importantly, a consultant&rsquo;s report in 2002 recommended that both of these locations be upgraded.  They are more than suitably located for the purposes for which they exist and I do not understand this.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport to attend in the House or guide me as to how this matter should be approached?  It is extremely serious.</P>
        <P>I support the call made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole with regard to the planning matter raised last week.  It is ridiculous that people living a few hundred miles away and known in some parts of the country as &ldquo;Julys&rdquo; or &ldquo;holiday home merchants&rdquo; <Col N="1724"/>can object to a proposal for a principal private dwelling of a local resident.  I would greatly welcome a debate on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to respond briefly to comments made by the Opposition with regard to the health crisis.  As a member of a Government party I welcome the Opposition&rsquo;s support for the cancer care strategy being implemented.  Unfortunately, this is not always obvious in the behaviour or public utterances of the Opposition parties.  The Minister&rsquo;s call for a bipartisan approach to reforming our health services was one of the most sensible I heard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and try to work on the reform of the health services which is in all of our interests.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite to the House the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to respond to the issues raised yesterday by the chief executive of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Mr. Sean Quinn, at its annual conference?  He expressed concern that the tourism industry may be attracting people to the island on false pretences as, while we market ourselves internationally as a tourism destination on the basis of a clean, green environment, increasingly this is under threat.  Mr. Quinn called on the tourism industry to be far more pro-active, act in a more environmentally-friendly way and be an advocate and lobbying voice for greater environmental protection to preserve and protect the basis of the tourism industry.  He mentioned that an environmental unit was established within F&aacute;ilte Ireland which will devise policies to do so.  The Minister could address these issues and give us an idea how this new role for F&aacute;ilte Ireland could be developed and expanded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened from the D&aacute;il Gallery to the speech of Mary Harney last night and it was a remarkable performance.  I do not use the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in a scathing manner and I do not wish to suggest there was anything theatrical about it.  It was a speech of passionate conviction and I respect this.  I have ideological differences with her and I have made them plain in this House.  What horrified me was her statement that she was made aware of the ultrasound problem in Portlaoise only on Wednesday at a meeting with other people, spent 24 hours trying to get a satisfactory answer from the HSE and failed to do so.</P><Col N="1725"/>
        <P>It is astounding that the Minister for Health and Children cannot extract information from the bureaucracy.  It confirms everything stated, not in a partisan way or on this side of the House, but by Members on the other side of the House and by Ministers.  This worries me because clearly a real problem exists with regard to information flow.</P>
        <P>This is not confined, however, to the Department of Health and Children.  As I left the Chamber I encountered a Cabinet leak.  As a result of this I was able to inform our distinguished Leader that a decision had been made to embark on Seanad reform, which will scrutinise the university seats in particular.  It was a very interesting proposal and I welcome it but it is time we examined the rest of the seats.  We should put an end to their method of election, although I am not casting aspersions on the people who managed to arrive here by a plainly corrupt system.  If we are looking for rotten boroughs, they are all around this House but they are not in the six universities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was confirmed in my opinion by what I saw on Monday night of avariciousness and lack of integrity among councillors.  I am amazed at the lickspittling of local authorities that continues because they are Senators&rsquo; constituencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate will be held later this evening on the issue of Seanad reform.  We do not want that debate now.  The Senator is very experienced but he should refer to Ministers as &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; or &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; rather than by name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s direction.  I acted with no disrespect and, in that regard, am astonished he did not rebuke a previous speaker who did precisely the same and who also referred to doctors by name.  I should not have to remind the House of the tradition that people are not named when they are not here to defend themselves.</P>
        <P>When reforms are introduced, we will want to ensure we do not create a completely unworkable constituency.</P>

	<P>I very much respect the Chair and I have made that clear.</P>
        <P>I tried to raise on the Adjournment the case of a woman from Nigeria, whose name is made privy in the documents I supplied.  In 2004 this woman arrived in the country at the age of 15 and she is now 19.  She is being deported, even though she is half-way through a degree course and has her leaving certificate.  She is unsupported and has no family, having been separated by the situation she experienced, yet we are throwing her back to Nigeria.</P>
        <P>I tried to put a motion on the Order Paper requesting the Government to hold a referendum on removing the word &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; from the Constitution because of our signal failure to act in a Christian manner towards these people but I could not get a single person to sign my motion.  It is utter hypocrisy.  We bleat about the undocumented Irish in America but we are sending a girl back to a country where we know she will end up on the streets.</P>

	<P>I ask in this case and in the case of the autistic boy who was sent back to Nigeria that the Irish embassy in Lagos be required to follow through and find out what happened to these people.

I note that we will have a debate this evening on the university panels for the Seanad.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to address the matter I have raised.</P>
        <P>Few Members of either House are aware of the consequences of the Murphy judgment, which means that county boundaries will be halved and small segments will be transferred from one county to another.  It is time we examined the identities we all possess in terms of our counties in order that no future boundary commission will be allowed to breach county boundaries, even if that means increasing the number of Members in <Col N="1727"/>these Houses.  That has been suggested but it was wrongly rejected by the commission.  I ask that an all-party committee be established by both Houses to examine the future with regard to boundary commissions and how D&aacute;il constituencies are defined.</P>

	<P>It is unfair of Senator Norris to tar all councillors with the same brush.  As a former county councillor I know the vast majority of councillors would not dream of becoming involved in the antics referred to in the programme shown on television the other night to which the Senator referred.  Using the Chamber to spread unsubstantiated allegations about the councillor body as a whole is wrong and I ask Senator Norris to be more considered in his contributions in future.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Many Senators, including the Leader and some Front Bench spokespersons, attended the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body held in Oxfordshire in recent days.  Lord Dubs led a particularly interesting debate about the Irish community in Britain.  A paper he prepared on the issue showed a vast difference in the experience of those who emigrated to Britain in the past 20 years as compared to those who emigrated in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  The more recent arrivals have tended to integrate better and have found it much easier to maintain links with Ireland owing to factors such as lower travel costs and improvements in communications, including access to the Internet.  We need to address the issue of how we can support elderly emigrants in the United Kingdom.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House to hold a debate on the elderly Irish in Britain and how Members can improve their lot?</P>

	<P>Last evening, I attended an all-party committee meeting chaired by Deputy John Cregan to discuss the role of the friends of the undocumented Irish in the United States and how best we can make progress on this issue.  I commend Deputy Cregan&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.  Members should press ahead with the current bipartisan approach.  I have also discussed this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has made a number of trips to the United States to lobby on behalf of the Irish in America.  We should invite the Minister to the House to debate Deputy Cregan&rsquo;s initiative which has been debated in the Lower House.  Such a debate would give Senators an opportunity to show support for the bipartisan approach and identify how best to proceed.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of achieving consensus on health policy, it is not a lack of support from the Opposition which has led to the problems in the health service.  I remind Senators that the Minister for Health and Children and her two most recent predecessors, the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputies Cowen and Martin, respectively, belong to parties which have had a majority in the House for the past ten years, during which time they had control of the Department.  Lack of Opposition support was not the reason the Minister was unable, as she informed the media the other day, to obtain information from the Health Service Executive.  She has effectively admitted she cannot get satisfaction from the organisation she created or the manager she appointed.  This sounds like a case of hands-off politics.  Patients deserve more and if the Minister wants to put them first, she must find out what is going on in the health service.  It is ridiculous to hear Government Senators imply this is a problem created by the Opposition.  It does not speak to the facts as they emerged at a recent committee meeting.</P>
        <P>When I spoke last week about two further women being diagnosed with breast cancer, little did I think we would hear about 97 more women a few hours later.  Responsibility must be put on those responsible, which is what is being said in the D&aacute;il.  We must have accountability and someone must be accountable.  We cannot have two parallel structures where one person, particularly the person meant to be in charge, does not know what is happening within the HSE.  It was the Minister who created the HSE.</P>

        <P>I agree with my colleague on the issue of road safety.  Will the Leader raise the issue of poor signage on road works throughout the country with the Minister for Transport, particularly with regard to changes in road layout?  We see this serious problem on a daily basis and must see more action from local authorities on the matter.  I agree with Senator Keaveney that we need better signage where traffic layout is changed because the lack of adequate signage leads to serious accidents.</P>

This would be the third debate on cancer services in two months and the Minister&rsquo;s fifth time in the House in less than two months.  Last week she was in the House for three hours.  I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber last night and listened to what she had to say.  I remind Members that the Mullingar accord, which was agreed before the most recent general election between Fine Gael and the Labour Party &mdash; I am glad the Labour Party has not supported the Fine Gael call for a debate &mdash;  had 12 priorities.

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been quite difficult to listen to some of this debate and I hope it is not broadcast on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight.  The debate should be about the victims of the flawed health policy the Minister has overseen.  It would be hard for victims of the service that has been provided down the years across the State to listen to the political toing and froing taking place in this Chamber without any reference to them.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on an issue on which I have asked for a debate on a number of occasions and which has been supported in the House today, namely, the undocumented Irish.  I believe there is cross-party consensus on adopting a motion in this Chamber, without debate if necessary.  It is disrespectful to the undocumented Irish and to <Col N="1731"/>those who are lobbying that this Chamber has failed to introduce this motion three weeks after it has been requested.  I have made such a request every week since.  Senators from across the political divide have echoed that request.  I ask, as a matter of urgency, that it be brought before the House.</P>
        <P>I reiterate a call for the Minister for Transport to come into the House and discuss the infrastructural deficiencies in the west and north west, especially around the Atlantic road corridor, the status of the project and if it will be put on hold.  There is also the issue of the western rail corridor, the Donegal-Sligo link and public transport in rural areas, particularly in the west and north west.  Anyone who represents those areas has seen a withdrawal of services in recent months and years.  In my county of Donegal we have seen such a withdrawal in Malin and west Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader seek clarity on an issue I have raised in this House regarding the Health Service Executive and the reimbursement prices to pharmacists?  As late as last night I was advised that the HSE has deferred the implementation date of 1 December 2007 for the new reimbursement prices.  When I contacted pharmacists I learned they were unaware of this deferral.  This decision is unacceptable.  All the HSE has said is that the decision has been deferred to a later date.  I ask that clarity be sought from the HSE on whether it agrees that an independent chair be appointed, as I have sought, to work out an appropriate negotiation and on when such talks will commence.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an issue which has been referred to by many speakers, that is, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  I have said previously that there is a great deal of confusion about who is responsible for what.  I asked if we could have a briefing document.  My understanding is that the Department <Col N="1732"/>of Health and Children is the policy Department and the Health Service Executive must ensure the provision of service.  In regard to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point, the HSE is the issue.</P>
        <P>We have moved from a situation of 14 health boards which had local democratic input by way of local public representatives who were doing a pretty good job.  I accept there may have been room for improvement but to go from 14 health boards to an executive simply has not worked.  I have stated that so far as I am concerned, the jury is out on the HSE but it is time to deliver the verdict because I believe the HSE is not working.</P>
        <P>Would it be possible for the Leader to indicate if we have the power under standing orders to call the HSE before a sub-committee or a committee of this House and, if so, could he advise me how to go about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>What is clear from what has been said in the discussion about the health service and the current crisis in Portlaoise in cancer care is that, for the sake of the women and their families who are suffering terribly at this time, the key question that must be asked in this House and elsewhere is who is responsible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>If nobody will take responsibility, why not?  It is clear the Minister bears ultimate responsibility for a system which she set up and which appears to be responsible for failures in communication, diagnosis and treatment.  If not the Minister, why has somebody lower down the hierarchy not resigned?</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In Britain, the head of Revenue and Customs took the responsibility and resigned following an error of which he was clearly unaware.  Nobody in the HSE, the Department of Health and Children, Portlaoise Hospital or anywhere else in the health care system has yet taken responsibility for the terrible situation in which these women find themselves.</P>
        <P>I renew my call for a debate on the restoration of universal child benefit to children of asylum seekers who are in receipt of direct provision.  When I called for such a debate on the Adjournment last week, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs responded by stating asylum seekers were receiving direct provision in lieu of child benefit.  Direct provision is only &euro;9.60 per week per child for the approximately 2,000 children of asylum seekers.  By contrast, child benefit is &euro;160 per month, or approximately &euro;40 per week.  Yes<Col N="1733"/>terday I spoke at an Irish Refugee Council launch to call for an increase in the amounts payable under direct provision in order that they would be at least equivalent to the amount paid in child benefit and close to the sum of &euro;40 per week.</P>
        <P>I again ask the Leader to convene a debate on the terrible situation of children of asylum seekers in particular, who are in real poverty and to whom we are simply not paying adequate social welfare.</P>

One of the most esteemed names in modern Irish politics is that of Alan Dukes because of the Tallaght strategy.  Before that, in the 1920s, de Valera allowed the facts to bring him into a bipartisan policy.  We also had such a policy throughout the Troubles.</P>
        <P>It is clear to all of us that difficulties in certain areas of Irish life and public life will be solved <Col N="1735"/>only by a bipartisan approach.  While we might argue about what these are, there would not be any argument &mdash; if, for example, a major row were to break out about immigration in the middle of a recession &mdash; that the Upper and Lower Houses could not be turned into bear pits, with people&rsquo;s lives and the lives of those in marginalised communities being debated in a political roughhouse.  We would have to adopt a bipartisan approach in such circumstances.  We had to adopt one with regard to Northern Ireland  and we will not reform the public sector without one.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
        <P>I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Harney, was playing politics in seeking a bipartisan approach because the same systemic problems are in the health service that were in Northern Ireland.  One cannot deal with the health service unless all parties are agreed that some tough measures will have to be taken to deal with the vested interests involved.</P>
        <P>I strongly urge Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and the Independent Senators to take some of the heat out of this debate.  We have had weeks of debate in the media but at the end of it I do not think the public knows a lot more.  People are angrier but not much more light has been cast on the matter.  Deep down people get angry when politicians carry on partisan warfare as the public knows the problems are systemic.  The public respects the Minister and knows she has taken on a terrible job.  The public also knows there is a vested interest and I have repeatedly heard the Opposition closing with that issue, which is right, but every so often the Opposition and the Government again fall back into partisan rows.  As a preparation for the forthcoming difficulties in dealing with immigration, I strongly recommend that we agree on areas where we can adopt a bipartisan approach.  These include the public sector, immigration, Northern Ireland and health.</P>

	<P>I concur with Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to attend the House.  I have lost count of the number of times I have made the same request &mdash; perhaps six or seven times.  Yesterday, Mr. Se&aacute;n Quinn commented specifically on the environment in Ireland and bringing people here under false pretences.  Unfortunately, the self same chief executive has an area within his organisation for planning and the environment, which is totally underfunded and has been for a number of years.  I take his comments with a grain of salt, however, because the resources are not there.  I know the individuals concerned and I have worked with them; there is one person and an assistant.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that at the beginning.  The environment is one of the biggest issues and the others are the access debacle, particularly in the mid-west, competitiveness, product development and the various marketing challenges facing us.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of the undocumented in the United States.  I was one of the few who attended an all-party meeting on this issue last night.  It is a pity there was not a larger attendance but significant business was going on in the D&aacute;il at the time.  I took the liberty of getting in contact with some of those on the committee that is trying to promote the cause of the undocumented in America.  I know some of them quite well personally.  This is an area on which we must maintain a collective cross-party view.  Unfortunately, however, the people who have been doing their best in recent years to help the undocumented through various strategies in many cases believe the current Minister is not doing all he can in order to achieve this.</P>

	<P>Senators Twomey, Norris, Ormonde, Fitzgerald, Feeney, Doherty, Callely, Bacik, Glynn, Buttimer and Harris all expressed serious concerns about events that have occurred since we met last Thursday.  No one could have foretold what would happen following the Minister&rsquo;s address to the House, when she explained in minute detail the position concerning her portfolio.  One could only admire her vast knowledge and grasp of her brief.  We as public representatives, however, must acknowledge that the communications system that existed under the former health boards has completely changed since the move to the HSE structure.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Minister could not find out the up-to-date information on this matter?  All fair-minded people would say the buck must stop somewhere.  If neither the Minister nor the CEO of the HSE is being supplied with information, then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to give peace of mind to those 97 unfortunate women who had to be called back.  Everyone in the country was gripped with concern for their well-being, as well as for the other nine women.  We in this House want to do the right thing.</P>
        <P>I saw the Minister, Deputy Harney &mdash; she and I are close personal friends &mdash; from time to time correctly brief the then Opposition spokesperson in the D&aacute;il, Senator Liam Twomey, another good friend of mine, and give him as much information as she had to hand.  Senator Twomey, a medical doctor of eminence, has much to contribute in this regard because there are culprits in his profession.  If they were culprits in my former profession, we would not be too long about taking action.  There is no point in hiding from this.  If people have the required ability, they should be in these positions, but if they do not, they should not be given such positions.</P>
        <P>I take the Senator Twomey&rsquo;s point about Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty.  He clarified her position on the interview board, which was important information for Members of this House.  She is an eminent person in her own right.  I have read and heard comments in various branches of the media on her involvement in this issue.</P>
        <P>I will endeavour to invite the Minister, Deputy Harney, to the House at the earliest possible time and to make time available to have another very meaningful contribution from her.  On the last occasion here, she engaged in a question and answer session and Senators were responsible in their contributions.  As Senator Harris said, there is no gain for anybody toing and froing on this issue and throwing allegations across the floor of <Col N="1738"/>the House.  Most of us were members of health boards.</P>
        <P>When the Hollywood report was published, if the truth were told we all, regardless of whether we are members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Fianna F&aacute;il, battled as hard as we could to have specialised services located in our own areas.  Perhaps with the benefit of hindsight that was not the right thing to do.  The recommendation of the Hollywood report for specialist services to be located in one catchment location in each area may have been correct, but given the nature of politics and human beings, we battled with each other for those services to be located in our own towns.  Therefore, we as politicians have had a responsibility in this regard  for a long time under the former health board system.  Let us be factual, honest and put the issues on the table.</P>
        <P>We are one of the first group of individuals who down through the years have admitted when we got something wrong or something  right.  No one is infallible in such circumstances.  However, when people&rsquo;s lives are at stake let us put up our hands and say that whatever must be done should be done to improve matters.</P>

The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I was a member, the Joint Committee on Transport, which was chaired by Senator Ellis, and the Road Safety Authority have done considerable work in this regard.  We have come a long way in that 100 people are alive today who would not be alive had we not implemented the proposals made over the past 18 months.  Two thousand or 3,000 people would have been in serious accidents or maimed for life.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate tragedy that took place two days ago only 15 miles from my home, in which two young lives were lost, is most regrettable.  I express my sympathy to the two families involved.  The National Roads Authority must ensure that reasonable distances are maintained where major route changes are made.  I refer to the need to have at least a quarter of a mile of roadway fully visible.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White expressed the need to address the issue of risk management in hospitals.  Senators can debate this when the Minister is present.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, Keaveney and Doherty called for a debate on planning regulations in areas where holiday homes are purchased in vast numbers.  Their request to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House is valid.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White asked that the Minister for Finance be invited to the House to discuss public services.  I will have no problem allocating time for this debate but it will not take place until early in the new year because of the budgetary constraints on the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney called for a debate on animal welfare.  We are endeavouring to have this debate take place and have been in contact with the Minister&rsquo;s office.  When I hear further news, I will relay it to the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan questioned the position regarding the coast guard stations at Valentia and Malin.  It is proposed by the relevant Minister that there will be two centres.  I understand the difficulties in Valentia and Malin concern broadband, the continuity of electricity supply and other matters.  One station is to be in the east, in the Drogheda area, and the other location is to be agreed with the Minister.  Since Senators asked me about the stations, I have been assured that no jobs will be lost.  If Senator Coghlan wishes to discuss this during Private Members&rsquo; time, he can table an appropriate motion.  Perhaps he can pursue the matter on the Adjournment tomorrow evening.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca and Kelly called for a debate on the portfolio of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Brennan.  This is very timely at the start of the term of the new Seanad, bearing in mind the five-year or seven-year plan for the Department.  The Minister has been very effective in every portfolio he has had so far and <Col N="1740"/>I look forward to his visit to the House.  We will try to have the debate as early as possible.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Hannigan called for a debate on Seanad reform.  Senator Norris referred to his elitist panel.  We can discuss this in the House along with all the other panels.</P>

	<P>The debate on Seanad reform will take place in the House from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. this evening.  I regret it is only a two-hour debate because it could last for an entire <Col N="1741"/>day.  I ask that the Clerk present the 25 Members of the 23rd Seanad who were not Members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad heretofore, and the ten Members who had been Members of the D&aacute;il &mdash; 35 in all &mdash; with the last two reports on Seanad reform so they can read them over the coming two or three weeks, or over Christmas.  Bearing in mind that there is some urgent legislation to come before the House in addition to the budget debate, which will be followed by the Christmas recess, perhaps we can have a full-day debate on Seanad reform in the first or second week of February.</P>
        <P>There are many good ideas on Seanad reform.  As one who played a central role in the process, in addition to the present Cathaoirleach, who was a Whip, I note that 30% of all legislation is initiated in this House.  This is an excellent means of assisting the Government and it results in much better scrutiny of legislation.  The Seanad has always been referred to as the Upper House.  Ministers look forward to coming to this Chamber because they know that on most occasions, legislation can be scrutinised here according to its merits in a non-partisan way.</P>

	<P>Why is there no legislation at all this entire week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to all panels in this House and not just to the one whose representatives seem to be the most vocal.  That is the nature of their panel but ultimately we are all Members in our own right and all have individual and collective responsibility.</P>
        <P>Senators Ellis and Feeney called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the decisions of the Constituency Commission and the difficult position of the electorate in Leitrim and in many constituencies, including my own.  Senator Ellis and I would not be Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann were it not for a commission that disenfranchised the people who wanted to come out in their hundreds to re-elect us to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Had Senator Ellis and I not been appointed to the Seanad, it is quite possible that they would not be as well represented as they are at present.  Having taken this into account, one must conclude that no county should be left without a Member in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is what this proposal is about and I will have no difficulty inviting the Minister to the House to discuss it.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan and Doherty referred to the Irish community in the United Kingdom.  The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body met at the weekend and discussed Irish emigrants.  People who went to work in these destinations have grown old and have little support.  During his 20 year membership of the Seanad, Paschal Mooney was a champion of the emigrant and I acknowledge that today.  I will be briefed by him from time to time in regard to what we should do.  As Leader, I am lucky to have his friendship.  I have <Col N="1742"/>no difficulty in setting aside time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Pearse Doherty raised the issue of transport to, and matters in, the west.  Perhaps we can have a debate on the Border, midlands and west region, which would very welcome.  The BMW region covers nearly all the Connacht-Ulster constituency and Longford-Westmeath, which has now been included for the European Parliament elections.  I cannot let the occasion pass without saying that never has as much money been spent on infrastructure in the west as is being spent at present.</P>

We come to this House to discuss facts.  There will be a major expansion of the rail network to the west, although that may not occur in Derry, Donegal or in counties to which we would like to see it extended.

As Senators know, many public representatives from the Taoiseach down were very involved in this matter last week because we were all concerned.  Meetings took place over two or three days with Ministers and opposition leaders and the Taoiseach met the pharmacy organisation at the weekend.</P>
        <P>I have a letter from Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Dowd, who is well known to us from the HSE in the midland region, in which he states that in view of the considerable progress in this regard, the HSE has decided to defer to a later date implementation of the new reimbursement rates planned to take effect for community pharmacists on 1 December 2007.  He went on to state that the HSE would keep community pharmacists informed of its intention regarding the implementation of the new arrangements and that individual community pharmacists had been informed by letter.  The requests genuinely made by Members of both Houses and acted on by the Minister and the Taoiseach have been listened to.</P>
        <P>I read a suggestion in a newspaper that the pharmacy people would appoint an independent arbitrator, which is unacceptable.  The person appointed must be totally independent if that is the route we take.  Many Senators would be more <i>au fait </i>than I with this.</P><Col N="1743"/>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to address the House on a theme of particular importance.  We have a well established legislative and administrative infrastructure to support equality principles.  The provisions of the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts, together with the work of the Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal, have given us a very firm foundation which is recognised internationally.  The legislation provides protection as well as a forum for redress against discrimination.  Discrimination is recognised under nine grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.</P>
        <P>I wish to concentrate on the position of the Traveller community and to outline some of the important issues which must be addressed in a practical and meaningful way to underpin equality for Travellers.  We live in a time of rapid social change and we see a greatly increased diversity of peoples who have their origin in other countries.  In trying to adapt to these circumstances, there is a danger we may overlook a community which has deep historic roots in Irish society.</P>
        <P>We all recognise many of the problems which occur around issues such as the provision of halting sites.  We are all aware of conflicts between Travellers and settled people.  For some people, their awareness of Travellers is derived almost entirely from such situations.  Reporting in the media also highlights negative images.  It is not surprising, therefore, that attitudes characterised by suspicion and fear persist both among Traveller and settled peoples.  Many Travellers continue <Col N="1744"/>to live on the margins of mainstream society.  Young Travellers do not, in general, enjoy anything like the same range of life choices available to their settled counterparts.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that Travellers have been subject to persistent discrimination and social exclusion for many generations.  As Minister with responsibility for equality issues, I am very conscious that pursuing equality is not simply about reacting to discrimination and prejudice.  We also need to give positive support to groups and communities in our society which face particular disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In the wider equality arena, we have seen additional supports for people with disabilities through the national disability strategy incorporating the Disability Act 2005.  The national women&rsquo;s strategy is a comprehensive statement of the issues involved in the continuing pursuit of gender equality.  In regard to Travellers, there also have been a number of important strategic measures and instruments, the first of which was the report of the Task Force on the Traveller Community.  After exhaustive consultation with stakeholders, the task force, chaired by Mr. Justice Fergus Flood, produced a comprehensive set of actions and objectives in its 1995 report.  My Department chaired the Traveller monitoring committee which reported on the implementation of the task force report.  By the time the monitoring committee gave its second progress report in December 2005, many of the task force recommendations had been implemented.  These included the enactment of equal status legislation, which gives explicit protection against discrimination to Travellers.  In addition to an overarching monitoring committee, there also have been separate consultative structures supporting policy development in respect of Traveller health, education and accommodation.  Following on the last national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, a new national advisory body was created based on a renewed commitment from the social partners to give &ldquo;concentrated attention&rdquo; to pursuing progress for Travellers.  In line with best international practice, the new national Traveller monitoring and advisory committee operates independently of Departments.  This committee was inaugurated by the Taoiseach earlier this year under the Chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Bonner, the former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The committee includes a broader representation of Travellers than the old monitoring committee which it replaces.  In addition to the principal national Traveller organisations, there are a number of other prominent Traveller representatives.  A quarter of the committee&rsquo;s membership is composed of Traveller representatives.  Already, it is playing an important role in distilling the views and advice of stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Government commits very significant financial resources to Traveller-specific programmes.  In recent years this has been running at <Col N="1745"/>well over &euro;100 million per annum.  About half of this goes on Traveller accommodation and much of the remainder is spent in the education sector.  Despite sustained funding over many years and the work of the various consultative bodies to which I have referred, the rate of progress has been somewhat disappointing.  There has been an obvious need for greater progress and more effective delivery of services and supports by State agencies.  Responding to this, a high level group on Traveller issues was established at the request of the Taoiseach.</P>
<P>The high level group is composed of senior officials from Departments and other State agencies.  It should not be regarded as a replacement or a duplication of the work of other committees.  It is working in a very focused way to improve the performance of State agencies in delivering their services for Irish Travellers.  The work of the high level group is supported by a very firm commitment from the Taoiseach and the Government to drive forward the delivery of more effective services.  The core objective proposed by the high level group is to ensure effective inter-agency co-operation using the structures of the city and county development boards.  This arrangement is closely allied to meaningful consultation with Travellers and their representatives at local level.  In March of last year, the Government endorsed the approach proposed by the high level group.  This has led to each city and county development board establishing a Traveller inter-agency group to implement the Government-approved strategy.  My Department and the high level group are keeping a close eye on developments.  I am conscious that in some areas, there is much more tangible progress than in others.  We are working with specialist bodies like Pobal who have vast experience in local and community development.  We are also using the expertise of the Institute of Public Administration to help highlight the most effective approaches to management and administrative processes.</P>
<P>The work of the Traveller inter-agency groups incorporates the full range of public services, including law enforcement.  Sometimes this is viewed as a separate issue.  However, it is clear to me that effective law enforcement and building positive community relations require full co-operation from all stakeholders.  Much has been made in the media of reports of crime among Travellers.  I have no problem in also applying the equality principle to law enforcement.  Therefore, anyone who commits a crime should expect to be dealt with through the criminal justice system.  However, we must also remember that many of those most affected by crime committed by Travellers are other Travellers.  This can occur through intimidation and obstructing access by service providers to particular localities. It is particularly true in the way that negative stereotypes can be reinforced to the detriment of decent, law abiding Travellers.</P><Col N="1746"/>
        <P>The Traveller community has had to deal with significant disadvantage and discrimination over many generations.  Like everyone else, Travellers have had to cope with the very rapid social and economic changes that have occurred in Ireland in recent years. While these changes have brought many benefits, the pace of change has created its own difficulties.  Many traditional occupations have died out, both for Travellers and settled people.  There has been increasing pressure on older family and community structures. Young people, in particular, are subject to a range of influences which older generations did not experience.  Unfortunately, the modern scourges of drug use and youth suicide affect Travellers as much as the settled community.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has gone through an economic boom, it is fair to say that the full benefits of this have not been felt by many in the Traveller community.  It is often said that a rising tide lifts all boats but we sometimes forget that not everyone has a boat.  People with limited access to employment generally experience corresponding limits on the range of life choices which are open to them.  It is worth noting that the idea of supportive positive action is included in the original employment equality legislation of 1998 in respect of Travellers, people with disabilities and those over 50 years of age.  The concept was extended in the Equality Act of 2004 to encompass all of the nine grounds laid down in the legislation.  In practical terms, promoting equality implies that we must be ready to support an environment where everyone has a fair chance to make the most of their abilities.  While I am here, I will take the opportunity to mention that a serious effort is being made in some areas to rectify a wrong that exists and has existed in this country for a long time.  The best example I have seen in the few months in which I have been in the job is the very hands-on approach taken by the county manager of South Dublin County Council, Joe Horan, who has provided wonderful opportunities for Travellers, as well as the respect they have for him and the co-operation and interaction that takes place on a regular basis.  It is a great example to other local authorities in respect of what can be done.  I would like to see some of the work and success enjoyed by South Dublin County Council being replicated around the country.  If this council can be so successful, there is no reason similar results cannot be achieved everywhere else in the country.</P>
        <P>In pursuing positive action, an essential link has to be made in the progression from education and training to employment. Retention in education is a continuing issue for Traveller families and a minority of Traveller children progress as far as the junior certificate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had the pleasure last week of attending a play written by a Traveller.  It was almost a one-man show by Michael Collins whom some Senators might remember from &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;.  Apart from being a wonderful play, it contained a wonderful <Col N="1747"/>message.  He explained to people how they needed to stay in education as long as possible in order to maximise their chances in life.  It is a wonderful sketch and I hope it can be shown in as many parts of Ireland as possible.  When one hears a successful Traveller explaining matters to and advising people, it is all the more meaningful.  Last week&rsquo;s performance was a once-off which had the support of South Dublin County Council but we will make every effort to ensure it travels around the country and that other people are given the opportunity to see it.</P>
        <P>I realise that there are many complex issues involved and I am encouraged that we have a comprehensive strategy to address these in the report and recommendations for a Traveller education strategy, which was published last year.  This was the product of an intensive engagement between the education services, Traveller representatives and other stakeholders.  The Department of Education and Science is leading the implementation of this strategy which will be of vital importance.  We will continue to find it difficult to motivate young Travellers to remain in education unless they can be convinced that it will lead to meaningful employment and a reasonable income.  I am aware of the views expressed by Traveller representatives that discrimination in entering the workplace is a continuing barrier for Travellers even though they may have the relevant skills and qualifications.  I am also aware that this form of discrimination can be expressed very subtly &mdash; &ldquo;thanks for your application, but the job is already gone&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, this is the news to which so many Travellers have had to listen for a long number of years and is something we cannot tolerate or allow to continue.</P>
        <P>By way of contrast, I would like to highlight some of the successful employment initiatives which have taken place recently.  These have been based on an inter-agency approach, both at local and national level.  A number of local authorities, in particular, South Dublin County Council and Clare County Council have opened up new routes into employment and enterprise for Travellers.  This has resulted in direct employment in the local authorities and Travellers setting up their own businesses.  The HSE is also building on the work of its Traveller primary health care programme.  Recently it produced a new tool kit to promote further employment opportunities in the health service.</P>
        <P>A further initiative was the Traveller internship programme in the Civil Service.  A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of participating with the Taoiseach in an award ceremony for successful participants.  Under this programme 23 young Travellers gained valuable work experience.  Some performed clerical duties while others engaged in general operative work with the Office of Public Works.  The participants were enabled to develop a range of abilities, including computer skills, personal communications and <Col N="1748"/>team working skills.  Some have gone on to other employment in both the public and private sectors.  Others have opted to seek further education.  Within public bodies, news of this programme and the local authority initiatives is having a ripple effect and further employment opportunities are emerging for Travellers.</P>
        <P>I hope the social partners in the private sector will be increasingly involved in future initiatives to support Travellers in the workplace.  We have already developed some of the supports that may be needed in this regard.  It is very encouraging that F&Aacute;S has implemented a number of special initiatives in support of Travellers over the past two years, located in Clare, Cork, Dublin and Galway.  These initiatives involved 200 people from the Traveller community and included almost 50 employment and enterprise opportunities.  I hope this work will produce a coherent training strategy that will have an ongoing impact in all areas of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is nice to have some good news to report and the news is not just that people who might not have considered mainstream employment previously are now in the workforce.  It is also about Travellers and settled people working together and developing some mutual appreciation and understanding.  Positive action on employment is not just about economic progress.  It is about breaking down barriers of suspicion and fear and moving towards inclusion and equality.</P>
        <P>More initiatives will be needed to solve the many serious problems that remain.  There continue to be problems with the delivery of accommodation and the general health status of the Traveller community.  The important aspect of the employment initiatives is that it shows what can be achieved with a collaborative approach from State agencies and Traveller community representatives.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since the 1995 report of the task force on the Traveller community, Ireland has become a much more diverse and faster moving society.  An essential objective must be opening up mainstream economic and social activities to participation by Travellers.  This should not mean that Travellers have to sacrifice their own distinctive culture and traditions.  I hope it will mean that Travellers, like others, will adapt and re-invent their way of life to participate as equals in 21st century Ireland.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to necessary and helpful legislation.  This is important but attitudes must also change.  In modern Ireland we cannot allow what happened before, when Travellers were discriminated against in a despicable manner.  Members of these Houses have a role to play and must show leadership to change attitudes that exist and provide equal opportunities for all.  I thank Senators for their attention and I look forward to their contributions.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Liam Twomey. </P><Col N="1749"/>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for providing an overview of the matter and an outline of the structures.  We agree on the objective of promoting equality for the Travellers.  The report has no measurements of the position in health and education nor Government targets for the next five years.  There is greater recognition of the principle of equality and its application to the Traveller community.  There is a greater recognition of the distinct cultural and social grouping the Traveller community constitutes.  As a former Cathaoirleach of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council I have seen specific programmes such as accommodation and social inclusion programmes.  There are good relations between bodies that represent the Traveller community at local authority level.  The Minister of State has alluded to accommodation, one of the most fundamental programmes required to assist the Traveller community.  These programmes are always contentious but local councillors have taken responsibility and have approved sites for Traveller accommodation in their local authority areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael has stressed the need for acceleration of local accommodation plans of local authorities and access to the justice system.  Discrimination and equality are essentially flip sides of the same coin.  Promotion of equality is the correct approach to this issue rather than seeing it as a fight against discrimination.  Positive support for education must be targeted, measured and precisely specified.</P>
        <P>We do not have up-to-date figures for the health status of the Traveller community.  The most recent figures show a higher rate of infant mortality and lower life expectancy for the Traveller community.  These should be measured and we should be able to track changes and the effect of policies adopted and expenditures incurred to see if we are achieving results.  The Minister of State referred to access to employment and the local authorities are to the forefront in providing young Travellers with an opportunity to access employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been many examples of serious criminal acts by members of the Traveller community, which reflect badly and unfairly on the community.  These are isolated incidents and it is unfortunate if they stigmatise the whole community and set back the effort of promoting equality and recognising the need to support the community.  Despite the difficulties and problems there is greater public appreciation at local and national level of the need to assist the community in promoting equality in health, education and employment.</P>
        <P>With rights come responsibilities, which applies to the settled community as much as the Traveller community.  The Traveller community needs to have a greater appreciation of its obligations to society, whether in upholding the standard of accommodation provided or having a greater appreciation of the rights of neighbours.  There must be appreciation on both sides of the prob<Col N="1750"/>lems that arise when decisions are made on the location of halting sites or settled accommodation.  Law enforcement is another issue.  People in the Traveller community are victims of crimes committed by Travellers but that does not change the issue.  I accept that this is a difficult area but we should not take a particular view in respect of it simply because Travellers are affected.  The position is similar to that which obtains with regard to crime in inner city areas, namely, that it is other gangland criminals who are affected.  I do not wish to make a comparison between the two but perhaps we do not take this matter as seriously as we should.  However, I reiterate that an issue exists in respect of law enforcement.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State indicated, there is a need to build positive community relations and promote better understanding on both sides.  Fine Gael is fully committed to furthering the principle of equality and the implementation of the latter within the Traveller community.  My party supports many of the measures that have been put in place.</P>
        <P>I commend all those organisations that work with the Traveller community.  I have interfaced with some of these at local authority level and they do a wonderful job in representing the Traveller community and trying to provide the vital link between it and the authorities engaged in assisting it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We should always be realistic with regard to what we say in this Chamber.  As a politician and a doctor, I have had a great deal of contact with the Traveller community.  If there is one thing I admire about members of this community, it is that they say things as they are and are not disposed to the patronising &ldquo;we know what is best for you&rdquo; attitude displayed towards them.  There was a certain element of the latter in the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  He talked down to members of the Traveller community and stated that all the recommendations of the 1996 report were implemented.  If that is the case, why will we be obliged to concentrate our attention on resolving problems within the Traveller community in the coming years?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that the provision of funding has failed to achieve the required outcomes.  Basically, he admitted that the Government has failed utterly to achieve any of its objectives in the context of catering for the needs of the Traveller community.  That is the way members of the Traveller community like to hear about matters.</P>

	<P>If the Minister of State wants me to be constructive, I will oblige him.  I notice he has got into the habit of checking his text messages during the contributions of Opposition Members.  I will try to prevent him from doing so by speaking up somewhat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is estimated that the level of diabetes among Travellers is double that which obtains in the settled community.  There are also major problems with regard to alcohol consumption and infant mortality within the Traveller community.  The measures that work best are those which afford Travellers respect.  For example, the HSE runs a programme in New Ross on which young Traveller women are taught about basic parenting issues, such as how to look after children, how to check their temperatures, how to recognise when they are ill, etc.  These young women are taught by other Travellers, not officials of the HSE, doctors or nurses.  Travellers are of the view that this is an excellent programme.</P>
        <P>Travellers want accommodation and access to health care.  We could work hard towards achieving what they desire in respect of these issues.  Some of the organisations representing Travellers, especially those at national level, are inclined to be of the view that they are above the real issues relating to the Travelling community.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined that clearly when he criticised an organisation regarding the way it conducted itself in respect of the Roma gypsies on the M50.  The majority of Traveller organisations, especially those at local level, are working for the interests of members of the community they represent.  The Minister of State should work with them and he might arrive back here in ten years&rsquo; time with a programme that achieved some success.  He must admit &mdash; I ask him not to insult my intelligence in this regard &mdash; that the programme relating to the previous report has not worked well, despite the amount of money spent in respect of it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must also be realistic with regard to the current position.  He referred to the Equal Status Act.  To some degree, the latter occasionally drives a wedge between the settled and Traveller communities.  Certain individuals chose to abuse the provisions of the Act in an attempt to get away with engaging in criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.  If we are going to protect the decent, honest members of the <Col N="1752"/>Traveller community, we should speak to them in realistic terms and not patronise them.  We should highlight what is succeeding and what is being done right.  However, we should be honest when things are not working out.  We must also not be afraid to indicate when we witness behaviour which is not becoming of a civilised society.</P>
        <P>I must be critical of the Minister of State in respect of another point, namely, when he said &ldquo;This should not mean that Travellers have to sacrifice their own distinctive culture and traditions.&rdquo;  On each occasion on which a society is radically changed &mdash; our society has undergone such change in the past 20 years &mdash; there will be changes to its culture and traditions.  The position is the same for the Traveller community.  Travellers acknowledge that there will be changes to their culture.  The Minister of State should not insult them by making comments such as that to which I refer.  He should state that there will be changes and that we can all learn to deal with them as they happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his enlightened contribution.  When I was a boy, Travellers used to frequent rural areas.  They were welcome in people&rsquo;s houses, were usually given dinner and on many occasions were provided with accommodation, perhaps in a shed or barn.  There was mutual respect between the two communities.</P>
        <P>A significant amount has been done in recent years.  In my opinion, this is a two-way programme.  The Government, other agencies and the equality and equal status legislation can only do so much.  There must be a fair interaction on both sides.</P>
        <P>Accommodation is one of the major issues facing Travellers.  Even though people will argue that the difficulties are more acute in certain areas, I am pleasantly surprised by the progress that has been made in that regard in recent years.  It should be acknowledged that there was a significant increase &mdash; in the region of 7% or 8% &mdash; in the number of Traveller families between 2000 and 2005 and that, year on year, the position relating to Traveller accommodation has improved.  The Minister of State, his departmental officials and local authorities were responsible for the latter.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to be parochial but I am aware of a Traveller family in my county which, on six occasions, was offered accommodation of various types &mdash; from a five-bedroom house to a significant parcel of land &mdash; to try to encourage it to abandon the unauthorised site it was occupying.  The family in question, for whatever reason, refused all offers of accommodation.  I tried to persuade its members that they should take up the offer.  The local authority, councillors and various agencies also did their utmost to try to intercede and help but unfortunately our efforts came to naught.</P><Col N="1753"/>
        <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><P>It would be remiss of the Seanad to fail to recognise a number of areas in respect of which progress has been made.  Departmental statistics from November 2006 indicate that approximately 40% of Travellers were occupying standard housing, including voluntary housing, in the region of 12% were in private rented accommodation and between 8% to 8.5% were in group housing schemes.  It is regrettable that a significant number &mdash; the figure then stood at 629 &mdash; remained on unauthorised sites.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the years large numbers of Travellers used their own resources to provide themselves with accommodation.  They should be encouraged in this regard.  It is obligatory for every local authority to provide properly serviced halting sites.  It is not that long ago since my constituency of Cork South-West had no authorised halting site.  It now has three or four and I welcome this support which allows people to have basic facilities such as sewerage, water and electricity on these sites.  Local authorities and other housing groups make significant attempts to accommodate Travellers who wish to be housed and give them a slot in the community.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker, who is a medical doctor, has experience from a medical perspective and I will not state he is wrong or right.  I presume the Senator gave us the facts as he sees them.  I would like to see progress, whether through education or encouragement at local level, in getting young male and female Travellers involved in sports such as soccer, football or rugby, which people state is elitist but I do not mind.  The problem is not as acute in a rural area such as west Cork as it would be in the outreaches of Dublin or other such areas.  Cork, and west Cork in particular, has a minority sport which is often forgotten, namely, road bowling.  It is covered by Bol Chumann na h&Eacute;ireann which is affiliated to Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.</P>
        <P>I was involved in seeking funding for a pilot scheme which is being established in Dunmanway whereby an indoor road bowling alley of 50 m in length will be opened.  When one shoots the bowl it will return through a spring mechanism.  Traditionally, Travellers have been involved in this sport.  Road bowling is popular in Armagh, west Cork and Mayo and I believe an all-Ireland was held last year or the year before in Wexford.  I accept it is a minority sport.</P>
        <P>Children must be attracted to sports such as road bowling, Gaelic football or other games at a young age.  Having children who grew up in my home town with Traveller children at infant level and through national school and secondary school, I have no doubt many of them are treated well by schools and the education system.  It is a pity young Travellers have such a large drop-out rate at junior certificate level.</P>
        <P>It is also pity more engagement does not occur when sport has a camaraderie.  Those who participate in road bowling are well treated, well catered for and looked after with no discrimination by Bol Chumann na h&Eacute;ireann.  Travellers have won county championships and they have also contested in international events.  I would like to <Col N="1754"/>see progress made in this area.  A pilot scheme could be commenced to get children aged seven, eight, nine or ten more involved in sport in their communities.  International football and large clubs such as Manchester United, Arsenal or Liverpool show us that it does not matter what country one is from or what is one&rsquo;s creed or belief as one will become a hero to young people if one is good at one&rsquo;s sport.</P>
        <P>As someone with experience and who had a family member involved in teaching the Travelling community in Dublin for many years, I have a word of warning with regard to accommodation.  I would hate to see a ghettoisation with a large concentration of halting sites, caravans or several Traveller families in one housing estate.  That is a recipe for disaster.  It is also a warning for dealing with discrimination of another type with regard to the influx of refugees and asylum seekers, where people are inclined to be ghettoised.  It is important that Traveller accommodation is dealt with fairly.  It should not mean Travellers are all lumped into the one estate because they are Travellers.  This can create problems.</P>
        <P>If I am honest, my experience as a local authority member of dealing with the Traveller community is mixed.  As a previous speaker mentioned, modern society&rsquo;s obligations towards the Traveller community and responsibilities under legislation not to discriminate must be met by responsibilities of the Traveller community towards the settled community and greater interaction by the Traveller community with the settled community.</P>
        <P>It is a misconception that the settled community has a &ldquo;hands-up, hands-off&rdquo; approach to the Traveller community.  This is not the case from my experience, coming from a humble background.  The relationship between education and the Traveller community works both ways.  One can go so far to assist and I am in favour of ensuring they receive fair play, do not experience discrimination, obtain better education and housing and become involved in sport.  However, one must also urge caution that we must have better engagement and rapport and a better sense of responsibility and fairness from the Traveller community to the settled community.  This would be a great achievement.</P>

	<P>Well, what about it.</P><Col N="1755"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>Quite a lot more must be done with regard to Travellers.  We have a lack of sufficient data, particularly health data, and what we have is extremely worrying.  Mortality rates and life expectancy among the Traveller community are dismal when compared to the control figures for the general population.  The employment rate for Travellers between 25 and 44 years of age is 16% compared to 79% for the settled community.  That is an enormous disparity.</P>
        <P>Travellers feel particularly strongly about the Government&rsquo;s obdurate refusal to regard them as a group having its own ethnic identity and the refusal to recognise Travellers as a minority ethnic group.  This is probably because it would put teeth into the fine sentiments of the Government and give a legal point to them.  This was recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Equality Authority and all Traveller organisations.  It would be a democratic exercise for the Government to take this on board and at last recognise Travellers as an ethnic group.</P>
        <P>We could spend the evening debating whether Travellers are an ethnic group.  They have certain linguistic characteristics, an historical and cultural background and a different way of life.  To some extent, the Government already acknowledges the distinctive culture of Travellers and assisted in establishing Pavee Point.  It also acknowledges that Travellers are a separate social grouping.  This means Travellers being a separate cultural and social grouping is acknowledged by the Government.  The next logical step would be to acknowledge them as a minority ethnic group.  That would also help in terms of translating stated policy into practice.  Many observers believe it is invariably the Travellers who are expected to change rather than requiring society to accommodate a group which is already recognised as different.</P>
        <P>A number of requests have been made which are worthy of consideration.  The establishment of an ombudsman for Travellers has been sought.  We already have ombudsmen for this, that and the other and it could help to resolve the sometimes awkward relations that exist between the settled and Traveller communities, the fault for which can fall on either side.  I recall when playing fields were invaded and people were blackmailed by members of the Traveller community who asked for payment to leave.  An ombudsman would be a useful institution in that regard.</P>
        <P>I have a number of problems with the disgraceful way the Defamation Bill is scuttling through the House on Committee Stage, thereby disbarring 35 out of 60 Senators from speaking at all on Second Stage.  A draft code of conduct developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform states: &ldquo;Newspapers and periodicals shall not publish material intended or likely to cause grave offence or stir up hatred against an individ<Col N="1756"/>ual or group on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, colour, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, illness or age.&rdquo;  Why is the Traveller community left out if the Government does not accept it is covered under &ldquo;ethnic origin&rdquo;?  If it has not accepted the Traveller community as a minority ethnicity, it must be included separately.</P>
        <P>I speak with a degree of authority on this because I pioneered the sexual orientation clauses in Irish legislation and, from the beginning, I coupled them with membership of the Traveller community.  Every time legislation was gender or human rights proofed, sexual orientation and membership of the Traveller community were included.  Why then have Travellers been excluded given that the matter in question seems to place them at a great disadvantage?</P>
        <P>The rights of Travellers under international agreements, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, which was recently incorporated into law, exist on paper but do not mean much in practice.  They may, for example, have the right to vote under Article 25 of the covenant but they do not have the right in practice because of the attitudes of local authorities.  They are denied accommodation or given inappropriate housing and they are not registered by the very local authority which in some instances is at war with them.  According to a document with which I have been supplied:</P>
        <P LI="1">This dynamic is compounded when the agency that has failed to deal with your accommodation issues either appropriately or effectively is also the agency with responsibility for the electoral register.  For example, in order for Travellers living on the roadside or in unofficial accommodation to register to vote the Local Authority must acknowledge that they are resident in the area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have raised the practical issues I would like the Minister to address, namely, the Press Council, an ombudsman, the right to vote and implementing in reality those rights that appear to be conferred by the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me.  I have been involved in this issue for many years.  One of my assentors for my very first election campaign was Nan Joyce, a spokesperson at the time for the Traveller movement.  There is a need to ensure we take the proper approach on the Traveller issue.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech but did not think it as patronising as others appear to have found it.  It touched on issues which I consider important and the only aspect which I could possibly find patronising was the comment about television programmes.  The criti<Col N="1757"/>cism that not enough has been done is important, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must investigate the issue of suicide within the Traveller community because suicide rates among Travellers are now four times higher than in the rest of the population.  I would like to set targets in areas such as infant mortality, suicide and alcoholism, all of which have high rates within the Traveller community.</P>
        <P>Difficulties have arisen with various local authorities but it should be acknowledged that Fine Gael has been quicker than any other party to recognise the importance of this issue.  On a number of occasions over the past three years, its leader has hauled in errant councillors who went beyond the bounds of acceptable language when dealing with Travellers.</P>

	<P>Incidents arose in Galway some years ago, and Tipperary and Wexford in more recent times, whereby unacceptable comments were made about Travellers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The idea of an ombudsman to deal with issues pertaining to the Traveller community is useful and sensible.  However, having been a supporter of Travellers&rsquo; rights for as long as I can recall and having fought to ensure they received education and proper facilities in schools, I continue to disagree on the issue of culture, subculture and ethnicity.  We should debate that important issue but the Minister of State did not refer to it in his contribution.  My point of view, that there is an Irish culture with a variety of subcultures, is not popular.  People from Kerry or GAA activists thus belong to subcultures of the Irish culture.  When I make this argument to members of the Traveller community, they disagree with me, which they are entitled to do.  However, it is like apartheid to say they belong to a different culture from Irish culture.  I do not mean to be demeaning when I say they are a subculture of the Irish culture but to point out that other matters are thereby brought into consideration.</P>
        <P>Traveller groups often argue they are too often forced to change to accommodate others.  I agree with the generality of that argument but not with the subtext that Travellers do not have to change at all.  Everybody must change.  I have argued with Traveller groups about the example of a mother who wanted to be settled in a house rather than on the road.  That debate needs to take place within the Traveller community.  I accept the argument that the State should be supportive, within reason, where Travellers choose a nomadic lifestyle but we are afraid to address these issues.  I do not want educational standards for Traveller children to drop, but if they move too much they will miss out on education and thereby encounter significant difficulties as they grow older.</P>
        <P>The current spokespersons for the Traveller community are extraordinarily articulate.  It is <Col N="1758"/>great to see them argue on radio and television in the way that people spoke for them 30 years ago.  However, a debate is needed, which means that the Minister of State will raise points with which they will disagree and all sides will have to change their positions.</P>
        <P>We need to address issues such as suicide, alcoholism, education, housing and halting sites, and targets should be set in respect of each.  The original plan for local authority housing and support for the Traveller community has not been implemented throughout the country.  Some authorities, such as South Dublin County Council, are superb but others are not.  Every time they do something, they are criticised by people in the settled community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I was first elected to a local authority in 1991, the first year of former President Mary Robinson&rsquo;s term of office.  The platform on which President Robinson was elected included a promise to instigate sponsorship of an architect&rsquo;s scheme for accommodation for the travelling community.  This marked one of the first occasions I was exposed, as an elected representative, to the issue of housing Travellers.  While the scheme proved successful, unfortunately the targets set out at the time in Government policy were not reached either then or subsequently.  Despite the efforts of successive Governments, we have failed to meet targets on accommodation.  I remember Deputy Liz McManus, in her role as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, introducing another accommodation scheme for Travellers which, unfortunately, did not attain the desired objectives. </P>
        <P Just="Left">When speaking about the role of the Traveller community in society we must acknowledge it has fewer basic services available to it than other sections of the community.  For example, Travellers face problems in the areas of housing, life expectancy and educational attainment but society fails to recognise these problems because of prejudice and ignorance.  I note the Order of Business featured a pre-emptive discussion about the role of local authority members as electors to the House and the importance of ensuring we do not upset them.  Sometimes the House has a duty to speak out when local authority members step out of line and express sentiments based purely on ignorance and prejudice.  Senators do not fulfil this duty often enough.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In acknowledging the increase in the resources made available to address problems in the Traveller community and improvements in the quality of Traveller housing, we must also accept that a considerable amount of work remains.  While I <Col N="1759"/>am loth to admit it, the ignorance and prejudice surrounding this issue necessitate a bipartisan approach of the kind referred to by Senator Harris on the Order of Business.  To do otherwise would invite those with small minds and narrow visions to dominate a debate on an issue for which we, as a society, have collective responsibility.  While having statements in the House in a proper context could help in this regard, ultimately it is a matter of having the collective will and necessary resources to meet the targets we have failed to attain thus far.  If we have any conscience, as members of an elected assembly, we would not allow these problems to persist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Boyle for sharing time. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Undoubtedly, the Traveller community is afflicted by serious issues.  Senators all have their own experience of the issue of Travellers, particularly at local government level.  I recall that as a young councillor in the mid-1970s I and others championed the cause of a few Traveller families in our area.  As a result, three Traveller families were housed in one housing allocation.  One was an elderly couple who moved into a house and were probably not given the support they needed to manage, having previously lived in poor conditions in a caravan.  Nonetheless, the move resulted in a sea change in their quality of life.  The second family were not given support either and proceeded systematically to dismantle a large part of the house for firewood.  This was a reflection on the manner in which we managed some of these issues, albeit a long time ago.  Some of those who speak eloquently about rights and so forth are not as active in offering support when it becomes necessary to provide additional services which are essential to the well-being of families.</P>
        <P>Shortly after moving into the house the third family accommodated in the scheme bought up a large number of other properties in the area.  This conditioned me to ask whether families being housed had the necessary resources to provide their own accommodation.  This is an ongoing issue because the travelling community, like the settled community, includes very wealthy people and people who require support.  It is not always easy to determine the group to which a person or family belongs.</P>
        <P>I was pleasantly surprised to learn that only 22% of the 7,691 Traveller families in the State do not live in houses.  This is a significant achievement as it is fair to assume that a significant proportion of those living in caravans on halting sites, both authorised and otherwise, refuse offers of housing because they want to maintain their nomadic way of life.  Every effort should be made and pressure should be applied to change this way of life because in many cases it is not good for the health of children.  Many health problems can be ascribed to poor accommodation and a lack of education.  Even within the settled community it <Col N="1760"/>is accepted that people in the higher socioeconomic bracket tend to look after their health and, as a consequence, have longer life expectancy and enjoy better health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also an educational element to this debate. I welcome the prioritisation of pre-schools in the Traveller community.  Frequently, parents in the Traveller community do not have an education and consequently do not pass on to their children the important message that education is a priority.  Pre-schooling is an important consideration in this regard.  Senator Twomey mentioned a scheme in place in New Ross.  The VECs have undertaken some tremendous initiatives in this area, doing great work for children and in the area of adult education and literacy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I applaud employment initiatives for Travellers, particularly the Civil Service internship programme for Travellers which has given members of the Traveller community work experience in the Civil Service.  As a result, they become more attractive and employable for employers in the private sector.  More work should be done in that area.</P>
        <P>I fully subscribe to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s argument on the issue of involving Travellers in sport as a means of offering a way to integrate in society.  It also offers networking opportunities which open up avenues to education, employment and other areas that may not be available to Travellers.</P>
        <P>I will spend some time discussing the issue of crime.</P>

This responsibility is not always exercised by members of the Traveller community and some of those who represent it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement to which I and other Senators listened carefully.  He did not, as Senator Twomey claimed, state that all the task force recommendations from 1995 had been implemented.  On the contrary, he indicated that many of them had been implemented.  I would argue, however, that only some of the recommendations have been implemented.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State was also fair in acknowledging that the rate of progress has been &ldquo;somewhat disappointing&rdquo;.  His judgment on this issue, with which we can only but agree, should be the starting and end point of our short debate.  While more resources have been dedicated to areas such as Traveller accommodation, a massive amount of work remains to be done.</P>
        <P>This is an unusual discussion because, not for the first time, Senators have noted the need for a <Col N="1761"/>bipartisan, cross-party approach to this issue.  We hear similar remarks on practically every issue virtually every day.  If some people have their way we will, at some point, push all the chairs in the Chamber together but it would still leave Government and Opposition sides.</P>

	<P>I disagree with the emphasis of some colleagues on the other side, although I endorse everything Senator Boyle said.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P FLI="0">I must, however, respectfully disagree with some of what was said on this side of the House.  I disagree with Senator Twomey that the Equal Status Act had the effect of driving a wedge between the Traveller community and wider society.  That is wrong, although it may not be what he meant.</P>
        <P>The equal status legislation, which was initiated by the Labour Party ten years ago but supported by all parties, was an important development for our society.  It was the first serious step we took as a community and society to put the sorts of equality principles we espouse into legislation.  It gave the State statutory benchmarks by which progress was to be made and scrutinised and put pressure on the providers of services to ensure they did not discriminate against any member of any group listed under nine prohibited grounds, most importantly against the Traveller community.</P>
        <P>While Members of the House have different experiences and come to this issue from that point of view, I come to it as a former councillor, but also as a lawyer.  I have acted in many cases where there has been manifest discrimination against members of the Traveller community with regard to employment and, in some cases, the provision of services.  I take exception to the suggestion often made about abuse.  Of course, abuses occur.   With most forms of statutory protection, people sometimes see the opportunity to press a case that may not have merit.  However, most of the cases I have seen have had merit, as do most of the cases raised with the Equality Authority and other bodies.</P>
        <P>The level of discrimination seen in some of the examples raised in tribunals and elsewhere would sicken anybody, as would the level of naked prejudice that still exists in society.  It exists across many of our respected institutions as well as in corner shops, hairdressers, pubs and elsewhere.  I am not trying to tar everyone with the same brush, but we need to acknowledge, notwithstanding all the progress we have made, that there is still deep-rooted prejudice across society and it finds expression in discriminatory behaviour towards Travellers with regard to employment, and elsewhere.  I do not lay this at the Minister&rsquo;s door; we have had a week talking about political accountability.  However, the Government must be alive to the possibility of discrimi<Col N="1762"/>nation and take such measures as are necessary, prudent and correct to address and stand up to it.</P>
        <P>A Senator on the Government side of the House made a point about councillors and public representatives making unacceptable statements.  I agree with what he said, but there are others in public positions who do the same, including sometimes, members of the District Court bench.  Some of these have made statements that are grossly unacceptable and they should be criticised in the House by the Minister.  It is not acceptable for any public official, judge or otherwise, to make prejudicial remarks about members of any group, particularly Travellers.</P>
        <P>It is true that many of the recommendations of the 1995 task force report have been implemented.  The target was that by 2000, some 3,100 units of Traveller accommodation would be ready, 900 homes and 2,200 Traveller specific units, halting sites or group housing schemes.  However, while the 900 houses have been provided, only 600 Traveller specific units have been provided.  Another 1,500 Travellers, therefore, seek some form of permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>I do not want to misquote Senator Walsh, who has left, or any of my colleagues.  The argument has arisen constantly in this debate that when accommodation is provided, it is not respected.  The example is always given of the case where accommodation was given to people who damaged it or did not appear to be grateful for it.  Seeking gratitude from the Traveller community is not what we should be about, although we want all groups working together.  The benchmark of progress is not whether members of the Traveller community are grateful.  Many Traveller families who live on the side of the road do not do so by choice, a fact I observed as a member of South Dublin County Council.  I thank the Minister of State for what he said about that council, the management of which is very progressive.  Traveller families do not choose to live on the side of the road without water or sanitation.  It is the duty of the State and legislators to ensure proper provision for them by ensuring resources for local authorities to provide decent accommodation for people in that situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Accommodation is linked to the difficulty Travellers have obtaining employment.  How could it be easy for a Traveller of any age to obtain employment without an address?  Traveller organisations have often pointed out that without the benefit of an address, Travellers do not have access to employment.</P>
        <P>I will wrap up as I know the Minister of State is anxious to make his response.  I thank him for what he said and draw attention to his statement that the rate of progress has been somewhat disappointing.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others that we should have targets.  It is all very well to talk about agencies &mdash; it can be difficult to get one&rsquo;s head around the various agencies and working groups &mdash; but we must set targets and try to achieve particular outcomes.  What achieve<Col N="1763"/>ments on this would the Minister of State like to be able to report to us if he were to come back to us in a year&rsquo;s time?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for what were, in the main, constructive contributions.  I acknowledge the lecture from Senator Twomey and thank Senator White for clarifying the situation.  I will not go back over the ground I already covered.</P>
        <P>I tried to give an honest assessment of the situation as I see it and mentioned that, despite the significant investment we have put in place, we have not achieved the progress we would like.  We have put in place policies or schemes in a number of areas that have worked successfully.  The plans require leadership and commitment.  If we can be successful in some areas, there is no reason the same cannot be done everywhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned that the Civil Service internship was very successful.  I spoke with a number of participants, but my words cannot express how much it meant to them to participate in a programme in which they felt it would have been impossible to participate some years ago.  One of the participants later applied for a job and is now a full-time employee in a Department.  Stories like that will inspire other Travellers to take the extra steps needed to succeed.  There is no point in our asking the private sector to employ Travellers if we are not serious about doing it ourselves and providing opportunities for them.</P>
        <P>While it is important to have in place legislation to protect against discrimination, we must focus on changing people&rsquo;s attitudes.  It is incredible that while we might admire a family that decides to move to Wexford for three months of the year, our view changes dramatically when a Traveller family decides to live on the side of the road for 12 months of the year.</P>
        <P>I listened attentively to what Senators had to say and will refer to a couple of points raised and questions asked.  There are clear performance targets, particularly in the areas of accommodation and education.  Senator Twomey mentioned the very successful primary health care programme.  That is fully supported by the State, although it was his contention that the Government had failed in that regard.  However that was one of the successful examples which, for some reason, he happened to point out even though he did not give us much credit for achieving success.  I acknowledge the various comments on accommodation, inclusion and cultural activities.  I agree we need to pay continuing attention to these areas.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of information.  An all-Ireland health study is commencing which will improve information significantly.  However, the Senator is mistaken about the press council guidelines.  They were not drafted by my Department.  The press council is established indepen<Col N="1764"/>dently.  I understand the guidelines, currently drafted, are considered as a work in progress.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Traveller organisations and others such as the Equality Authority have promoted a form of State recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group.  The Government has taken the view that while Travellers are clearly an indigenous minority community there is no firm rationale for a specific ethnic recognition.  Travellers already enjoy specific protection under equality legislation and there is special provision for local authorities to provide culturally appropriate accommodation for them.</P>
        <P>The Government has prioritised practical policy implementation and it is difficult to see how recognition of ethnicity, whether in law or otherwise, would improve the day-to-day lives of Travellers in general.  The equality legislation provides specific protection for Travellers against discrimination.  It is uncertain if an additional recognition of ethnicity would add anything to the overall legal provision.  The Council of Europe has, in relation to the framework convention on national minorities, acknowledged that the issue is of lesser significance due to the protections given in Irish equality laws.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I acknowledge that our social partners have agreed to work for greater progress for Travellers.  It is important that there is now a significant dialogue among stakeholders in national consultative and advisory structures.  In practical terms, the Government&rsquo;s approach is one which supports Travellers who are breaking out of old cycles of disadvantage.  It is imperative that we support Travellers who are determined to seize new opportunities to improve their situations and that of their families.  To do this requires sustained leadership and commitment, politically and at the top levels in public bodies.  It is also about sustaining and improving the working relationships between the State agencies and the Travellers&rsquo; representatives.  There are significant challenges and significant opportunities.  Concentrating on practical support measures will allow us to grasp those opportunities and face the many challenges successfully.</P>
        <P>I would be more than happy to return to the House in 12 months&rsquo; time when I guarantee I will be able to report major success on a number of fronts.</P>

    <Title>Report on Seanad Reform: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the commitment in the programme for Government, that this Government is to determine the extent of cross party agreement on the recommendations of the Report on Seanad Reform to advance proposals for implementation, which previously had all party agreement, and work collectively to ensure that as many of these agreed <Col N="1765"/>changes can be achieved during the lifetime of this Seanad.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I am grateful to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, for his help in opening the debate.  However, I am somewhat <?oasys _dc18- ?>disappointed, given the enthusiasm expressed, that there are not more Members in the Chamber.  It is possible, however, that as the<?oasys _dc0- ?> debate progresses many more will make contributions.  The motion was tabled in an attempt to have all Senators engage with the issue which has been talked about, not only in terms of this the 23rd Seanad but probably since its establishment in 1937.  It is an unwanted statistic that 11 reports have been produced on Seanad reform, none of the recommendations of which has been implemented, outside of a referenda in 1979 to allow the university constituencies to be reconstituted.  That is not a record that reflects well on either the political process or the willingness or ability of the House to change with changing circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Seanad was established in 1937, on foot of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, it was a sister parliament of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which, at the time, had 138 members.  In the interim the population has increased by more than a third and the number of seats in the D&aacute;il has been increased to 166.  On those grounds alone there is a need to look at the Seanad, who it represents and how it represents them.  For the most part, the Seanad can take great pride in its role as a revising chamber.  The argument that has been made by some in the political process as to the need for a second chamber has been fairly well rebutted.  In most democracies there is a second revising chamber and it exists for a reason.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the history of the Seanad there have been many instances where its existence was more than justified by the role it played with particular pieces of legislation and in the role played by Members in leading debates that were important in Irish society at the time.  We can take that as a <i>non sequitur.  </i>That debate is not going to happen.  There is a need for the Seanad and it needs to make itself as vital and as important to the people as it can.  That 11 reports have been produced, without any action having been taken on them, is a matter we need to confront as a chamber.  The most recent report carries the strongest degree of political consensus among all political parties and it offers the opportunity of achieving real progress in a short time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion reflects the reality of what is included in the programme for Government about which some Members might express disappointment but it is written with a specific purpose in mind.  The programme for Government promises to determine the extent of cross party agreement on the recommendations of the report on Seanad reform and to advance proposals for implementation.  It was written in that way because of the recognition that elections followed <Col N="1766"/>the publication of that report.  There is a new D&aacute;il and Seanad and, with the participation of my party, a new-looking Government for which reform is very much a priority.  On those grounds, we need to assess whether the consensus still exists.  I would like to believe it does and that there is a hunger among most in this Chamber and the political process in general to achieve change in Seanad processes.  What we can do is put in place a timetable to allow this to take place.</P>
        <P>As a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the previous Parliament, I sat with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and other Senators on the informal group that was meant to implement the findings of the last report on Seanad reform.  I must admit both disappointment and failure with regard to the working of that group, which was not entered into in the proper spirit.  It was there to approach change from a minimal base and the very real agreement that existed in the report was largely ignored.</P>
        <P>There is now an opportunity to reinforce the agreement that existed at that time and the 23rd Seanad is the perfect vehicle for doing so.  It has 35 new Members, 25 of whom are in the Oireachtas for the first time and ten of whom were previously Members of the D&aacute;il.  On that basis, we can take ownership of a process that will make Seanad &Eacute;ireann an even more respected political institution.</P>
        <P>One of the changes which is necessary in terms of public identification with the importance and value of the Seanad concerns the element of public election.  I stand over this as a personal achievement to be attained.  Unless members of the public can identify individually with this institution, we are very much in a black hole with regard to our political legitimacy.</P>
        <P>Political chambers throughout the world are elected by a variety of methods.  The Australian Senate, which was elected last week on the same day as its House of Representatives, in what was a very successful election for the Australian Green Party, was elected by public vote.  The German second chamber, the Bundesrat, is reconfigured during the lifetime of a government according to results in regional parliamentary elections.  As a result, it is not directly but indirectly elected by the people, depending on whom they elect.</P>
        <P>There is a mixture of three forms of selection and election to this House.  The majority of Members are elected by people who themselves are elected, which is a sound principle.  The report needs to examine whether the 1,000 people who comprise that electorate make up a representative enough sample.  For example, town councillors, who are also elected, are not part of that electorate.  Questions also arise as to whether the value of each councillor&rsquo;s vote is equal in that the population proportion for each councillor may be far greater or lesser depending on what part of the country is involved.</P><Col N="1767"/>
        <P>There are questions with regard to the panel system which, although it was introduced on the initiation of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1937, plays a particular role in the Ireland of 2007.  It is interesting that we are talking about a system that is now 70 years old.  The panel system was meant to be a reflection of the corporatist approach to politics which was very much in vogue in the 1930s and was practised particularly in Portugal.  We should be grateful we did not go fully down the road of Dr. Salazar and his like.  While that was the model in vogue at that time, we need to ask whether the vocations which are meant to be promoted through the panels are those which express public life in Ireland today and whether the weight given to them is the correct one.  Do labour and agriculture have twice the value of culture and education?  Why is particular weight given to the administrative panel or the industrial and commercial panel?</P>
        <P>The last report addressed this issue in a way that made more sense.  Instead of putting the Clerk of the Seanad through some type of mental torture before every Seanad election in determining whether the candidates comply with the vocational heading under which they are seeking election, why not have an open election among people who themselves are elected and get rid of the fiction of the vocational panels?</P>
        <P>Members of the House might find it more difficult to accept the recommendations in regard to the call for a degree of public election, which would mean a reduction in the number of seats available.  There is talk of reducing the number of seats from 43 to 26.  Nonetheless, a panel of 26 seats, however they are divided up, would still make for a lower quota than many of the present panels.  If candidates were practised public representatives, the method of election would be less difficult and therefore the need to persuade many public representatives would be lessened.</P>
        <P>I return to the fact we have a Seanad membership that is vastly changed from that of the previous Seanad and the likelihood the next Seanad will be composed of people who are part of this rolling process of membership of the House.  As we are part of this period of Seanad history, now is the time to make these changes.  Many of us can stand aside from being seen as having vested interests and can make the necessary arguments and changes.</P>
        <P>Another recommendation in the report is that not only should there be a rolling membership of the Seanad but perhaps a rolling form of election.  Again, this could be a matter of debate in determining whether consensus still exists.  There is a value in having an ever-evolving Seanad outside the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s election cycle.  Other countries operate quite well on this basis.  I referred to the German example in which the upper house constantly changes regardless of what is happening in the lower house.  Some seem to think the evolutionary approach to membership of the Seanad <Col N="1768"/>might be difficult in terms of the public perhaps using the opportunity to give a mid-term Government a bloody nose or a kick in the shins, but this is not necessarily a bad thing because it would help inform the policy debate and give the public an involvement in policy issues they would not otherwise have between the main parliamentary elections.</P>
        <P>The other suggestions as to how the Seanad should change relate to the other types of membership in the House.  The first relates to the university membership.  I have already outlined that the only effort at change to have been made in the 70-year history of the House was the holding of a constitutional amendment in 1979 that has never been acted upon.  The principles argued then remain the same.  While the membership of university Senators is a very valuable component of this House and their contributions are marked and often illustrious, they must reflect the sector they represent.  At present, that representation is limited to Trinity College and the National University of Ireland colleges.</P>

	<P>The Minister is of a mind that other universities and other degree graduates can be brought into this process in a newly enlarged university constituency.</P>
        <P>My final point, before my colleague addresses the changing functions of the Seanad, concerns the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, although I realise my difficulty in making this argument.  The report referred to increasing the number of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees to 12.  There is an argument that there should be a degree of nomination by the Taoiseach to provide a necessary Government presence in the Seanad at any given time.  The number of nominees is a matter of debate.  To use this as a mechanism to involve more people from Northern Ireland would also be of value.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, if I were to invent a system for election to the Seanad, my personal preference would be to have a totally public election.  However, I see the value in the Seanad reform report in that it outlines where consensus exists, which is where we can move from.  If we can reignite that consensus, the changes proposed can be introduced in a very short time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to address the motion, which is the first Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by me and my Green Party colleague, Senator Boyle.  That we have tabled a motion on Seanad reform shows the importance we attach to the question.  The issue was quite extensively debated during our first couple of sitting days in the House when Senators expressed their support for Seanad reform.  However, as my colleague Senator Boyle pointed out, while 11 previous reports have been produced on the proposed process of Seanad reform we have not seen any of those recom<Col N="1769"/>mendations being implemented.  Unfortunately, there is always a tendency to carry on with business as usual.</P>
        <P>It would appear that the political will to embrace reform has not been there up to now.  In its current form the Seanad has been in existence for 70 years and it is desirable to renew and upgrade our democratic systems from time to time.  To date, however, we appear to have lacked the political will to do so.  The purpose of our motion is to recognise the important work undertaken by the previous Seanad with cross-party support and involvement.  The sub-committee was chaired by the former Senator, now Deputy, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke and other Members of this House including Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, former Senator John Dardis of the Progressive Democrats, and former Senator, now Deputy, Brian Hayes.  They put together a well argued case for Seanad reform with coherent recommendations.  One of the report&rsquo;s conclusions was that the recommendations should be implemented in full, as a package and on an all-party basis.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this motion is to establish that cross-party support for the process of Seanad reform, as proposed in that report, still exists.  If so, we will be able to move to the next stage.  We currently have a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who is willing to embrace reform.  In examining this area, he has brought to bear the commitment to reform in the programme for Government.  If Senators are willing to examine positively the recommendations in the report of the previous Seanad, we will have a good opportunity to bring about such reform, which is so badly needed and for which there is a public appetite.</P>
        <P>There is a desire for reform because increasingly the Seanad is viewed as being less relevant than it should be.  It is also seen as not having a distinctive political contribution to make to the overall political process.  I know this from personal experience.  Since having had the honour of being nominated to the Seanad, many constituents congratulated me but in the next breath they asked what the Seanad does and what are its functions.  This highlights the extent to which Senators are disconnected from ordinary citizens.  It also demonstrates that the popular legitimacy we could and should enjoy is currently lacking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The functions of this House were clearly outlined in the report of the sub-committee on reform produced by the previous Seanad.  Some of that report&rsquo;s recommendations are excellent.  As regards the composition of the Seanad, it is proposed that D&aacute;il and Seanad elections should be decoupled.  It is further proposed that a system of rolling renewal of the Seanad be introduced whereby approximately half the seats would be elected every five years by a system of direct, popular election.  As my colleague Senator Boyle said, if that were to happen, it would stimulate much greater public interest in this institution.</P><Col N="1770"/>
        <P>There are also proposals for a reformed higher education representation system whereby all graduates of third level institutions in the State, holding a primary degree or equivalent award at level seven in the national framework of qualifications, should be entitled to vote in Seanad elections under a separate higher education constituency.</P>
        <P>It was also recommended that a system of indirect election be retained with a strong local government dimension. The Green Party supports that, as councillors around the country should have an input in Seanad elections.  The report recommended that 20 Seanad seats would be filled by this method.</P>
        <P>It was also proposed that the number of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees be increased by one, to 12, and that in making his nominations the Taoiseach should have explicit regard to the capacity of nominees to represent under-represented and excluded groups in Irish society.  Proposals were also made to have two nominated Senators from Northern Ireland, representing the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, as well as Senators representing the interests of immigrants and emigrants.</P>
        <P>Strong recommendations were also made on a revised legislative role for the Seanad.  One excellent proposal concerned a formal system to allow for consultation with interested groups and individuals early on in the legislative process.  That would appeal to members of the public who often do not know how to go about lobbying and thus influencing legislation that passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Other recommendations included a new role for the Seanad in EU affairs, which I strongly support.  In that respect, we could review draft EU legislation of major national policy importance as well as providing Irish MEPs with a domestic forum to discuss European issues.  Recommendations were made concerning public policy reviews in addition to giving the Seanad responsibility for scrutinising senior public appointments.</P>
        <P>The work that was carried out on that report was both thorough and intensive.  Its recommendations will involve constitutional amendments requiring a referendum, as well as new legislation and amendments to the Standing Orders of the House.</P>
        <P>The challenge facing this 23rd Seanad is one for which there is a public appetite.  It is up to us, however, to decide whether we have the political will to make it happen. Change is not easy for any of us and it must often be imposed rather than being voluntarily embraced.  We are in a unique position, however, to bring about such reform.  We have before us a report with excellent recommendations that we can examine and hopefully support.  We now have an opportunity to review and improve the quality of democracy that attaches to the institution of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I call on my colleagues to lend their support to <Col N="1771"/>Seanad reform.  The Minister, Deputy Gormely, made an announcement earlier today and will clarify his position here this evening.  I am sure he will be willing to help in the process of bringing about this reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds like the Senator is open to influence, given that he is looking for cross-party co-operation.  A rash of requests for cross-party co-operation has broken out in recent days both here and in the D&aacute;il.  I am wondering if it has anything to do with the difficulties the junior partners are having in persuading the senior partner, Fianna F&aacute;il, to accept their policies.</P>
        <P>I agree with the points made by Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca concerning the quality of the sub-committee&rsquo;s report produced by the last Seanad.  It is a most interesting document containing a good overview of the Seanad&rsquo;s work, the potential for reform, and practical recommendations on a range of matters.  As the report said, some of the recommendations will be uncomfortable for people.  There is no doubt about that.  Change is uncomfortable for everyone, including politicians, and people will have differing views on some of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>It has been pointed out that we have a new Seanad with 35 new Members, and parties are represented that were absent from the last Seanad.  The Leader has said he would like to see what consensus exists on the recommendations of <Col N="1772"/>the sub-committee&rsquo;s report.  While that is important, we do not need another report.</P>
        <P>This report is impressive in terms of the 161 written submissions, the four days of public hearings and the great work done by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, the former Senators Brian Hayes, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke and John Dardis, and the former Senator Brendan Ryan who was a member of the group for a period.  Its recommendations are radical and far reaching.  It recommends constitutional and legislative change and extensive revisions of the Seanad Standing Orders.</P>
        <P>I heard what the Minister responsible said about the university panels this morning.  I do not know whether he intends to select university panels and recommend change in that respect as opposed to what the report recommends, namely, the introduction of a package of reforms.  That would be a preferable way to proceed.  Such change affects everybody.  The way to deal with it would be to opt for a package of reforms as opposed to any one particular reform mentioned in this report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael welcomes this debate.  It offers us an opportunity once more to discuss the need to reform this House and make it relevant, radical and ready for the challenges ahead.  I will not support the Green Party motion owing to its nature and context because the House should not congratulate the Government on its intentions.  Rather it should condemn it for its inaction on the reform agenda and put pressure on it to move forward in that regard.  The House should view the Government&rsquo;s stated intentions with nothing but a sceptical eye until we see that reform become a reality.  That is the challenge we face and it has been a tough one in the Seanad over the years because we have had so many reports and even a constitutional amendment that was not acted upon.  We should not welcome the commitment in this respect in the programme for Government until we see evidence on the ground of real change and commitment by all the parties in Government.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Deputy Brian Hayes, who was the Fine Gael representative on the sub-committee.  We published our agenda for change of the Seanad as far back as 2003 with a comprehensive programme for reform.  Among the recommendations were for the Seanad to be given a watchdog role on secondary legislation.  Many statutory instruments become law with no parliamentary scrutiny required only that they be laid before the Oireachtas for a 21-day period.  Where more than 20 Members of the Seanad request it, the statutory instrument should be debated and voted on by the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Whatever about secondary legislation we are in the business here of dealing with primary legislation.  It is ironic to speak on reform of the Seanad in a week when the Government, backed by Senators D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca and Dan Boyle, saw fit not to bring any legislation to the House. <Col N="1773"/> Not one Bill is before the House this week.  I understand there is also an issue in the D&aacute;il in regard to the lack of legislation.  I have some idea about what has happened but where is the legislation to be introduced and the legislative programme for the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in this term?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>What is happening to the critical legislation to which the partners committed themselves in the programme for Government, of which we have not had sight and we are some eight of nine weeks into this term?  That needs to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>In regard to European affairs, we recommended that all MEPs elected on the island of Ireland should have the right to attend and speak in the Seanad but not vote.  We are talking about real links between Leinster House and Brussels in the work ongoing at European level that increasingly influences our everyday lives.  That suggestion is included in the recommendations in the report of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>We face a challenge in getting members of the public on-side to support the EU reform treaty and ensuring they understand its provisions, of which currently they have little understanding.  A major challenge faces us to ensure the people understand what they will be voting on in a referendum on the reform treaty, if we are not to have a repeat of the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum.  There is an opportunity here for the Seanad to play a strong role in European affairs.</P>
        <P>The report of the sub-committee contains many recommendations.  While it is not possible to go through all of them, the attendance here of former Taoisigh should be encouraged.  That is an important recommendation and is a feature of other democracies.  The attendance of the Leader of the Seanad at Cabinet is another important recommendation.  Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke said at the time of the publication of the report that she did not wish to be appointed to Cabinet in her then role.  She need not have worried so slow was the action on the report.</P>

	<P>I believe that was the last thing that was going to happen.  Since 2002, the Leader of the Fine Gael group in the Seanad has been a member of the party&rsquo;s Front Bench.  We take this House seriously.  </P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Boyle said and with what is stated in the report, namely, that the issue is not about abolishing the Seanad but that it is very much part of our democracy.  The issue is how to move forward, of that there is no question.  Without doubt the greatest issue that the public has with Upper House is its democratic legitimacy.  Without a predominantly directly <Col N="1774"/>elected membership, the question of our mandate will always arise.  There are a number of recommendations in that regard.</P>
        <P>To enhance our democracy it is important that there is Seanad reform, and I support the principle that we should try to get as much consensus as possible on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an extremely important debate.  I commend the Green Party on bringing forward the debate forward relatively early in this session of the Seanad.  Its members are doing us a service in doing so.  I am happy to support the amendment to the Green Party motion for reasons to which I will return.  We are here to promote debate and, hopefully, we can do that.</P>
        <P>One point on which it is worth reflecting initially is that, whereas the Seanad has an important role in the debate about the Seanad, this Seanad does not own this institution.  The 60 Members who are honoured to be in this Seanad do not own it; it belongs to the people of Ireland.  Whereas we have an important role to play as experienced people &mdash; some of us have long experience as Members while many of us have only recently become Members of this House &mdash; we should not lose the run of ourselves and think this is an opportunity for us to carve up this operation, as it were, for the benefit of those who are already elected here.  We should have a wider perspective on it.  That is reflected in the report prepared in the last session and in the motion the Green Party has put before us.  I do not criticise anybody when I make that remark but it is something we should bear in mind.</P>
        <P>While I commended the Green Party on bringing forward this motion and on sponsoring this debate, the wording of the motion is contradictory.  Like Senator Fitzgerald, I have an aversion to being asked to welcome a commitment in the programme for Government.  Words to that effect are included in the first line of the motion.</P>

That does not compare like with like.  Senator David Norris and other Members know that.  There is a direct electorate in the universities and an indirect electorate of councillors.  It is not unprecedented across the world to have an electoral college of persons who are themselves already elected.  It is not new.  There are plenty of precedents where parliaments and presidents are elected on the basis of an electoral college comprising persons who are themselves already elected.</P>

        <P>On the question of universities, we need to know the proportion of all living graduates of Trinity College and the National University of Ireland who vote in elections or who are even registered to do so.  If we want to throw brickbats at each other when deciding which panel is most representative, we must analyse the electorate pertaining to each in addition to the entire process.  The main reason behind the amendment to the Constitution in 1979 was apprehension that the National University of Ireland would be broken up, and another reason was to facilitate legislation to ensure third level colleges other than universities could elect Seanad representatives.</P><Col N="1776"/>

	<P>The university panel was selected in the first instance for a very sound and solid historical reason dating from the 1930s.  Trinity College and the Church of Ireland had a particular historical position that made the creation of the panel absolutely correct.</P>
        <P>Since I have become interested in politics, I have admired the work of past and present Members on the university panel, including Owen Sheehy Skeffington and, I have no difficulty in saying, Senator Norris, whose contribution to public life has been immense.  This is not intended as a condescending remark, regardless of whether Senator Norris interprets it as such.  If anybody in public life deserves to be in an upper house such as this, it is he.  In this regard, I would also include many of his colleagues, including Senator Feargal Quinn, who have made significant contributions.  We want to hear their views, as does the public, but that does not mean they should be elected simply because they are university graduates.  Why should we maintain what is essentially an anachronism, that is, an electorate of third level graduates?  &ldquo;Anomaly&rdquo; is probably a better word to describe it.  I am sorry the word &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; offends some &mdash; I am certainly not using it with this intention &mdash; but it hints at the criticism that the 30% or 35% of the voting population who are graduates are afforded special treatment.  This criticism should be part of the debate.  Five or six other proposals have been mentioned by Senators and I would love an opportunity to address them at another time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that nothing is ever perfect, irrespective of whether it is in vogue for a long or short time.  As an elected forum, the Seanad is no different and it should be <Col N="1777"/>pushing out the boat in terms of how it does its business, how it is comprised and how it is perceived.  Some do not see the Seanad in a good light but, as a House of the Legislature, its Members can be proud of how it reviews legislation.  Its teasing out of legislation has been of proven benefit to Governments, both past and present.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about the role of the universities.  I have no problem with the universities or the inclusion of other third level institutions on the university panel, but we should consider a group that has been bypassed and overlooked for many years, namely, the borough and town councillors.  They are elected but are not represented in this House.  There are five county boroughs, with a total 60 members.  There are 36 members from three 12-member town councils and 414 from 46 town councils, formerly called district councils, and 234 from former town commissions.  This results in a grand total of 744 elected members without representation in this House.  They are under the umbrella body of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  It is well worth noting that a certain town, as opposed to a borough, that was represented until recently by at least one Member of this House has a greater population than either of two counties.  The latter have county councils and I therefore support the retention of the right to representation.</P>
        <P>I am not entirely happy with the proposal to reduce the input of county councillors on the five vocational panels.  I have no difficulty in extending the number of seats in the Seanad to 65 to accommodate representatives from Northern Ireland, ethnic groups and immigrants or emigrants.  I have no difficulty in supporting strongly the automatic return to the House of the Cathaoirleach.  This is long overdue.</P>

	<P>Past and present Cathaoirligh have been very badly treated by the system that has obtained to date in the Seanad.  If nothing is done other than addressing this, a good day&rsquo;s work will still be done.</P>
        <P>Nobody, including Members of the Oireachtas, will be too offended if I say the level of debate in this House is excellent.  The contributions of Members on all sides have been innovative, reforming and productive.  Above all, they have proven more than worthy in terms of upgrading and introducing legislation.</P>
        <P>The report on Seanad reform recommends significant reform of the Seanad electoral system, including the rolling renewal of the Seanad and the introduction of direct election to a single 26-seat constituency.  Reform involves a number of facets.  I am not entirely satisfied or happy that the number of Senators elected by the county <Col N="1778"/>councils, county borough councillors, incoming D&aacute;il Deputies and outgoing Senators should be reduced.  The selection of only 20 would be unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>The point made on elected Members constituting a college is not only pertinent to Ireland but is also reflected in many jurisdictions worldwide.  At the request of the Taoiseach, an informal all-party parliamentary group on Seanad reform was established in 2005 and chaired by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Of the 43 Members elected by county boroughs to the five vocational panels, only one was elected to the group, yet the five panels contain 43 Members of a 60-Member House.  This bears thinking about.  The informal reform group addressed proposals that attracted early consensus and which are capable of implementation in the short to medium term.  Prior to the general election, the group referred to a number of draft Standing Order changes concerning the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to be piloted as sessional orders.</P>

	<P>I am proud to say I am paid from the public purse.  I run a full-time constituency office in Mullingar which I believe I should do as I am paid from the public purse.  I will make no apologies to anyone for so doing nor will I give myself a slipped disc by clapping myself on the back.</P>
        <P>It is common for federal states, such as the USA, Canada and Germany, to have an upper house of the legislature.  In a federal system, the upper house is where the interests of constituent states are balanced.  Ireland, however, is a unitary state and not a federal one.  Under the unitary system of government, there are two main arguments in favour of having an upper house.</P>
        <P>I am not exactly happy with what this report contains in regard to locally elected Members.  I ask Members to bear in mind that there is a very large elected group which is excluded from representation in this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am firmly committed to an upper house.  At present the Seanad is unrepresentative, undemocratic, anachronistic and unfair in the way it is put together.  The point raised by Senator Alex White is right in that a university electorate is elitist, a cadre, exclusive <Col N="1779"/>and unacceptable in a democracy.  However, it is not the only thing which is unacceptable.  The only reason I am on the university panel is that I would not have got a vote on the cultural and educational panel despite the fact I was the boss of the largest, oldest and most widespread educational organisation in the country, nor would I have got a vote on the labour panel despite the fact I was president of the largest labour organisation on this island.  The only way I could have a voice in the second House of Parliament was to be on the university panel.  That is why it needs reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we must ask why there is a university panel.  If we worked on the basis of one person, one vote I would not have a difficulty with maintaining the university panel.  In other words, if we elected people by direct vote and if 10% of Members were elected by university graduates &mdash; although I have no doubt a lot more than 10% of the population would be graduates &mdash; I would not have a difficulty with that.  I am not, however, enthusiastic about it.  My view since I became a Member &mdash; I have been on every reform group for 20 years &mdash; is that if it comes down to that, farmers and fishermen should vote for those on the agricultural panel, education partners should vote for those on the cultural and educational panel, registered members of trade unions should vote for those on to the labour panel and business people should vote for those on the administrative panel.  The nominating bodies should have votes.  It is disgraceful that they have no impact beyond nominating people.  These are some of the gaps in the system.  In such a structure, there would be a strong case for maintaining the university panel.</P>
        <P>I am completely in favour of extending the vote to all third level graduates.  I am a great loser in this regard because primary school teachers, who are my base, who graduated after 1996 have not been allowed to vote.  My vote potential deteriorates every year so, therefore, I have a vested interested in increasing the university franchise.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the concept of indirect elections, which works in France, the USA and in many countries.  It is a distillation of democracy in that one layer elects the other.  The only problem I have with it at present is that the preponderance of people elected that way is unacceptable.  My view is that the Seanad should become slightly larger and that the number of Members should be increased to approximately 70 and that the number elected indirectly would not be reduced to 20 but should be perhaps 30.  I very much agree with the point made by Senator Boyle.  The idea of a national list, a national panel, to elect people indirectly makes much <Col N="1780"/>more sense than this nonsense of knowledge and experience of education, etc.</P>
        <P>We need to make changes and implement the proposals.  There is a roadmap for implementation and milestones and targets are included in the report.  If we do not agree to the amendment, I will co-operate with the Government motion.  The business could be done in two months and we could move forward.  Let us make people put up or shut up.  We must be conscious of people who have been elected by county councillors.  People should be given time to adjust and make changes to what is proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will support the amendment to the motion.  I indicated I would sign it but I am afraid it was a little too late.  My problems with the motion are manifold.  I refer to the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;, for example.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole got a commitment from a previous Leader of the House, Michael Lanigan.  When he asked if the commitment would be fulfilled, he was told it was not an absolute commitment so there are different kinds of commitments.  They are not all musical groups.  The motion is also grammatical nonsense in that it states &ldquo;that as many of these agreed changes can be achieved&rdquo;.  As many as what?  Is it as many as I want?  Is it as many as the Pope decides?  Is it as many as the Minister wants?  It does not make sense; it is not logical.  However, I understand what the Government is at.</P>
        <P>I agree with the idea of Seanad reform.  That is why I tabled a motion which the Government voted down in the first couple of weeks.  All the Members on the Government side trooped through the lobby to vote against exactly what it proposes tonight.  However, I detect a greater degree of seriousness in the tenor of this debate.  Something probably will happen but I hope it is not confined exclusively to the university seats, although I welcome the extension.  However, we ought to look at the way it is being extended.  I have suggested various ways to retain certain characteristics of the constituencies, but that will be up to the majority to decide.</P>
        <P>I issue one warning.  We should not make it a vast constituency of 250,000 or 500,000.  That will Americanise the process.  Only people with money and the incumbents will be able to go forward.  It would be fine for me; I have a high profile on radio and television.  If I am not being arrogant, I believe I would have a reasonably good chance of getting elected, but let us think of some young person with radical ideas.  How would he or she get elected and how would he or she finance the election?  If we are going to do that, we will have to provide a certain amount of finance.</P>
        <P>The university panel has encouraged people.  I would never have got elected but for it.  It is 30 years since I started to campaign to get into this <Col N="1781"/>House.  I never wanted to be a Member of the D&aacute;il.  I am one of the people who wanted to be a Member of this House.  There are such people in all parties but we are a minority.  Most people want to get into, or back into, the other House.  I was the one who coined the phrase about this House being the intensive care ward of the D&aacute;il.  I am unrepentant about that.  I have made submissions which Members should read if they are interested.</P>
        <P>I am make no apology for the university representation.  I do not agree with Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole on this.  There is no need for an apology.  It is not particularly elitist and if it is, what about it?  There is a lot to be said for elitism and for people who have certain qualities.  I salute the people who got university degrees; I think they are great.</P>
        <P>I am not taking any lessons in democracy from the parties.  I remember being in this House when people were dragooned in to vote for people for whom they were told to vote by their parties.  There are a number of people on both sides who remember that.  It happened in every party.  There was no democracy.</P>
        <P>In regard to this delegated university suffrage rubbish, Senator Camillus Glynn gave the lie to that when he spoke about the office in his constituency.  His constituency is not Mullingar; it is the administrative panel.  The way one gets proper representation is by enfranchising the people.  It is a laughing stock.  I remember the president of the Royal Irish Academy putting himself forward but he did not get a single vote.  Somebody else, whose blushes I will spare, topped the poll.  That tells one how representative and democratic it is.</P>
        <P>In regard to university representation as opposed to the other, I am not taking back anything I said about county councillors earlier today.  I saw the programme on Tuesday night.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0">I know there are very decent councillors such as Senator Hannigan, who is a former councillor.  However, many Members of this House were caught by the tribunals with their fingers in the jam.  This was because they were members of councils and this must be addressed and removed.  I remember being in this House when every single named officer of this House stood for election and was rejected by the people.  One of the most important of them stood for election to the D&aacute;il and was rejected by the people, stood for the European Parliament and was rejected by the people, stood for the Seanad and was rejected by the people and was then nominated and made a Member of the Seanad.  That is democracy.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I will be told I am being inflammatory but that is the situation.  If one is going to do something, one should not just target the university Senators where one gets bloody good value.  One may not always like it but one gets good value out of it.  One should look at the whole pic<Col N="1782"/>ture, enfranchise people and give voting rights to the ordinary members of the nominated bodies and then one will cover the whole country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the point made by the eminent Senator Norris, good and worthy people are not always popular people.  We have seen how the greatest people have stood for election and have not been elected at the early stages for one reason or another but have become probably the best parliamentarians we have had during that particular time in the country&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>When I entered the Seanad in 1982, it used to sit for about half a day a week.  It would then sit for only about seven months of the year.  We have come a long way and have achieved a great deal.  The greatest change I have seen in my time here has been the fact that almost 30% of legislation is initiated in this House.  It is a great tribute to the Taoiseach, the present Government and those of the past ten years that this has been the case.  The amount of good work that Senators have done in respect of legislation and the assistance they have provided to Ministers and their portfolios and Departments has been untold.  We have certainly have made an immeasurable positive contribution in this House.</P>
        <P>We must also say that over that period, there has been a huge amount of change in personnel here.  If we look back over 25 years, we can see that only two Senators from that year are serving in the House and two others have just passed the 25-year service mark.  If one looks at the new Seanad, one can see that it has 35 new Members and that 25 Members have not previously served in either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  It is not an old boys&rsquo; club and that lie should be put to rest.</P>
        <P>We must see the facts and use common sense.  The Seanad is a necessary second or upper house for the protection of the Constitution on behalf of the people on a mostly non-political basis.  The level of debate in this House deals with legislation and proposed amendments to legislation placed before us.  The serious and urgent matters that arise occasionally need the urgent attention and the expertise among Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann that may not be available in the D&aacute;il.  There are Members of the Seanad who would never get elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for one reason or another.  This has been handed down for generations and we have all seen the greatest examples of it.</P>
        <P>In respect of the job being done in the Seanad in respect of this review, all panels will be seriously reviewed.  However, if something is good, one should not break it.  Something that does not meet modern needs must be amended and adjusted.  There is a place for everyone to play.  I am fortunate to be one of those Senators elected to and represented on those five panels and am certainly very happy with the way they <Col N="1783"/>contribute to the House in a true vocational sense that was set up by the former Taoiseach and President, the late &Eacute;amon de Valera.</P>
        <P>Given the work done by the Leaders and the Chief and Deputy Whips of all parties and everyone assisting in the Seanad, as well as the number of hours they put in, the issue of remuneration must be examined.  There is no such thing as a part-time Senator; Senators are here for three and a half days.  In my job as Leader of the House, I spend four full days here.  Given the work done by the Government Whip, the small amount of money given to them borders on an insult.</P>
        <P>These are serious matters which the review must examine.  Given the calibre of the people who are asked to perform the duties of the Upper House, they must be seriously rewarded.  Nobody does nothing for nothing nowadays, so to speak.  I am saying this on behalf of other Members rather than on my own.  I fully support the proposal that the Chair be automatically returned.  The Chair must be impartial.  We have a good Chair who can attend functions, cannot pose for photographs in a political basis and must be totally independent.  The person who assumes this position is at a considerable disadvantage if he or she intends to stay in politics.  We want people of the highest calibre occupying the Chair and I fully support the proposal that the Chair be automatically returned, as is the case in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>As I said on the Order of Business today, I will ask the Clerk to present the Members of the Seanad who were not previously Members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad and the Members who had previously been Members of the D&aacute;il with the last two reviews on Seanad reform so they can read over them.  Senator Glynn made a valuable point that most Senators participating in the last review were selected Senators.  The elected Senators, especially the 43 elected by the panels, should be representative and represented.  I am not casting any aspersions on anyone as quite senior parliamentarians and very experienced people, both male and female from both sides, for whom I have the highest regard were on the group.  I certainly acknowledge the great service they have given Ireland in their terms in both Houses.  My former colleague, former Senator John Dardis, who was Deputy Leader of this House and with whom I worked so well down through the years, was a true gentleman of the highest standing.  I value their advice.  However, there was also a previous report so perhaps we will get the Clerk to give everyone two copies of those and we will have a look at them over Christmas.  Perhaps then we can continue this debate, which will not conclude this evening.  I know it is going to continue.</P>
        <P>The question of the Six Counties must be addressed because we have seen the new Ireland.  We must have representation from the Six Coun<Col N="1784"/>ties.  As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I assure its members and Members of this House that I know that it would be wonderful if the Six Counties were represented.  Four Senators represent Ulster but they are from Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  They represent these counties excellently but we must have representation from the Six Counties.  If there is an increase in the panels and it must go to a referendum, I know the people of Ireland will overwhelmingly give their approval so that this could take place.</P>
        <P>The Seanad &Eacute;ireann of the future must be a 32-county Upper House.  For that reason, we should have a review of the Seanad.  Many good suggestions have been made which will be examined by the most experienced Members of the House.  Everyone who is elected, irrespective of the panel he or she is elected to, is elected to bring change and enhance the legislative process in respect of bringing Bills forward and bringing everything before the House.  The contribution they have made has been immense and must be acknowledged.  I acknowledge it as Leader of the House.  We are now looking to the 21st century to see how we can enhance it.  Party politics have not been played to the same extent that they have at the present time.  I understand that this is a levelling-off period.  Young Members have entered the House who are enthusiastic and energetic.  By the very fact of entering this House, they believe things can be changed very quickly.  Coming from the world of private enterprise, the most significant change I came across was realising that getting things done can take a long time.  Once Members get over that teething problem, they will make an immeasurable contribution.  I look forward to Seanad reform.  I congratulate the Minister, a man who takes on the challenge with gusto, on his appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Buttimer. </P>
        <P>I welcomed the report on Seanad reform when it was published some years ago.  One of its main items was the suggestion that reforms ensure that &ldquo;the Seanad, or more realistically Seanad committees, would become vehicles for more widespread and effective public consultation&rdquo;.  There are a number of ways we can approach reform.  We can amend Standing Orders, a proposal for which is before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at present.  Many of the suggestions of the report can be covered under Standing Orders, such as allowing a former Taoiseach to attend the Seanad on a matter before the House or having MEPs speak in the House, which has already happened.  These are laudable reform suggestions.</P>
        <P>Another concerns scrutiny proposals for legislation under Community treaties, which the Joint <Col N="1785"/>Committee on European Scrutiny concludes is of significant and national importance.  They should be debated here.  Select committees can and should be formed to deal with the mid-term EU policy and consider the development of the European Union in the long term.  There is the suggestion that a sub-committee on social policy and social partnership be formed, to be reflective on instruments of social partnership such as the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance and the National Economic and Social Development Office reports.  These can be done under Standing Orders, constituting a major item of reform.</P>
        <P>Most people think of Seanad reform relating to the manner in which Senators are elected.  It is the item that grabs the headlines but it is a small part of it.  The vocational panel system has served the House well and should be retained, with some modifications.  Up to 20 people should be directly elected by the people, based on European Parliament constituencies or otherwise.  There should be a five year set term.  Perhaps holding the Seanad election on the same day as the general election would separate the powers of the Senate and the D&aacute;il.  I am sorry I agreed to share my time now because I could talk about this for a long time.  It is laudable that we are having this debate.  Anyone who thinks that Seanad reform refers to the method by which we are elected is losing the plot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>As one of the new Senators to whom the Leader referred, I deem it an immense honour to be elected to this House.  Seanad reform should not focus on how we are elected, as Senator Cummins pointed out.  I was elected by councillors on a panel including the Leader and Senator Cummins.  From meeting councillors I know they take their jobs seriously, despite the criticism heard today.  Some 99.9% of them, across all political parties, are decent, upright people who take their jobs seriously.</P>
        <P>I do not see the Upper House as the intensive care ward of the Lower House.  It is meaningful, there are 35 new Senators, new parties are represented and it represents the voice of the people.  Parties who organise voting pacts and observe how their party members vote devalue this House.  That should be stopped.  It is important to have an Upper House.  Reform of the electorate will not make the House more democratic.  Reform is always mentioned with regard to this House but the manner in which we carry out our business is far more important.  There should be Question Time in this House.  Senators should have the ability to table parliamentary questions.  We should be able to hold Ministers to account rather than having Adjournment debates or strategic motions.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s state<Col N="1786"/>ments in <i>The Irish Times</i> with regard to the university panels.  As a graduate of the Pontifical University of Maynooth I should have a vote in Seanad &Eacute;ireann because my degree is no different from those of Trinity College, DIT, UCD or UCC.</P>

	<P>It is the Pontifical University of Maynooth.</P>
        <P>Our party has been to the forefront in proposing reform of this House.  Let us have a meaningful debate but let us not home in on the fact that most of us are elected from vocational panels by councillors.  Like the Leader said, what is good should be retained and where there is a democratic deficit it should be changed.  There is no such thing as a part-time Senator.  I, like others here, work harder than some Members in the D&aacute;il.  We should get the recognition we deserve as a relevant House.  It behoves us to make it relevant.</P>
        <P>The media, which pays scant regard to this House, has a role to play in Seanad reform.  The coverage is paltry and is not good enough for the Upper House of the Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for not being here for some of the contributions but I heard them on the monitor.  I must leave for a meeting at 6.30 p.m. but I am glad the Seanad is debating this serious issue.  I thank Senators Dan Boyle and Deirdre de B&uacute;rca for moving the motion.</P>
        <P>Our national political institutions are at the heart of the State and it is vitally important that they remain effective and relevant in a changing world.  As such, reform of the Upper House deserves our attention and our dedicated efforts to bring about beneficial change, when warranted, to strengthen the legitimacy and efficacy of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government makes a clear and unambiguous commitment in that regard.  The programme states that the Government will determine the extent of cross-party agreement on the recommendations of the report on Seanad reform to advance proposals for implementation.  The commitment to seek to advance Seanad reform forms a part of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to Oireachtas reform.  The programme states that the Government will also reconsider the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Constitution regarding D&aacute;il reform, and will pursue the issue of reform of Oireachtas sitting times, Oireachtas procedures and strengthening the role of committees.</P>
        <P>In February 2003 the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges established the Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform.  The terms of ref<Col N="1787"/>erence of the sub-committee provided that it should review and make recommendations on the future composition and functions of the Seanad, particularly its electoral system and its role in the areas of legislation, parliamentary accountability, public policy and EU affairs.  It is notable that the sub-committee did not work in isolation.  The public&rsquo;s involvement was encouraged and 161 written submissions were received.  In addition, the sub-committee held four days of public hearings.  This demonstrates a considerable commitment on its part to engage as fully as possible with society.</P>
        <P>The Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform published its report in April 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I was obliged to rush back to obtain my copy of the script.  I hope further copies can be circulated to Members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report sets out a package of comprehensive recommendations for further consideration and action concerning the composition, functions and future role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Many of these recommendations are radical and far-reaching. The principal recommendations propose that membership of the Seanad be increased from 60 to 65; provision be made for the automatic re-election of the Cathaoirleach; 32 of the 65 senators to be directly elected &mdash; 26 of these seats would be filled from a single national constituency under a list-PR system and the other six by election from the reformed higher education constituency, with graduates from all higher education institutes in the State being eligible to register; 20 Senators to be indirectly elected by county and city councillors, Deputies and Senators under the PR-STV system; and 12 senators to be nominated by the Taoiseach.  Another of the recommendations is that the Seanad would be renewed on a rolling basis, with direct elections &mdash; including in the higher education constituency &mdash; taking place every five years on the same day as European and local elections and, similar to current practice, indirect elections to take place and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominations to be made, within 90 days after a Dail election.</P>
        <P>The recommendations also refer to widening the franchise for the higher education constituency in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The current restriction of the Seanad university seats to three elected by graduates of the National University of Ireland and three by Trinity graduates has been acknowledged by all parties as anomalous.  The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act (Election of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann by Institutions of Higher Education) 1979 permits the extension of <Col N="1788"/>the higher education franchise, in a manner to be provided by law, to other institutions of higher education in the State.  The 1979 amendment was originally introduced to facilitate the intended break-up of the NUI.  However, legislation was not introduced or enacted to give effect to the constitutional amendment because the break-up of the NUI did not subsequently occur.</P>
        <P>For the information of Senator Cummins, I understand there is a problem with the photocopier but that copies of my script are being made and will be circulated shortly.  I apologise for the delay.</P>

	<P>The approach of the sub-committee to re-evaluating the role of the Seanad, advocating and embracing reform and developing new roles for this House, while maintaining its integral character and status as part of our modern democracy, is to be commended.  The 2004 report was not the first effort made to address the reform of the Seanad.  A total of 11 separate reports on the reform of the Seanad have been published.  These principally focused on its composition and electoral system.  The first report was published in the aftermath of the Seanad election in 1928 and, aside from the 2004 report, the most recent reports were published in 1997 and 2002 by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the conclusions and recommendations of the 2002 and 2004 reports differ in many respects.  For example, the seventh progress report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, published in 2002, recommended the direct election of 48 senators and the abolition of all university seats.  However, despite the differing approaches recommended by the various reports on its reform, the Seanad is widely considered to face several principal challenges.  The 2004 report states that the Seanad&rsquo;s distinctive role is unclear and that the system of election to the House diminishes the public legitimacy of senators.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of university representation in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Current arrangements exclude the graduates of the vast majority of third level institutions, despite the fact that a constitutional amendment was passed in 1979 to broaden the scope of the franchise beyond Trinity College Dublin and the National University of Ireland to other institutions of higher education in the State.  Aside from the disparity between graduates who are entitled to vote and those who are not, the system has been criticised because it confers a basic democratic right to certain people and denies it to others solely on the basis of educational achievement.  Given the constitutional opening, however, I am of the opinion that <Col N="1789"/>reform should focus initially on widening the third level franchise.  That is a matter I am anxious to progress.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Taoiseach, an informal all-party parliamentary group on Seanad reform was established in 2005 and was chaired by my predecessor.  The group&rsquo;s role was to assess the extent of cross-party agreement on the sub-committee&rsquo;s recommendations and to advance, with consensus, proposals for the implementation of Seanad reform.  The group addressed proposals which attracted early consensus and which are capable of implementation in the short to medium term.  The group met on four occasions between October 2005 and November 2006, having adopted a pragmatic work plan with a view to initially progressing the recommended Standing Orders changes that could be implemented in the short term.</P>
        <P>Prior to the general election, having consulted with the relevant Oireachtas committees and Government Departments, the group referred a number of draft Standing Orders changes, to be piloted as sessional orders, to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The draft sessional orders relate to  the attendance of former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute;; assessing legislative and other proposals going before EU Councils; reviewing particular draft EU legislation of major national importance; developing a medium-term policy framework for EU affairs to address challenges andopportunities facing Ireland in the next ten years; and public policy review in respect of medium-term economic and social planning and social partnership.  I understand the Seanad CPP is currently considering the draft sessional orders.</P>
        <P>The all-party group also examined the higher education constituency reform proposals of the 2004 report but consensus did not emerge.  Clearly, the question of Seanad reform is a core element of the wider debate on democracy and the political process.  The 2004 report acknowledged that it has considerable political implications and that difficult decisions, involving sensitive political matters, will have to be taken.  However, it is argued in the report that if progress is to be made, there is an urgent need to accept the political reality that Seanad &Eacute;ireann must be reformed if it is to make a viable and distinctive contribution to the economic, social and political affairs of our country.</P>
        <P>The election of the 24th Seanad is not due for five years.  I intend to ensure that the intervening period is used to address reform, particularly the issue of the Seanad higher education constituency.  I am anxious to see Seanad reform &mdash; based on an all-party, consensus approach &mdash; advanced.  The reform of our institutions of national governance deserves and requires non-partisan, inclusive methods.  I intend to establish and chair an all-party group in the near future which, I hope, will have sufficient weight to deliver con<Col N="1790"/>sensus and which will reflect the fact that the Seanad does not operate in isolation from the Lower House.  I will be writing to the party leaders soon, requesting their nominations in respect of that group.  However, consensus cannot be allowed to become paralysis.  If I cannot obtain agreement, I will be obliged to proceed in respect of extending the third level franchise.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to state that the Government welcomes all contributions from across the House.  Senators may rest assured that their views are key to the future of the reform process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased my name is appended to the amendment to the motion.  I fully support calls for reform.  The amendment goes further than the motion by calling for the publication of a timescale in respect of the implementation of the recommendations of the 2004 report.  The Minister provided a concise summary of those recommendations.  They received all-party support and members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Independent Members signed up to the amendment calling for a timescale to be published.  We have consensus and we could proceed to implement the report on a comprehensive basis.</P>
        <P>My concern following the Minister&rsquo;s speech is that he suggested he will move forward only on one element of reform if all-party agreement is not forthcoming.  This would be a shame.  The entire spirit and tenor of the report is that wholesale reform of the Seanad is required.  If one examines the report, one sees it states a radical alternative to the vocational panel system is required as well as a radical alternative to the university panels which clearly require reform and I accept this.</P>
        <P>I am sorry Senator Buttimer was not able to vote as a graduate of Maynooth.  Persons who graduate from both NUI and Trinity have two votes and if such a person is a councillor or a Deputy he or she would have three votes.  This is not democratic and, admirably, the report recommends that people choose which aspect of the Seanad election to vote in, for the higher education panel or for the 20 members to be elected by Deputies, councillors or Senators or for the national constituency.  This gives choice and ensures no one has more than one vote.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced about increasing the number of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  This would have the effect of neutering the Seanad.  The report points out the perception of the Seanad as being weak, ineffective and of questionable value is compounded by the fact that it is dominated by <Col N="1791"/>the Government.  I do not see why the Taoiseach&rsquo;s right to nominate should be present, bringing with it an in-built Government majority.  I appreciate the report correctly recommends that if the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nomination power is to be retained it should be placed within certain legislative parameters as to the criteria to be used in selecting the people to be nominated and include representatives from Northern Ireland and under-represented groups in Irish society.</P>
        <P>On balance, I favour the recommendations in the report.  However, I hope they will be implemented together and that not only the changes which can be made through legislation, namely, changes to the university panels, will be made but also the changes requiring constitutional change.  Given that this report of 2004 is the 12th report we have had and it represents cross-party consensus we could see a timeframe put in place which would see us having a constitutional referendum, perhaps at the same time next year as the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for sharing her time.  I support the amendment and I was not sure whether I would do so until I came to the Chamber and listened to what was being discussed.  My objective, and the objective of many of us, is to ensure the Seanad becomes a creative and viable force in the political process.  I fear this is not likely to happen.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister state he was anxious to progress.  I know he has been in office only a short time but phrases such as &ldquo;anxious to progress&rdquo; and the suggestions he made indicate a danger that a talking shop will continue for a long period.</P>
        <P>We need reform.  However, I am not sure the public recognises this in the same way we do because I do not believe they regard us highly.  Those of us here know the amount of work done and what we have achieved.  A great deal can be stated in favour of a bicameral system.  Recently, I was written to by a professor in New Zealand who is writing a report on bicameral systems throughout the world.  He asked for details on the Irish system because he was anxious to learn about it.</P>
        <P>When speaking about Seanad reform we tend to speak about the electoral system.  While we need to reform the electoral system, we can do a great deal apart from this.  This debate is similar to the one we had on 27 April 2004.  Reading the speech I made on that occasion, I realise I could almost make the same one today.</P>
        <P>Previously in this House, I made the point that what upsets me about our system and why I believe we lose credibility among the public is the use of lobbyists who come in behind the scenes.  I would love to see this House used for open and transparent lobbying with no other lobbying <Col N="1792"/>allowed.  Anybody who wishes to influence a Minister or a civil servant would do it in the full and open transparency of this House.  If this system worked it would be a major improvement on the recognition for the political system and process we have.</P>
        <P>Another change that could be made is the introduction of question time.  When the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, accepted questions last week it was a healthy method of using this House.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Leader for organising it.</P>
        <P>I am on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and I believe we need to do far more work with regard to the scrutiny of European legislation.  If we do not do so in committees we could use the Seanad to do so.  When I spoke in April 2004, I mentioned the need for changing the Constitution and I know there is great difficulty in doing so.  We change it only for the electoral system.  If we are going to change it again for the university electoral system we must to consider how seriously we can do so.</P>
        <P>All, including those of us fortunate enough to have been elected by NUI and Trinity, recognise the unfairness of the system.  I apologise to Senator Buttimer.  When he stated he was a graduate of Maynooth, I assumed he had a vote.  I recognise not only this college but other third-level colleges do not have a vote.  It would be useful for them to have a vote.  Having this system of election is of major benefit and extending it to nine seats, which has been suggested, would also be extremely useful.</P>
        <P>I do not agree entirely with Senator Bacik with regard to the 11 nominations of the Taoiseach.  One of the benefits of this is that it makes the House less confrontational because the Government usually has a majority.  I have great difficulty with the five vocational panels being party political.  It is beneficial to have independent seats.  During the period from December 1994 to the change of Government in 1997 when the Taoiseach nominees from the previous Government remained, the joy of being one of the five Independent Senators with the balance of power made it well worthwhile.  We had more forceful and capable debates.  Let us hope something similar happens again.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to the debate and a consensus is apparent.  This is a political Chamber.  It is subordinate to the D&aacute;il <Col N="1793"/>and is dissolved when the D&aacute;il is dissolved and because it is a political Chamber we must consider our electorate.</P>
        <P>The Seanad is composed of five panels which have a range of nominating bodies.  I am concerned about the number of nominating bodies coming out of the woodwork today.  My nominating body is relevant to the issues which arise in society and which are discussed in this House and I speak for it when I can.  We could examine nominating bodies.</P>
        <P>Local authority members guard their right absolutely to select Senators and rightly so.  It should remain like this for the simple reason that they have been elected themselves.  Local authority members are professional people who know the electorate and who will not be told who they should elect.  They are good at assessing every candidate.  My first election to this Chamber was in 1993.  I had to get to know my electorate and that was how I was elected.  That is the only way any of us should be elected to this House.  I do not want this Chamber to become a mere stepping stone to the Lower House nor do I want it to be a retirement home for those who have nowhere else to go.  I am a professional Senator and I have a significant role to play here.</P>
        <P>We have addressed many issues, such as the undocumented Irish in the United States, our overseas aid programme and EU legislation.  There was public outcry in regard to EU directives on public service and agriculture but the public felt these issues were not being aired.  I blame the media for that because after we debated the issues here, I looked for coverage in the newspapers and on television and radio but failed to find a single line.  The media rather than Senators are at fault because we make good contributions and scrutinise and initiate legislation.  That is how I would like reform to be introduced.</P>
        <P>I am totally opposed to the proposals on direct elections which would be held alongside local and European elections.  The public would be confused if any further elections were held on the same day.  I also oppose the list system and I will not have my or any other party making a list of who should be elected.  That is not democracy to me.  Local county councillors will not be told by the hierarchy of any party who they should elect.  I have problems with many of the recommendations before us.</P>
        <P>We have opportunities for internal reform.  Senator Cummins referred to reform on the Order of Business.  I find it distasteful that the Order of Business is like a classroom in which we have to raise our hands for attention.  Such a system is not professional for Senators and it should be changed.  I would like to see reform in that regard.  There is room in this House for continuity among professional Senators who are really interested in whatever comes before them.  We should explore how we can enhance the role of <Col N="1794"/>the Seanad rather than use it as an opportunity to jump to the other House.  I consider the people who do that as opportunists who are not fulfilling their role properly.  One is either a professional Senator or going somewhere else.  I do not want to be regarded as passing through or at a retirement stage of my life because that is not the way I conduct my business.  This Chamber is being spoiled because too many people are in transition rather than concentrating on the proper role of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the views of many of the previous speakers with regard to the value of the Seanad.  In many cases, the role played by the Seanad is not fully recognised.  Between the 1980s and the present, the Seanad addressed issues such as the pro-life and anti-divorce campaigns and stem cell research in a coherent manner, to the benefit of the overall debates.</P>
        <P>The most practical proposal is to retain a system that works.  Some reforms may be required but the system of five vocational panels, university seats and Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, which was voted into being in 1937 by almost 1.2 million people and enacted in 1938, should be retained in full.  Parts of the system may need to be tweaked, which implies small changes.  These changes may include the number of nominating bodies and university seats.  The number of Seanad seats should, however, increase by a minimum of 15, and possibly 20, to reflect the expansion of the D&aacute;il from 122 seats in the 1920s to the present 166.</P>
        <P>I am amazed at how certain proposals can be taken seriously, such as the indirect election of 20 Senators and the election of 26 through a national constituency.  If Senators are elected by a national constituency, they would not readily accept the constraints preventing them from dealing with financial resolutions or amendments that could frustrate legislation.  Most bizarre of all is the proposal that Seanad elections should take place at the same time as local elections.  At a practical level, how could the 20 potential Senators from my panel alone meet each individual councillor?  Some 100 people will be trying to meet a councillor who is standing for election and does not want to meet any Senators.  I do not know how that proposal was made.</P>
        <P>The system as it stands is not broken, although it may need to be tweaked.  We need to increase our numbers but retain the basic principles of university seats, Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees and vocational panels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be speaking about the issue of reform so early in the life of the current Seanad.  All too often, members of the public have questioned me about the relevance and legitimacy of this House.  I am glad the Green Party has put forward this motion and would like to see cross-party support on the issue.  Some may argue that a certain section of society would not be well served by Seanad reform.  To be more specific, Senators would argue it is like turkeys voting for Christmas.  I disagree with that, however, because reform is in our interest.  It will add legitimacy to the House and, as a result, increase its prestige and standing.</P>
        <P>I would like to see change in the composition of the Seanad and the type of work it carries out.  The 2004 reforms proposed 65 seats in the Seanad which would be elected by councillors, Deputies and Senators, as well as six from the university panels.  While I am aware of the incomparable contributions made by Senators elected from the university panels, their system of election is archaic.  We need to consider the complete removal of university panels because it is not fair to give somebody a vote purely on the basis that he or she had the benefit of a university education.  It is unjust, undemocratic and elitist.  A previous speaker asked what is wrong with elitism.  Not long ago, people in this country fought for the right to share the franchise with women and those who did not own property.  Elitism goes against the principle of equality and for that reason we need to scrap the system of election based on education.  I want those seats to be added to a national list system.</P>
        <P>Reform is also needed on the system of indirect election by councillors.  I am aware the current proposals call for the number of seats thus elected to be reduced from 43 to 20 but I would like to reduce the number to ten.  I recognise that some Senators and councillors will face difficulties in such a system, so we should consider the experience of the UK House of Lords and introduce reform on a gradual basis.  After implementing the present proposals, we could wait then five years before considering a further reduction in the number of seats elected by councillors and Deputies.  That should be built into the legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the work undertaken in the House, we should spend more time dealing with European issues and, as recommended in the report, organisations should come before the House to present their annual reports and take questions from Senators.  These steps would foster greater interest in the work of the House among members of the public.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate and compliment the Green Party on tabling the motion.  I will, however, support the amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party as the report on Seanad reform must be implemented sooner rather than later. <Col N="1796"/> Failing this, I will press my party to introduce a Private Members&rsquo; Bill during the term of this Seanad.</P>

Is cinnte gur d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht f&iacute;or-t&aacute;bhachtach, at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh blianta, at&aacute; ann.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn ruda&iacute; a lean&uacute;int suas agus a chuir i gcr&iacute;ch i ndiadh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in was not part of the sub-committee which examined Seanad reform because the party was not represented in the previous Seanad when the report on Seanad reform was formulated.  Reform is necessary.  Although the proposals in the report do not go far enough, any reform of the Seanad, however small, must be welcomed because it is a fundamentally undemocratic, elitist forum.  Sinn F&eacute;in advocates the establishment of a reformed, democratic, transparent, accountable and relevant second House of Parliament.  The Seanad should afford a role for civic society and provide for fuller representation from all sections of society in the legislative process.</P>
        <P>A second House could be constituted so as to represent those not adequately represented in the D&aacute;il.  It is beneficial for the democratic nature of government to have a second House of Parliament which provides a system of checks and balances on Government legislation and policy.</P>
        <P>All Members of the Seanad should be elected by the citizens of the 32 counties, those who have been resident on the island for five years or more and all those aged over 16 years.  I am disappointed the Minister does not intend to include these proposals in his reforms.  Under the Sinn F&eacute;in proposals, which the party submitted as part of the process of drawing up a report on Seanad reform, pending the reunification of the country, those citizens of Ireland who are resident in the Six Counties would be able to cast their ballots by postal vote and Northern representation, a commitment across all parties in the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, could be realised in the House.  I agree with the Leader that the House could become a 32 county forum in the Irish Parliament.  Are we serious about bringing about this objective?  Does every party subscribe to it?  If so, the House has an option to allow citizens across the 32 counties to vote in elections to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Irish emigrants in London, Birmingham, Scotland, America and elsewhere in the world should be allowed to cast their votes by registering with the relevant Irish embassy.  During the recent general election in Poland, candidates for the Polish Parliament travelled to Ireland to canvass members of the Polish diaspora here.  Emigrants should be represented in the Seanad.</P><Col N="1797"/>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in favours having six vocational panels, including a community and voluntary panel, through which Senators would be elected.  To tackle the under-representation of women, a gender quota of at least 30% should be applied in each panel.</P>
        <P>These proposals address the mechanism by which Senators would be elected to the House.  We must also deal with the functions of the House.  Scrutiny should be its main role with Senators scrutinising draft domestic legislation and furnishing reports to the D&aacute;il, including specific recommendations for amendment, withdrawal, further consultation, impact assessment and fast-tracking of progress.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes significant changes to the current legislative Stages.  Prior to consideration by the D&aacute;il, all proposed legislation would first pass scrutiny by the Seanad, in a process to be known as Second Stage.  A new stage would include a community consultation process.</P>
        <P>We cannot tinker at the edges of Seanad reform, as the Government proposes to do.  The report on Seanad reform does not go far enough.  One of the most undemocratic aspects of the election of Senators is the privilege afforded to the Taoiseach to nominate 11 Senators.  This is a ridiculous mechanism which would be described as a form of dictatorship in any other country.  To propose to increase the number of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees to 12 and allow the majority of Senators &mdash; 33 of the proposed 65 Members &mdash; to be political appointees does not make sense.  We should not be afraid of allowing people across the 32 counties to speak.  Let them decide who is best to represent them in the Upper House.</P>

	<P>The most recent report on Seanad reform, which forms part of the motion before the House, was not agreed on an all-party basis and there were many dissenting voices in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on a range of its proposals.  I propose first to respond to some of the comments made on the proposals regarding the university Members.  Before entering the Seanad I considered it somewhat discriminatory to allow two universities elect six Senators.  To be fair, however, since becoming a Senator, I have found that the university Members make a valuable contribution to the House.  While I disagree with them on many occasions on a range of topics, they bring a dimension to the House which would be missed were they to cease being Members.  </P>

	<P>Having said that, the franchise should be extended to include all third level institutions.  I do not concur with those who argue for the abolition of the electoral mandate for graduates of third level institutions.  </P>
        <P>There is a notion that we should adopt a list system because this model is used elsewhere and <Col N="1798"/>is more democratic.  Nobody stops to ask who would draw up the list, how it would be drawn up and what criteria would be applied.  I have no doubts about how this would be done and will oppose any move towards the creation of a list system for Seanad elections.  The current system may have some defects but, as Senator Alex White noted, Senators have a mandate.  While Senator Norris may argue that a Senator may be elected with just 50, 60 or 70 votes, each of these votes probably represents 1,000 electors.  Those who elect councillors at local government level give them a mandate to take decisions on their behalf.  Many of these decisions impact directly on the people councillors represent.  There is nothing anomalous about the fact that they also exercise this mandate to elect Members of the Upper House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>It may be necessary to extend the franchise to all councillors as only a little over half of councillors at county and city council level currently have a right to vote.  It may also be necessary to change the vocational panels.  While they probably had a purpose in 1937 when the Seanad was established, their resonance is missing today and they are no longer the best method of electing Senators.  We could adopt regionalisation, an approach frequently suggested during election campaigns when one travels the country.  While certain reforms may be necessary, fundamentally there is nothing flawed about indirectly electing Members to the House through local representatives.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty referred to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  I do not know how one could abolish this system while ensuring a working majority for Government in the House.  This is a practical difficulty which those who served in the rainbow coalition from 1994 to 1997 experienced when they introduced legislation.  As somebody who lobbied on particular issues in the marine area from the outside during that period, I recall engaging the Independent Senators with a view to thwarting the measures the then Government was endeavouring to introduce.  I see some sense in looking at a better or more effective method of doing it, if there is one, but I cannot think of anything better.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I feel particularly strongly about Northern Ireland representation.  The House can play a pivotal role by having among its Members all shades of political opinion on this island.  We should have a minimum of ten Members from Northern Ireland.  I have discussed this with Unionists and people interested in the development of politics on this island who have a role to play.  They have said that without a minimum number it would be too difficult for them to take part, as they are so easily isolated within their communities and parties.  This should not be done by nomination, but by election and our current system would be one way to do it.  We should work through the various <Col N="1799"/>conduits we have with politicians of all shades in the North to try and bring this about.  This would be a major step in rationalising political thinking on the island.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and particularly for the tone and tenor of the debate which demonstrates that membership of the House is consistent with the belief we exist to serve.  How we do so depends on the quality of this House and its structures.</P>
        <P>I cannot accept the amendment put forward by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators as it is too descriptive.  I ask those who moved the amendment to consider the Minister&rsquo;s speech, in which he gave a clear commitment that an all-party committee will be established immediately.  The first task of that committee will be to determine in a short timespan that all-party agreement still exists on the basis of the last report.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the final comments of Senator Walsh, that some Senators, who were Members of the last Seanad also, do not agree with the recommendations.  We are not talking about unanimity or the views of individual Senators.  We are talking about how all political parties and Independent Members can come to a consensus.  As I said earlier, this is not how I would propose the Seanad to be.  I would like to see a publicly elected Seanad.  However, I recognise that the Seanad is the way it is for a reason.  Any changes we bring to it should bring the best of what exists currently with it into the future.</P>
        <P>We should not kid ourselves.  There is a  list system in our current arrangements for electing Senators.  It is called the inner panel and it is determined solely in the backrooms of party offices.</P>

	<P>I withdraw that.  The basis of what I said is that the existence of a place on the list is determined by a small number of people, which is an even greater diminution of the electoral process.  We should examine this.</P>
        <P>It is important, in order to get greater public acceptance of the important work we do as Senators, that we get a degree of public involvement in the selection of Members of this House.  This was the most important recommendation of the last report.  The degree to which we can agree that and the extent to which we can bring in the necessary proposals for constitutional change will determine how successful the 23rd Seanad is in ensuring we have a vibrant Seanad in the future.</P>
        <P>I am glad there is consensus the legislative changes should be made with regard to the universities will be made in the short term.  The committee to be established by the Minister will have as part of its brief a reason not only to advance that legislation, but to ensure that in the course of this Seanad we make proposals for constitutional change.  Otherwise, any bringing forward of particular legislation would be unfair to the spirit of the existing and all preceding reports.  Either we believe in change that is consensual and wide-ranging, or we will continue without any change at all.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Leader&rsquo;s call to return to this issue.  I am glad I and my colleague, Deputy D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, have had the opportunity to use Private Members&rsquo; time to raise this important issue of discussion early in the life of this Seanad.  The promise of a full day&rsquo;s debate in February on the wider issues, following the formation of the committee and, hopefully, after it has made an early assessment of its work, will give the House another opportunity to deal with how it can advance the agenda for change.  I thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for facilitating me in my desire to speak first in the debate.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, for attending and the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to deal with the matter.  While some will deliberately misinterpret my raising of this important issue to suggest I am a killjoy, I hope Members will listen carefully to what I have to say.</P>
        <P>We are continually aware from reports of Irish people&rsquo;s abuse rather than use of alcohol.  We are continually warned of the rise in levels of obesity.  We are continually encouraged as communities to move more and more towards healthier living and to engage in exercise beyond the raising of a glass.  We hope that our children in the schools do the same and that our new generations are not exposed to the obesity levels predicted for them.</P>
        <P>I combine these thoughts and point out that as a person who, like many males and females, enjoys participating in the very popular sport or fad of dieting, there is a current lapse in the provision of vital information, a deficit which must be addressed.  I refer to the move to labelling in the food world.  There is increasing use of labelling with regard to salt, protein, carbohydrates, saturated and unsaturated fat, sugar levels and so forth, as well as allergy warnings for the presence of, for example, nuts, and quality assurance and country of origin labelling.  Most notably, there is a labelling of calorie content per 100 grammes and by packet content &mdash; this is often left at an index figure but is sometimes converted into a weight watchers points tally.</P><Col N="1802"/>
        <P>Whether one is on a diet, the information given is of interest and relevance to many.  It gives people the right to choose one tin of tuna over another.  As people become more aware of the fact one tin of beans may well have twice the calorie content of another brand, they will soon make the consumer choice to suit their new knowledge base.  Of course, if the lower calorie product is not tasty, the product will not ultimately succeed or at least the diet will change course.</P>
        <P>What I have said thus far could not be considered in any way controversial or an over-the-top requirement.  Much discussion is ongoing in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about food labelling.  Therefore, I ask why the same level of interest is not generated in what we drink.  The issue of where a product came from, what it contains and how strong it is may be addressed on the labels of many products but how many of us are aware of the calorie content of the full or quarter bottle of red or white wine we are consuming?  Is it not strange we know how many calories are in a 330 ml can of Diet Coke, a 500 ml bottle of Diet Club Orange or in 100 ml of a diluted soft drink?  This is easily broken down to give us a sense of how good we are being when we indulge, although on another day we should consider how healthy are E-numbers and sugar replacements.</P>
        <P>It is no accident this calorie information is not readily available on alcohol products.  At least one company supplying the &ldquo;light&rdquo; version of its product has put the calorie content per 100 ml on bottles and cans &mdash; they are not light on alcohol but light on calories.  Some of the other &ldquo;light&rdquo; alcohol drinks are light on alcohol content but omit the calorie information.  In either case, the information is not complete and, while I might assume what may be termed the &ldquo;light&rdquo; aspect is either calorie or alcohol content, I may not necessarily be correct, particularly if the information is not provided.</P>
        <P>My basic point is simple.  I am a consumer.  I want the choice of purchasing a product on an informed basis.  If I am watching my weight, why can I be facilitated by the food industry but not the drinks industry?  This is a market to be tapped, and it may challenge some producers to produce a lighter product.  That research and <Col N="1803"/>development aspect would provide a new career opportunity for some.  It would challenge them to produce a product that people still wanted to drink when compared to the original product.  However, it may also let those who realise they have consumed a bottle of wine, six pints, six alcopops or half a bottle of vodka or gin on a night&rsquo;s socialising know a little more as to why their latest food-fad diet is not working and educate them into exercising more choice.</P>
        <P>I speak as one who wants to see the alternatives develop, whether this is in the form of high or low alcohol content.  Variety would definitely be a great aspiration but to have the truth of the content of recurrent products made visible to consumers would be an important start.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I take the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the current position in regard to the labelling of alcohol products in Ireland.  Labelling is one of the key elements of food and drink safety.  It provides the consumer with the information necessary to make healthy choices regarding consumption.  In this regard, alcohol labelling is of paramount importance.</P>
        <P>The dangers of excessive alcohol consumption are well-documented.  For example, earlier this year a report entitled &ldquo;The Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital Study of Alcohol, Smoking and Illicit Drug Use 1988-2005&rdquo; was launched.  The results of this study in regard to alcohol consumption among pregnant mothers were a huge concern given the growing evidence and research into the link between alcohol and foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  The particular pattern and prevalence of binge drinking among the female population of child-bearing age in Ireland significantly increased the likelihood of harm being caused to a developing foetus.</P>
        <P>Legislation on food and drink labelling is developed within the European Union regulatory framework.  Directive 2000/13/EC, as amended.  It provides the legislative framework for the information that must be indicated on the labelling of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer.  The scope of the directive encompasses all foodstuffs, which includes alcoholic beverages.  Its aim is to ensure that the consumer gets all the essential information as regards the composition of the product, the manufacturer, methods of storage, preparation and so on.  Producers and manufacturers are free to provide whatever additional information they wish, provided it is accurate and does not mislead the consumer.</P><Col N="1804"/>
        <P>With regard to alcoholic beverages, allergens must be labelled as well as alcoholic strength for beverages with alcohol content greater than 1.2% by volume.  Currently, the listing of ingredients is not required for alcoholic beverages.  However, the legislation states the intention to bring forward rules for the labelling of the ingredients of alcoholic beverages.  Thus, the derogation from the requirement to list ingredients is a temporary one.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is currently reviewing labelling legislation in order to recast and modernise its provisions.  The labelling of alcoholic beverages will of course be considered in the context of this review.  The objective will be to address the lack of obligation upon the producer to label the ingredients of alcohol.  The Commission has also indicated that the review will explore the feasibility and viability of using warning labels on the containers of alcoholic beverages to raise awareness on the harmful effect of alcohol on health.</P>
        <P>In February 2006 member states were invited to make submissions on an EU consultative document entitled &ldquo;Labelling, Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation for the EU&rdquo;.  As part of the consultation process, member states were asked to consider whether health warnings on alcoholic beverages could be an effective means to inform consumers about risks associated with inappropriate consumption of alcohol.  At the request of the Department of Health and Children, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland undertook a public consultation exercise.  The observations received assisted in developing the Irish response to the questions raised.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was also consulted, as it is responsible at national level for some directives relating to foodstuffs.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children responded to the Commission consultation, suggesting, <i>inter alia</i>, that the script on labels on alcohol products should be of sufficient size to allow for general readability and be clear so that the reference to light products would distinguish between light in calories and light in alcohol; labels should list ingredients and display calorie content; and an indication of origin should be compulsory on all spirits.  The response also noted that the strategic task force on alcohol in 2004 recommended that a health warning label be placed on all alcohol products and alcohol promotional materials.  It was suggested that the concept of health warnings on alcoholic beverages be further developed following the publication of the EU alcohol strategy in 2006.</P>
        <P>It is expected the Commission will issue a draft labelling regulation in December of this year.  Member states will then be given an opportunity to debate this document at length.  The Department of Health and Children is committed to <Col N="1805"/>robustly advocating the benefits of the points raised in our submission.  We would expect that the developments which I have outlined to the House will ensure a comprehensive approach to food and beverage labelling will be achieved.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I ask the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the situation regarding the playing field beside the church which was previously used by Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in in Rathcoole, County Dublin.  It cannot be utilised currently owing to the state in which it has been left following upgrade works to the N7.  Furthermore, I ask the Minister to confirm whether her Department owns this field and, if so, whether she has any intention of selling it for development, and what, as far as the Department is aware, is the current status of this field and its ownership.  I am concerned by the way the school and its community have been left with a cloud of confusion and uncertainty with regard to the future of the playing field and school facility.</P>
        <P>The matter seems quite simple at first.  There is a field located near the school, which is used by the school for student recreation.  The field then became inaccessible owing to the need to upgrade the N7.  However, the school&rsquo;s board of management was left in no doubt by the council that the field would be restored to its original state following the conclusion of the upgrade works.  Yet, at this stage, the school has been unable to use the playing field for over four years.  Its management has been left in a situation where it has had to pursue endlessly the council and the Department of Education and Science on this matter.  The people concerned are stressed and concerned about the impact on the school and the children.  I ask the Minister to intervene and clarify the matter.  Put simply, without access to this area, the school must continue to incur significant costs, both financial and timewise, in trying to arrange for students to be transported to other facilities.</P>
        <P>The situation could also affect the number of children the school can enrol in future owing to the limited recreation space without the use of this field.  I ask the Minister to clarify the ownership of this area.  If the Department owns it, is it in a position to give an undertaking that it will not be sold for development and will be available to Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in in future?  The school has been a wonderful educational amenity to the community of Rathcoole.  The Department should support its endeavours to provide comprehensive and holistic educational facilities, including the use of this playing field once more.  This simple matter is of great concern to the school in question and its board of management.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1806"/>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the playing fields at Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in.  In 2003, the Department agreed to dispose of a small portion of its lands at Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in to facilitate the upgrading of the N7 and to provide alternative access from Main Street, Rathcoole.  This small portion of land formed part of the school&rsquo;s playing field.  The agreement was subject to a number of conditions, including the making good and reseeding of the playing field on completion of the works.</P>
        <P>While the improved access has now been provided, the Department was notified by a representative of the school management that some works still remain outstanding, specifically relating to the reinstatement of the playing field.  The Department subsequently raised the matter with South Dublin County Council, which has advised that the only outstanding works at present relate to landscaping of the green space that was affected by the provision of the access road.  The Department is further advised that a landscaping contractor recently commenced works to cut back growth on the site and that the area will be top soiled and reseeded.</P>
        <P>As Senator Fitzgerald will appreciate, the school management is better placed to monitor progress of the works and to ensure their completion.  The Department will shortly be contacting the school management in this regard.  I can confirm that the school site, including the playing field, is in State ownership and that there are no proposals at the present time to sell any of the lands in question.  Once the grounds are reinstated the field can be used by the school for recreational purposes.  I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter and allowing me to clarify the Department&rsquo;s position relating to these lands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State can provide us with a timeframe for the completion of a permanent school building for Holy Trinity national school in Leopardstown.  This is a new school that serves the Leopardstown-Ballyogan area.  It was established under the auspices of the Stepaside area action plan to serve one third of this rapidly developing area.  The school, now in its third year, is a vital part of our community and is essential to the community&rsquo;s future development, cohesion and sustainability.  It currently has classroom facilities for junior infants, senior infants and first class pupils who are in temporary accommodation.</P>
        <P>In January 2006, the school was given a commitment for a permanent building.  It was indicated that this project would be fast-tracked and <Col N="1807"/>the timeframe for completion was 12 to 18 months.  Some 21 months later, however, a number of delays have been experienced.  The architect&rsquo;s stage 1 and 2 plans were submitted in June 2007 and it appeared initially that they were fine, but no feedback was forthcoming.  About three weeks ago, there were indications that the chief architect had examined the plans and it appeared that some issues had to be resolved.  It has not yet been possible to identify what those issues are.  Anxiety is growing because we are now nearing the time for enrolment for the next school year.  We do not know, however, if the necessary accommodation will be available to allow for such future enrolment.  It would be a pity if the accommodation is not made available because the school has got off to a tremendous start and there is great motivation within the community to keep it going.  I would appreciate an update on the situation together with a timeframe as to when the permanent school building can be completed.</P>

	<P>I wish to thank Senator Corrigan for giving me the opportunity of outlining, on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf, the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of a Holy Trinity national school at Sandyford, Dublin 18.  It is proposed to <Col N="1808"/>build a new 24-classroom school on a 2.5 acre site.  The project is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.  The stage 2 submission, sketch scheme, is currently under review in the Department.  The school&rsquo;s board of management will be kept advised of developments when this examination is complete.  Under the national development plan, a sum of &euro;4.5 billion is assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  Over &euro;540 million will be spent on school buildings this year.  The level of construction alone in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2007 is such that it will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for around 17,500 pupils.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme, in which the main focus is to deliver school places within rapidly developing areas.  The progression of Holy Trinity national school, as with all large-scale projects, will be considered in this context.  The Minister for Education and Science is committed to providing suitable, high-quality accommodation for the school at the earliest possible date.</P>
